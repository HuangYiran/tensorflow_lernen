9
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,570
上溯至宇宙初始  周遭还只是一片漆黑
In the beginning, there was darkness.

10
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,420
不知何时  忽地一声巨响
And then-- Bang!

11
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,500
时间空间以及物质皆由此发端
Giving birth to an endless expanding existence

12
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,310
此后不断膨胀  延伸  永无止境
of time, space, and matter.

13
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,060
每一天  新的发现都在不断为我们解开 
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

14
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,100
蕴藏于这里的那些神秘莫测 
the mysterious, the mind-blowing,

15
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,810
令人大开眼界  致命的秘密 
the deadly secrets of

16
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,930
我们称这个地方为"宇宙"
a place we call the universe.

17
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,080
你在一个陌生的星球举步维艰
You're lost on an alien planet.

18
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,390
食物所剩无几
Food is running low.

19
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,050
氧气补给日渐减少
Oxygen is running out.

20
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
救助也在遥不可及的地点
Help is 100 million miles away.

21
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,570
火星是一个致命的地方
Mars, it's a lethal place.

22
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,890
哪里才能避免受宇宙辐射的伤害
Where can you hide from blasts of space radiation?

23
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,720
带电粒子会射向我们地表的宇航员
Charged particles would be hitting any astronauts that we had on the surface.

24
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,070
他们没有防护措施
They would not be protected.

25
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,820
如何才能抵御致命的尘暴
How can you stand up to a deadly dust storm?

26
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,420
火星上的尘土能侵蚀掉航天服
The dust on Mars could eat away at the fabric of a space suit.

27
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,530
这是非常可怕的
That would be catastrophic.

28
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,000
氧气不足时  你该怎么办
What will you do when you run out of air?

29
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,420
你会非常痛苦地死去
You will die a horrible death.

30
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,510
紧急降落火星后  你如何能够生还
How can you survive crash-landing on Mars?

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,330
人类迫降在火星上
Humans crash landing on Mars.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,700
在恶劣的环境中求生存
Struggling to survive on a hostile world.

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,030
这一直是科幻电影热门的素材
It's been a favorite theme of science-fiction movies.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,730
这其中有许多事都搞错了
They got a lot of things wrong.

35
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,680
可是包括美国在内的许多国家的宇航局
But NASA and other space agencies

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,220
正筹备要在未来几十年内将人类送上火星
are planning to send people to the red planet in the next few decades.

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,470
所以我们要考虑火星上迫降和生存的问题
So the questions of crash-landing and survival have to be taken seriously.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,540
要知道  你要做的事情
Well, think about what you're trying to do.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,500
是将探索队送上火星   
You're sending a mission to Mars,

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,900
着陆地点和环境都是你一无所知的
you're sending it to an unknown location within an unknown environment.

41
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,900
马修・格罗姆贝克
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

42
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,690
一步走错
All it takes is one thing to go wrong...

43
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,670
整盘皆输
Then you've lost the whole mission.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,600
本节目是根据最近的科研成果
This program, based on recent scientific information,

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,770
展示了不久的将来可能发生的情景
presents one possible scenario of what might happen in the near future.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,680
想象一下  国际探索队将去探索火星  
Imagine that international crew has been selected to explore Mars

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,810
并为建立永久基地做好准备
and set the stage for a permanent base.

48
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,770
火星探索队  第174天
即将登陆

49
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,910
老电影中的这些人智勇双全  技能熟练
In old movies, such crews were brave, skilled, and resourceful.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,490
电影的这一部分倒是说对了
Well, the movies got that part right.

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,430
总之  我们选拔人才组成一个小的团队
The bottom line is that when we're dealing with a small group of individuals

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,420
而不是一大群人时
forming a crew, not a large community,

53
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,420
帕斯卡・李
火星协会

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,540
有一个起码的标准 
but a small group of people,

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,570
每一个人员的选拔都非常重要
the specific individuals that you end up selecting is really very important.

56
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,210
你会把谁送上火星呢
Who would you send to Mars?

57
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,330
不是那些杂而不精的人
Not jacks of all trades, uh, who are aces at none.

58
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,670
你希望你的团队每个方面都有能手
You want, uh, aces at many trades on your crew.

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,360
队员最重要的能力就是维修能力
The most important skill among the crew is that of mechanic.

60
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,980
四人团队中我要有两人
I would have two of the four members of the crew

61
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,050
罗伯特・祖布林
火星协会

62
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,110
是能够维修机械的
selected primarily for their ability to fix things.

63
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,280
除了机械师  团队中最重要的技能人才
After mechanic, the most important skill among the crew

64
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,810
是实地考察科学家  他们能够
is that of field scientist, people that are qualified to

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,490
根据地质线索找到化石  
follow hints in the geology to find fossils

66
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,690
或是找到可开采的水源  
or to find places where we can drill for water,

67
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,400
用《星际迷航》的话说
okay, in Star Trek terminology,

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,210
要两个史考特和两个斯波克
two Scottys and two Spocks.

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,270
一个是机械师  一个是科学家

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,530
还有一点是老电影里弄错了的
But here's something old movies got wrong,

71
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,990
即人类只需一艘尖头宇宙飞船便可抵达火星
the idea that humans will fly to Mars in a single needle-nosed spaceship.

72
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,750
与那些旧时的科幻电影中看到的不同
Unlike the case in many old science-fiction movies,

73
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,090
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,010
用多艘宇宙飞船将物资送去火星
it's actually cheaper and more efficient

75
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,650
会更低廉也更高效
to send a bunch of material to Mars on different rocket ships.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,350
你要是想只用一艘飞船装载所有物资  
If you try to put them on one rocket ship,

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,180
那就需要一艘巨型飞船
it turns out that that ship has to be enormous

78
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,940
甚至需要核能推动
and probably nuclear-powered, and

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,030
并由此引发许多连带问题和风险
there's all sorts of dangers and problems associated with that.

80
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,110
实际上  火星宇的航员
In most real-life scenarios, the Mars astronauts

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,430
用不同的太空舱来着陆和起飞
will land and leave in separate crafts.

82
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,410
在长达十八个月的火星考察中
The habitat module, or hab, will be their home during their

83
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,600
生活舱就是宇航员的家
18-month mission on the martian surface.

84
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,720
生活舱备有加压漫游车
They'll take long-range trips in a pressurized rover

85
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,900
他们将用此车进行一次长途旅行
packed along with them on the hab.

86
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,780
一辆小型短程漫游车   
A smaller rover, for shorter trips,

87
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,000
已经在着陆点就位
has been pre-positioned at the landing site

88
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,390
旁边就是宇航员的返回舱
along with the astronauts' ride home,

89
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,140
这就是返回地球舱  简称返地舱
the Earth Return Vehicle, or ERV.

90
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,830
它不仅在等待宇航员
The ERV isn't just waiting for the astronauts--

91
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,680
它还在将火星资源转化为火箭燃料和可用空气
It's transforming martian resources into rocket fuel and breathable air.

92
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,900
返地舱有一个泵  能抽进火星的空气 
The Earth Return Vehicle runs a pump which sucks in the martian air,

93
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,650
这里二氧化碳含量为95%
which is 95% carbon dioxide gas,

94
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,020
我们可以用这些二氧化碳
and we can react that carbon dioxide gas

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,420
和我们从地球带来的少量氢气混合反应
with a small amount of hydrogen that we've brought from Earth

96
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,540
便能产生大量的甲烷  燃料和氧气
to produce a large supply of methane fuel and oxygen.

97
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,630
你的四名宇航员在返地舱附近登陆火星 
Your crew of four astronauts land on Mars near the Earth return Vehicle,

98
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,880
他们把生活舱当作实验室和考察基地
they use their habitat as their laboratory, as their exploration base,

99
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,140
考察结束后 
but when they're done,

100
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,600
他们就坐返地舱返回地球
they get in the Earth Return Vehicle and they fly back to Earth.

101
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,260
他们将生活舱留在火星上  
They leave the hab behind on Mars,

102
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,180
每次探索我们都会为基地增加一个生活舱
so each time we do this we add another hab to the base,

103
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,260
很快
and before you know it

104
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,340
我们就能在火星开始建立人类定居地了
we've got the beginning of the first human settlement on a new world.

105
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,010
我们应该在火星哪里着陆呢
So where should we land on Mars?

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,480
火星很令人着迷  那里有许多有趣的地方
Well, Mars is a fascinating planet-- There's a lot of interesting areas.

107
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,150
选择赤道附近的地点也许会好一些
It might be better, initially, to choose a region near the equator,

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,020
最好是平坦区域  但要靠近地貌奇特的地方
especially a flat area, but also near geologically interesting features.

109
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,950
生活舱降落的技术必须万无一失  
One thing that mustn't go wrong is the hab's landing technique,

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,390
即大气煞车法
called aerobraking.

111
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:16,200
大气煞车法是利用火星大气层的摩擦力 
Aerobraking is the art of using the friction of the martian atmosphere

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,590
降低宇宙飞船的速度
to slow down the spacecraft.

113
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,600
设想这就是进入火星大气层的生活舱
Imagine this ball is the habitat module entering the martian atmosphere.

114
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,320
这根杆子就是火星  非常细小
The pole is Mars, a very skinny Mars.

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,420
现在我可以用火箭慢慢降低它的速度 
Now, I could use rockets to gently slow this thing down

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
在预设的地方着陆  也就是胶带的位置
and land at the desired spot, where this duct tape is,

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,930
但这就需要许多能量  也就是燃料 
but that would require a lot of energy, which requires fuel,

118
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,440
燃料很重且成本高
and that's heavy and expensive.

119
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,030
取而代之  我们可以用火星的大气层来减速
Instead, we could let the martian atmosphere slow the hab down.

120
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,000
看呐  它正在慢慢减速
See that, it's gently slowing down.

121
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,110
而只有在最后  非常接近地表的时候 
And only near the very end, when it's getting very close to the surface,

122
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,530
我们才需要用到减速火箭 
would we turn on some retrorockets

123
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,260
还有气球降落伞  即气伞
and use a balloon parachute called a ballute

124
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,010
使之在特定位置降落  比如胶带那里
to bring it to the desired location. Like that.

125
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,940
风险就在于  如果进入的角度不对 
Now, the danger is that if the angle of entry is wrong

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,230
或是速度太快  那么就会导致
or the speed is too fast, then, in fact,

127
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,210
摩擦超过防热罩的承受能力  减速伞和
friction can overwhelm the heat shield, the aeroshell,

128
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,840
舱体会像流星一样在大气层中燃烧起来
and the hab can burn up like a meteor in the martian atmosphere.

129
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,810
只要是微小的计算错误
And even a slight miscalculation

130
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,810
都能导致硬着陆或是在错误地点着陆
can lead to a landing that's too rough or in the wrong place.

131
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,780
着陆过程极其复杂
There's about a thousand things that have to happen.

132
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,800
利用防热罩进入大气层  速度会很快
Come in on a heat shield, going quite fast,

133
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,770
利用大气的摩擦来减速
use the friction of the atmosphere to help slow you down.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
要把防热罩抛掉才能着陆
The heat shield, the heat shield needs to be jettisoned.

135
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,910
在穿越大气层时要尽全力制动减速
You need to aerobrake through the atmosphere as much as you can.

136
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,240
通过弹出降落伞来减缓下降速度
You need to pop out a parachute to slow yourself down.

137
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,240
近地面时很可能用到反推火箭
You probably then need retrorockets at the bottom.

138
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,350
落地后要把降落伞割断并丢弃
You need to cut the parachute to get it away from you.

139
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,620
在所有困难的步骤中  这步是难上加难
This is extremely difficult, among the most difficult things there is to do.

140
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,280
但在距离火星表面仅几公里处  
Then, a few miles above the surface,

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,590
出现了非常困难的状况
something goes very wrong.

142
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,660
生活舱猛地闯入巨大的火星尘暴中
The hab hurtles into a martian dust devil of terrifying proportions.

143
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,490
火星尘暴其实是大气层中的气旋
Dust devils on Mars are vortices in the atmosphere

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,170
麦克儿・史密纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

145
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,890
高速运转的气旋  卷起火星表面的沙尘
so rapidly spinning columns of air that lift dust off of the surface.

146
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,400
然后吹散到大气中
And loft them into the atmosphere.

147
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,130
目前地球上的尘暴高仅一两百米
Now, on Earth, dust devils may only be a few hundred feet high,

148
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,700
但在火星上则高达5至6.5千米
but on Mars, they can be 3 to 4 miles high.

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,510
尘暴的规模相当大
So they're simply immense structures.

150
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,960
尘暴吞噬了生活舱
The dust devil engulfs the hab.

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,310
将其抛离既定轨道  非常危险
Throwing it dangerously off course.

152
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,390
从德州到哈萨克斯坦的跟踪台 
Tracking stations from Texas to Kazakhstan

153
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,670
都密切关注着本次着陆
are following the descent.

154
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,790
但因为火星实在太远
But Mars is so far away,

155
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,870
生活舱信号传输到地球要花费18分钟
it takes 18 minutes for the hab's transmissions to reach Earth.

156
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,150
收到生活舱将要迫降的消息时
When the signal comes through that the hab is headed for a crash-landing,

157
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,780
宇航员们早已迫降着陆了
the astronauts have already crashed.

158
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,860
但是着陆地点在哪  它们是否生还
But where? And are they alive or dead?

159
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,330
起飞和着陆两个过程中
There's only one thing you can do at launch, and there's

160
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,860
我们唯一能做的  只有祈祷
only one thing you can do at landing, and that's pray.

161
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,160
火星探索队:
生活舱位置不明

162
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,360
在火星的某处  宇航员们还活着  
Somewhere on Mars the astronauts are alive

163
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,680
但联络中断
but communications are out.

164
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,980
他们无法和地球进行联系
They can't talk to Earth.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,050
更糟的是尘暴使他们远离既定路线
Worse, the dust devil has taken them far off course.

166
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,510
人类首次登陆火星  真真正正是一次壮举
When humans first land on Mars, it'll be a truly magnificent event.

167
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
这是史无前例的壮举
One of the most historic events ever.

168
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,500
但是  我们的宇航员是紧急迫降的
But, you know, our astronauts crash-landed.

169
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,380
当他们跨出生活舱时
So they're gonna step out

170
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,540
并不知道自己位于何处  发生了什么
not knowing where they are. What's going on.

171
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,960
火星上太阳的亮度仅有地球的一半
The Sun would be about half as bright as it is here.

172
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,900
火星赤道上阳光的强度 
The intensity of sunlight at the martian equator

173
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,450
与地球上的挪威或阿拉斯加相当
is about the same as that in Norway on Earth, or Alaska.

174
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,540
火星地表在阴影下
In shadow, everything on Mars

175
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,000
均会呈现黄褐或赤褐色调
would have this kind of yellowish-brown-reddish hue,

176
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,170
只有在阳光直射下才较为显现其原色
and only things in direct sunlight would show their more true color,

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,060
这是光线在红色飞尘颗粒中
and that's because the light is being bounced around

178
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,560
反复折射产生的现象
amongst all these reddish dust particles.

179
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,330
这是一幅壮丽的画卷
It'll be a wondrous scene.

180
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
但他们无暇欣赏
But they won't have much time to enjoy it.

181
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,540
他们要确定所处的位置
Because they need to figure out where they are,

182
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,740
保证自身安全并计划下步行动
how to get themselves to safety, and what to do.

183
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,380
在火星上没有仪器  怎样找出方位
How do you find out where you are on Mars without instruments?

184
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,800
这些21世纪的宇航员
These 21st-century astronauts

185
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,380
转而求助于一种古老的方法
fall back on an ancient technique.

186
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,960
天文导航
Celestial navigation.

187
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,890
火卫一和火卫二是火星的卫星 
The martian moons, Phobos and Deimos,

188
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,350
都运行在赤道轨道上
they're both in equatorial orbits.

189
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,290
它们从正东方升起
The point at which they rise, that would be due east.

190
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,600
从正西方落下
The point at which they set would be due west.

191
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,410
通过计算火卫轨迹顶点与你正上方位的偏差
At their zenith, to the extent they deviated from being directly overhead,

192
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,700
可以得出你所处位置和赤道的距离[纬度]
that would tell you how far you were from the equator.

193
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,440
将火卫升起或降落的时间对照万年历
The time of rise and set, if you compared that to an almanac,

194
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,790
一般电脑上都装有的
which you might have in your computer,

195
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,820
可以得出你所处位置的经度
would tell you your longitude.

196
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,070
结果令人震惊
The results are shocking.

197
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,390
他们身处峡谷的东半部
They have crashed in the eastern half

198
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,600
该峡谷是整个太阳系最大的
of the largest canyon in the Solar System.

199
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,710
1971年被水手9号探测器发现  
Discovered in 1971 by the Mariner 9 probe,

200
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,640
并因此命名 
and named for it,

201
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,210
水手谷位于火星赤道以南
the Valles Marineris is just south of the martian equator,

202
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,590
深度是美国大峡谷的数倍 
several times as deep as the Grand Canyon

203
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,040
长度等同于美国大陆
and as long as the continental United States.

204
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,160
宇航员距离地球返回舱数百公里 
The astronauts are hundreds of miles from the Earth Return vehicle.

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
更糟的是 
And there's worse news.

206
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,850
氧气从损坏的生命舱中正在快速流失
The damaged hab is leaking oxygen at a critical rate.

207
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,840
并且无法修复
It can't be repaired.

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,190
探索人员数日内可能死亡
The crew could be dead within days.

209
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:23,560
与火星探索队失去联络时间: 16小时

210
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,320
这是在不久的将来可能发生的一幕
It's a near future scenario that might happen.

211
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,120
第一批人类抵达火星  偏离轨道
The first humans on Mars are hundreds of miles off course.

212
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,420
在水手峡谷里孤立无援
Stranded deep in the gigantic Valles Marineris.

213
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,820
他们无法与地球取得联系
They can't communicate with earth

214
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,270
受损舱体内的空气正在外泄
and their damaged habitat module is leaking air.

215
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,110
几乎每部火星电影都在星球上设计了
Almost every Mars movie imagines a breathable atmosphere

216
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,860
至少一块可呼吸区域
in at least one section of Mars

217
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,600
这样演员就可以把头盔摘掉
so the actors can take off their helmets.

218
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,720
但实际上  火星的大气95%都由二氧化碳构成 
But, in fact, Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide

219
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,440
与地球三十千米处的大气一样稀薄
and as thin as Earth's atmosphere at 100,000 feet.

220
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,110
我时常惊讶  火星浪漫的景色
I'm often surprised by how caught up we can be by

221
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,540
帕斯卡・李
火星协会

222
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,940
是那么的令人着迷
this sort of romantic vision of Mars.

223
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,720
这里看着像犹他州或加利福尼亚州
It looks like Utah or California here.

224
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,840
但其实这里是致命的
But the truth is it's a lethal place.

225
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,380
宇航员们只有一次机会  
The astronauts have one chance.

226
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
他们抓住了
And they take it.

227
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,890
他们组装了一辆漫游车
They assemble the rover,

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,430
内有足够使用三周的空气储备
which has a three-week air supply.

229
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,750
一辆密封的漫游车就像旅行房车
A pressurized rover is sort of your RV.

230
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,380
因为你们在车里生活
Uh, you are living inside the rover,

231
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,410
车内加压了  所以可以穿便装
it's pressurized, you're in shirt-sleeves.

232
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,730
开车  生活和工作时 
You don't have to be wearing a space suit

233
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,320
你不必身着宇航服
while you're driving it, or living, or working inside.

234
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,930
水手谷:
通讯恢复

235
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,430
漫游车运转良好  通讯系统也正常了
The rover is functional and so its communications system.

236
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,990
宇航员通过无线电汇报生还的消息
The astronauts radio home that they are alive.

237
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,120
若漫游车或其中的零部件出了故障
If some component or something goes wrong on it,

238
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,800
备用部件会确保宇航员生还
there is a backup that wouldn't lose the mission.

239
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,320
余度是为了确保安全而考虑的一种设计手段

240
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,320
余度设计是行之有效的方法
So redundancy can be a very good thing,

241
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,320
马修・格罗姆贝克
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

242
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,880
至少它为困难的解决提供了可能
or at least the ability to design for a failure if you will.

243
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,740
但是对话并不是像阿波罗登月计划里
But the conversations are not like the

244
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,290
不间断地来回问答
constant back and forth of the Apollo Moon missions.

245
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,420
假设这只球代表了信息或对话
Imagine this ball represents a message, a conversation

246
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,570
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

247
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,910
发生在登月宇航员  也就是我 
between an astronaut on the Moon, me,

248
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,770
和德克萨斯州休斯顿控制中心之间
and mission control in Houston, Texas.

249
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,940
现在我距离休斯顿只有几十厘米 
Now I'm standing a few inches away from Houston,

250
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,880
但事实上月球在38万公里之外
But, in reality, the Moon is 240,000 miles away.

251
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,330
无线电传输速度等同于光速
Now, radio waves travel at the speed of light,

252
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,590
相当于每秒30万千米 
186,000 miles per second.

253
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,210
"你好吗"和"我很好"的问答
So it's only about three seconds

254
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,920
只需耗费3秒钟
between "How are you?" And "I'm fine."

255
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,950
这样对话很简单
Pretty easy to hold a conversation.

256
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,150
但火地的最短距离是地月距离的150倍  
But Mars is, at minimum, about 150 times farther away than the moon.

257
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,610
因此我要走出一大段路
So I have to go all the way over to here.

258
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,600
我们仍能交流  
We can still communicate,

259
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,580
但出现了更长的延迟
but there's a longer delay.

260
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,780
现实中  火星到地球的距离 
In reality, the distance between earth and Mars

261
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,830
在5600万公里到3.8亿公里之间
is between 35 million and 240 million miles.

262
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,690
所以 "你好吗" 和 "我很好"
So the time lag between

263
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,000
之间的时间间隔
"How are you?" and "I'm fine."

264
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,440
会在6到44分钟之间
can be between about 6 and 44 minutes.

265
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,840
这是一段完整的交流需要的时间
That's for a complete exchange.

266
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,370
如果遇到突发状况
So if there's an emergency,

267
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,190
便不能及时解决
it can't be dealt with in real time.

268
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,370
但还有个更大的问题
But there's a bigger problem.

269
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,760
和可见光相同  无线电波只沿直线运动
Like visible light, radio waves travel only in a straight line,

270
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,220
地球和火星都绕轴心旋转
and both Earth and Mars rotate on their axes,

271
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,490
所有有时候两个星球上的人 
so there are times when people on the two planets

272
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,270
无法相互交流
can't communicate with each other.

273
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,950
我们可以用两颗定位卫星解决这个问题
We can solve this with two properly positioned satellites.

274
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,500
假设一颗卫星围绕火星运转
If there's a satellite orbiting Mars,

275
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,120
信息能从火星传到休斯顿的指挥中心
a message can be sent from mars to mission control in Houston.

276
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,380
信息从火星轨道卫星发出
It gets sent to that satellite orbiting Mars,

277
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,190
传到地球轨道卫星
then to the Earth orbiting satellite,

278
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,360
最后传到指挥中心  再往复传递
then to mission control, and back again.

279
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,060
现在  问题发出与回答
Now, there's still a time delay

280
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,020
仍有段多达44分钟的时间延迟
of up to 44 minutes between question and answer,

281
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,200
但至少火星宇航员和
but at least the Mars astronaut and

282
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,410
指挥中心能制定出一个生存计划
mission control can formulate a survival plan.

283
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,120
解决了通讯延迟的问题
Working through the communication lag,

284
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,160
计划成型了
the plan takes shape.

285
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,340
为燃料电池驱动的漫游车装上食物和仪器
Load the fuel-cell powered rover with food and equipment,

286
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,380
并向东行驶到
and drive it east to where the

287
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,790
水手谷注入的一个外流峡谷
Valles Marineris empties into an outflow valley,

288
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,090
这个峡谷可能是十亿年前形成的
probably carved out billion of years ago,

289
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,490
那时火星的大气层更厚
when Mars had a thicker atmosphere

290
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,530
液态水仍在其表面流淌
and liquid water still flowed on its surface.

291
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,380
从这里出发
From this exit point,

292
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,810
驶向返地舱的原始着陆地点
it's less than a day's drive to the Earth return Vehicle

293
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,440
时间不足一天
at the original landing site.

294
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,330
你可以想象这段横穿火星大陆的绝望之旅
So you can imagine having a desperate trip across the Martian landscape

295
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,500
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

296
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,680
为的是重新回到返地舱上
to get back to the Return Vehicle

297
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,950
可能会做点科学研究
and perhaps do a little bit of scientific research

298
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,500
但最重要的是保全自己并返回地球
but most importantly, save yourself and get back to Earth.

299
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,830
所有事情都取决于一些残酷的客观条件
Everything depends on some very cold equations.

300
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,480
每名宇航员每天需要11升水
Each astronaut has a daily need for 3 gallons of water,

301
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,490
两千卡路里的食物  和900克的氧气
2,000 calories of food, and 2 pounds of oxygen.

302
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,740
生存性技术能发挥作用
Survival technology can help.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,000
它们用漫游车车载的装置
They can extract water from Mars itself

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,950
从火星提取水
using equipment on-board the rover.

305
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,740
火星探测器显示
The Mars Odyssey spacecraft has shown

306
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,830
火星赤道区的尘土中  水的质量约占6%
that average Martian dirt in the equatorial regions is 6% water by weight.

307
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,480
如果想从中提取出水
So if you want to get water out of that

308
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,220
你只需采集一些尘土
you can just take some of it

309
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,540
罗伯特・祖布林
火星协会

310
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,950
将其放入一口类似高压锅的带盖容器中
and throw it into a pot like a pressure cooker with a led

311
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,400
加热到150度  水就提取出来了
and heat it to, you know, 150 centigrade and you get out the water.

312
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,140
如果放入11升的尘土
And if you put in about 2 gallons of dirt,

313
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,790
就会得到470毫升的水
you'll get about a pint of water.

314
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,320
但是在火星上
But other human needs

315
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,040
满足人类的其他需要却没这么简单
are not so easily supplied on Mars.

316
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,950
一次为期两周的旅行
Certainly on a two-week journey,

317
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,490
若要成功横穿火星的荒凉之境
if you had to make it across a desolate Martian landscape,

318
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,120
你可以减少食物摄入
you could cut down on food.

319
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,280
留用饥饿时充饥
You could have starvation rations.

320
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,130
甚至可以减少饮水量
You can even cut down on water.

321
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,390
但唯一时时刻刻不可或缺的是空气
But the one thing that you absolutely need, minute by minute, is air.

322
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,640
你无法控制身体所需空气量
You have no flexibility in the amount of air that you need to

323
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,020
以供特殊时期使用
make it for a specific amount of time.

324
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,380
除了要到达返地舱的需要
Despite the need to get to the ERV,

325
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:26,800
还有足够的空气供数次舱外短时操作
there is enough air for several brief EVAs, or extra vehicular activities.

326
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,260
把人们送上火星的部分理由是
Part of the reason for sending people to Mars

327
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,960
做些令人信服的科学研究
would be to do some compelling science,

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,470
我们可以设想他们采集样分析样品
so we would imagine them taking samples, analyzing them,

329
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,080
试图了解岩石形成时的环境
trying to understand the environment when those rocks formed.

330
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,530
诸如此类的事
Things like that.

331
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,640
宇航员使用各种各样的工具
Astronauts could use a whole variety of tools,

332
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,860
锤子  放大镜  不同种类的分普仪
hammers, hand lenses, spectrometers of various sorts,

333
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,040
以及化学分析仪器
chemical analysis machines.

334
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,850
漫游车上可能会有移动实验室
There'd be probably some mobile laboratory on the rover

335
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,670
宇航员们用采集的材料
that would use the materials that they gathered

336
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,440
观察其物质构成  诸如此类
to look at the composition, and so on.

337
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,340
关于水手峡谷的形成
There's a number of theories as to how the, uh,

338
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,840
有许多理论
Valles Marineris was created.

339
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,460
对结构如何形成仍然一知半解
It's still not fully clear how the structure came to be, but,

340
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,140
在大部分的可能性中  涉及到诸多过程
in most likelihood, quite a few processes were involved.

341
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,300
我认为  做野外地质学研究对真正了解
I think that being on the ground and doing field geology is

342
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,310
像水手峡谷一样复杂地形的形成过程
essential to really understanding the processes that had

343
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,610
是必不可少的
sculpt a complex landform like the Valles Marineris.

344
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,400
这个过程很复杂
It's not a simple story.

345
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,970
这不只是地上的一个裂缝
It wasn't just a crack in the earth,

346
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,560
也不只是流体流动形成的
it wasn't just fluid flowed in and formed that.

347
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,830
不同的过程
There were different processes,

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,190
发生在不同时间
acting at different times,

349
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,760
分层堆积在彼此之上  形成一本复杂的书
layering on top of each other, forming a complex book.

350
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,270
为了阅读这本书
And in order to read that book,

351
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,030
你需要到那里将书页翻开[实地考察]
you really need to be there to turn the pages.

352
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,330
水手谷的不同部分变化多样
Valles Marineris has a whole variety of different segments.

353
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,490
中间部分  有一  二  三
There's places in the middle that there's one, two, three, or

354
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,040
甚至四处坎坷不平的平行峡谷
even four parallel canyons where you go down and up

355
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,120
经过那里需要不停地上去下来
and down and up and down and up.

356
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,900
最东部的尽头  
And then, at the very eastern end,

357
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,850
看起来像是河流从混沌区域涌出 
it looks like water came flushing out through what would be a chaos zone,

358
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,800
灾难性的洪水也许曾在此发生
catastrophic floods of water that might have come out.

359
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,080
水中曾有生命的存在吗
Was there life in that water?

360
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,770
他们挖出的岩石样本能充分证明
Could some of the rock samples they dig up have enough evidence

361
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,430
石化细菌的存在吗
of fossilized bacteria?

362
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,100
火星曾是一个温暖潮湿的行星
Mars was once a warm and wet planet,

363
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,790
这是因为
and we know that for a fact

364
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,890
水侵蚀的特征遍布火星表面
because there are water erosion features all over the surface of Mars.

365
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,080
为了寻找有生命的化石  
To look for fossils of life,

366
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,970
你需要找一些有水流过或是聚积的地方
you want to look for places where water has flown or accumulated,

367
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,450
水手峡谷或许是其中一个地方
and the Valles Marineris might be one of those places.

368
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,190
他们在地表之下能找到
Is it even possible that they will find evidence of

369
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,740
液态水的迹象吗
liquid water under the surface?

370
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,590
水中  会有生物体吗
And in that water... Living organisms?

371
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,670
稳定的液态水环境中  都有生命形成吗
Will life form anywhere that liquid water is stable?

372
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,060
或者  会有亿万分之一的机会形成生命体吗
Or is there a one-in-a-trillion chance occurrence that leads to life?

373
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,550
火星上曾有另一个起源吗
Was there a second genesis on Mars?

374
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,120
我认为现在火星上完全可能有细菌活动
I think it's certainly possible that there's bacterial activity on Mars now,

375
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,140
但绝对不是确定的
but that's by no means certain.

376
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,450
这是个非常有趣的现代科学问题
It's--it's a very interesting current scientific question.

377
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,890
我觉得这是太阳系科学中最让人着迷的
I think it's one of the sort of most intriguing questions

378
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,710
一个问题
in solar system science.

379
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:38,650
水手峡谷
三级红色警报

380
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,190
突然  为了生存
Suddenly, the search for life pauses

381
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,930
生命的探索中止了
as the fight for survival resumes.

382
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,550
指挥中心发出信号
Mission control signals that

383
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,460
一个高度危险的太阳耀斑喷向火星
a high risk solar flare is headed for Mars.

384
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,750
一个太阳耀斑是太阳小型区域
A solar flare is a tremendous outburst

385
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,260
所发生的一次猛烈活动
from a relatively small region of the Sun.

386
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,880
一股巨大的能量迸发出来 
A huge amount of energy goes pouring out explosively,

387
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,960
随之而来的就是一股带电粒流 
and a bunch of energetic charged particles

388
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,270
穿越太阳系
go zooming through the solar system.

389
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,670
它们可以与细胞反应  造成伤害
They can interact with cells and harm them.

390
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,740
还会产生像X射线一样的超强电磁辐射 
Also, high-energy electromagnetic radiation like x-rays gets produced,

391
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,350
同样对我们有害
and those can harm us as well.

392
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,880
所以有两个能量波  接连而来
So it's "Wham!" and then "Wham!" again sometime later.

393
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,720
地磁场可以抵消太阳耀斑大部分影响
Earth's magnetic field shields us from the worst effects of solar flares.

394
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,260
但是火星四十亿年前就没有了磁场
But Mars lost its magnetic field 4 billion years ago.

395
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,220
在地球上的人们观测到太阳耀斑活动后 
After a solar flare is seen by people on Earth,

396
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,470
我们想要警告火星上的宇航员
we want to warn the astronauts on Mars.

397
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,790
但是我们无法预警他们将有电磁辐射
Now we can't warn them about the electromagnetic flash because

398
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,920
因为预警信号的传输速度和电磁辐射相同
our warning signal would travel at the same speed as that flash from the Sun,

399
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,310
但是我们可以警告他们带电粒子风暴来袭
but we can warn them about the onslaught of charged particles.

400
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,870
高能带电粒子风暴的速度  差不多是
The high-energy charged particles can travel, perhaps,

401
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,170
光速的一半
at half the speed of light.

402
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,000
生活舱设有防辐射舱
The hab has a radiation-proof chamber,

403
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,640
但是现在距离太远
but it's now too far away.

404
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,220
尽管太空服可以使宇航员免遭太阳耀斑辐射
While the astronauts' space suits shielded them from the solar flare's x-rays,

405
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,020
但他们现在只有几分钟 
they have only minutes to seek shelter

406
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,380
在第二波高能粒子到达火星前寻找庇护所
before the flare's high-energy second wave slams into Mars.

407
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,740
如果在未来  人类登陆火星紧急迫降
If a future human mission to Mars crash-lands,

408
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,800
宇航员面对的不只是
the astronauts will have to contend

409
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,990
严酷的火星地貌环境
with even more than the harsh martian landscape.

410
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,950
太阳耀斑的质子风暴在火星的威力
A solar flare of charged protons would be far more dangerous here

411
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,290
比地球强的多
than on Earth.

412
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,790
水手峡谷:
耀斑粒子流来袭倒计时: 7分钟

413
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,210
因为火星并不具备像地球一样的地磁场
Well, Mars doesn't have a magnetic field like the Earth does

414
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,300
那么所有那些高能粒子和带电粒子流 
so all of these high energetic particles and these charged particles

415
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,840
将会直接轰击火星表面
would be hitting the surface directly

416
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,440
并且伤害到那些在火星地面的宇航员
and hitting any astronauts that we had on the surface.

417
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,740
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

418
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,700
他们将完全暴露在这些危险的太阳射线和
They would not be protected from all of these dangerous rays and

419
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,950
带电粒子流中  
these dangerous particles,

420
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,570
而在地球  我们有地磁场的良好保护
whereas on Earth, we're comfortably protected by our magnetic field.

421
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,170
如果地表宇航员接触高能粒子流
There are a number of bad effects that would come about

422
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,520
将会有许多严重的后果发生
from the energetic particles hitting an astronaut on the surface.

423
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,380
比如  增加患癌症的几率  或者其他疾病
Increased rates of cancer, for example, or other diseases, uh,

424
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,970
辐射病  辐射中毒
radiation sickness, and radiation poisoning.

425
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,260
事实上  在空间站的宇航员
In fact, astronauts aboard the space station

426
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,420
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

427
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,860
偶尔也会进入到一个特别的舱室
have occasionally been told to hide in special chambers

428
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,420
使其免遭来自太阳的带电粒子流
to protect them against the charged particles

429
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,730
和电磁辐射的伤害
and radiation coming from the solar flare.

430
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,470
对于那些在火星水手峡谷中的宇航员来说 
For the astronauts in the middle of the Valles marineris,

431
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,570
唯一的保护装置就是他们的加压漫游车
the only shelter is their pressurized rover.

432
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,560
保护宇航员的并不是漫游车原辐射保护层
The rover's primary radiation shielding isn't lead.

433
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,600
而是墙上摆得食物包
It's the food packets lining the walls,

434
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,410
以及宇航员的排泄物提供了保护
along with the astronauts' own waste material.

435
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,780
排泄物种含有烃类  而烃类中则有氢
Feces contain hydrocarbons, and hydrocarbons contain hydrogen,

436
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,310
而氢是一种很好的辐射吸收剂
and hydrogen is a very good absorber of radiation.

437
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,530
还没有被食用的食物中的氢元素
Hydrogen that you have in the form of food before it's consumed

438
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,860
将会为你抵挡一部分辐射带来的危害
will help shield you from some portion of this radiation,

439
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,730
帕斯卡・李
火星协会

440
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,850
当然  当你把食物食用后  
and certainly once you've consumed your food

441
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,330
应该把排泄物放进
you want to put your feces

442
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,230
那些在漫游车上的墙中的小格子里
in these little tilble zip-blocks and back on the wall of the vehicle

443
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,080
来保护你们免遭辐射
to shield you from radiation.

444
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,210
如果你想在宇宙中活命
If you're going to survive in space,

445
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,580
任何东西都得派上用场啊
almost nothing can go to waste.

446
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,370
包括排泄物
Not even waste.

447
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,760
紧急危机过去了
With the immediate crisis over,

448
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,970
宇航员们继续前往返地舱地点
the journey to the Earth Return Vehicle continues.

449
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,190
然而  又有意想不到的事发生了
Then, something unexpected happens.

450
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,510
水手号峡谷
任务计划改变

451
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,220
宇航员们投票表决后改变了计划
The astronauts take a vote and change the plan.

452
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,220
指令长:
休斯顿指挥中心  我们做出了一个决定
我们一致决定不立即返回地球

453
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,510
他们不愿搭返地舱提前500天回到地球
Rather than using the ERV to fly home 500 days ahead of schedule,

454
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,250
他们要在火星上坚持完成任务
they will stay and complete de mission.

455
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,850
火星行动的后援团队对
The team backup on the space is gonna have much less knowledge

456
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,420
罗伯特・祖布林
火星协会

457
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,270
探索队情况和他们面临的选择知之甚少
of the circumstances of the crew and the real options opened to them

458
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,460
只有他们自己最清楚
than the crew themselves have.

459
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,560
所以我觉得应从前线指挥火星探索队
So I think that a Mars mission is gonna have to be commanded from the front,

460
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,110
而这样的话  与其设立控制中心
and that, rather than having a mission control,

461
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,200
我们需要一个任务支持中心
we need to have a mission support.

462
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,320
宇航员们的新计划是到达返地舱所在地 
The astronauts' new plan is to make it to the Earth return Vehicle

463
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,050
并用其代替生命舱  作为他们的行动基地
and use it, in place of the hab, as their base of operations.

464
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,470
返地舱要比生活舱小许多  
It's much smaller than the hab,

465
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,740
但它有电力供给  并能产生额外氧气
but it has a power supply and it has the ability to make extra oxygen.

466
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,750
所以事实上  探索队可以使用返地舱
So the crew could, in fact, go to the Earth Return Vehicle

467
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,460
生活并进行工作
and live in it and work out of it.

468
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,130
宇航员对他们的生存抱有极大信心
The astronauts' confidence on their survival shoots up.

469
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:34,010
水手峡谷外流渠道

470
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,070
因为他们到达了水手谷东部的外流渠道
As they reach the outflow channel at the eastern edge of Valles Marineris.

471
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,280
食物水源和空气都还充足  
There's enough food, water, and air

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,170
到返地舱绰绰有余
to make an easy drive to the ERV.

473
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,730
这时  一名宇航员看到了不寻常的事物
Then, an astronaut sees something unusual.

474
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,020
有一块暴露在外的岩石层
An exposed layer of rock that looks like it might contain

475
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,080
可能包含叠层石
something called stromatolites.

476
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,010
在地球上  有细菌存在
On Earth, we had bacteria,

477
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,740
而且不只是单细胞细菌
and not just individual bacteria

478
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,470
还有多细胞菌群落  它们造出了岩石
but bacteria that formed colonies, which created rocks

479
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,330
也就是叠层石
known as stromatolites.

480
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,710
这些东西  可以说是细菌界的珊瑚礁
These are, you might call, the bacterial equivalent of coral reefs,

481
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,830
由微小的生物体造出的大物体
where tiny organisms build up something big.

482
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,920
如果火星上应该存在这种东西
This would be a logical thing to look for on Mars.

483
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,940
在地球上有叠层石  这也是我们期望
Stromatolites on Earth provide the kind of evidence

484
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,410
在火星上找到的某种证据
that we would expect to see on Mars,

485
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,070
不是说一定要有  但这是基本的理论 
not on that exact form, but it's the basic idea.

486
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,120
叠层石相当于无数细菌尸体
Stromatolites were sort of massive LOG

487
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,000
转为硅质形态堆积 
and then silicon-like material but built up

488
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,770
形成宏观结构  随即这样保存了下来
and formed macroscopic structures which were then preserved.

489
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,800
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

490
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,260
如果说类似过程曾在火星发生
If something like that was going on on Mars,

491
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,000
我们就能很肯定的说
that would provide an easy way of determining that

492
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,100
那里曾经有生命存在
life did indeed exist there.

493
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,650
很多科幻电影题材都是源于
Many science-fiction films are based

494
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,530
我们在火星上发现了存在先进文明的证据
on the idea that we'll find evidence of advanced civilizations on Mars.

495
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,610
火星上并没有城市或是规模化建筑的迹象
Mars has no cities or grand structures.

496
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,800
但宇航员或许能找到火星存在生命的证据
But astronauts may yet find evidence of life on Mars...

497
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,490
哪怕是只能找到细菌化石
Even if it's only fossils of bacteria.

498
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,020
宇航员们采集到了岩石样本
With the rock samples loaded in,

499
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,450
漫游车准备出发  但却停止不动
the rover tries to head off... But goes nowhere.

500
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,140
一个轮子陷住了
One wheel is stuck.

501
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,740
宇航员束手无策
The astronauts cannot free it.

502
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,870
沙子是火星上的死亡陷阱  
Sand is sort of the death trap of Mars,

503
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,670
我可以预见到  
and I wouldn't be surprised if, you know,

504
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,960
在未来的登陆中 会有一些宇航员因为
in future expeditions, we end up losing some crews that are on

505
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,650
漫游车陷入沙障中而命丧火星
these long pressurized rover traverses to sand traps.

506
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,190
他们记算了一下从这里到返地舱的距离
They calculate the remaining distance to the ERV.

507
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,330
他们能徒步平安返回吗
Could they walk to safety?

508
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,830
满载氧气的太空服只能支持十二小时
A space suit's full tank of air will only last 12 hours.

509
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,540
而这段距离需要持续徒步三十个小时
It would take 30 hours of continuous walking.

510
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,170
当你在地球上考察各种地形时
On the Earth, you can get stuck

511
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,100
会在沙漠地带抛锚
when you are doing all-terraining in sandy areas.

512
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,130
但是  在地球上
But, of course, on the Earth,

513
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,230
你大以可停下 吸口新鲜空气
you can just step outside the vehicle and breathe.

514
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,110
在火星上却不行
On Mars, you won't have that option.

515
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,190
所以如果你的车被卡住了
So if your vehicle is stuck,

516
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,380
并且无法脱困
and there's no way to get it out of its predicament,

517
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,580
你只能眼睁睁地等死
you're gonna watch yourself die.

518
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:38,020
水手峡谷外流渠道

519
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,460
在我们设想的人类首次登火可能出现的问题中
In our scenario of what might go wrong for the first human mission to Mars,

520
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,270
宇航员漫游车陷入火星沙地
the astronauts' rover is trapped in the Martian sand.

521
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,040
返地舱却在160公里远之外
The Earth Return Vehicle is 100 miles away.

522
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,010
宇航员必死无疑吗
Are the astronauts facing certain death,

523
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,510
还是他们能利用工业化前的技术再次脱险呢
or can they save themselves once again with pre-industrial technology?

524
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,970
假设探险队陷入困境  
So let's say the crew was stranded

525
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,490
至少需要一人
and they need to get at least one person,

526
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,740
长途跋涉去找到另一辆车
a considerable distance to secure another vehicle

527
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:04,060
罗伯特・祖布林  
火星协会

528
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,540
再回来解救其余的人
and come back and rescue the rest.

529
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,670
气球式降落伞能否堪此重任  
Could they do this with ballutes?

530
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,690
只是有可能
It's just possible.

531
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,190
地球上的工程师进行了一些测试
Engineers on Earth run tests to see

532
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,270
看一个气球是否能运载至少一名宇航员
if a balloon could carry at least one astronaut

533
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,260
穿过沙漠到达返地舱
over the desert to the ERV.

534
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,990
通过伸展一张包裹着气体二氧化碳的 
You could do this by stretching a synthetic membrane of some sort

535
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,850
人造膜来做到这一点
around a pocket of the surrounding air, just carbon dioxide.

536
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,960
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

537
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,740
你得加热其中的气体来
And then you'd have to heat the air inside

538
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,860
使它产生浮力
in order to give it some sort of buoyancy.

539
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,120
现在可以使用太阳能加热
Now, one way of doing that is having solar heating

540
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,730
令薄膜有效地吸收太阳能  
effectively have the membrane absorb solar energy,

541
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,860
加热其中的二氧化碳
heat the carbon dioxide inside

542
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,950
然后薄膜膨胀融合  气球升起
and then it expands, becomes blend and lifts the balloon up.

543
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,990
在火星制造的气球
Any balloon that you would construct to fabricate on Mars

544
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,990
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

545
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,850
是非常巨大的
would have to be very large

546
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,590
因为这样才能弥补那里的极低大气密度
to compensate for the very low density atmosphere.

547
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,450
火星大气层非常稀薄
The Martian atmosphere is very thin.

548
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,770
比地球海平面大气压的1%还低
It's less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level.

549
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,910
那意味着为了举起重物
That means that to get substantial lift,

550
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,560
你需要一个庞大的气球
you need an enormous balloon.

551
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,210
对一个身着太空服的宇航员来说
A balloon that is 10 meters in radius is probably enough for

552
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,370
也许一个半径十米的气球足矣
one astronaut in a space suit.

553
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,060
为什么火星小队会有个如此巨大的气球
Why would a crew on Mars have a balloon that big?

554
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,970
他们也许没有  
They probably wouldn't,

555
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,690
但他们也许会有大量  
but they might have a large number of balloons used

556
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,650
小型用于科研的气球
for scientific purposes that were smaller than that.

557
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,280
这个冒险计划被付诸行动
The risky plan is put into action.

558
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,270
一名宇航员用临时伞带  升上火星的天空
In a makeshift harness, one astronaut rises into the Martian sky.

559
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,570
在1.6千米高空  
A mile up,

560
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,620
风吹着她以每小时96公里的速度
winds blow her towards the ERV

561
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
前往返地舱
at 60 miles an hour.

562
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,270
火星表面的盛行风从西吹向东
On Mars, the prevailing winds near the surface blow from West to east,

563
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,160
我们正想如此  所以那对我们有利
and we want to go from west to east. So that's good for us.

564
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,490
这个方案存在个大问题
One of the big problems with this scenario

565
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,130
就是你达到目的地的精确度
is the precision at which you could hope to, uh, reach your destination.

566
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:01,310
如果你能降落在徒步到达的距离之内
But if you could then come down within hiking distance of your destination...

567
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,450
这需要一些运气  但也有可能
It'd take some luck, but it's possible.

568
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,020
火星重力只有地球的百分之三十八
Mars has only 38% of Earth's gravity.

569
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,020
科幻电影常常忽略这个事实
Science-fiction movies usually forget that fact,

570
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,390
让宇航员在正常的好莱坞重力下行动
and have astronauts operate in normal Hollywood gravity.

571
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,480
事实是  就算穿上沉重的
The truth is, even with the heavy space suits

572
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,620
舱外活动太空服 
worn during extra vehicular activity,

573
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,680
在火星上步行也比在地球上容易得多
hiking on Mars will be easier than on Earth.

574
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,330
假如你体重68公斤
Let's say you're a 150-pound person

575
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,910
穿上90公斤的太空服  
and you put on a 200 pound suit--

576
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,560
就是160公斤
That's 350 pounds.

577
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,160
但是如果你只有那重量的38%
But then, if you only weigh 38% of that,

578
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,730
那么你加上制服的重量就只是55公斤
okay, then your weight is maybe 120 pounds with the suit.

579
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,310
所以你穿着制服在火星上步行
So you actually have less of a burden walking with that suit on Mars

580
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,480
要比在地球上轻装徒步更轻松
than you have walking in your stockings on Earth.

581
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:08,690
返地舱位置
已到达

582
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,850
宇航员成功着陆
The astronaut lands successfully

583
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,430
成功到达返地舱和双人漫游车
and manages to hike to the ERV and the two person rover.

584
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,130
一切设备正常工作
Everything is in working order.

585
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,940
其中一名宇航员驾驶沙漠漫游车
So one of the astronauts gets into a dune buggy rover,

586
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,800
回到被困的加压漫游车旁  
comes back to the pressurized rover,

587
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,390
带上其中一名宇航员  将他带向返地舱
takes one of the astronauts, brings that astronaut to the Earth Return Vehicle

588
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,840
然后来回几趟
then goes back and forth a couple of more times

589
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,480
将所有的宇航员都安全带回
to get all the astronauts over to safety.

590
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,800
计划就是如此
That's the plan.

591
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,380
但是新的危险出现了
But then a new danger arises,

592
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,560
一场红尘暴
a storm of red dust.

593
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,990
空中太阳越来越暗淡  沙尘越来越厚
The Sun would get dimmer in the sky, and it would continue to build and build,

594
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,100
向一望无际的天边望去
and you'd see, from horizon to horizon,

595
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,170
浓厚的沙尘在大气中形成巨大的漩涡
this very thick dusty swirly mass in the atmosphere.

596
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,330
但是什么引发了火星的沙尘暴
But what causes dust storms on Mars?

597
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,740
加州阿纳海姆的丽莎・阿布多发达
That's what Lisa Abdelfatah of Anaheim,

598
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,310
在电邮中写道
California, emailed

599
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,830
询问宇宙

600
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:15,620
是什么引起了火星的沙尘暴
丽莎・阿布多发达  阿纳海姆  加利福尼亚

601
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,700
丽莎  你也许会大吃一惊 
Lisa, you might be surprised to learn that

602
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,790
因为是太阳的能量引发了火星上的尘暴
dust storms on Mars are actually caused by energy from the Sun.

603
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,100
太阳炙烤火星表面的沙尘和大气层
The Sun heats the dust in the surface of Mars and also that atmosphere,

604
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,220
导致它膨胀并产生对流现象
causing it to expand and causing convection currents to occur,

605
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,770
在不同的空气之间存在的不同压力
and there are difference of pressure between one pocket of air and another,

606
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,410
于是产生了风
that leads to winds.

607
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,900
接着沙尘越来越厚  越来越热
Then more dust gets kicked up and more heating

608
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,730
压力差越来越大
and more of these pressure differences,

609
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,890
最终导致猛烈的沙尘暴
so you get these violent dust storms.

610
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,230
火星的沙尘对宇航员来说非常危险
The dust on Mars could be very hazardous to astronauts

611
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,350
其中有很多原因
for a number of reasons.

612
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,040
因为火星没有水
Because there's no water on Mars,

613
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,740
每颗沙粒不像你在地球海滩上看到的
the individual grains are not smooth and rounded like--

614
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,730
那么光滑圆润
Like you would see on a beach here on Earth.

615
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,110
它们真的很尖锐且有锯齿
They're actually very sharp and jagged.

616
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,270
宇航员步行或者活动的时 
As that dust gets kicked up as the astronaut's walking or moving,

617
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,240
激起的沙尘存留在太空服上
uh, it gets caught on the space suit.

618
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,370
一段时间之后  由于摩擦
And, over time, due to friction--

619
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,130
比如宇航员在摆动胳膊或者迈腿的时候
Let's say the astronaut's moving arms or his legs--

620
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,280
沙尘就开始侵蚀太空服的纤维
Uh, it begins to eat away at the fabric of the space suit.

621
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,440
这样太空服就很容易撕破或开裂
So you could easily get a tear or a rip in the space suit,

622
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,480
而那将会是灾难性的
and that would be catastrophic.

623
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,720
尽管危机重重  宇航员还是驾着小型漫游车
Despite the dangers, the astronaut takes the small rover,

624
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,320
载着额外的氧气补给  冲入沙尘暴
loaded with extra oxygen, out into the storm.

625
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,120
她一个一个地把队友接回返地舱
And one by one, she brings her crew mates back to the Earth Return Vehicle.

626
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,410
但是就在即将到达安全地点时
But just a few feet from safety...

627
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,960
粗糙的沙尘就撕破了指挥官的太空服
The abrasive dust tears a section of the commander's suit,

628
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,560
将他暴露在几近真空的火星大气层下
exposing him to the near-vacuum of the martian atmosphere.

629
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,640
如果你的太空服有一个漏洞
If-- If your space suit springs a leak,

630
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,510
或者它突然降压  完全打开了
or if it's a violent decompression, where your suit is ripped open,

631
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,870
你只能保持几秒清醒
you might not have more than a few seconds to remain conscious

632
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,660
来面对将会发生的事
and see what's going to happen to you.

633
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,770
你情况不妙
You would be in a very bad way.

634
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,180
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

635
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,100
好似在地球上深度潜水后上浮
You would be not dissimilar to coming up from a very deep dive on the Earth.

636
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,460
这将是一次非常痛苦的经历
It would be a very painful experience.

637
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,590
如果你有减压问题
If you have a decompression problem

638
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,820
这将是很严重且致命的
it can get very serious and lethal.

639
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,980
你将面临可怕而迅速的死亡
You would die a horrible death and very quickly as well.

640
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,810
帕斯卡・李 
火星协会

641
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,540
除非他的同伴能马上采取措施
Unless his crew mates can do something immediately,

642
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:22,000
否则他将会成为火星上的第一具人类尸体
the commander will be the first human corpse on Mars.

643
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,810
返地舱位置  
严重空气泄露

644
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,810
在我们对不远未来的设想中  
In our scenario of the near future,

645
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,490
首批登陆火星的探索者
the first explorers on Mars

646
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,910
同时经受住了近乎致命的撞击
have survived a near fatal crash

647
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,190
与在这充满敌意的星球上的危险旅程
and a dangerous trek across a hostile planet.

648
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,350
但如今  一场磨蚀性砂尘形成的风暴
But now, a storm of abrasive dust

649
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,810
在任务指挥官的太空服上撕开了一个洞
has torn a hole in mission commander's spacesuit.

650
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,630
这是宇航员最为害怕的情况
It's the one thing the astronauts fear above everything else.

651
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,030
失去意识前  你只有10到12秒的时间
You've got 10 or 12 seconds before you lose consciousness.

652
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,160
亚历克・菲力彭科
加州大学伯克利分校

653
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,140
这种情况下最好立即呼气  排空肺部
You better exhale, right away. Empty your lungs,

654
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,530
不然的话它们便会迅速扩张乃至爆裂
because otherwise they'll quickly expand and rupture.

655
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,450
太空服破损十二秒后  指挥官已不省人事
Twelve seconds after his suit tore, the commander is unconscious.

656
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,600
他的皮肤开始发青
His skin is turning blue.

657
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,380
他的组员只有不到九十秒的时间
His crewmates have less than 90 seconds

658
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,150
将他送进返地舱的气闸室
to get him through the ERV's airlock

659
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,520
进行紧急输氧  否则他的血液循环将停止
and administer emergency oxygen before his blood circulation ceases

660
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,390
他的器官将永久地停止工作
and his organs shut down forever.

661
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,450
在失去意识之后  
After you've lost consciousness,

662
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,980
最好有人能在接下来的一分半钟内 
you hope that someone will hook you up to pressurized oxygen

663
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,740
为你提供压缩氧气
within the next minute and a half.

664
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,690
如果得不到的话  你必死无疑
If you don't get hooked up, you'll die for sure.

665
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,070
若能得到救助  并能再次呼吸氧气 
If you do get hooked up, and you start breathing oxygen again,

666
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,080
等你挺过来  一般来说
it turns out that, when you come to,

667
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,490
不会造成太多的永久性伤害
there's usually not much permanent damage.

668
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,990
指挥官在千钧一发之际得以幸存
The commander survives with seconds to spare.

669
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,300
尽管他受伤了  他还是能够痊愈
Despite his injuries, he will make a full recovery.

670
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,590
很快  队员们恢复了精力
Soon, the crew is back to full strength,

671
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,590
火星基地一号  任务进行中

672
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,010
并开始进行各种实验活动
working and performing experiments.

673
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,320
火星探索已正式展开
The exploration of Mars has begun in earnest.

674
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,300
对我来说火星将会挑战一切
Mars to me would challenge

675
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,200
帕斯卡・李
火星协会

676
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,940
人类历史上有过的探索经验
all the expedition experiences that we've had throughout our history.

677
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,200
过往积累的宝贵经验均会尽数应用
It will take all the best lessons learned from all past expeditions.

678
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,050
比如极地经验  丛林经验
The polar ones, the ones through the jungles,

679
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,090
以及北美大陆经验
the ones through North America.

680
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,430
火星是个极具挑战性的地方  它极度无情
Mars is a super-challenging place; it's very unforgiving.

681
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,290
在地球上  即便遇上麻烦  
Here on Earth, if things go wrong,

682
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,060
格雷格・鲁克林
加州大学圣塔克鲁兹分校

683
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,450
我们仍有空气可呼吸  仍有水源可饮用
we can rely on there being air to breathe and water to drink.

684
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,370
但在火星上  如果出了问题  
On Mars, if something goes wrong,

685
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,050
那么情况马上会变得更加糟糕
then the situation is automatically much more serious.

686
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,210
但是宇航员已证明他们能适应火星上的环境
But the astronauts have proven that they can adapt to the martian environment.

687
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,510
和极地探索者一样  他们抵御着刺骨低温
Like polar explorers, they protect themselves from the frigid temperatures.

688
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,000
像沙漠探索者一样
Like desert explorers,

689
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,040
他们学会与无处不在的砂尘共同生活
they learn to live with the ever-present dust.

690
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,700
在我们火星协会运作的沙漠研究站里 
In our own desert station that the Mars Society runs

691
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,970
我们带去一台高端显微镜
we brought a really superb microscope,

692
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,540
罗伯特・祖布林
火星协会

693
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,790
但是运抵之后数周之内 它就被砂尘弄坏了
but it was disabled by dust within a few weeks of it's arrival.

694
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,000
而另一方面  一些工艺更为粗糙的显微镜
On the other hand, some much cruder kind of microscopes,

695
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,490
类似于一般本科学生用的一类
similar to the kind that college students use routinely,

696
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,530
经证实相当强韧
have proved very robust.

697
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,990
在前线环境中  你想要的不会是匹赛马
In a frontier environment, you don't want to bring a racehorse.

698
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,450
你想要的会是匹骡子
You want to bring a mule.

699
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,020
然而火星上也不见得处处都比地球艰难
Not everything on Mars is more difficult than on Earth.

700
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,870
例如地表风就十分柔和  根本无法对
The surface winds, for instance, are mild, too weak to threaten

701
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,720
宇航员或是他们的器械造成威胁
the astronauts or their instruments.

702
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,130
火星大气层的厚度只有地球大气的百分之一 
The martian atmosphere is only 1% as thick as Earth's atmosphere,

703
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,210
所以说如果你站在地上  
and so if you're on the ground

704
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,070
对面96公里每小时的风刮过来时
and a 60 mile an hour wind kicked up,

705
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,100
你只会有10公里每小时的风轻拂的感觉
you would only feel the force of a 6 mile an hour wind.

706
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,020
我们这有个风速计  或是叫测风速计 
We have here an anemometer, or wind-gage

707
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,590
用来测量当前风速  
which helps us measure the wind speed.

708
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,400
它的设计实际上很简单
It's a very simple design really.

709
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,890
迈克尔・密史纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验所

710
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,960
上面的这些风杯在风刮过的时候 
You've got these cups on top that capture the wind

711
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,490
捕捉风力从而使得风杯旋转
as it blows by and causes the cups to spin.

712
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,120
你只用记下风杯的旋转次数 
You simply count the number of rotations of the cups,

713
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,220
它就能显示出当前风速
and it gives you the wind speed.

714
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,760
它的设计非常简单  
It's a very simple design,

715
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,850
与19世纪刚发明的时候基本一样
very much the same as the one that was invented back in the 1800s,

716
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,260
只是没有这个数字读数器
except, of course, with this digital readout.

717
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,820
劳拉・丹利
格里菲斯气象台

718
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,590
看看我们能不能测得到这的风速吧
Well, let's see if we can get some wind here.

719
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,860
有了  这里有阵风
Oh, there we got some! Oh, here comes a gust.

720
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,810
因为火星大气层较地球大气层要稀疏得多 
Because the atmosphere is so much less dense,

721
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,180
因此作用在风力计上的空气分子就少得多
and you have far fewer molecules of air sort of blowing on the anemometer,

722
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,210
地球上3公里每小时的风给人的感觉 
You would need a 20 mile an hour wind on Mars to feel

723
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,250
在火星上要32公里每小时的风才能做到
what a 2 mile an hour wind would feel like on Earth.

724
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,060
你可以看到这个速度下的风
So you can see the wind that's blowing at that speed is sort of

725
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,990
只能稍稍弄乱你的头发
lightly mussing your hair.

726
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,140
而你要是在火星上  
If you were to have this on Mars,

727
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,600
要达到同样的效果的话  
a similar wind speed that would give you the same sort of effect

728
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,270
风速大约要有112公里每小时
would be about a 70 mile an hour wind.

729
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,660
也就是飓风风速
So that's hurricane speed.

730
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,680
宇航员要做的不仅仅是适应火星的环境
The astronauts do more than adapt to Mars.

731
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,790
他们从火星表面提取水源
They extract water from the surface,

732
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,740
并用火星土壤种植食物
and use martian soil to grow food.

733
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,690
就种植食物来说  
Now, in terms of growing food,

734
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,100
最容易种植的是像生菜一样的带叶植物
the things that can be grown most easily are leafy things like lettuce.

735
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,210
在未来的某一时段人们会开始种植土豆
At a certain point you're gonna want to grow potatoes, which can

736
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,800
这能使农场里平方米淀粉产量得到极大增长
create a great deal of starch per square meter of farmland.

737
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,740
一年前在火星上  只有四人绝境求生
A year ago on Mars, four humans struggled to survive.

738
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,420
如今  他们开始在那里繁荣生息
Now, they are beginning to make a planet bloom.

739
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,680
但这只是个开始
But it's only a beginning.

740
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:07,710
近一个世纪来  电影一直有构想和希望 
For over a century, movies have perpetuated the idea, and the hope,

741
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,910
即火星上有智慧生物存在
that there is intelligent life on Mars.

742
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,610
目前这里还没有
There isn't, yet.

743
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,700
但在本世纪末的某个时候  
But sometime late in this century,

744
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,480
两位来自地球的人类的结合
two people from Earth

745
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,870
有可能诞生出首位火星人
might give birth to the first martian

746
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,370
它可能是很多新事物的起源
who may be the first of many more.

747
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,130
我们将是火星人
We will be the martians.

748
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,740
但这是未来的远景
But that's the future.

749
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,360
对于第一个任务来说  时间快不够了
For this first mission, time is running short.

750
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,990
地球与火星处于返程的同一直线上
Earth and Mars are at the right alignment for the journey home.

751
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,990
火星基地一号
返程开始

752
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,330
宇航员们希望能一头扎进
The astronauts look forward to splashing down on the warm

753
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,040
太平洋温暖的水域里
waters of the Pacific ocean.

754
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,620
正当他们向着浩瀚宇宙中
As they head back to that bright blue ball

755
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,570
那颗明亮的蓝色星球进发时
in the star-sprinkled blackness,

756
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,120
另一道光却朝着相反的方向闪过
another streak of light heads the other way.

757
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,810
这是装载有另一台返地舱的
It's the second manned mission heading for a rendezvous

758
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,810
火星探索队2
第一天

759
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,450
向着集结点前进的第二次载人探索任务
with another pre-positioned ERV.

760
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,180
载人火星探索有相当多的危险
There's plenty of risks associated with a human Mars mission.

761
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,980
但如果你着眼人类历史
But if you look at human history,

762
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,530
有一点是很明确的
you know, one thing is clear,

763
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,600
即伟业必有险阻
nothing great has ever been accomplished without risk,

764
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,560
创举必须勇气
and nothing great has ever been accomplished without courage.

765
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,440
如果我们能够在这一代将人送上火星
If we sent humans to Mars in our time,

766
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,990
如果我们能够在火星上定居下来
if we establish that little planet rock settlement on mars in our time

767
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,900
这是我们能做到的
which is what within our capability,

768
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,450
那么五百年后在火星以至于更多星球
then 500 years from now there would be new branches of

769
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,960
都会诞生出人类文明的新枝节
human civilization on Mars and on many worlds beyond.

770
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,370
这将会是未来的曙光
It's the birth of the future.
