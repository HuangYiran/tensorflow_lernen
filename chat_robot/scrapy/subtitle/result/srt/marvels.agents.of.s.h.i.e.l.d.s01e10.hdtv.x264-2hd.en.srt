00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,750
Previously on "marvel's
 agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,050
I know that...Agent coulson
was killed in action.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,860
Welcome to level seven.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,760
Some say it was only for 8
seconds,But I feel different.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,110
What is centipede?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,900
It's an intravenous
filter for his blood.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,770
Very similar to the serum Dr.Erskine
developed in the '40s for the...

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,020
Super soldiers.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,730
Listen,doctor,your product works.

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,780
It appears the volatility in
the serum has been neutralized.

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,820
Who is the woman you referred to?

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,960
Some rich girl in a flower dress.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,930
We all have to do things that make us uncomfortable
If we are ever to get our toy soldiers off the shelf.

14

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,070
That seat is taken.

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,930
Perimeter breach,quad four!

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,140
three guys just crashed the prison!

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,530
Security breach!Security breach!

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,000
Time to go.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,980
Sir.

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,850
Excuse me?

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,640
Time to go,sir.

24
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,650
It's time to go,sir!

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,420
- Mission briefing in five.
- Okay.

29
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,090
Katherine shane?

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,270
Do you know her?

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,650
We ran a few ops together in the '90s.

32
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,570
Smart,resourceful.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,940
Had a soft spot for truffaut movies.

34
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,680
Easy there,charm school.

35
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,620
According to these files,agent
shane could be my mom.

36
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,130
Even if shane was the agent Who dropped you off
at the orphanage,It doesn't mean she's your mother.

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,090
I started looking into all the
female agents Active when I was born.

38
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,310
Needle,haystack,I know.But then I
factored in age and marital status,

39
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,580
And then I built a program
to narrow down the field.

40
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,350
You're still looking at a long road.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,990
Well,it would be a lot shorter
If I could access more files.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,620
Maybe you could remove
my internet nanny?

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,930
- I'm talking about my tracking bracelet.
- I got that.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,390
- So you'll take it off.
- No.

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,530
But I asked may to look Into
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s more restricted files.

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,560
I was kind of hoping
to keep this private.

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,430
Agent may specializes in private.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,620
Let's go.

49
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,650
Nice feint.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,420
I read your file. I
know you favor your left.

51
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,090
That's in there?What else?

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,920
Nothing that's news.

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,760
You don't play well with others.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,720
I think I've proven that I can...

55
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,320
...More than once.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,090
Not here.

57
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,250
Towel down.

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,680
I need you both in the
command center in five.

59
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,930
At 0-800 hours,Three men infiltrated
the havenworth federal penitentiary.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,290
Infiltrated?More like cannonballed.

61
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,140
They were in and out in
less then two minutes.

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,190
Left no prints at the
scene,but we do have one lead.

63
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,950
centipede.

64
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,870
Seems they salvaged some of
their research from hong kong.

65
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,330
So we were right.Chan's platelets
solved their combustion problem.

66
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,250
Now they can create super
soldiers With no fear of explosion.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,640
Maybe don't get so excited about it.

68
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,210
Two of centipede's labs have been
destroyed,But they keep popping back up.

69
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,210
Now they have at least three
of these guys,maybe more.

70
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,750
Who did they break out?

71
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,300
Edison po,former marine,Expert
in tactics and rapid response.

72
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,570
He fell off the grid in '08,Reappeared
18 months ago at a diner in boston.

73
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,480
Where he stabbed a friend's eyes out.

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
With a steak knife,then
finished his meal.

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,500
That's funny.Po doesn't look crazy.

76
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm kidding.The guy
is a walking mug shot.

77
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,000
Which means he shouldn't
be too hard to track down.

78
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,800
Finding po and these centipede soldiers
Is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,400
We'll be running point,but
we won't be working alone.

80
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,130
What team did hq send for backup?

81
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,550
Not a team -- a person,Someone who
can help us fight fire with fire.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,450
Somebody we worked with before?

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,360
Not exactly.

84
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,080
Did I beat captain america's time?

85
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,570
Not even close.

86
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,870
Excuse me.

87
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,480
Agent coulson?

88
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,660
Mr. Peterson,if you could put that
bulldozer Back where you found it...

89
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,200
We need you to suit up.

90
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,480
This is a bad idea.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,110
While I have you in a
good mood,You should know

92
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,230
that skye's trying to I.D. The agent
That dropped her off at the orphanage.

93
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,030
We agreed to protect her from the truth,So
I told her you were looking into it.

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
She may come to you.

95
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,230
One mistake at a time.

96
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,920
Agent coulson,agent may.

97
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,570
Last time you saw her,you
threw her into a brick wall.

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,180
Right.

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,340
First time around,I wasn't who
I wanted to be,But now I get it.

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,450
Having all this --
it's a privilege.

101
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,080
And training to be an
agent,working with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

102
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,970
It's me trying to do
better,trying to be  better.

103
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,690
I just need you to give me a shot.

104
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,470
Everyone deserves a second chance.

105
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,140
But let me be clear --
there will not be a third.

106
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,000
- Understood,sir.
- Good.

107
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,310
It's not good.

108
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,980
At all.The guy was a ticking
time bomb -- literally.

109
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,510
Hq wouldn't have sent him
if he was still combustible.

110
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,400
They must have found a way
to stabilize him somehow.

111
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,850
They stabilize his attitude?

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,640
'cause he was pretty
hostile in union station.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,220
Well,it's not like We haven't opened
up our doors to other people --

114
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,900
People with questionable track records.

115
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,620
Not cool,but true.

116
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,910
And don't worry about mike.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,110
He's a good guy.

118
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,800
Who's been in the centipede program.

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,140
Exactly.He can give us
some superpower backup.

120
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,710
- Yeah.
- Just saying,this could easily go sideways.

121
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,130
I mean,the last time we saw this
guy,He was a raging homicidal maniac --

122
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,640
He's standing right behind me,isn't he?

123
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,160
Mr. Peterson,this is agent grant ward.

124
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,300
He's the man who shot
you at union station.

125
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,110
Fitz-simmons designed the weapon
he used,And I think you remember --

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,340
Kidnap victim.

127
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,240
- you  joined S.H.I.E.L.D.?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,870
Turns out,guys in
suits -- not so bad.

129
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,980
Look,I know union station
could have gone another way.

130
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,420
Another team might not have
let me out of there alive.

131
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,390
I owe you --
all off you.

132
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,300
That's bygones and water under
a distant bridge far away.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,470
how's your son?

134
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,800
Still with my sister.

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,060
He thinks I'm working
construction,But he's good,happy.

136
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,960
So,what do we have?

137
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,050
Not much on po.

138
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,320
I checked his previously known addresses
And old military contacts -- came up empty.

139
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,500
We've been looking for where
po might be on the outside.

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,340
Let's look at his life on
the inside -- at the prison.

141
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
See if that gets us any leads.

142
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,340
Anything on the centipede soldiers?

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,500
We found a facial recog
match on one of them.

144
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,550
Name's brian hayward.

145
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,190
Stationed in afghanistan for three
years,Then fell of the radar when he got back.

146
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,080
Only living relative -- sister,laura,Sophomore
at the university of ohio.

147
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,910
She's our best shot at finding hayward.

148
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,290
You and I will go talk to her.

149
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,910
Have may set a course for cleveland.

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,540
With all the high-tech gadgets
and gizmos at our disposal,

151
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,360
It's easy to forget about
the simple tools of the past.

152
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,110
What can I do for you?

153
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,580
I'm just curious about what you
want me to do,Where you need me.

154
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,220
Here,on the plane.

155
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,110
But shouldn't I be out in the field?

156
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,040
I mean,that's why you
brought me here,right?

157
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,210
You'll get your chance.

158
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,180
Right now I need you to go
down to the lab for some tests.

159
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,460
I'm stable.

160
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,220
They already tested me at sci-ops.

161
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,230
I know.

162
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,870
I also know that using
your powers takes a toll.

163
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,740
I need to understand your limits,For
your sake as well as my team's.

164
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,920
The lab's downstairs.

165
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,750
I have to put away four times what
I used to Just to keep my energy up.

166
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,650
Uh,and after you use your strength?

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,240
Maybe 10 times the food?

168
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,920
And I usually crash afterwards.

169
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,700
It's really hard on my body.

170
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,600
Hard body.Got it.

171
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,140
You do know we have equipment that can
take measurements.No need to do it manually.

172
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,850
my mistake.

173
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,870
Well,no matter.I'll send the
numbers to you straight away.

174
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,560
I need measurements to build you a diagnostic
suit So we can monitor your vitals in the field.

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,260
As for fabrics,how does a polymer blend With
10 layers of treated composite material sound?

176
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,430
Sounds great?

177
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,270
Yeah,it does,doesn't it?

178
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,220
Sorry.

179
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm sorry.I was -- I was
just looking at it,and --

180
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,640
Oh,no,it's okay.I'm used to it.

181
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,540
They tried to take it off
me at the sci-ops facility.

182
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,670
Realized they couldn't
do it without killing me.

183
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm afraid we're terribly curious.

184
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,110
How did they stabilize
the extremis in you?

185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
- And keep you from exploding?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,480
Oh,that wasn't them.

187
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,730
That was you two.

188
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,990
- Come again?
- What's that?

189
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,310
Your gun.

190
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,320
It somehow froze me Right at the
moment I was about to explode,

191
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,640
Helped my body absorb
the serum,stabilize.

192
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,880
Your weapon saved my life.

193
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,770
well...

194
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,440
All that,and it didn't
even leave a scar,so...

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,000
- Well,I...
- Well,I should think not.

196
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,330
Yeah,we couldn't have that,could we?

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,070
It would be a shame,Especially when
you're so,well,formed and symmetrical.

198
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,660
And wh-when did you stop talking?

199
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,110
About three embarrassing sentences ago.

200
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,990
Yes,right.

201
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,940
{\a9}***

202
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,010
"psychology of women:
Unraveling the female psyche."

203
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,350
- That's an actual book?
- It's a whole course.

204
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,380
Hayward's sister's in there now.

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,620
We'll be at the school in 10.

206
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,810
We'll catch her on her way out.

207
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,950
Whole class... On women.

208
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,410
Time was,you just had
to figure them out.

209
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,530
Solving the puzzle was half the fun.

210
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,870
You solve a lot of puzzles in your day?

211
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,830
A few. Some more worth it than others.

212
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,370
One was... Especially rewarding.

213
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,690
What happened?

214
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,080
I died.

215
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,630
I guess she wasn't level 7,sir?

216
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,560
She was a cellist,second
chair,portland symphony.

217
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,330
Saw her play whenever I was in town.

218
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,830
Ever see a beautiful
woman play the cello?

219
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,950
It's something else.

220
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,000
She laughed at my jokes,too,which
was a very nice bonus.

221
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,980
You know where she is now?

222
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,330
Of course I do.

223
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,290
I'm sorry,sir.

224
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,770
I was gone for months.

225
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,930
The avengers thought I was
dead,So I had to keep that up --

226
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,860
S.H.I.E.L.D. Protocol.

227
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,110
It's probably better this way.

228
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,430
Maybe if she'd been
part of the agency...

229
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,990
In my experience,that's
just asking for trouble.

230
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,710
Coulson told me you were helping to,you
know,Find my long-lost folks,so thanks.

231
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,780
I'm glad you're in on this
with me.It means a lot.

232
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,470
Right,I can tell
you're really into this.

233
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,190
Um,I've done a lot of the heavy lifting
already,Came up with a short list.

234
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,240
- I thought you might --
We're on a mission,skye.

235
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,060
Is this why you called me here?

236
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,250
No.

237
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,740
I was just working on this
while I waited for you.

238
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,040
Uh,I called 'cause I
found something about po.

239
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,820
Show me.

240
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,110
Po only had one visitor
during his prison stint -- her.

241
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,410
You notice the outfit?

242
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,250
Miles said a girl in a flower dress Asked him
to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. This could be the same girl.

243
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,200
Can we hear the conversation?

244
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,720
That's the bummer -- There was no
audio,but it's not a total loss.

245
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,490
I was able to use S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lip-reading
program,Because we have one of those.

246
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,600
It didn't work on the girl Because
she never looks up at the camera,

247
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,930
But po did -- once
-- and it caught this.

248
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,900
The clairvoyant does
not like  to be touched.

249
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,750
I wrote that down,So we don't
have to hear that again --ever.

250
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,480
- The clairvoyant.
- Yeah.Does that mean anything to you?

251
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,300
But it means
something to them --

252
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,410
To po and whoever that woman is.

253
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,210
Her name's raina.

254
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,990
You know her?

255
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,750
Yeah,she recruited me for centipede,

256
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,140
Came up to me at the hospital where
I did my back therapy Out of the blue.

257
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,080
Told me she could change my life.

258
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,840
Nice to cut my own meat again.

259
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,720
The steak was to your liking?

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,050
Overcooked,and the ambience...

261
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,370
We're not here for the decor.

262
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:20,220
We've stabilized the serum,added the implant,And now we need
the clairvoyant's help In finding the key to stage three.

263
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,920
I've asked before.The clairvoyant has trouble
seeing The man you're looking for and his weaknesses.

264
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,090
I don't mean to upset you.

265
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,580
It's the way of things.

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,950
This  is what's upsetting me.

267
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,690
This S.H.I.E.L.D. Teams has
destroyed two of our operations.

268
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,080
We move every few days now to be safe.

269
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,550
Which causes challenges for
our maintenance problems.

270
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,780
We can't overstate the toll
this takes on our soldiers.

271
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,120
They are drained after every mission.

272
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,130
Our men need regular
injections,constant upkeep.

273
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,760
Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D.
Has us on the run.

274
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,600
Then it's time to stop running.

275
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,660
We're running her through our systems.

276
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,580
Maybe we can get an I.D.,but we're guessing She's
centipede's recruiter and po's her latest recruit.

277
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,380
Three super soldiers dive-bomb
a prison,pluck him out?

278
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,730
He's her number-one draft pick.

279
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,210
But why him?

280
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,830
Centipede's making more soldiers.

281
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,690
Maybe they want po to
coordinate them,lead them.

282
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,450
His background's tactical
strategy.He fits the bill.

283
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,050
So,these guys have super soldiers,An
expert military strategist,

284
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,810
And a clairvoyant who
can see the future.

285
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,880
Anyone else thinking
about switching teams?

286
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,490
They couldn't have a psychic.

287
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,540
There are none on the
index.They're a myth.

288
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,750
So was thor.

289
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,860
Maybe it's an alias.

290
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,130
Run it through our database
and see if anything pops up.

291
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,040
Ward is approaching
hayward's sister now.

292
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,320
- Laura hayward?
- That's me.

293
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,840
Sorry to bother you,But I was
hoping you could help me out.

294
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,140
I hope so,too.

295
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,350
I'm looking for you brother,brian.

296
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
Have you seen him lately?

297
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,490
I'm -- I'm
sorry.Who are you?

298
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,520
Dan filch,ohio state gaming commission.

299
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,600
We're trying to contact
brian,tell him the good news.

300
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,820
He won the lottery?

301
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,010
$50,000.

302
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,670
Really?

303
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,630
And you're looking for him?

304
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,290
Don't you guys want to keep the money?

305
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,900
Sure,but we have to at least try and contact
the winners Before the ticket expires.

306
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,230
Your brother's does in six
days,so if you know where he is --

307
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,280
I don't. Sorry. We're not close.

308
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,460
I haven't spoken to him since
he got back from afghanistan.

309
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,530
Well,now you have a reason
to -- 50,000 reasons,actually.

310
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,250
So let us know if you hear from him.

311
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,530
Okay.

312
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,430
Not sure why you wanted to
go with the lottery story,sir.

313
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,960
It's a tough sell.

314
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,750
Exactly.

315
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,940
Nothing makes people more suspicious Than
a handsome man offering them free money.

316
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,360
She's making the call now.

317
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,340
Brian,it's me.

318
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,760
Some guy was just waiting for me
at school,Said you won the lottery.

319
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,270
I know,right?

320
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,000
We're not that lucky.

321
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,310
Is he local?

322
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,830
No. He's in oakland,california.

323
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,090
Come in!

324
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,180
Oh,it almost looks homey.

325
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,570
Is that ace?

326
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,270
What a cutie.

327
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,160
He must be so proud of you,His
dad working for S.H.I.E.L.D.

328
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,570
Which he can't know with
everything being classified.

329
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,760
That's all right.He knows I'm working.

330
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,150
Called him on his birthday And gave him
all the "heroes of new york" action figures.

331
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,190
nice.

332
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,710
Are you two close?

333
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,520
We're a team.

334
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,120
I'd do anything for this little guy.

335
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,500
It's got to be the best feeling,

336
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,210
Son looking up to you Who wants
to grow up to be just like you.

337
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,770
Yeah.

338
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,590
Looks like he's growing fast,though.

339
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,110
You said you wanted your shot.

340
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,940
Here it is.

341
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,220
I won't let you down.

342
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,000
- I think it's quite smart.
- How does it feel?

343
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,520
Feels good.

344
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,050
Comfortable.

345
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,690
Having powers is cheating,but
the suit's pretty cool.

346
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,250
It's perfect for an array
of tactical missions.

347
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,320
Yeah,also measures your heart
rate,Systolic pressures,and glucose levels.

348
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,620
All while providing State-of-the-art
ballistic protection.

349
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

350
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,190
- Oh,no. Thank you.
- We've never been  so proud.

351
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,400
Hayward's cellphone has been traced To an
abandoned factory about eight miles from here.

352
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,040
Probably centipede's new lab.

353
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,290
Certainly been there m.O.
-- We destroy one factory,

354
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,530
They set up another,putting
us back to square one.

355
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,880
This time,I want answers.

356
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,570
Means we go in quiet,Do minimal damage
to the facility and the people inside.

357
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,980
Ward,may,you'll go in
through the west entrance.

358
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,890
Mr.Peterson and I will enter
through the loading dock.

359
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,310
You'll run the back end from outside.

360
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,010
We're doing this just us?

361
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,620
We've been playing whack-a-mole with these
guys Since ward first picked me out of my van.

362
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,180
Shouldn't big S.H.I.E.L.D.
Be sending in backup?

363
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,890
Trust me,they already did.

364
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,510
Let's move.

365
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,460
No pressure.

366
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,570
{\a9}***

367
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,190
- We alone here?
- It appears so.

368
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,200
The only heat signatures
we're reading are yours.

369
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,340
But there's a weird electronic
signal.I'm trying to isolate it.

370
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,790
Place looks emptied out.

371
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,820
Think we're too late?

372
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,550
Fitz,dial hayward's number.

373
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,360
Find out.

374
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,100
Uh,sir,you've got company.

375
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,930
Yeah,we do.

376
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,190
Coming your way.

377
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,780
Usually packs a bigger punch.

378
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,600
Yeah,I remember.

379
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,300
What's happening?

380
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,400
His systolic and diastolic
pressures are dropping.

381
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,850
Heart rate's plummeting,as well.

382
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,980
Sir,he's in bad shape.

383
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,730
Between the physical exertion and this
wound,His vitals are dangerously low.

384
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,310
Who's behind centipede?

385
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,650
Who's doing this?!

386
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,250
I won't say anything.I promise.

387
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,860
No! Please!

388
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,580
Don't
do th--

389
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,070
That's mike peterson,one
of our first subjects.

390
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,490
He hasn't been injected with the serum
in awhile,But he still has his powers.

391
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,950
No.

392
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,520
What he has is your key to stage three.

393
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,950
The one on the left is akela amador's.

394
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,350
Hayward's is on the right.

395
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,180
Now,his prosthetic was slightly
damaged,But based on digital reconstruction,

396
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,910
We can now confirm That the
technology is virtually identical.

397
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,710
Hayward's prosthetic has the
same internal power source,

398
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,140
Backscatter capabilities,and
biomechanics as amador.

399
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,600
So centipede also
designed the eye implant?

400
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,360
These guys are serious multitaskers.

401
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,100
Who's akela amador?

402
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,060
Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent,The first person
we encountered with this eye technology,

403
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,220
A good agent who was forced
to do some bad things.

404
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,900
We helped her.

405
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,920
Kind of a pattern with you guys.

406
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,910
So then those soldiers at the warehouse Were
forced to attack us through that eye thing?

407
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,220
They were getting orders.

408
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,130
When the tide turned in our favor,

409
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,480
Centipede flipped hayward's kill
switch,Told the other guys to run.

410
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,220
Can you track the eye feed
like before,find their location?

411
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,580
Nope -- they've upgraded since
amador.Their feed's untraceable now.

412
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,840
Their technology keeps advancing
at a disturbingly rapid pace.

413
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,120
They must have endless
manpower,resources.

414
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,930
And someone with a fat wallet.

415
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,440
Po's the strategist.Raina's the
recruiter.Perhaps this clairvoyant's the money.

416
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,590
That makes sense.

417
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,570
If I could see the future,I'd
go straight to las vegas.

418
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,920
Whoever's behind them may or may not be
psychic,But they're one step ahead of us every time.

419
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,540
I need to update hq.

420
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,130
This is bigger than we thought.

421
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,080
I spoke with the clairvoyant.

422
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,520
And?

423
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,560
I'll share the information
when the time is right.

424
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,280
I would love to hear much
more than just information.

425
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,280
Will you... Tell me what he's like?

426
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,750
Never.

427
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,720
The last person who tried to learn
these things Got a knife for it.

428
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,940
I don't want to have
to do that again,raina.

429
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,690
You have such pretty eyes.

430
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,330
I understand.

431
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,220
You can't even whisper to me about him.

432
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,640
No,I can't.

433
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,480
But I did tell the
clairvoyant about you.

434
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,400
Spoke at length about your many virtues.

435
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,640
How sweet.

436
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,960
- I'll pour you a scotch.
- Don't ever do that again.

437
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,370
Brandy,then?

438
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,350
When we're out in the field,Your
head needs to be on the op,not on me.

439
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,740
Time-out.Still
playing catch-up here.

440
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,670
What are you talking about?

441
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,000
You taking a punch for me?

442
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,700
I don't need your protection.

443
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,350
You think I don't know that?

444
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,670
I took that punch 'cause
you're faster than me.

445
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,260
You could do more good on your feet.

446
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,300
It was tactical,not personal.

447
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,540
My mistake.

448
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,930
I am not some recruit who can't
separate church from state.

449
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,870
I'm on the same page as you.

450
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,020
So don't flatter yourself.

451
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,380
Sorry.I didn't mean to crash.

452
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,440
What do you want?

453
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,080
- This about that thumb drive again?
- No.

454
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,190
Good.

455
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,650
Look,I get that you don't want to help with
that Loud and clear,big neon,flashing lights.

456
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,810
But I didn't ask,okay?

457
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,950
- Coulson -- Coulson doesn't
want to tell you the truth.

458
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,690
The truth is...

459
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,540
You have to decide why you're here.

460
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,740
We have a mission,and it's
not to find your parents.

461
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,260
If you can't put aside your personal
attachments,Then you shouldn't be here.

462
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,880
Oh,come on in.

463
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,640
You doing okay?

464
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,950
Afraid I won't be...

465
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,040
Much good to you for
the next couple days.

466
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,110
That's understandable.

467
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,000
You went above and beyond at that
warehouse,Had our backs more than once.

468
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,080
Thank you,sir. But I know
centipede's still out there.

469
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,090
No,we still got a lot of work to do.

470
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,430
True. But according to your
s.O.,hard work's your specialty.

471
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,150
Said you train 24/7.

472
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,400
I want to be the best.

473
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,970
And that's admirable.

474
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,810
But you hadn't left the training
facility Since you got there,

475
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,890
Which means you haven't seen
your son since union station.

476
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,270
Ace is fine.

477
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,350
We...We talk all the time.

478
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,480
But you haven't been to see him. Why?

479
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,820
Mike!

480
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,270
Because the last time he saw me...

481
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,700
I was a monster.

482
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,090
My kid saw that.

483
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,770
You can't fix that from here.

484
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,640
And staying away,not being there...

485
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,490
I've seen firsthand The
kind of damage that can do.

486
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,910
The last thing I want to do is hurt ace.

487
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,700
He's...He's my son,but... Maybe
he's better off without me.

488
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,130
I don't think that's true.

489
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:58,880
When I took this job,I made a choice,The
same choice everyone else here made --

490
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:07,810
This life over the other one,The one with
holiday dinners and pta meetings,recitals.

491
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,470
It's not easy.

492
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,020
But if the time comes to make
the hard call,It's simpler.

493
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,310
But you have a son.

494
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,810
You have someone waiting
for you to come home.

495
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,170
You need to think about that.

496
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,850
You need to think about him.

497
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,450
Before you make your choice.

498
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,900
Hello?

499
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,370
Hey,ace.

500
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,980
Dad!

501
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,740
It is so good to hear your voice,buddy.

502
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,360
And I got some good news -- I'm gonna
get to come home and see you for a bit.

503
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,770
Awesome!

504
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,210
Then maybe you can meet my new friend.

505
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,870
She said she knows you.

506
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,950
She's here right now.

507
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,770
Ace,who's there with you?

508
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,500
Where's your aunt mindy?

509
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,820
Hello,mike.

510
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,390
Remember when I told you
I could change your life?

511
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,860
They want a trade --
ace for his father.

512
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,140
They've set a time and a place.

513
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,230
Bloody savages.

514
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,780
They want to experiment on him,Determine
how he still has his abilities.

515
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,920
And we're gonna let them?

516
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,810
- We've fought these guys before.
- We don't have a choice.

517
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,280
The instructions they gave
mr.Peterson were very specific.

518
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,310
I called hq,told them to stand down.

519
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,860
- Stand down?
- So we take them alone.

520
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,750
We should at least have a
hostage-rescue unit In support of this.

521
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,310
They said they would murder my son.

522
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,850
If we make one wrong move.

523
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,680
Any electronics,any comms,any sign of
surveillance And they'll terminate the arrangement.

524
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,170
I'll give myself up,no
problem,get him back.

525
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,360
I can figure it out from there.

526
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,640
You're still recovering.

527
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,280
We can't just hand you over
to them like that,can we?

528
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,950
Fitz-simmons have a non-electronic
method Of tracking him.

529
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,170
Simmons has fabricated
an odorless scent.

530
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,950
I have an instrument
which can detect it.

531
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,180
Works like a bloodhound,Can track
someone from over 50 kilometers.

532
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,360
After we make the trade,We'll
be able to follow mr. Peterson.

533
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,810
Buy him some time to
get his strength back.

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,740
We'll find him.

535
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,940
I don't care what happens to me.

536
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,540
As long as my boy is...

537
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,670
I promise you,we're
gonna get your son back.

538
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,600
At least let me escort
him out for the exchange.

539
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,910
Mr. Peterson requested me.

540
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,820
I'm comfortable with that,and if things go south,I
need you back here,taking point on the team.

541
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,440
Is ward in position?

542
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,910
Yes.

543
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,840
But I don't like any of this.

544
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,360
There'd be something
wrong with you if you did.

545
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,680
Once the swap happens,I'll
fire up my equipment.

546
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,590
We'll be able to track
you wherever they take you.

547
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,930
Just don't do anything
that'll endanger my son.

548
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,190
We won't,but we want to make sure Ace
has his dad at the end of the day,too.

549
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,310
Time to go.

550
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,430
My team won't let you down.

551
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,420
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

552
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,470
I'm gonna make this right,I swear.

553
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,520
Damn it.

554
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,430
Hello,mike.It's been awhile.

555
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,440
Your son is adorable,and
he looks just like you.

556
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,730
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

557
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,090
Lucky for you.

558
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,930
I have to thank you,mike,For
holding up your end of the deal.

559
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,230
Let's just make the trade.

560
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,200
Give us ace,and you can have him.

561
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,170
Oh,that wasn't the deal.

562
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,760
I'm so sorry.

563
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,050
Let me know when I can
activate comms and the tracker.

564
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,930
What's happening here,mike?

565
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:34,190
Well,in exchange for his son,we
asked mike to deliver you.

566
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm not at full strength,But
I can still crush your throat.

567
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,240
New deal!My son for your  life.

568
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,870
Sadly,my employer cares no more
for my life than your son's.

569
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,650
If I die,so does he,And his
death will be so much worse.

570
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,000
You need to let her go.

571
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,830
I told them they could have me.

572
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,220
But they want you.

573
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,650
Why do they want you?

574
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,280
I don't know,but if you kill this
woman,You'll never see your son again.

575
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,850
But how will I look him in the eye?

576
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,510
How will I explain what I did?

577
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,060
We talked about this.

578
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,780
I'm so sorry.

579
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,410
Let's finish this.

580
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,700
Dad!

581
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,260
There's his son.

582
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,060
Oh,thank god.I have no stomach for this.

583
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,090
On my mark,activate comms and tracker.

584
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,930
If there had been any other way...

585
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,820
You made the only choice you had.

586
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,790
What happened?They've taken coulson.

587
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,640
All right,call it in.We need backup.

588
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,000
I have a shot.

589
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,570
Do not engage.They'll kill coulson.

590
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,700
Stand down. I'll contact hq.

591
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,750
You okay?

592
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm fine,dad.

593
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,770
S.H.I.E.L.D. Hq,this
is S.H.I.E.L.D. Rg422.

594
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,940
We need immediate satellite support.

595
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,110
Ace,I've got to make something right.

596
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,080
Daddy loves you so much,okay?

597
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,640
Stay with skye.You remember skye,right?

598
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,320
Keep him safe.

599
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
Take care of my boy!

600
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,140
No!!

601
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
mike!

602
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,630
Where's coulson?

603
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,510
Oh,my god.

604
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,410
Coulson.

We land in half an hour.

607

Good. The sooner we begin,the better.

Whatever this is,whatever you

I won't give you what you want.

610

You will.

611
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,110
And we want is simple.
