{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}September

00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:38,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg?        What?

5
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg!        Huh? What?

6
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:42,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Get up!

7
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:43,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom and Dad have been calling you for an hour.

8
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:45,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're about to be late for your first day of middle school.

9
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, geez! How did that happen?

11
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go! Mom's about to flip out!

12
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:54,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She sent me to get you while she waits in the car!

13
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? What's going on?

14
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting ready for...

15
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:46,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...school.

16
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you insane? School doesn't start till next week.

17
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, FYI, school doesn't start at 4:00 in the morning!

18
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:57,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You woke up Manny. And if he doesn't go back down...

19
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:58,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning!

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no way he is going back down.

21
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to sleep till 6:00.

22
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby!        Go to bed. I got him.

23
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, what are you doing up making all this noise?

24
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:10,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Rodrick! He woke me up!

25
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He changed my clock!

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I swear, he was just...        Go to bed.

27
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:23,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that smell? I can't even identify it.

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,600


29
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby!

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600


31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,100


32
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:52,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy Birthday!

33
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, Bubby.

34
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Look at the size of that flamethrower!

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, first of all, let me get something straight.

36
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a journal, not a diary.

37
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know what it says on the cover.

38
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when my mom went out to buy this thing,

39
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:20,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I specifically told her not to buy one that said "diary" on it.

40
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:24,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This just proves Mom doesn't understand anything about kids my age.

41
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?        Sissy!

42
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:31,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only reason I agreed to write in this thing is because

43
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I'm rich and famous I'll have better things to do

44
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than answer people's stupid questions all day long.

45
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gregory, tell us about your childhood!

46
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you always so smart and handsome?

47
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:43,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's my journal. Now, shoo, shoo.

48
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's our boy up there.

49
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did I ever say no to him?

50
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:51,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom got me this thing

51
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I could write down my feelings about starting middle school.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm gonna be fine.

53
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:59,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my best friend, Rowley Jefferson, I'm worried about.

54
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's definitely not middle school ready.

55
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:03,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Geronimo!

56
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:10,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not quite clear on the concept of growing up.

57
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:14,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want a puppy, a kitty, a gumball machine...

58
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But anyway, this is about me, not Rowley.

59
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always figured they'd make a movie about my life.

60
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I didn't think they'd start the story here.

61
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, seriously, who wants to see a movie about a kid

62
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?

63
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:57,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three days, no shower. Smell the love!

64
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:59,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go, Rodrick!

65
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:03,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. We're just having some fun, right?

66
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, okay. So, look.

67
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom asked me to give you some advice about middle school.

68
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:12,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's real simple.

69
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:15,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. Don't go anywhere.

70
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't sit down. Don't raise your hand. Don't go to the bathroom.

71
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:24,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get noticed. Don't choose the wrong locker. Don't...

72
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I kidding?

73
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be dead or homeschooled by the end of the year, anyway.

74
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't be seen with Rowley.

75
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny, stop it! Mom!

76
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:46,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the eggs, Mom.

77
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:48,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank?        Greg?

78
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's gross and undignified

79
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:53,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I have to eat breakfast next to him on the potty.

80
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, well, it's your fault he's still potty training.

81
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look down, Manny.

82
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:01,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The potty monster doesn't like it when you look at him.

83
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just joking with him.

84
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:07,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Kiss him you're sorry and then let's get a move on.

85
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't be late for your first day of school.

86
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:29,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me just say for the record that I think middle school may be

87
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:31,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the dumbest idea ever invented.

88
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got kids like me who haven't hit their growth spurt yet

89
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:36,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mixed in with gorillas who have to shave twice a day.

90
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's juvenile delinquents and weirdos.

91
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm smaller than about 95% of the kids at my school...

92
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it back! Stop!

93
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so thank God for Chirag Gupta.

94
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:51,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's mine! Stop!        Can I have the backpack?

95
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:52,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to jump higher.        It's not yours!

96
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an excellent buffer between me and these morons.

97
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:56,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Greg.

98
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:59,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, fella!

99
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:03,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, I don't know what happened to these kids over the summer.

100
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was there a nuclear accident?

101
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Science experiment gone bad?

102
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God there are a few normal people

103
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or this place would be a total freak show.

104
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're as discriminating as I am,

105
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:22,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it can be tough to figure out

106
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where to sit on your first day of middle school.

107
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One bad move

108
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:30,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're stuck next to some idiot for the rest of the year.

109
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg!

110
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember how I said Rowley wasn't middle school ready?

111
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there you go.

112
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you wearing?

113
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:56,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My family just got back from Guatemala! It's my serape!

114
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice, huh?

115
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:04,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, class, I'm Mrs. Flint. Everybody take your seats!

116
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to your first day of middle school.

117
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:14,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember your seats. You'll be sitting here every day.

118
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley, if you had to say where you were ranked

119
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in terms of popularity from one to 200,

120
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where would you put yourself?

121
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is 200 good or bad?

122
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say you're somewhere around the 154 mark.

123
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:33,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd put myself around number 19 or 20.

124
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:37,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might even have a shot at the top spot by the end of the year,

125
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if things go the way I think they will.

126
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, who's at the bottom?

127
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys, wanna see my secret freckle?

128
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fregley. Sent home for hygiene issues at least once a month.

129
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out. It's got a hair in it!

130
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:00,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What color is that?

131
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:05,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna help me name it?

132
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, ladies! Gather around!

133
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, put the knitting down! Let's go!

134
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everybody.

135
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Coach Malone and I am your gym teacher.

136
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}P.E. Is as much a part of my life

137
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as waking up in the morning and going to the bathroom.

138
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:27,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I live and breathe Physical Education.

139
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:29,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, who's with me?

140
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:30,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready to have some fun out there?

141
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

142
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, outstanding!

143
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we're gonna divide you up into two teams.

144
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you two, over here. You, you, you, this way.

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you three, this side. Good.

146
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are going to be Shirts!

147
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you will be Skins.

148
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we Skins? I hate this.

149
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just trying to make kids like us feel bad.

150
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, kids like us?

151
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't want to get a sunburn, right, Rowley?

152
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:03,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Bell E. Button.

153
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:04,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's yours?

154
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's start off with a little game I like to call Gladiator.

155
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this one!        No!

156
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:15,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that!

157
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cover me!

158
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

159
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not good!

160
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're never going to be able to outrun these guys!

161
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:43,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have to outrun them!

162
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just have to outrun Chirag!

163
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a look, take a look, take a look

164
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:49,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the kids on the street

165
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* No, they never miss a beat *

166
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:52,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Never miss a beat *

167
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Never miss a beat *

168
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:54,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Never miss a beat *

169
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:55,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Never miss a beat *

170
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think they saw us?        No way.

171
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were focused on getting that kid with the limp.

172
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll hide here for the rest of the class

173
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I'm not playing that game.

174
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:09,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not fair.

175
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got all the Neanderthals on the same team. It's barbaric!

176
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's completely barbaric.

177
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is an intellectual wasteland.

178
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, you know, it's nice to meet someone

179
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:24,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}more interested in his mind than in his body.

180
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:28,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You girls get to jump rope. What are you doing hiding?

181
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avoiding the pain.

182
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It all starts in middle school, you know?

183
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a kid anymore. The coddling has stopped.

184
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:40,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids are now separated by intelligence. The weak are picked on.

185
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And girls you've known since kindergarten

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}won't even talk to you anymore.

187
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:49,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, well, sounds like you got it all figured out,

188
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:51,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so go back to your book.

189
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is a glorified holding pen.

190
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:57,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the way! All the way! You're like a machine!

191
00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:58,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's where adults put you

192
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as you make that awkward transition between child and teenager

193
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so they don't even have to look at you.

194
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I'm Angie.

195
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:11,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great story. We're gonna go now.

196
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? This is a good spot.

197
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a perfect spot.

198
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I survived all of the sixth grade here.

199
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I would enjoy some like-minded company

200
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get me through the seventh.

201
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that the whistle? I think I hear the whistle.

202
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to go.

203
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No showboating, all right?

204
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we leaving?

205
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could get killed out here in the open!

206
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your shirt on. They'll think we're on their team.

207
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:41,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, getting crushed is better than being seen with that freak job.

208
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:44,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, you can't recover from social suicide.

209
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never talked to a girl that long before.

210
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check that out.

211
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:05,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that cheese?

212
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

213
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:18,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good God, man! You almost got the Cheese Touch.

214
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The what?        The Cheese Touch.

215
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody knows when or how,

216
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:28,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.

217
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody knew who it belonged to.

218
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:35,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody touched it. Nobody threw it away.

219
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so there it sat,

220
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:40,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}growing more foul and powerful by the day.

221
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then one day, a kid named Darren Walsh

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}made the biggest mistake of his life.

223
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darren touched the cheese!

224
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:52,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't! I just looked at it! Really!

225
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:55,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darren had the Cheese Touch!

226
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was worse than nuclear cooties.

227
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He became an outcast.

228
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way to get rid of the Cheese Touch

229
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was by passing it on to someone else.

230
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:16,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so began the Cheese Touch Frenzy.

231
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:18,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friend turning on friend.

232
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brother turning on sister.

233
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was madness.

234
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:28,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until a German exchange student named Dieter Muller took it away.

235
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dieter has the Cheese Touch!

236
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:32,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ze Cheese Touch?

237
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vat is it?

238
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vat does it mean, ze Cheese Touch??

239
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sadly for Dieter, that fact was lost in translation.

240
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nooooooooooooooo...!

241
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:43,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thankfully, he moved back to Dusseldorf

242
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and took the Cheese Touch with him.

243
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:53,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so the cheese sits, patiently waiting for its next victim.

244
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a terrible place.

245
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No doors?        None.

246
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:24,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not pooping until I'm in high school.

247
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:29,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cafeteria, possibly the cruellest place on Earth.

248
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:33,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was about to make some kid's day by sitting next to him.

249
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That seat's saved.

250
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For who?

251
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:38,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's saved.

252
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:43,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one's saved, too.

253
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:46,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So not happening..

254
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taken.

255
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we supposed to eat?

256
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess this is where all the cool guys hang out.

257
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:18,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fregley must have bumped his head when he was little, like, really hard.

258
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay,

259
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so my first day could have gone better,

260
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but at least I wasn't humiliated.

261
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:38,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Greg! You want to come over and play?

262
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he just say to you?

263
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:49,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think my ride's here.

264
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:53,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys. So this guy says to that guy,

265
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You wanna come over and play?"

266
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Do you guys wanna play with us?

267
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? This is the problem.

268
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:05,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now I have to take abuse from these morons.

269
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in 20 years, Quentin here will be working for me.

270
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, please don't fire me.

271
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:15,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really need my measly, pathetic job scooping your dog's poop.

272
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. I'll think about it.

273
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:22,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Vanilla on the bottom and chocolate on the top!

274
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't eat this!

275
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Play," Rowley? "Play"?

276
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've told you, like, a billion times that

277
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:31,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}guys our age say "hang out," not "play."

278
00:17:31,265 --> 00:17:32,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oops.

279
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, if you're not gonna listen to me, just tell me,

280
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause if you pull another stunt like that,

281
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll be stuck on the cafeteria floor for the rest of middle school.

282
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:44,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found half a Snickers bar down there.

283
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:47,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't be the guy who eats off his lap in the cafeteria.

284
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be at the top of the food chain by now.

285
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's got to change, fast.

286
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom told me to just be myself and people would like me.

287
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:04,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would be good advice if you were somebody else.

288
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, little brother.

289
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was your first day as crappy as I said it would be?

290
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Not at all. You were wrong.

291
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was actually better than I...        Worse.

292
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't listen to me, did you?

293
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:38,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to talk, look or go anywhere, and what happened?

294
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had to eat his lunch on the floor.

295
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley.        Perfect.

296
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:45,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if nobody wants you sitting at their table,

297
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you think they want Chummy Buttons over here?

298
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:51,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was right. You're not even gonna make it out of there alive.

299
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only chance you have of making the yearbook is

300
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when they dedicate it to your memory.

301
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you wanna play Twisted Wizard?

302
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I have a better idea.

303
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he catches you in here, he will kill you.

304
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:14,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Literally, kill you.

305
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:17,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. As long as we hear the music, we're okay.

306
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know Rodrick was into motorcycles.

307
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:27,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found it.        Found what?

308
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:29,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick's middle school yearbook.

309
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:33,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thing holds all the answers.

310
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley, this thing is like a bible.

311
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:39,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See this? This is where a person like me needs to be.

312
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The class favorites.

313
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're the best in their class.

314
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These people aren't nobodies. They're famous.

315
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:55,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't have to worry about getting a seat in the cafeteria, either.

316
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this out. There's tons of things I qualify for.

317
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Most Likely To Succeed," "Best Looking," "Class Clown."

318
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They should just give that to me right now.

319
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you have to be funny for that?

320
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! We could try for cutest friends!

321
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:13,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I tell you would happen if you ever went in my room again?

322
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But your band is still playing.

323
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:20,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the bass solo, Turd Burglar! Don't you know anything about music?

324
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:23,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I came up here to get a new drumstick,

325
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:27,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now, Greg, since Mom and Dad are gone,

326
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:30,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to kill you. Literally, kill you!

327
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:32,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you.

328
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:33,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beat it.

329
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:37,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, but I just want to say one thing!

330
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, Greg, run!        What?

331
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go, Baby Hippo!

332
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to come out sometime, loser!

333
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll wait here as long as it takes.

334
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:56,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, you're dead.

335
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time out, Rodrick. I have to pee.

336
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No time outs. Only death!

337
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I really have to go.        Don't care.

338
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move over! I'm dying.

339
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you!

340
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, did you throw Manny off his...

341
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is going on?

342
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg started it. I just came in here to take a shower.

343
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:29,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's lying! He was gonna kill me 'cause I was in his room!

344
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:31,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so you peed on him?

345
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:34,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I mean, no. I mean...

346
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

347
00:22:57,425 --> 00:23:00,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, there's a lot to sign up for.

348
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:02,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could be class favorite in a bunch of things.

349
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jazz dancing!

350
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:06,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could do that one together!

351
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe all these activities. They're all so much work.

352
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:14,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Staying after school, meeting before school, on weekends.

353
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of extracurricular activities are these?

354
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of my way.

355
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who let you into this school, Greg Heffley?

356
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:24,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking the same thing about you, Patty Farrell.

357
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You listen to me, Greg Heffley.

358
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm running for student council president and I'm warning you,

359
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you get in my way, I will beat you up,

360
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just like I did in kindergarten and fourth grade.

361
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:41,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fourth grade? That one was ugly.

362
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:45,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's her problem? What did I ever do to her?

363
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:50,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patty, Patty is a fatty, has a face just like a ratty!

364
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:59,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, that was pretty funny. She needs to get a sense of humor.

365
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I need something to make me a class favorite.

366
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about class favorites?

367
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you ever say hi or hello before you start talking?

368
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:11,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.        Hello.

369
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Greg's only here because he really wants to be something...

370
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley!

371
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:19,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just saying that I would really like to nail these people

372
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it's so obvious that

373
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're only doing these activities to get in the yearbook.

374
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I like your point of view.

375
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:30,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should sign up for the school paper. We're the voice of the people.

376
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the people are mostly idiots, so I guess, technically speaking,

377
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're the voice of the people making fun of the people.

378
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, but I can't be on the paper

379
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I'm gonna be in the paper a lot.

380
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:45,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that would be a conflict of interest.

381
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the people. Got it.

382
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:55,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you believe me now? That girl is crazy town.

383
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:57,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! They have wrestling!

384
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it! I'm great at wrestling.

385
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:04,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've watched it for years, I know all the moves.

386
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:06,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tombstone piledriver

387
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chair shot.

388
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vader Bomb.

389
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:18,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heffley! Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!

390
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!

391
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:28,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Something is very wrong here.

392
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These don't look like wrestling costumes to me.

393
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:34,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to wrestling, you future Olympians!

394
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:37,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, just to make sure we all get off on the right foot

395
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and nobody gets seriously injured,

396
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:42,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're gonna teach you a few basic moves.

397
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:48,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, this is about learning the sport and having fun!

398
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. It's not a competition

399
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because everyone here is already a superstar to me.

400
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coach Brewer, can you step over here for a moment,

401
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}please, give me a hand? Thanks.

402
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:06,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's known as a speed takedown.

403
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice job, Coach Brewer.

404
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you get up and come behind me?

405
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:12,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put one arm over my shoulder? Let's go, yeah.

406
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it, walk it off, come on.

407
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was known as the arm drag.

408
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:22,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's give Coach Brewer a hand, everybody!

409
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fine.

410
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Heffley.

411
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:32,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about piledrivers and Vader bombs?

412
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is fake wrestling.

413
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:39,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is real wrestling! Let's go!

414
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I have to wrestle Benny Wells, he'll kill me!

415
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's move! Come on!

416
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, to keep things fair,

417
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:48,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've divided you into weight categories by your size,

418
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:51,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so Rottweilers over here.

419
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:53,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bulldogs, you stay right there.

420
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:55,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we got two

421
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chihuahuas. Yeah.

422
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice head gear.

423
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:03,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks. My mom let me borrow it.

424
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's see what you got.

425
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Fregley, I'll take it easy on you.

426
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I wasn't ready!

427
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:16,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody's keeping score, but that was a sweet speed takedown, Fregley!

428
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is fun, Greg Heffley!

429
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:26,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off me!

430
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:31,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!

431
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blow the whistle, blow the whistle!

432
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:37,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! Fregley!

433
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:42,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Outstanding!

434
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And let's...Let's hear it for our other winner.

435
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:50,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yay, Greg!

436
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:53,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't lose to Fregley again.

437
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:55,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I get beat by the weirdest kid in school,

438
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody's ever gonna let me sit at their table.

439
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:02,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you going to beat him? It's like he had superhuman strength!

440
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:05,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna beat him. I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week

441
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I can move up to the Bulldog weight class.

442
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:10,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then you and I can wrestle each other.

443
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready?

444
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I throw at you now?        Later.

445
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're better at riding than I am, and I'm a better thrower.

446
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:32,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, save some for everybody else, honey.

447
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't. I need to bulk up.

448
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:35,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

449
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:39,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think your body looks beautiful just the way it is.

450
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.

451
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what is wrong with you?

452
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:46,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you sign up for something you don't have to do?

453
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You signed up for wrestling?

454
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of.

455
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never sign up for anything at school.

456
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fly below the radar.

457
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That way you never raise anyone's expectations.

458
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:00,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Rodrick, for those words of motivational wisdom,

459
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:02,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but perhaps a better way to look at it is that

460
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:06,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's a chance to learn to excel at something.

461
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:09,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what could I learn at school that I can't teach myself?

462
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:12,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Greg, I think it's great that

463
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:14,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you took the initiative to learn something new.

464
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:17,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is like the first step to responsibility!

465
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:21,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My boss's son Will was smaller than you,

466
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he built himself up with the weights!

467
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. We could get you the same equipment.

468
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:31,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could train, get the right nutrition, cardio.

469
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:35,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.

470
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:40,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it would only take, like, three months.

471
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three months?        Yeah.

472
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just stick to eating.

473
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:57,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't know where you put it, Heffley,

474
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:00,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you gained 10 pounds and joined the Bulldog class.

475
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:01,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

476
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you didn't gain any weight this week.

477
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom's ankle weights.

478
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:18,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, bulldog Heffley. Meet your new opponent.

479
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:23,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? But this is boys' wrestling.

480
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever hear of Title IX?

481
00:30:25,873 --> 00:30:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her parents threatened to sue,

482
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:31,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you show her what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.

483
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:42,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! What you waiting for, huh? Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.

484
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:45,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make your move!        She's a girl! Where do I grab her?

485
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay down!        Patty, over here!

486
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off of me!        Can I wrestle somebody good now?

487
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A GREAT DAY FOR WOMEN

488
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:10,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, look who's in the paper.

489
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:16,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg! You're famous! Right on the front page!

490
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I would have pinned her, which I could have done easily,

491
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:31,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know I would have gotten in trouble for hurting a girl.

492
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why does she even want to wrestle?

493
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows? Girls are very confusing.

494
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like today, I heard someone in the hallway say

495
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt. What does that even mean?

496
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A butt can't be cute. It's a butt.

497
00:31:44,618 --> 00:31:47,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but that's what they were saying.

498
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:48,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see why girls our age

499
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can't talk just like regular people.

500
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:58,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how are you gonna become a class favorite now?

501
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:02,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two words. Best Dressed.        How are you going to do that?

502
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fashion is easy.

503
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wear a shirt and a tie, and kids are impressed.

504
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, this is gonna work.

505
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:13,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* I light 'em up before the motor starts *

506
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:17,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* I go so fast that I could never stop *

507
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:20,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Look under the hood but you don't know what I got *

508
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* I'm a moving violation, baby *

509
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:25,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Hot, hot, hot, hot *

510
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I was wearing this.        I know!

511
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:37,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to be matchers!        Check them out!

512
00:32:39,673 --> 00:32:43,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg and Rowley sitting in a tree

513
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kl-S-S-l-N-G

514
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First comes love...

515
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, maybe Rodrick was right about Rowley.

516
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I do need a new best friend.

517
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:58,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't just ditch him.

518
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:01,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, if anybody has a better idea, I'd love to hear it.

519
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IT'S AWESOME TO BE ME

520
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:05,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In this school, much like your own,

521
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:08,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one boy is about to learn an important lesson

522
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:09,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about self-worth and esteem.

523
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:12,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gag me with a spoon.

524
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:15,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That guy is so unpopular, I'd hate to be him.

525
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:19,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why doesn't anybody like me?

526
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:23,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe because they don't know how awesome you really are.

527
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:27,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brock Branigan P.I.! What are you doing here?

528
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:31,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here to solve the case of the boy who just needed to be himself.

529
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:35,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So go for it! Show them how awesome you really are!

530
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:41,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys. Do you like break dancing?

531
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is totally rad!

532
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wicked. You should sit with us at lunch, friend.

533
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:08,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet!

534
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:12,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It really is awesome to be me! Thanks, Brock.

535
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}AWESOME!

536
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's talk about what we've learned.

537
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:31,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know about anyone else, but I know what I learned.

538
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:33,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is awesome to be me.

539
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:37,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The problem with Rowley is that he's not enough like me.

540
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:40,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't ditch him 'cause he'd be lost without me.

541
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:43,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe I can fix him.

542
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that's the kind of friend I am.

543
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:50,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

544
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:53,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Making your clothes more middle-school friendly.

545
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:56,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this stuff. Too babyish and weird.

546
00:34:57,277 --> 00:35:00,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too "Why don't you just punch me now?"

547
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, a foreign exchange student?

548
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man. This one we burn.

549
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:10,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a present from my mom.

550
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then your mom is trying to get you killed.

551
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:15,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready? Steady. Go.

552
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. You look like one of the Seven Dwarfs.

553
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:25,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only need one strap. One strap is cool.

554
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's two straps.

555
00:35:27,574 --> 00:35:30,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would they put on two straps if you're only supposed to use one?

556
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:33,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the guys who make backpacks aren't cool.

557
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:35,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they were cool, they'd give it one strap,

558
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like the cool one-strap guys do.

559
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what has one strap? Machine guns.

560
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:43,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what else? Electric guitars.

561
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what else?        Purses?

562
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Joshie is cool.        Rowley, Joshie is not cool.

563
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a lip-synching pop star whose fans are eight-year-old girls.

564
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:56,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just jealous that I was the one who discovered him.

565
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:59,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you gonna listen to, Rowley? Me or Joshie?

566
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:02,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joshie says to respect your parents and follow your dreams.

567
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:05,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then Joshie must get beaten up a lot.

568
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually almost look as good as me.

569
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:17,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I great at this or what?

570
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:22,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's Bryce Anderson. Just be cool.

571
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bryce.        Yeah, hey, Bryce!

572
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:29,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cute butt!

573
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:35,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're killing me, you know that?

574
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:37,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Rowley, tonight's Halloween,

575
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our favorite night of the year,

576
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so, just promise me you won't wear,

577
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do or say anything weird.

578
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:49,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're kidding me, right?

579
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:53,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom wanted me to be visible at night.

580
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:56,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From space?

581
00:36:57,464 --> 00:37:00,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we'll hit a few houses on the way to the North Side,

582
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is where we'll do most of our trick-or-treating.

583
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:05,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we going all the way over there?

584
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:07,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's where the rich people live.

585
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:11,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They hand out, like, two, three pieces of big candy to each kid.

586
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:13,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that candy corn crap.

587
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:17,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking about full-size Milky Ways and Nutter Butters.

588
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, if we time it right,

589
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rich people get tired of answering their doors

590
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:23,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and just leave the bowl out.

591
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can clean up.

592
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, you're lucky.

593
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:32,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom doesn't let me play with makeup anymore.

594
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:35,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, tool. Loded Diper's got a gig tonight.

595
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:41,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm.

596
00:37:41,942 --> 00:37:44,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going to the North Side, huh?

597
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:46,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Takes you right past the Devil Worshiper Woods.

598
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Devil Worshiper Woods?

599
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:50,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know about that story, right?

600
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:56,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there used to be this house right here where these woods are.

601
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had to tear it down

602
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because what happened there was so terrible.

603
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:02,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened there?

604
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:07,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, a long time ago, two kids who were, I don't know,

605
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:09,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe in middle school,

606
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they trick-or-treated at that house on Halloween night.

607
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:20,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the house was full of devil worshipers

608
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who put the kids in these giant pizza ovens.

609
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:27,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they cooked them and they ate them.

610
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they forgot to turn off the ovens.

611
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the house burned down with everyone in it.

612
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:37,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd the trees get there?

613
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:40,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then they planted trees.

614
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

615
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:46,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to this day, on Halloween night,

616
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can still hear the demonic laughter of the devil worshiper ghosts

617
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:56,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as they roam the woods, looking for more kids to sacrifice!

618
00:38:57,017 --> 00:39:00,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rodrick. I need you to help me out. Like...

619
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you wearing eyeliner?

620
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:07,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trick or treat.        Susan!

621
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on door duty!        Thank you.

622
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby!

623
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, can you tell him to stop calling me that?

624
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:17,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if somebody hears?

625
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then they'll know how much he loves you.

626
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:24,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, Frank, honey, honey, can you go with them?

627
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:28,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can't. I got to guard the house in case someone tries to T.P. Us.

628
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:30,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna get drenched from the roof.

629
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:34,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, for goodness sakes, don't do that again.

630
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:35,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember what happened last year?

631
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:38,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you!

632
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:43,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

633
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought they were teenagers.

634
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I couldn't see through the bushes.

635
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:51,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My legs, they hurt from the squatting.

636
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:55,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that's why I'm doing it from the roof this year.

637
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:58,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I can see when they're coming.

638
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:02,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we go now?

639
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, go.

640
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:08,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But stay in the neighborhood.        Trick or treat.

641
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:11,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no North Side!        We promise!

642
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to stay in this neighborhood the rest of the night.

643
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:32,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That guy gave me two full-size Snickers!

644
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:36,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I tell you or did I tell you? These people have money to burn!

645
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:40,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe we got this much candy.

646
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:41,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is, like, the best day ever.

647
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:45,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, reflector dude, nice costume!

648
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:46,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks! My mom made it...

649
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:57,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that was awesome!        I saw your plates! We're calling the cops!

650
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-oh.

651
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy.

652
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:07,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run!

653
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:13,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, they're going through the yard!

654
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

655
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:20,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going? We're totally exposed!

656
00:41:23,796 --> 00:41:26,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My grandma's house!        Quickly!

657
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're coming!

658
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?        That's not helping! She's not home!

659
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:35,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bingo night.        Okay, you guys are dead.

660
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door! Get the key!        Okay. Okay.

661
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:39,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door! Get it!        Come on, let's get them, boys.

662
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're coming!

663
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!        Oh, I got you now!

664
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey!

665
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:49,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you babies!

666
00:41:51,691 --> 00:41:52,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kick your butts!

667
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:58,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? You and what army?        Whatever.

668
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are so lucky you can hide in there behind your mommy!

669
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we aren't! It's not our house!

670
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:11,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's his grandma's and she's not even home!

671
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:18,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Why would you tell them that?

672
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he just say that?

673
00:42:19,485 --> 00:42:20,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oops.

674
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now they're never gonna leave.

675
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to call your mom to come get us.

676
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine'll kill me if she knows we're here.

677
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mine will, too. She thinks you're a bad influence.

678
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's right.

679
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:39,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we're gonna have to bust out of here.

680
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have any threes?        Go fish.

681
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:50,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's that?

682
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:58,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Danger, danger *

683
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:00,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* High Voltage *

684
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:06,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Danger, danger *

685
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:08,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* High Voltage *

686
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just back off! I don't want to hurt anybody,

687
00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:19,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we just want to walk away and forget this ever happened.

688
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody needs to be a hero! Whoa!

689
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:32,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

690
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:33,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna rip off your arms

691
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and punch you in the face with your own fists!

692
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:44,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gaining!        This way!

693
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:53,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Devil Worshiper Woods! No way!

694
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:57,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Stay right there! We're gonna get you!

695
00:44:00,086 --> 00:44:02,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're going into the woods.

696
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:05,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no way I go into Devil Worshiper Woods. Uh-uh.

697
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:08,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't over!

698
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:14,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really scared!        Just keep running!

699
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:25,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that? It's the devil worshipers.

700
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:46,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys?

701
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we safe?        Yeah.

702
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:59,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we made it with still a ton of candy.

703
00:45:02,248 --> 00:45:05,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I was...I thought you were teenagers.

704
00:45:09,122 --> 00:45:11,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe next year, Pops!        Hey!

705
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:29,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So anyone else exhibiting symptoms of pink eye

706
00:45:29,275 --> 00:45:31,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should contact the nurse immediately.

707
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In field trip news,

708
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:34,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}consent forms are going out today

709
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for our annual History of Plumbing excursion.

710
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:39,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In sports news...

711
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Shelly is looking Hot today.

712
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.        Are they talking about me?

713
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:51,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I don't speak Russian.

714
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:57,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And finally, some positions have opened up for the Safety Patrol.

715
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anyone is interested, see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.

716
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's what I'm talking about.

717
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:08,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Safety Patrol. The cops of middle school.

718
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:10,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boss people around,

719
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}report the jerks,

720
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and miss class three times a week.

721
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Safety Patrol is a sacred trust.

722
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you put on this vest and that badge

723
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you become a protector of the weak.

724
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:29,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You become an enforcer of the laws of this school,

725
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because today's litterer and jaywalker

726
00:46:32,899 --> 00:46:35,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is tomorrow's window breaker and graffiti vandal,

727
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's our job to stop it.

728
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:40,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I ask you, are you up for the job?

729
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!        Yes!

730
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:46,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then welcome to Safety Patrol.

731
00:46:46,313 --> 00:46:49,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just remember, with great power...

732
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:52,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. ...comes great responsibility.

733
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you get your first assignment just after lunch,

734
00:46:56,256 --> 00:46:58,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you'll be excused from the first 20 minutes of sixth period.

735
00:46:58,392 --> 00:47:01,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that means we'll miss Algebra...Ouch!

736
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:02,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we get free stuff?

737
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:06,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free hot cocoa.        Could this day get any better?

738
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:08,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, is that cocoa?

739
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Safety Patrol only.        Sorry.

740
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You rejected the school paper, but you joined the Safety Patrol?

741
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:21,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, are you working your way down the evolutionary ladder?

742
00:47:21,782 --> 00:47:22,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

743
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:26,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Safety Patrol is the lowest of the low,

744
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:29,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the geekiest of the geeky, the Island of Misfit Toys.

745
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just jealous they don't trust you

746
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:32,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to keep our school safe.

747
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now if you'll excuse me, I need to secure the perimeter.

748
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:43,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hungry.        Keep it straight, people.

749
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:45,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Single-file line, one by one.

750
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:56,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg! It's those guys from Halloween!

751
00:47:57,884 --> 00:47:59,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do?

752
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man, just pull my finger.

753
00:48:04,387 --> 00:48:05,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God, I'm not gonna do anything.

754
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:08,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, shoulder to shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder.

755
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. Go!        Whoa, whoa.

756
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close.        Too close.

757
00:48:30,383 --> 00:48:33,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's times like these that make me realize

758
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley's pretty lucky to have me as a friend.

759
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:42,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I got Twisted Wizard Two, and a new bike!

760
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we're going to take a family trip

761
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to New York City for New Year's Eve!

762
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:51,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you get?        My dad got me a weight-lifting set.

763
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:54,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how many video games I could've gotten instead?

764
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:58,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to get out of there before he expected me to, like, use it.

765
00:48:58,845 --> 00:49:02,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, let's play some Twisted Wizard Two at your house.

766
00:49:02,082 --> 00:49:05,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably not a good idea. My dad's still annoyed at you.

767
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For what?

768
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:10,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember that secret language we made up last week?

769
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:15,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa like-pa a woman-pa.

770
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:20,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he cracked our code.

771
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:22,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should probably do something outside.

772
00:49:24,638 --> 00:49:27,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you ride and I throw at you first?

773
00:49:27,974 --> 00:49:30,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My legs kind of hurt from walking over here.

774
00:49:47,294 --> 00:49:50,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Rowley. Come on. Get up.

775
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:53,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shake it off.

776
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure the doctor was right?

777
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It really didn't look that broken to me.

778
00:49:58,638 --> 00:50:03,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's broken. The X-ray never lies.

779
00:50:05,312 --> 00:50:09,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh. What happened?        I broke it.

780
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How?        Big Wheel accident.

781
00:50:13,153 --> 00:50:14,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're funny.

782
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:16,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I sign your cast?        Me, too.

783
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna sign it, too.        Why, sure.

784
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I'm the one who broke his hand.

785
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you're a jerk.

786
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.        Does it hurt?

787
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:32,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley, you're so funny.

788
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After I stood...        I couldn't believe it!

789
00:50:36,776 --> 00:50:41,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley was eating at an actual table because of something I did!

790
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my credit?

791
00:50:44,217 --> 00:50:47,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's right handed! He can feed himself just fine.

792
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:53,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how's that class favorite thing working out for you?

793
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

794
00:51:12,178 --> 00:51:15,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realized Rowley's injury thing was a pretty good racket.

795
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:23,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be so much fun.        Hey, guys. Check it out.

796
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:25,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh, what happened?

797
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a raging infection caused by a splinter that was left untreated.

798
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:33,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want to be the first to sign my sympathy sheet?

799
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

800
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll sign it, Greg Heffley,

801
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you'd let me look at your infection.

802
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And on the X-ray,

803
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:50,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you could see where the bone just snapped right in half.

804
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:54,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had the exact same break last year, and it got all purple!

805
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool! Mine, too!        Hey, Gregory, want to sign the card?

806
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:00,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got Rowley a card?

807
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No, it's for Bryan Little.

808
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the guy who writes the Wacky Dawg cartoons

809
00:52:05,565 --> 00:52:07,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the school paper?

810
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has mono and he's going to be out for three months.

811
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:13,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That really stinks.

812
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, just out of curiosity, who's gonna do the cartoon?

813
00:52:17,577 --> 00:52:21,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're having tryouts, but the important thing is Bryan gets better.

814
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely.

815
00:52:25,552 --> 00:52:28,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bryan Little getting mono was destiny.

816
00:52:28,254 --> 00:52:31,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I draw cartoons all the time. I'm gonna win this.

817
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:44,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to go ahead and forgive Rowley

818
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:46,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for milking the broken hand so hard

819
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I told him he could work on the cartoon with me.

820
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:53,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I was thinking we could do something like this!

821
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:55,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oops, I stepped in a puddle!

822
00:52:55,915 --> 00:52:58,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least it's not an acid puddle.

823
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:00,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oy, oy, oy! It is an acid puddle!

824
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:02,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zoo-wee Mama!

825
00:53:04,324 --> 00:53:06,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zoo-wee Mama!

826
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:10,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the same joke every time.

827
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:12,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Zoo-wee Mama!

828
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:16,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't just do the same thing over and over.

829
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:18,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can if it's Zoo-wee Mama.

830
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:21,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has to be a little more sophisticated.

831
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:24,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder what is in this cute little box.

832
00:53:24,477 --> 00:53:27,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a box, it's a brick, you dumb moron.

833
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oops! I've been trying to open it all day!

834
00:53:32,986 --> 00:53:34,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can he say, "Zoo-wee Mama"?

835
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not funny.

836
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:40,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think it is. I like Zoo-wee Mama.

837
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:41,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what?

838
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you like it so much, then why don't you go do it yourself?

839
00:53:48,134 --> 00:53:51,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I will.

840
00:53:52,806 --> 00:53:54,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you.

841
00:54:04,984 --> 00:54:06,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I forgot my raincoat,

842
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm gonna need you to walk the kids home today.

843
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:13,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't. I can't get my cast wet. You can borrow my coat.

844
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Rowley?

845
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:23,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He couldn't get his cast wet!        He walks us better!

846
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:31,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

847
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:39,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh! Space monsters!

848
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:44,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're going to eat us, unless we can get into that hole!

849
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, people, move it! Now, people! We're gonna get eaten!

850
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:50,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Don't worry! I'm right behind you!

851
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!        Go!

852
00:55:04,077 --> 00:55:05,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

853
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:08,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley Jefferson, is that you?

854
00:55:09,816 --> 00:55:12,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Mrs. Irvine!

855
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:17,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kids!

856
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:27,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to eat us?

857
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:30,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And though doctors assure us that

858
00:55:30,908 --> 00:55:33,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Cheznik is no longer contagious,

859
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:37,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the cafeteria nachos bar will be closed for the remainder of the week.

860
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, what you've all been waiting for.

861
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The faculty, Student Council and editors have all met

862
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:48,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and selected the new cartoonist for the school paper.

863
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:54,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the winner is "Zoo-wee Mama" by Rowley Jefferson!

864
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:01,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?        That is funny!

865
00:56:02,502 --> 00:56:03,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great job.

866
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:07,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zoo-wee Mama.        I couldn't believe it.

867
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:11,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I the only one who gets comedy?

868
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:14,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley, will you put me in your cartoon?        Sure.

869
00:56:14,514 --> 00:56:17,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And me, too. I want to be the one who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."

870
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:20,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it!        Hey, Rowley, congratulations.

871
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:21,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.        No problem.

872
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I read all the submissions

873
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:24,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and yours was by far the best.

874
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:26,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I read yours, too.

875
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:28,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley.        Hey, Bryce.

876
00:56:29,128 --> 00:56:32,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, hey, Bryce.        Hey, fella.

877
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Everyone knows me now.

878
00:56:37,203 --> 00:56:41,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like I'm famous! Isn't this great?        Yeah.

879
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:46,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley Jefferson? I need to see you in my office, now.

880
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just took a call from a Mrs. Irvine

881
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about what happened to the kindergarteners last week.

882
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:05,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was very upset. And so am I.

883
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:09,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?        You violated the sacred trust.

884
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This...

885
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:18,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This badge is supposed to mean something, and you just spat on it.

886
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can barely even look at you.

887
00:57:20,413 --> 00:57:22,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really don't...        Just save it.

888
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:26,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are officially suspended from Safety Patrol.

889
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:29,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I expect a full apology to the kindergarteners.

890
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:31,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

891
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:45,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What did he have to say?        I'm kicked off.

892
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:47,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know what he's talking about.

893
00:57:51,077 --> 00:57:52,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley?

894
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?        Nothing.

895
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been home for an hour and haven't badgered me for any snacks.

896
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:19,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you feeling okay?

897
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.

898
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:26,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know something

899
00:58:26,979 --> 00:58:30,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if I tell the truth about it, it could hurt somebody.

900
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:33,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I don't, it could hurt somebody else.

901
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:36,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you have to trust your gut

902
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and try to do the right thing,

903
00:58:40,293 --> 00:58:44,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because it's our choices that make us who we are.

904
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:48,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

905
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:54,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was up all night, tossing and turning,

906
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:56,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinking about my mom 's advice.

907
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:59,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I finally decided to do the right thing.

908
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:03,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.

909
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

910
00:59:06,152 --> 00:59:09,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I decided to let Rowley take one for the team.

911
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:16,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not entirely sure that was the right call.

912
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:26,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how's it going?

913
00:59:27,006 --> 00:59:31,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I was pretty upset about being suspended from Safety Patrol,

914
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:33,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but then I just started drawing a bunch of Zoo-wee Mamas

915
00:59:33,747 --> 00:59:35,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I felt better.

916
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. I put you in this week's cartoon.

917
00:59:38,384 --> 00:59:41,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you even get to say, "Zoo-wee Mama."

918
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:44,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. That's really

919
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nice.

920
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:51,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, listen.

921
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:55,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kind of funny, you know, the whole Safety Patrol thing.

922
00:59:55,268 --> 00:59:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

923
00:59:57,036 --> 00:59:58,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready for the funny part?

924
00:59:58,938 --> 01:00:02,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm the one who terrorized those kids!

925
01:00:05,178 --> 01:00:06,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?        Yeah,

926
01:00:07,013 --> 01:00:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I think we can both learn some valuable lessons from this.

927
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:12,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, I should be more careful what I do

928
01:00:12,336 --> 01:00:14,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in front of Mrs. Irvine's house.

929
01:00:14,387 --> 01:00:16,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, well,

930
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:19,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you should be more careful who you lend your coat to.

931
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:26,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, Greg? You're not a good friend.

932
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. How could you even say that? I'm a great friend.

933
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:34,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were a great friend, you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.

934
01:00:34,907 --> 01:00:37,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, one thing. You can't get mad about just...

935
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only care about yourself.

936
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:42,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hated my cartoon.

937
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:47,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made fun of my clothes. You disrespected Joshie.

938
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:50,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You broke my hand and you didn't even seem sorry.

939
01:00:51,057 --> 01:00:53,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That broken hand was the best thing that ever happened to you!

940
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't call me.

941
01:00:57,864 --> 01:01:01,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't come by my house. We're done.

942
01:01:19,285 --> 01:01:21,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought the whole thing would blow over.

943
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Rowley was still giving me the silent treatment.

944
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:27,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even when I tried to make the first move.

945
01:01:32,198 --> 01:01:33,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, anyway,

946
01:01:33,325 --> 01:01:35,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was so angry at him, I didn't know what to say.

947
01:01:37,136 --> 01:01:41,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the kindergarteners finally told their parents the whole story.

948
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg? You're relieved of your Safety Patrol duties,

949
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:47,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}effective immediately.

950
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley,

951
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:53,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for showing dignity under false suspicion,

952
01:01:53,028 --> 01:01:56,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am promoting you to team captain.

953
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's a position that I held for two years.

954
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you'll honor it.

955
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:25,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Okay *

956
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:31,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* You're supposed to be my friend *

957
01:02:31,524 --> 01:02:34,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* We're supposed to get along *

958
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:39,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Hey, you're supposed to be my friend *

959
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:42,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley, my mom says it's okay for me to sleep over tonight.

960
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:44,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awesome!

961
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:46,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole thing with Rowley is,

962
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was willing to let bygones be bygones.

963
01:02:49,442 --> 01:02:51,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then he made friends with Collin just to mess with me.

964
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:53,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As if I even care if he...

965
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:58,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know what?

966
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two can play at that game.

967
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:05,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no going back, Sergeant. I need to board the helicopter.

968
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:07,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have my back?

969
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:09,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will always have your back, Captain.

970
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:13,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some friends *

971
01:03:13,733 --> 01:03:17,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Yeah, maybe I'll meet up with some dogs *

972
01:03:17,636 --> 01:03:19,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* 'Cause you're supposed to be *

973
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:21,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* You're supposed to be *

974
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Supposed to be my friend *

975
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* You're supposed to be my friend now *

976
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.        Hey, Greg Heffley.

977
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:40,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I was thinking maybe you might want to have a sleepover?

978
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:43,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. With who?

979
01:03:44,597 --> 01:03:45,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me.

980
01:03:46,132 --> 01:03:49,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, when?        Now.

981
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:53,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley, I love you!

982
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:55,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going to be best friends forever!

983
01:03:56,776 --> 01:03:59,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna have a tickle fight?

984
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's get inside.

985
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe it!

986
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley's in my room!

987
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley's in my room, Rebecca.

988
01:04:14,927 --> 01:04:17,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want to do, Greg Heffley? How about Twister?

989
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not really that much of a Twister guy.

990
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:23,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Candy!        Wait!

991
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:25,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no! Fregley, come on! Really!

992
01:04:25,671 --> 01:04:27,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really think we should save those for later!

993
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:29,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should go outside and...

994
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom doesn't let me have sugar.

995
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:34,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She says high glucose in my diet induces hyperactivity.

996
01:04:35,815 --> 01:04:37,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's so good!

997
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley, you want to jumpety-jump?

998
01:04:39,885 --> 01:04:41,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you know what, Fregley? I just remembered,

999
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:44,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an appointment, a really important appointment.

1000
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:48,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a homework appointment. Yeah, and I really should be going.

1001
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away from me!

1002
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:58,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can fly! Whoa.

1003
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:00,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How fun, Greg Heffley!

1004
01:05:00,973 --> 01:05:05,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg? Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg? Greg? Greg?

1005
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear you breathing, Greg Heffley.

1006
01:05:36,342 --> 01:05:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Gregory,

1007
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:41,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm very sorry I chased you with a booger on my finger.

1008
01:05:42,081 --> 01:05:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, I put it on this paper so you can get me back.

1009
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:00,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1010
01:06:04,737 --> 01:06:06,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1011
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:11,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, enough. I'll show Rowley I don't need him.

1012
01:06:11,944 --> 01:06:14,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he sees me in the yearbook as Most Talented,

1013
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's gonna come running back.

1014
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:22,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, since there are so many of you here auditioning,

1015
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:27,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to save time, we're gonna do a group sing of one of my favorite songs.

1016
01:06:27,726 --> 01:06:30,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please refer to the lyrics on this handout.

1017
01:06:30,596 --> 01:06:34,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will pick out the best voices and place you accordingly.

1018
01:07:36,729 --> 01:07:41,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley, what a lovely soprano voice you have. I'm stunned!

1019
01:07:42,868 --> 01:07:44,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should be Dorothy!

1020
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:50,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I can't be...        No!

1021
01:07:51,143 --> 01:07:54,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg Heffley was suspended from the school Safety Patrol!

1022
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you trust him with the lead role in the play?

1023
01:07:58,183 --> 01:08:00,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can't be Dorothy! I'm Dorothy!

1024
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Patty, calm down.        I'm Dorothy! I am!

1025
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:07,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother is the president of the P.T.A.

1026
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She can ruin your life!

1027
01:08:10,296 --> 01:08:11,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just an idea.

1028
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, well, Greg,

1029
01:08:14,144 --> 01:08:17,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your voice is too high for any of the other male roles.

1030
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:19,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you can be a tree!

1031
01:08:19,872 --> 01:08:22,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A tree? No way.

1032
01:08:29,748 --> 01:08:32,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trees get to throw apples at Patty Farrell.

1033
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't you seen the movie?

1034
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:48,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, we don't get arm holes?

1035
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we gonna throw apples at Dorothy without arm holes?

1036
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't need arm holes because nobody's throwing any apples.

1037
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:57,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not doing the movie. In my version, the trees sing.

1038
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These, my dear.

1039
01:08:59,611 --> 01:09:03,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Down the winding yellow road *

1040
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:07,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Doth she know to where it goes *

1041
01:09:07,886 --> 01:09:11,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* With her dog so small and true *

1042
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:14,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* We hope she fares well *

1043
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:18,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Yes, we do *

1044
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:27,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My tooth! I think I knocked out my tooth!

1045
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:29,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we should cut out some arm holes.

1046
01:09:29,775 --> 01:09:31,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he okay?        You think?

1047
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:48,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't this exciting? Your son's in a play.

1048
01:09:48,694 --> 01:09:52,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure. It's not wrestling, but...

1049
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at least it's something.        Come on, Toto.

1050
01:09:57,136 --> 01:10:01,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let us explore this magical path!

1051
01:10:08,347 --> 01:10:09,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby!

1052
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:13,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby! Bubby!

1053
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:14,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby.

1054
01:10:17,656 --> 01:10:20,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bubby, I think you dropped an apple.

1055
01:10:20,993 --> 01:10:21,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

1056
01:10:25,464 --> 01:10:29,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* We three trees from yonder glen *

1057
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:33,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Do spy a fair and sweet maiden *

1058
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:37,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Whilst we're rooted to our spots *

01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:42,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* In silver slippers she doth trot *

1060

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Down the winding yellow road *

01:10:45,884 --> 01:10:46,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Oh, yes. *

1062
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:50,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Doth she know to where it goes *

1063
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:51,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're dead.

1064
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:54,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* With her dog so small and true *

01:10:56,628 --> 01:11:00,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}* Yes, we do *

1067
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:03,427

01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:14,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wish her joy through journey's end!

01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:18,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing!

1071
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing!

1072
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:25,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing!        This bites!

1073
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:27,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Greg Heffley!

1074
01:11:27,926 --> 01:11:31,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop ruining the play like you ruin everything else!

1075
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:36,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make me come over there and beat you up again!

1076
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:51,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat this!

1077
01:11:51,817 --> 01:11:53,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat this!

1078
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:58,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

1079
01:12:13,906 --> 01:12:15,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd you think?        I thought he was the best one up there.

1080
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.        You know, I'm...

1081
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:27,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought Dorothy deserved it.

1082
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Dad.

1083
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got some good shots in there.

1084
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:43,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what I found in the trash.

1085
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess you threw it away by accident.

1086
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:47,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it back, Rodrick!

1087
01:12:47,339 --> 01:12:49,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way! You want it?

1088
01:12:49,308 --> 01:12:51,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come and get it then! Come on.

1089
01:12:51,276 --> 01:12:52,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it!        Come on!

1090
01:12:53,045 --> 01:12:55,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use your muscular legs! No, you can't have it.

1091
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, boys!        Give it back!

1092
01:12:56,949 --> 01:12:58,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, don't you want it?        Okay!

1093
01:12:58,283 --> 01:12:59,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for you.

1094
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an invitation for the Mother and Son Sweetheart Dance.

1095
01:13:05,857 --> 01:13:07,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew you didn't want to miss that.

1096
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:09,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like a lot of fun.

1097
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:12,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you should go. I think it'd be a lot of fun.

1098
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:15,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fun? That's the exact opposite of fun!

1099
01:13:17,002 --> 01:13:20,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This entire year has been terrible and nobody even cares!

1100
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My family, my best friend.

1101
01:13:23,842 --> 01:13:27,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sick of it. Somebody needs to pay.

1102
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:36,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Manny, I'm putting this Tootsie Roll in Rodrick's backpack.

1103
01:13:37,089 --> 01:13:41,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for Rodrick, so whatever you do, don't touch the Tootsie Roll.

1104
01:13:42,995 --> 01:13:43,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

1105
01:13:47,165 --> 01:13:50,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg? Coaster. Where's he...

1106
01:13:52,437 --> 01:13:55,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny? Where did you get that?

1107
01:14:02,748 --> 01:14:05,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my. That's offensive.

1108
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick? Rodrick!

1109
01:14:17,429 --> 01:14:19,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to talk to you inside! Now!

1110
01:14:20,632 --> 01:14:24,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead and talk. We're a band and we have no secrets.

1111
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:26,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, fine. What is this?

1112
01:14:29,641 --> 01:14:32,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not mine.        It was in your backpack.

1113
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it was in my room.

1114
01:14:37,082 --> 01:14:40,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does owning this magazine make you a better person?

1115
01:14:41,553 --> 01:14:44,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.        Did it make you more popular at school?

1116
01:14:44,389 --> 01:14:45,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

1117
01:14:46,391 --> 01:14:47,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1118
01:14:47,759 --> 01:14:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you feel about having owned this type of magazine?

1119
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:56,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ashamed!        Nice.

1120
01:14:56,101 --> 01:14:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm.

1121
01:14:59,504 --> 01:15:03,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have anything you wanna say to women

1122
01:15:03,141 --> 01:15:07,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for having owned this offensive magazine?

1123
01:15:08,613 --> 01:15:09,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, women.

1124
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, women.        Yeah.

1125
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:18,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're grounded for two weeks.

1126
01:15:18,957 --> 01:15:22,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, settle down, Susan! I think one week is plenty!

1127
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make it four weeks and I'm gonna need the keys to your van!

1128
01:15:26,364 --> 01:15:27,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My van?

1129
01:15:28,633 --> 01:15:31,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Yeah.

1130
01:15:33,038 --> 01:15:34,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1131
01:15:36,374 --> 01:15:37,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1132
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:40,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1133
01:15:53,658 --> 01:15:55,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, smile.

1134
01:15:55,794 --> 01:15:58,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this place! Wanna dance?

1135
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:01,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, stop dancing. You're embarrassing me.

1136
01:16:02,067 --> 01:16:05,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. I'm just keeping time to the music.

1137
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:07,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm begging you, please stop it.

1138
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, okay.

1139
01:16:11,977 --> 01:16:13,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, honey.

1140
01:16:14,379 --> 01:16:15,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi!

1141
01:16:15,714 --> 01:16:20,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if we're not here to dance, maybe you should go talk to Rowley.

1142
01:16:21,086 --> 01:16:23,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's time you two made up.

1143
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:25,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

1144
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:30,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart, he's your best friend.

1145
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:34,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And sometimes, when somebody's worth it,

1146
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you just have to put yourself out there.

1147
01:16:39,704 --> 01:16:41,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't know what to say.

1148
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I could go for an ice cream after the dance.

1149
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:48,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you could invite him to join us.

1150
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:49,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1151
01:16:55,687 --> 01:16:57,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley.

1152
01:16:59,057 --> 01:17:00,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1153
01:17:00,525 --> 01:17:04,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you want to go get some ice cream after?

1154
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:07,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. We already have plans.

1155
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:11,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. We do.

1156
01:17:13,471 --> 01:17:18,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fine. My mom wanted me to ask. So I did.

1157
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't even want to go.

1158
01:17:29,588 --> 01:17:30,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well?

1159
01:17:34,626 --> 01:17:36,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I'm sorry.

1160
01:17:41,266 --> 01:17:42,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

1165

01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:18,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I left my racing game at your house

1182
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Collin's sleeping over tonight.

1183
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I need it back.

1184
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:24,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No way.

1185
01:19:24,936 --> 01:19:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finders, keepers.

01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:32,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine, then leavers, losers.

1188
01:19:34,112 --> 01:19:36,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not even a real thing.

01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:37,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is if I say it is.

1190
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:39,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my game.

01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:43,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't even have that game if I hadn't told you about it.

01:19:43,788 --> 01:19:45,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't have half the stuff you have without me.

01:21:07,939 --> 01:21:09,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not you two.

1213
01:21:12,844 --> 01:21:17,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have no idea what I'm gonna do to you.

1214
01:21:17,715 --> 01:21:18,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, um...

1215
01:21:20,685 --> 01:21:22,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we gonna do?

1216
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.        We need to move this along.

1217
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:28,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My shift at Cinnabon starts in half an hour.

01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:47,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what we're gonna do. Give me the wide one.

1219
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:50,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's you, let's go.

1220
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pick it up.

1221
01:21:53,518 --> 01:21:55,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But...        Pick it up.

1222
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:12,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now eat it.

1223
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:13,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1224
01:22:13,872 --> 01:22:17,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat it or I'll shove the entire thing down your throat.

1225
01:22:30,421 --> 01:22:32,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even want to say exactly what happened

1226
01:22:32,924 --> 01:22:36,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because if Rowley ever tries to run for President

1227
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:39,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and someone finds out what these guys made him do,

1228
01:22:39,564 --> 01:22:41,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he won't have a chance.

1229
01:22:41,566 --> 01:22:42,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you.

1230
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:45,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm allergic to dairy!

1231
01:22:45,103 --> 01:22:47,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll die, and then you'll go to jail! And...

1232
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:48,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

1233
01:22:49,274 --> 01:22:51,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing on school property?        Go, go, go!

1234
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:52,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shotgun!

1235

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pete Hosey, is that you?

1236
01:22:59,918 --> 01:23:04,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boys okay? Yeah? All right.

1237
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:11,289

1238
01:23:20,838 --> 01:23:25,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Rowley Jefferson ate...

1239
01:23:25,743 --> 01:23:27,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ate the cheese!

1240
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:47,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I ate it.

1241
01:23:47,932 --> 01:23:52,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know what, people? I just did you all a huge favor.

1242
01:23:54,939 --> 01:23:56,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ate the cheese to show you all

1243
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:58,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how stupid this whole school is.

1244
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:01,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wrong friends.

1245
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:05,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wrong lunch table.

1246
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:07,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wrong butt?

1247
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:11,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all meaningless.

1248
01:24:12,023 --> 01:24:14,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like this cheese.

1249
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it. You all know it.

1250

1252

1254
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:46,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad, Heffley. Not bad at all.

1255
01:24:59,404 --> 01:25:04,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you want to come over after school and play?

1256

1263
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:43,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your yearbook. You're not in it that much.

1264
01:25:43,648 --> 01:25:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe try to get out there a little next year.

1265
01:25:46,384 --> 01:25:48,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, Patty?

1266
01:25:48,419 --> 01:25:51,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One day middle school will end and become high school.

1267
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:54,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And after that, it just becomes life.

01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:59,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all those things you think are important now won't be anymore.

1269

1271
01:26:07,672 --> 01:26:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Handing it to you is like touching you

1272
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I am way too smart
