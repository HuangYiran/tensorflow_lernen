It's 1941, the height of the London Blitz

14

有一样东西掉在了伦敦
 and something else has fallen on London.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,286
他说是一艘战舰
He said it was a warship,

16
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:30,500
他偷来的 然后把它停在了某处
he stole it, parked it somewhere out there,

17
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,157
炸弹会炸掉它 
somewhere a bomb's going to

18
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:35,100
- 除非我们出价   -  这是个骗局
- fall on it unless we make him an offer.   - It's a con.

I was conning you, that's what I am, I'm a con man.

Mummy, mummy.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,500
别让他碰到你
You mustn't let him touch you.

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,654
碰到了会怎么样 
What happens if he touches me?   

24
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:49,800
他会把你变成他那样的
It makes you like him.

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,460
好了 大家都出去 
Right, everybody out, across the

26
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:53,900
穿过后花园 从篱笆下面钻出去 快 快走
back garden and under the fence. Now, go, move!

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,994
在哪儿都能看到他们
You'll find them everywhere,

28
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:59,200
每间病房 每张床上 有好几百个
in every bed in every ward, hundreds of them.

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,693
他们的伤都如出一辙
They've all got the same injuries,

30
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,100
手背上有伤痕
scarring on the back of the hand

31
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,473
防毒面具似乎和肉体熔在了一起
and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh.

32
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:05,800
死因是什么
What was the cause of death?

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,200
他们没有死
They're not dead!

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,306
你是我的妈咪吗 
Are you my Mummy?

别让他们碰到你们 
Don't let 'em touch you. 

37
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:14,032
要是被碰到了会怎样?
What happens if they touch us?

38
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,059
后果就在你们眼前
You're looking at it!

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,900
妈咪
Mummy!

回你的房间去
Go to your room!

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,887
我的认真的 我对你很生气很生气 
I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you.

43
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:40,200
后果很严重
I'm very, very cross.

44
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,100
回 你 的 房 间 去
Go. . .To. . .Your. . .Room!

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,400
我很庆幸这句话有用
I'm really glad that worked.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,875
要是这变成我的遗言的话 也太差劲了点
Those would have been terrible last words.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Jamie...
Jamie...

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,700
为什么他们都戴着防毒面具
Why are they all wearing gas masks?

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,100
他么没有戴
They're not.

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
那些面具是他们的血肉之躯
Those masks are flesh and bone.

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,892
你的骗局是怎样的   
How was your con supposed to work?   

52
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,462
很简单 真的
Simple enough, really.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,520
搞些无害的太空垃圾残片
Find some harmless piece of space junk,

54
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:27,800
让最近的时间特工
let the nearest Time Agent

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,814
追踪到地球
track it back to Earth,

56
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,800
让他相信那价值很高 然后出个价
convince him it's valuable, and name a price.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,862
当他付了一半的首付 啊噢
When he's put 50% up-front, oops,

58
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:35,800
一颗德国炸弹从天而降 永远得炸了它
a German bomb falls on it, destroys it forever.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,263
他永远都不会看到自己买了什么
He never gets to see what he's paid for,

60
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:39,800
永远都不会知道自己买了一堆垃圾
never knows he's been had.

61
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,239
然后我用他给我的钱请他喝一杯
I buy him a drink with his own money

62
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,400
感叹下狗屎运
and we discuss dumb luck.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
完美的 不露破绽的骗局
The perfect, self-cleaning con.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,869
没错 很高明
 Yeah. Perfect.

65
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:48,875
伦敦闪电战战最适合扫尾工作了
The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners.

66
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,864
庞培也很好 如果你想去旅游的话
Pompei is nice, if you want to make a vacation.

67
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,864
{\a6}庞培：意大利古城 曾火山爆发被淹灭

68
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,631
但你最好在闹钟上设下火山日
But you gotta set your alarm for volcano day.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,800
看来有人不喜欢我的话
Getting a hint of disapproval.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,146
看看这间房间
Take a look around the room.

71
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:03,600
这就是你所谓的无害的太空垃圾残片的杰作
This is what your piece of harmless space junk did.

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,000
那是艘烧毁的医用运输船 里面什么都没有
It was a burnt-out medical transporter, it was empty.

73
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
Rose
Rose!

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,623
我们要走了吗
Are we getting out of here?

75
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:10,900
我们上楼去
We're going upstairs.

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,631
我甚至设置了飞行程序
I even programmed the flight computer so

77
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:13,635
它不会坠落到有生命体的地方 
it wouldn't land on anything living. 

78
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:14,461
我没有伤害任何人
I harmed no-one!

79
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,400
我不知道发生了什么 但相信我 与我无关
I don't know what's happening, but believe me, I had nothing to do with it.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,090
告诉你吧
I'll tell you what's happening.

81
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,000
你忘记设你的闹钟了 
You forgot to set your alarm clock.

82
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,400
- 今天是火山日   - 那是什么
- It's Volcano Day!   - What's that?

83
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
警报解除
The all clear.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,800
但愿如此
I wish.

85
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,100
啊
Ah!

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400

你有爆破工具吗
You got a blaster?

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,500
当然有
Sure.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,200
你的太空垃圾坠落的那个晚上 有人受伤了
The night your space junk landed, someone was hurt.

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,500
这就是他被带来的地方
This is where they were taken.

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,432
发生了什么   
What happened?   

97
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,286
打开它 我们进去找答案
Let's find out. Get it open.

Villengard武器工厂制造
Weapon factories of Villengard.

101

- 你去过那个工厂   - 以前去过
- You've been to the factories?   - Once.

102
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,490
这家工厂现在已经不在了 废弃了 
They're gone now, destroyed.  Main reactor

103
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,000
主反应堆达到临界点 基本都蒸发了  
went critical - vaporised the lot. 

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
我说了 以前
Like I said, once.

105

118
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,700
我想这解释了他为什么叫"妈咪"
I suppose this explains "Mummy"?

119
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,200
一个小孩怎么能做到这些
How could a child do this?

120
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,860
你知道你在哪儿吗

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,714
总是说 你是我的妈咪吗
Always, " Are you my mummy?"

134
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,000
就好像他不知道自己的妈妈是谁
 Like he doesn't know.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
妈咪
Mummy.

136
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,250
他怎么会不知道 
Why doesn't he know?

警察正在来的路上
The police are on their way.

140
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,772
这张桌上的食物都是我买的
I pay for the food on this table.

141
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:28,500
那些食物 都是我的血汗钱
The sweat on my brow, that food is.

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,300
我的血汗钱
The sweat on my brow!

143
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
您还要点什么呀
Anything else you'd like?

144
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,200
要不要我把整幢房子都给您啊
I've got a whole house here.

145
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,700
还有什么是您要的呢
Anything else you'd like to help yourself to?

146
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,100
对了
Yeah.

147
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
我要一把钢丝钳 谢谢
I'd like some wire-cutters, please.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,830
可以剪断带刺铁丝网的那种
Something that can cut through barbed wire.

149
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,261
噢 还要一个手电筒
 Oh, and a torch.

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
不要露出那副表情 Lloyd先生
Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd...

151
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
我知道你这儿工具多的是
I know you got plenty of tools in 'ere,

152
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,100
我注意你这幢楼好久了
I've been watching this house for ages.

153
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,300
我还想再看看你厨房里的橱柜
And I'd like another look round your kitchen cupboards.

154
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,232
第一次太匆忙了 我想看看有没有漏下什么 
I was in an 'urry the first time, I wanna see if there's anything I missed. 

155
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:57,900
这张桌上的食物...
The food on this table...

156
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,700
有很多 是不是 Lloyd先生
Is an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mr Lloyd?

157
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,800
比别人家的多了好多
A lot more than on anyone else's table.

158
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,708
半条街的人都以为你的太太
Half this street thinks your missus

159
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,500
和Haverstock先生 那个屠夫有染
must be messing about with Mr Haverstock, the butcher.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,700
但她没有 是不是 
But she's not, is she?

161
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
你才是出墙的那个

 And I'd like to use your bathroom before I leave, please.

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,300
哦 瞧瞧
Oh, look!

166
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,300
都流汗了
There's the sweat on your brow!

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,928
妈咪 求你了 妈咪 妈咪
Mummy? Please, Mummy? Mummy?

168
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,600
博士?
Doctor?

169
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,473
- 你们能感觉到吗   - 感觉到什么
- Can you sense it?   - Sense what?

170
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,500
答案触手可得
Coming out of the walls.

171
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
- 你们感觉得到吗   - 妈咪
- Can you feel it?   - Mummy?

172
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,700
人类滑稽的小脑袋 你们怎么靠这个混的
Funny little human brains! How do you get around in those things?

173
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,400
他有压力的时候 就喜欢黑别的种族 
When he's stressed, he likes to insult species.

174
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,600
Rose 我在思考
Rose, I'm thinking!

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,992
自己犯傻的时候
Cuts himself shaving, he does

176
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,200
也得先把别的种族说一顿
half an hour on life-forms he's cleverer than.

177
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,100
被炸后的废墟处 有一群流浪的孩子
There are these children. Living rough, round the bomb sites.

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,927
他们会在空袭间隙出来找吃的
They come out during air raids looking for food. 

179
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,302
妈咪 求你了
Mummy, please?

180
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,029
假设在那个东西 
Suppose they were there when this thing, 

181
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,122
不管那是什么 坠落的时候 他们就在那儿
whatever it was, landed.

182
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,100
那是艘医用船 完全无害的
It was a med-ship, it was harmless!

183
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,443
你就矫情吧
You keep saying harmless.

184
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,517
假设其中一个孩子被感染了 变异了
Suppose one of them was affected, altered.

185
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:03,400
变异成什么了
Altered how?

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,107
我在这儿
I'm here!

187
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,500
它在害怕
It's afraid,

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
它怕极了 而且很强大
terribly afraid. And powerful. . .

189
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,000
它现在还没发现 但总有一天会的
it doesn't know it yet. But it will do.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
它有天神的力量 但我刚刚我把它送回了房间
It's got the power of a god and I just sent it to its room!

191
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
- 博士   - 我在这儿哦
- Doctor...   - I'm here!

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,900
- 你看得见我吗   - 那是什么声音
- Can't you see me?   - What's that noise?

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,800
磁带放完了 大约30秒之前就放完了
End of the tape. It ran out about 30 seconds ago.

194
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,943
我在这里 你看到我了吗
I‘m here now, can't you see me? 

195
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,800
我把它送回了房间
I sent it to its room.

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
这就是它的房间
This is its room!

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
你是我的妈咪吗
Are you my mummy?

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
- 妈咪   - 博士
- Mummy?   - Doctor?

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
好吧 听我口令 
OK, on my signal,

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,050
- 开门准备... 
- make for the door... 

201
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,800
- 妈咪   - 冲啊
  - Mummy?   - Now!

202
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:52,300
妈咪
Mummy?

203
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,800
快走 别扔下香蕉
Go, now, don't drop the banana!

204
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,900
- 为什么   - 富含钾离子
- Why not?   - Good source of potassium!

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,300
给我
Gimme that!

206
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,000
妈咪
Mummy?

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
数码回复 身手不错
Digital rewind. Nice switch.

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,042
Villengard香蕉林产的 
It's from the groves of Villengard

209
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:11,800
我觉得还挺对等的
thought it was appropriate.

210
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,543
Villengard的中心真的有一片
There's really a banana grove in the

211
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:14,889
- 香蕉林吗 是你干的吗 
- heart in Villengard? And you did that? 

212
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,100
香蕉可好了
Bananas are good.

213
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,800
博士
Doctor!

214
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
快跑
Come on!

215
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,400
妈咪
Mummy!

216
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,910
它把我们堵在这里好抓我们
It's keeping us here till it can get at us!

217
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:37,808
是它在控制他们吗
It's controlling them?

218
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:38,500
它就是他们
It is them.

219
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
它是这间医院中每个生命体
It's every living thing in this hospital.

220
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,653
好吧 这玩意可以当成音速爆破器使
OK. This can function as a sonic blaster,

221
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:45,700
音速炮和一个三倍率的音速分解器使用
a sonic cannon and it's a triple-enfolded sonic disruptor.

222
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,102
博士 你有什么
Doc, what you got?

223
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,000
我有一个 呃 音速 算了 没什么
I've got a sonic, uh,. . . Never mind.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,719
你说什么
What?

225
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,100
这好歹也是音速的 好啦 别讨论这个了
 It's sonic, OK, let's leave it at that.

226
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,237
分解器 火炮 你的是什么
Disruptor, cannon, what?

227
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,058
我这个是音速的
It's sonic,

228
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,800
货真价实的音速 我全副武装
totally sonic, I am sonic-ed up!

229
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,200
- 一个音速的什么   - 起子
- A sonic what? - Screwdriver!

230
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
走下面吧
Going down!

231
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,524
博士 你还好吗
Doctor, are you OK?

232
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:11,700
你能提前打个招呼吗
Could've used a warning.

233
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,200
真感激不尽
Oh, the gratitude!

234
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,900
谁有个音速起子的
Who has a sonic screwdriver?

235
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,600
- 我   - 灯呢
- I do! - Lights?

236
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,221
谁看了音速起子之后会觉得
Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks,

237
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,100
哈 这实在是彻彻底底的音速武器啊
"Ooh-hoo this could be a little more sonic?"

238
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
这里肯定有个电灯开关
There's gotta be a light switch.

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,900
你从来不觉得长夜漫漫 你从来没装过柜子吗
Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?

240
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,000
妈咪
Mummy!

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,500
- 到门口去   - 妈咪 妈咪 妈咪
- Door!   - Mummy? Mummy? Mummy?

242
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,800
- 该死   - 妈咪
- Damn it! - Mummy?

243
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,624
这些特殊功能实在太耗电池了
It's the special features, they drain the battery. 

244
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:36,700
电池
The battery?!

245
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
这实在是太废柴了
It's so lame!

246
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,116
我原本打算再弄一个来的呢
I was going to send for another one.

247
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,300
但有人把工厂给炸了
But somebody's gotta blow up the factory.

248
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
我懂的   我见到他的第一天
I know. First day I met him,

249
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:46,543
他就把我的工作弄丢了  
he blew my job up. 

250
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,100
这就是他与人沟通的方式
That's how he communicates.

251
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,076
好了 那门应该能挡一会儿
OK, that door should hold it for a bit.

252
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,800
门   墙都挡不住他们
The door? The wall didn't stop it!

253
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,955
那他们总得先找到我们 
It's got to find us first! 

254
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,300
来吧 找点有用的东西
Come on. Assets!

255
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,585
呃 我有一根香蕉
Well, I've got a banana

256
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,100
必要的时候 你可以组装几个架子出来
and in a pinch you could put up some shelves.

257
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,281
窗户呢 有栏杆 跳下去绝对找死
Window? Barred. Sheer drop outside,

258
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,400
- 七层楼高   - 没有别的出口了
- seven storeys. - And no other exits.

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,267
所以 有用物品讨论就此结束了 
Well, the assets conversation went in a flash, 

260
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,300
是不是
didn't it?

261
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,381
那你是在哪儿把她救上来的
So where'd you pick this one up, then?

262
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:07,900
博士
 Doctor!

263
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,789
她吊在一个拦截气球上
She was hanging from a barrage balloon,

264
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,600
我有一艘隐形飞船 而我从不放过任何机会
I had an invisible space ship. . . I never stood a chance.

265
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,200
好吧 首先 我们得离开这儿
OK! One. . . We've gotta get out of here.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,300
但是 我们没办法离开这儿 我有漏了什么吗
Two. . .We can't get out of here. Have I missed anything?

267
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,900
是的
Yeah.

268
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
Jack刚才不见了
Jack just disappeared.

269
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,679
你们在想什么 都在这儿做什么
Thought as much. What are all of you doing 'ere?

270
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,100
每晚都要换地方 我说了多少遍了
Different house every night, I told ya!

271
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,763
我们以为你死了 或者跑掉了
We thought you were dead or you'd run off.

272
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:41,300
我没这么想 我知道你一定会回来找我们的
I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us.

273
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,900
我们在破烂堆里找到旧东西
Found that old thing in the junk.

274
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,337
他现在好像能写字了
Thinks he's can write now. 

275
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,500
我在给我爸写信呢
Writing a letter to me dad.

276
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,100
你都不知道你爸现在在哪儿
You don't even know where your dad is.

277
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,322
还有你准备怎么把它寄出去
And how you gonna send it? 

278
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,700
我不知道 把它封在一个信封里
I dunno, stick it in an envelope.

279
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,049
你连读和写都不行
You can't even read or write.

280
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,600
没有必要 我有台打字机
I don't need to, I've got a machine!

281
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,800
你能不能别再制造噪音了
Will you stop making that noise? !

282
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,500
对不起 Jim
I'm sorry, Jim.

283
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,800
你继续吧 如果你想的话就给你爸写封信吧
On you go, you write a letter to your dad if you want to.

284
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,383
我知道我们该转移了
I know we should've went somewhere else,

285
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,000
但是我们需要你 比如 为我们出谋划策
but we need you, see, for the thinking.

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
那我要是不在这儿呢
What if I wasn't 'ere?

287
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
要是有一天晚上我再也没回来呢
What if one night I didn't come back for ya?

288
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,000
战事胶着 人们都逃难去了
There's a war on, people go out.

289
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,454
不是所有人都能回得来的 
They don't always come back. 

290
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:32,400
这时有发生 那你要怎么做呢
It happens. What would you do then?

291
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
这原来是剪线钳
They're wire cutters.

292
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,311
我要你好好想想
I need you to think about that.

293
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,300
总得有人照看一切
Someone's gotta look after this lot.

294
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,741
为什么 你要去哪儿
Why? You going somewhere?

295
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:50,500
废墟
The bomb site.

296
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,000
在火车站旁边的那个
The one at the railway station.

297
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,400
- 为什么   - 那个孩子
- Why?   - The Child.

298
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,298
那就是他被杀的地方
That's where he was killed.

299
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,279
那就是一切开始的地方 
That's where it all started. 

300
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,200
我得弄清楚究竟是怎么回事
And I'm gonna find out how.

301
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,878
他会找上你的 接着他就会来找我们
He'll get you. And then he'll come for us.

302
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,600
- 他总是跟着我们   - 不是的
- He always comes for us! - No.

303
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Ernie 不是的
Ernie, he doesn't.

304
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,600
他总是跟着我
He always comes after me.

305
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,900
有些事情我没有告诉你们
There are things I haven't told ya.

306
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,900
有些事情我难以启齿
Things I can't tell ya.

307
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,200
只要你们跟我在一起
As long as you're with me,

308
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
你们就有危险 即使现在 坐在这
you're in danger. Even right now,sitting here

309
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,507
你们因为我而身处险境
you're in danger because of me.

310
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:25,600
是你带着我们逢凶化吉
You're the one that keeps us safe.

311
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,000
你这么想吗 Ernie
You think so, Ernie?

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,700
那么告诉我
Then answer this.

313
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,400
Jim就坐在你旁边
Jim is sitting there right next to ya. . .

314
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
那是谁在打字
.So who's typing?

315
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,132
他来了吗
Is he coming?

316
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,900
Ernie 只要你们和我在一起
Ernie, as long as you're with me. . .

317
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
他就如影随形
he's always coming.

318
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,400
全是蔬菜 快吃吧
Plenty of greens. And chew your food!

319
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,400
好吧 他就这样凭空消失了
OK, so he vanished into thin air.

320
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,000
为什么做这种事情的总是帅哥
Why is it always the great-looking ones who do that?

321
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,100
我在努力不把你这话看成是对我的侮辱
I'm making an effort not to be insulted.

322
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,000
呃 我的意思是 男人
I mean. . . Men.

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,500
哦 谢谢 这样感觉好多了
OK, thanks, that really helped.

324
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,700
Rose 博士 能听见我说话吗
Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me?

325
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,300
我用了紧急心灵传输回到了船上
Back on my ship. . . Used the emergency teleport.

326
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,025
抱歉没办法带上你们
Sorry I couldn't take you,

327
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:37,900
它安全锁定了我的分子结构
it's security-keyed to my molecular structure.

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,716
我正在努力呢
I'm working on it.

329
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,200
你怎么跟我们说话的
How are you speaking to us?

330
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,967
Om-Com 有了它只要给我个通讯设备
Om-Com I can call anything

331
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,100
我就能和任何人说话
 with a speaker grill.

332
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,744
多么惊人的巧合啊
Now there's a coincidence!

333
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:45,603
怎么了
What is?

334
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:47,400
那个孩子也可以做到   - 他能吗
 The Child can Om-Com too. - It can?

335
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,400
只要带有通讯设备的东西
Anything with a speaker grill.

336
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,787
甚至连Tardis上的电话
Even the TARDIS phone. 

337
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,597
什么 你的意思是那个孩子可以打电话给我们
What, you mean the Child can phone us?

338
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,794
我能听到你们说话哦 
And I can hear you. 

339
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:59,300
我来找你咯 来找你咯
Coming to find you. Coming to find you!

340
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,800
博士 你听见了吗
Doctor, can you hear that?

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,161
响亮清晰 
Loud and clear. 

342
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,900
我来试着屏蔽信号 至少我能做到这点
I'll try to block out the signal. Least I can do.

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,700
妈妈 我要来找你咯
'Coming to find you, Mummy.'

344
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,700
还记得这个吗 Rose
Remember this one, Rose?

345
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,400
我俩专属的歌
Our song.

346
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,400
{\a6} Glenn Miller--Moonlight serende

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,900
你在做什么
What you doing?

348
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,432
试着与混凝土形成共振
Trying to set up a resonation

349
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:06,600
让栏杆松动
pattern in the concrete, loosen the bars.

350
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,543
你认为他不会回来了 是吗
You don't think he's coming back, do ya?

351
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:09,800
我用我的命跟你打赌
Wouldn't bet my life.

352
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,150
你为什么不相信他 
Why don't you trust him?

353
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,000
为什么你那么相信他
 Why do you?

354
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,900
他救了我的命 讨人喜欢 一定用了不少牙线
Saved my life. Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing.

355
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,800
我相信他因为他有点像你
I trust him cos he's like you.

356
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,300
除了会约会和跳舞
Except with dating and dancing.

357
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
怎么了
What?

358
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,400
- 你刚才假设我   - 什么
- You just assume I'm. . . - What?

359
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
你真的认为我不会 跳舞
You just assume I don't. . .Dance.

360
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,700
什么 难道你是想告诉我 你
What? Are you telling me you do. . .

361
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,200
- 真的会跳舞   - 我都900岁了
- dance?   - 900 years old, me.

362
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,151
我一直四处旅行 我想你可以
I've been around. I think you can

363
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:40,635
假设我以前跳过舞  
 assume at some point I've danced. 

364
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:41,900
- 就凭你   - 有问题吗
- You? ! - Problem?

365
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,700
你要是跳舞了 那宇宙还不炸翻天了
Doesn't the universe implode or something if you dance?

366
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
我不想自夸 但我还是有两下子的
Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't wanna boast.

367
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,300
你有两下子
You've got the moves?

368
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,600
跳一段给我看看
Show me your moves!

369
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,600
Rose 我在尝试和混凝土建立共振呢
Rose, I'm, I'm trying to resonate concrete.

370
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Jack会回来的 他会救我们出去的
Jack'll be back. He'll get us out.

371
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,300
来吧 世界不会因为博士跳了舞而终结的
So come on. The world doesn't end cos the Doctor dances.

372
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,700
- 拦截气球   - 你说什么
- Barrage balloon? - What?

373
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,141
你吊在一只拦截气球上
You were hanging from a barrage balloon.

374
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,500
哦 是啊
Oh, yeah.

375
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,380
就在你丢下我两分钟之后
About two minutes after you left me.

376
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,000
在伦敦几千英尺的高空上
Thousands of feet above London.

377
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,000
正值德国的空袭 而我的胸前挂着英国国旗
Middle of a German air raid, Union Jack all over my chest!

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,860
我和形形色色的人一起旅行过
I've travelled with a lot of people,

379
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,600
但你总能创造新的危险记录
but you're setting new records for jeopardy friendly.

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
这就是你跳的舞   我可是会好好记下的
Is this you dancing? Cos I've got notes.

381
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,263
吊在一根绳子上
Hanging from a rope.

382
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:45,850
悬在离地几千英尺的伦敦上空 
Thousands of feet above London. 

383
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,800
却没有被割伤 连淤青也没有
Not a cut, not a bruise.

384
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,000
是啊 杰克上校把我治好了
Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up.

385
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
我们现在改叫他Jack上校了啊
We're calling him Captain Jack now?

386
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,300
呃 他叫Jack 他是名上校
Well, his name's Jack, and he's a captain.

387
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,173
不是真的上校 Rose
He's not really a captain, Rose!

388
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,200
你知道我怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

389
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,700
我认为你在吃上校的醋
I think you're experiencing captain envy.

390
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,600
你的脚就接在你的腿上
You will find your feet at the end of your legs.

391
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,778
你也许可以试着挪个步子
You may care to move 'em.

392
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,900
即使他曾是个上校 那他现在也已经被解职了
If ever he was a captain he's been defrocked.

393
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,500
是吗 我怎么没听说过
Yeah? Shame I missed that.

394
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,200
实际上是我自己退的
Actually I quit.

395
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,200
不过没人拿走我的衣服
Nobody takes my frock.

396
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
大多数人在被心灵传输的时候会察觉到
Most people notice when they've been teleported.

397
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,800
你们总是那么有趣 对不起我来迟了
You guys are so sweet. Sorry about the delay.

398
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,980
我得把nav-com下线了
Had to take the nav-com

399
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:23,000
才能撤销心灵传输的安全协议
off-line to override the teleport security.

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,319
你要用10分钟撤销你自己的协议
You can spend ten minutes overriding your own protocols?

401
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,100
也许你该记住这是谁的船
Maybe you should remember whose ship it is!

402
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,900
是啊 她是多么的迷人
Oh, I do. She was gorgeous.

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,600
就像我告诉她的那样
Like I told her. . .

404
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
五分钟后回来
be back in five minutes.

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,885
这是艘Chula舰
This is a Chula ship.

406
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,500
是的 就像那艘医药用品运输舰
Yeah, just like that medical transporter.

407
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,800
不过只有这个是危险的
Only this one is dangerous.

408
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
它们就是把我手治好的东西
They're what fixed up my hands up.

409
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,000
Jack叫它们 呃  
Jack called them, um. . . 

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Nanobots吗
Nanobots?

411
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,300
还是Nanogenes 
Nanogenes? 

412
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,867
是的,应该是Nangenes 
Nanogenes, yeah.

413
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:46,576
亚原子机器人
Subatomic robots.

414
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:48,100
这里有几百万个
There's millions of them in here.

415
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,600
看见了吗 当我登陆控制台的时候
See? Burned my hand on the console

416
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
我的手烧伤了  现在全好了
when we landed.  All better now. 

417
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:53,500
当船舱封闭时 他们就会被激活
They activate when the bulkhead's sealed,

418
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,000
检查你身体的受伤情况 任何伤口都能治愈
check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws.

419
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
带我们到坠落地去
Take us to the crash site.

420
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,700
我需要看看你的太空垃圾
I need to see your space junk.

421
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,000
等我登陆nav-com
Soon as I get the nav-com back on line.

422
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,600
你们请自便
Make yourselves comfortable.

423
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,100
继续你们刚才在做的事情
Carry on with whatever it was you were. . .Doing.

424
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,716
我们在谈论跳舞 
We were talking about dancing. 

425
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,900
不仅仅是在谈吧
It didn't look like talking.

426
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
也不像是跳舞啊
Didn't feel like dancing.

427
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
站住 别动
Halt! Don't move!

428
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,377
所以你曾是一位时间特工 
So you used to be a Time Agent,

429
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:38,600
而现在你却想忽悠他们
 and now you're trying to con 'em?

430
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,323
我也没那么坏
If it makes me sound any better,

431
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,342
因为我不是为了钱 
it's not for the money.

432
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,100
那是为了什么
 For what?

433
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,200
当我还在为他们干活的时候 一天早上我醒来
Woke up one morning when I was still working for them,

434
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,592
发现他们偷走了我两年的记忆   
found they'd stolen two years of my memories. 

435
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:48,400
我想要回我的记忆
I'd like them back.

436
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,000
他们偷走了你的记忆
They stole your memories?

437
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,100
整整两年
Two years of my life.

438
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
我都不知道自己做过什么
No idea what I did.

439
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,048
你那个朋友好像不相信我
Your friend over there doesn't

440
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,100
不过以我所见 他这么做是对的
trust me and for all I know, he's right not to.

441
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,700
好吧   我们该走了
OK! We're good to go!

442
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,400
坠落地点
The crash site?

443
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,207
不用起来了 你感觉好点没 
As you were. You feeling any better?  

444
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:08,700
只是碰了一下 长官
Just a touch, sir.

445
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,400
把她拷在Jenkins能看着的地方
Chain her up where Jenkins can keep an eye on her.

446
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
不  别把我留这儿  别和他一起
No! Not in here! Not with him.

447
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,800
如果不想待这儿就别闯进来啊
You shouldn't have broken in here if you didn't want to stay.

448
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
你不明白  别把我留他这儿
You don't understand! Not with him!

449
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,500
这里是限制区 小姐
This is a restricted area, Miss.

450
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,886
你可以在这儿稍微待一会儿
You can sit here for a bit,

451
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,300
我们过会要问你一些问题
we're going to have to ask you a few questions.

452
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
发现了这些 长官
Found these, sir.

453
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,900
很专业啊  有点儿专业过头了
Very professional. A little bit too professional.

454
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,645
看来并不是意外闯入
Didn't just drop in by accident,

455
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:35,500
- 对不对   - 我弟弟死在这儿了
- then, did you?  - My little brother died here.

456
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,200
我想知道到底是什么把他害死的
I wanted to find out what killed him.

457
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,200
带些人 检查一下围栏有没有其他洞口
Take the men, check the fence for any other breaches.

458
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,324
并且搜索整片区域 她可能不是一个人来的
And search the area, she may not have come here alone.

459
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:43,877
是 长官
Yes, sir!

460
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,800
拜托了 听着 你不能把我留在这儿
Please. Listen, you can't leave me here.

461
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,169
看好他 Jenkins 
Watch her, Jenkins! 

462
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:48,900
是 妈咪
Yes, Mummy.

463
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,300
- Jenkins   - 抱歉
- Jenkins?  - Sorry.

464
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,100
长官 我也不知道自己怎么了
Sir, I don't know what's the matter with me.

465
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,042
看啊 把我锁起来可以 可是别在这儿  
Look, lock me up, fine, but not here. 

466
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:01,500
求你了 哪里都行但别是这儿
Please, anywhere but here!

467
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,200
你不会有事的 小姐
You'll be all right, Miss,

468
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,900
我只是有点儿… 有点儿… 有点儿…
I'm just a little. . . Just a little. . .Just a little. . .

469
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,503
你到底什么毛病
What's the matter with you?

470
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:11,200
求你了  让我走
Please. Let me go.

471
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,013
- 为什么我要那么做   - 因为你
- Why would I do that?  - Cos you've

472
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:15,500
- 手背上有道伤疤   - 噢 没错
- got a scar on the back of your hand.  - Oh, yes,

473
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
有了又能怎么样
but what's that got to do with anything?

474
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,393
你觉得你生病了
And you feel like you're gonna be sick.

475
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:21,600
像有什么东西抵在你的喉咙上似的
Like something's forcing its way up your throat.

476
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,700
我了解的 因为我之前见过这种
I know because I've seen it before.

477
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,100
我到底怎么了 
What's happening to me? 

478
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,000
一分钟后你就不再是你了
In a minute you won't be you any more.

479
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
你甚至不会记得你是谁
You won't even remember you.

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,800
除非放我走 否则我也会变成那样  求你了
And unless you let me go, it's going to happen to me too. Please!

481
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,426
你到底在说什么啊   
What are you talking about? 

482
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:37,196
你母亲叫什么名字 
What's your mother's name? 

483
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,100
Matilda

妻子叫什么呢
Wife's name?

486
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,900
有孩子了没
You got kids?

487
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,100
你叫什么
What's your name?

488
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,900
拜托啊
Please.

489
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,000
放我走  你太迟了
Let me go. It's too late for you.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,900
我很抱歉  但是快放我走啊
I'm sorry. But please let me go.

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,500
你要嗯嗯
What do you m. . . ?

492
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,300
么-么-妈-咪
M-m-m-mumm-y.

493
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
妈-咪
Mumme-e-e-e!

494
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
好了 就是这里
Well, there it is!

495
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,500
嘿 是Algy当班  肯定是要紧的事
Hey, they've got Algy on duty. Must be important.

496
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,200
我们得想办法过去
We've gotta get past.

497
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,384
转移士兵视线
Are the words "Distract

498
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,600
是我们的大体行动方针吗
the guard" Heading in my general direction?

499
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
我觉得那不是个好主意
I don't think that'd be such a good idea.

500
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
别担心 我能处理
Don't worry, I can handle it.

501
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,673
自从我来到小镇上后
I've got to know Algy quite well,

502
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,500
就挺了解Algy的了  相信我
since I've been in town. Trust me,

503
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,400
你不是他的菜  我来引开他
you're not his type. I'll distract him.

504
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
别等我了
Don't wait up!

505
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,800
淡定  这家伙是51世纪的
Relax! He's a 51st-century guy.

506
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,000
就跳舞来说他确实有够灵活
He's just a bit more flexible when it comes to dancing.

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,100
有多灵活
How flexible?

508
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,500
和他一起的时候 你俩可是穿越了半个星系
By his time, you lot are spread out across half the galaxy.

509
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,337
啥意思
Meaning?

510
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,700
样式那么多 时间又那么少
So many species, so little time.

511
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,759
那就是我们逃出来的时候要做的  
That's what we do when we get out there? 

512
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,700
那是我们的使命
That's our mission?

513
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,100
寻找新生和… 和…
We seek new life and. . .And. . .

514
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,800
跳舞
Dance!

515
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
嘿 老虎  怎么了这里
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?

516
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,900
- 妈咪   - Algy 老伙计 是我
- Mummy?  - Algy, old sport, it's me.

517
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,800
妈咪
Mummy?!

518
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,700
是我 Jack
It's me, Jack!

519
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,600
Jack
Jack?

520
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,600
你是我的… 妈咪吗
Are you my. . . Mummy?

521
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,700
- 退后   - 你们 待那别动
- Stay back!  - You men, stay away!

522
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,800
这种病毒开始空气传播了 速度越来越快
The effect's becoming airborne, accelerating.

523
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,800
- 我们要怎么保障安全呢   - 没办法
- What's keeping us safe?  - Nothing.

524
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,200
- 啊 他们又来了   - 真走运
- Ah, here they come again.  - All we need!

525
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,200
你是不是说过炸弹会落在这儿
Didn't you say a bomb was gonna land here?

526
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,633
别管那个了  
Never mind about that. If the

527
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,231
- 如果病毒现在是空气传播
- contaminant's airborne now,

528
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,400
- 那就只剩几小时了   - 会怎么样
 - there's hours left.  - Till what?

529
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,070
会一无所有  永远的  
Till nothing! Forever! 

530
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,208
整个人类种族都不复存在
For the entire human race.

531
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,100
听到有人唱歌了么
And can anyone else hear singing?

532
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,200
宝宝的摇篮挂树梢
Rock-a-bye baby on the tree tops

533
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,700
风吹摇篮摇啊摇
When the wind blows the cradle will rock

534
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,300
枝断摇篮落树梢
When the bow breaks the cradle will fall

535
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,100
摇篮和宝宝一起掉
Down will come baby cradle and all. . .

536
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:25,124
宝宝的摇篮挂树梢
Rock-a-bye baby. . .On the tree tops

537
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:29,032
风吹摇篮摇啊摇
When the wind blows the cradle will rock.

538
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,900
瞧见没  就是个救护车
You see? Just an ambulance!

539
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,400
那是救护车
That's an ambulance?

540
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,179
很难解释 这是...
It's hard to explain, it's. . .

541
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,700
这是另一个世界的东西
 it's from another world.

542
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
他们试图进入来着
They've been trying to get in.

543
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,407
当然了  他们认为
Of course they have. They think

544
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:52,000
他们得到了希特勒的秘密武器
they've got their hands on Hitler's secret weapon.

545
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,568
- 你在干啥   - 当你看到
- What are you doing?  - When you see this

546
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,900
这玩意是空的你就知道我啥都没干过了
thing is empty you'll know I had nothing to do with it.

547
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
噢
Oh!

548
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,617
- 上次可没这样   - 上次它可没摔过
- Didn't happen last time.  - It hadn't crashed last time.

549
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,500
这是个紧急协议
There'll be emergency protocols.

550
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,500
博士 那是啥
Doctor, what is that?

551
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
妈咪
Mummy.

552
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,000
博士
Doctor!

553
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,829
上校 守住那些门   
Captain, secure those gates.  

554
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,600
- 为啥   - 做就是了
- Why?  - Just do it!

555
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,808
Nancy 你是怎么进来的
Nancy, how did you get in here?

556
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,200
剪短铁丝网
Cut the wire.

557
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,100
带Rose过去  设置成2428-D
Show Rose. Setting 2428-D.

558
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
- 啥   - 修复那些铁丝网  快去
- What?  - Re-attaches barbed wire. Go!

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,400
你是谁  你们都是谁啊
Who are you? Who are any of you?

560
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,400
说了你一定不信
Never believe me if I told ya.

561
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
你刚刚还跟我说那是从另一世界来的救护车
You just told me that was an ambulance from another world.

562
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,280
带着防毒面具的人到处乱跑
People are running round with gas mask

563
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:10,100
还叫着他们妈咪 天上全是炸弹
heads calling for their mummies, the sky's full of bombs.

564
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,037
告诉我吧 你觉得我还有什么不会相信呢
Tell me, do you think there's anything left I couldn't believe?

565
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,363
我们是来自未来的时间旅行者  
We're time travellers from the future. 

566
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:19,800
疯了 你们都疯了
Mad, you are!

567
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,780
我们有一个时间机器 我是说真的 
We have a time travel machine. Seriously. 

568
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,300
不会的
 It's not that.

569
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,400
好吧 你们有个时间机器 这我信
All right, you got a time travel machine, I'll believe ya.

570
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,800
我会相信任何东西  但未来是什么啊
Believe anything, me. .But what future?

571
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Nancy 这不是终点
Nancy, this isn't the end.

572
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,285
我知道现在的局面 
I know how it looks, it's not the

573
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,118
但这不是世界末日还是别的什么的 
end of the world or anything. 

574
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,200
你怎么能那么说呢
How can you say that?

575
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,600
- 看看这儿   - 听我说
- Look at it.  - Listen to me.

576
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,486
我在这个城市出生  
I was born in this city. 

577
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:49,900
我来自这里 差不多50年之后
I'm from here. In like 50 years time.

578
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
- 来自这儿   - 我是伦敦人
- From here?  - I'm a Londoner.

579
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,400
就在你的未来
From your future.

580
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,293
可是... 可是你不是... 
But. . .But you're not. . . 

581
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:58,000
什么
What?

582
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,700
德国人
German.

583
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,100
Nancy 德国人不会来这儿 他们赢不了
Nancy, the Germans don't come here. They don't win.

584
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,400
不要告诉任何人我给你说过
Don't tell anyone I told you so.

585
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,500
可是你知道么  你们胜利了
But you know what? You win.

586
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,000
我们胜利了
We win?

587
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
来吧
Come on!

588
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
这是空的  你看啊
It's empty. Look at it.

589
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,470
你还指望一个Chula医疗运输机里能有啥
What do you expect in a Chula Medical Transporter?

590
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,200
绷带  止咳片
Bandages? Cough drops?

591
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,300
- Rose   - 我不知道
- Rose?  - I dunno.

592
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,100
不 你知道的
Yes, you do.

593
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,460
nanogenes 
Nanogenes!

594
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,200
这可不是空的 上校
It wasn't empty, Captain.

595
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,900
这有足够重建一个种族的nanogenes
There was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species.

596
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,500
- 噢 老天   - 你可算明白了 是不
- Oh, God.  - Getting it now, are we?

597
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,269
飞船坠毁的时候 
When the ship crashes, 

598
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:38,100
这些nanogenes就溜走了
the nanogenes escape.

599
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
多的数之不尽
Billions upon billions of them.

600
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,800
准备着去修复全世界的割伤和擦伤
Ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world.

601
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,300
但他们最先找到的是一个死去的孩子
But what they find first is a dead child.

602
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
大概是前一晚被害的
Probably killed earlier that night.

603
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,900
并且带着一个防毒面具
And wearing a gas mask.

604
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,156
然后他们把他复活了 
And they brought him back to life? 

605
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:52,100
- 他们能做到的   - 什么是生命啊
- They can do that?  - What's life?

606
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
生命很简单  只不过是一件奇怪的事
Life's easy. A quirk of matter.

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,900
就是保持肉体新鲜的自然方法
Nature's way of keeping meat fresh.

608
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,363
对nanogenes来说没什么  
Nothing to a nanogene. 

609
00:28:57,363 --> 00:28:58,900
可还有一个问题
One problem though.

610
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,600
这些nanogenes 
These nanogenes, 

611
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,425
他们不像你飞船上的那些
they're not like the ones on your ship.

612
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,500
这些之前可从来没有见过人类
This lot have never seen a human being before.

613
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,900
根本不知道一个人类的正常形态是怎样的
Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like.

614
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,000
他们所了解的全部都是来自这样一个小男孩
All they've got to go on is one little body,

615
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,500
而周围像他一样的人可不多
and there's not a lot left.

616
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,219
不过他们就这样继续发展
But they carry right on, they do

617
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,700
他们按照计划进行着 - 他们不断修复
what they're programmed to do - they patch it up.

618
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,718
说不清什么是防毒面具
Can't tell what's gas

619
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,900
什么是头骨 但他们尽他们所能的去做
mask and what's skull but they do their best.

620
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,300
做完一切他们就撤了 远走高飞 工作完成了
Then off they fly, off they go, work to be done!

621
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,159
你也看见了
Cos you see, now they

622
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
现在他们自认为知道了人类是个什么样子
think they know what people should look like.

623
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,921
所以是时候把剩下的人都修复成那样  
And it's time to fix all the rest. 

624
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:24,800
并且不会停止
And they won't ever stop.

625
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
他们永远都不会停止
They won't ever, ever stop.

626
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,770
整个人类种族都会被拆卸
The entire human race is gonna be

627
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:32,000
然后重建成那个作为蓝本的恐怖孩子的样子
torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child,

628
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,300
不停地寻找他们的母亲
looking for its mother.

629
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,415
并且这世上什么都阻止不了它  
And nothing in the world can stop it! 

630
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:36,300
我又不知道会这样
I didn't know.

631
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,800
妈咪 妈咪 妈咪 妈咪
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy.

632
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,400
Rose
Rose!

633
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
这玩意把面具人都集中到这里来了
It's bringing the gas-mask people here.

634
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,600
飞船认为它被袭击了  所以呼叫了军队
The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling the troops.

635
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,776
这是标准协议 
Standard protocol. 

636
00:30:13,776 --> 00:30:16,100
但戴面具的人又不是军队
But the gas-mask people aren't troops!

637
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,600
现在他们是了  这是战时救护军
They are now. This is a battlefield ambulance.

638
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,492
纳米基因治疗剂不会只治好你
The nanogenes don't just fix you up, they

639
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:23,400
他们会把你送上前线  武装你 编码你
get you ready for the front line. Equip you, programme you. . .

640
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,101
这就是为什么那孩子这么厉害
That's why the Child's so strong?

641
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,800
为什么他能那样打电话
Why it could do that phoning thing?

642
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,500
他是一个全部武装的Chula战士 是的
It's a fully-equipped Chula Warrior, yes.

643
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,319
所有的武器技术都在一个四岁大的孩子手里
All that weapons tech in the hands

644
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,000
寻找着他的妈咪
of an hysterical four-year-old, looking for his Mummy

645
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
现在组成了一支军队
and now there's an army of them.

646
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,700
妈妈
Mummy!

647
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,202
他们怎么没有攻击行为 
Why don't they attack?  

648
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:42,050
听话的士兵们
Good little soldiers.

649
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:43,800
等着首领的指示呢
Waiting for their commander.

650
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,600
那个小男孩
The Child!

651
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,400
- Jamie   - 什么
- Jamie.   - What?

652
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,800
不是那个孩子 是Jamie
Not the Child, Jamie.

653
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
离炸弹爆炸还有多久
So how long until the bomb falls?

654
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
- 任何时候   - 有什么事 上尉
- Any second.   - What's the matter, Captain?

655
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
你是不是离火山太近了
Bit close to the volcano for you?

656
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,100
- 他只是个小孩子   - 我知道
- He's just a little boy.   - I know.

657
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,300
他只是一个想找妈妈的小孩子
He's just a little boy who wants his Mummy.

658
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,800
我知道
I know.

659
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,277
没有什么孩子
There isn't a little boy born who

660
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,300
是可以毁灭世界来拯救他母亲的
wouldn't tear the world apart to save his Mummy.

661
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,999
但是这个孩子可以  
And this little boy can. 

662
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,100
那我们要做些什么
So what are we gonna do?

663
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,300
我不知道
I don't know.

664
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,700
是我的错
It's my fault.

665
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,700
- 别这么说   - 就是的 都是我的错
- No.   - It is. It's all my fault.

666
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,300
- 怎么会是你的...   - 妈妈
- How can it be your. . . ?   - Mummy!

667
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,100
Nancy 你多大了
Nancy, what age are you?

668
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,200
20或者21 比你看起来要大 是吧
20, 21? Older than you look, yes?

669
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,100
博士 那个炸弹...我们时间不多了
Doctor, that bomb. . . We've got seconds!

670
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,500
你用心灵运输送走我们
You can teleport us out.

671
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,667
没法送你们 nav-com重新联网了
Not you guys. The nav-com's back on line,

672
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:53,100
要很久才能越过协议
gonna take too long to override the protocols.

673
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,700
是火山日了
So it's Volcano Day.

674
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,600
- 做你该做的去   - Jack
- Do what you've got to do!   - Jack?

675
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,500
五年前你多大 15或者16吗
How old were you five years ago, 15? 16?

676
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,700
反正够生孩子了吧
Old enough to give birth anyway.

677
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,300
他不是你弟弟 对吧
He's not your brother, is he?

678
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,900
在1941年一个单身少年妈妈
Teenage single mother in 1941.

679
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,900
你只有掩盖事实 你撒谎了
So you hid. You lied.

680
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,600

任何试图投弃的操作都会加速爆炸

785

甲板上没有逃生舱

801
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,631
上次我被判死刑时

All a bit of a blur after that.

804
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,800
醒来了之后看到我的两个死刑执行人在我床边
Woke up in bed with both my executioners.

805
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,400
唔 真是有爱的一对儿啊

They stayed in touch.

807
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
其他的就不说了
Can't say that about most executioners.

808
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,700
不管怎么样
Anyway. . .

809

我确定我曾经知道这些东西 请你关上门好吗
I'm sure I used to know this stuff. Close the door, will you?
