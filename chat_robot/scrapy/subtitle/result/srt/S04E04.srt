1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,250
我们在干嘛?
What are we doing?

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,670
探索飞马座星系
那就是我们要做的
Exploring the pegasus galaxy, it's what we do.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,670
你知道我的意思
You know what I meant.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,170
这里没有任何东西能
帮我们对抗幽灵族
There certainly doesn't appear to be anything here that would help in our fight against the wraith

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,550
或者复制人
or the replicators.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,720
拜托  我真服了你们了
Come on, you guys kill me.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,510
行星是广袤的
这你们应该知道
Planets are huge, you know.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,770
通常都是你在抱怨
Usually you're the one complaining.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,850
对啊  这么热情可真不像你  罗德尼
Yes, this enthusiasm is most unlike you, rodney.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,270
我正在改头换面
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,610
我们在小飞船里做了个
标准的空中飞跃
We did a standard fly-over in the jumper

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,980
探测生命迹象  一无所获
scanned for life-signs. Nothing.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,990
你不能只飞10分钟就说
这里什么都没有
You can't fly around for 10 minutes and decide there's nothing here.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,280
是的  我可以
Yes, I can.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,990
我探测到了奇怪的能源
I'm getting strange energy readings.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,410
是吗?  在哪儿?
Yeah? From where?

17
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,080
我无法标记来源
I can't pinpoint the source.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,580
这个丛林太密了
The jungle's pretty thick, though.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,120
它可能藏在任何东西之内
It could be hiding just about anything.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,330
我不知道
I don't know.

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,080
就好像某人在温暖舒适的房间里
It's almost as if somebody in a warm cozy room

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,210
敲着他们的电脑
typing at their computer

23
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,420
为了自己开心把我们派到这里
sent us here for their own amusement.

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,130
你不会真的认为泽兰卡
会那么做吧?
You don't really think zelenka would do that?

25
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,010
如果他做了  他就惨了
If he did, he's going to be sorry.

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,430
你知道在古人的数据库里有多少个
星际之门的地址
Do you have any idea how many gate addresses there are in the ancient database

27
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,180
是没有相关描述的
that have no accompanying description?

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,470
42个?
42?

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,810
不  我想比那更多  瞧  我记不清了
可那不是重点
No, I think it's a little more than that. Look, I don't really remember. That's not the point.

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,600
没什么
Nothing

31
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,810
什么信息都没有  我想说
No information at all. I say

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,020
那一定意味着什么
that has to mean something.

33
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,860
或许它表示  对于这些星球没什么
有价值的东西可以记录
Maybe it means there was nothing worth writing about on those planets.

34
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,070
或者有
Or there is

35
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,820
只是古人们试图将它藏起来
but the ancients are trying to hide it.

36
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,030
为了他们自己?
From themselves?

37
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,570
古人之后又过了很长时间
A lot of time has passed since the ancients were around.

38
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,200
你应该知道  事情会改变  或许
这里有些他们不知道的事
You know, things change. Maybe there's something here they didn't know about.

39
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,330
你对此下了赌注  对吗?
You have a bet riding on this, don't you?

40
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,830
你为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

41
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,250
好吧...
All right...

42
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,630
没错
That's it.

43
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,510
我宣布此次行动结束
都回到小飞船上
I'm calling this one. Everyone back to the jumper.

44
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,720
拜托
Aw, come on.

45
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,840
面对现实吧  麦凯  这次你输了
Face it, mckay, you lost this one.

46
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,260
等等  那是什么?
Hello, what's that then, huh?

47
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,730
看起来像某种自然晶体生物
Looks like some kind of natural crystalline growth.

48
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,150
我想或许就是它导致了能量的读取
I think this might be what's causing the energy readings.

49
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,280
真漂亮
Pretty.

50
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,860
看起来像童年时的某种玩具
Looks like one of those toys you play with when you're a kid.

51
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,160
海军准将64?
A commodore 64?

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,830
三筒手枪?
Triple barrel shotgun?

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,740
万花筒
A kaleidoscope.

54
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,990
你知道这意味着什么吗?
You realize what this means?

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,660
我们发现了一株
能发光的外星真菌
We discovered an alien fungus that glows.

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,250
不如说是长在树上的能量源?
How about a power source that literally grows on trees?

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,170
但必须承认
这些能量读取水平较低
But admittedly, these energy readings are pretty low-level, but

58
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,050
但是如果我们能培养这些水晶  那么
if these crystals could be cultivated, then--

59
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,180
哇  等等  你在干嘛?
whoa, whoa, wait. What are you doing?

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,770
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

61
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,270
嗯  我没事  只是
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just

62
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,190
受了点电击
a little shock.

63
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,350
那可能很危险!  我告诉过你它在
放射能源
That could have been dangerous! I told you it was giving off energy.

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
老实说  我...
Honestly, I...

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
我不知道我为什么那么做
I don't know why I did that.

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,780
你杀死它了
Well, you killed it.

67
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
真的吗?
Oh, really?

68
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,280
它不再放射能源了
Well, it's not giving off energy anymore.

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,620
或许他只是吓倒它了
Well, maybe he just scared it.

70
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,330
你甚至都不知道它是否是活的
You don't even know if it was alive.

71
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,240
老实说  你为什么碰它?
Seriously, why would you touch it?

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,620
我不知道!  我说过了  行了吗?
I don't know! I said that, okay?

73
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,120
我只是那么做了
I just did.

74
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,290
现在  你能不提这事了吗?
Now, will you leave it at that?

75
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,710
好吧  这附近一定还有更多
Okay, well, there's got to be more of them around here.

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,420
我建议派遣一支科学小组来这里
考察
I'm going to recommend sending a science team back here to check it out.

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,010
我就是一个科学小组
I am a science team.

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
嗯  好
Okay, fine,

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,020
让我们抛弃一个潜在重要的探索吧
let's desert a potentially significant discovery

80
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,560
就因为你们不想让我赢和
泽兰卡打的赌
just because you guys don't want me to win a bet with zelenka?

81
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,570
你的扫描都没有问题
All your scans are clear

82
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,360
血液检查很正常
blood tests are normal.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,150
据我所知  你很健康
As far as I can tell, you're in perfect health.

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,070
看吧?  我告诉过你
See? I told you.

85
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,910
谢谢你  医生
Thanks, doc.

86
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,370
不许再碰奇怪的东西了
No more touching strange things.

87
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
嗯  好建议
Well, that's good advice.

88
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,250
不知道你感觉如何  我很困了
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.

89
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,580
真是漫长的一天
It's been a long day.

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,920
谢谢你陪我过来
Well, thanks for hanging out.

91
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,710
只想确认一下
Just wanted to make sure.

92
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,460
我很好
I'm fine.

93
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,760
睡会儿吧
Get some sleep.

94
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,510
晚安  约翰
Good night, john.

95
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,900
星际之门亚特兰蒂斯
第四季  第四集
<font color=#38B0DE>Stargate Atlantis
Season 04 Episode 04</font>

96
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,790
这真不错
This is pretty good.

97
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,340
什么?
What is it?

98
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,470
我就知道你们最终会在一起
I knew you two were going to eventually hook up.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,300
我们没在一起
We are not hooking up.

100
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,220
只是晚餐罢了
It's just dinner.

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,550
我告诉过你  这里有东西放射出
奇怪的能量
I'm telling you, there's something in here giving off a strange energy reading.

102
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,640
约翰  你在干嘛?
John, what are you doing?

103
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,310
卡特中校不相信你
Colonel carter doesn't trust you.

104
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,560
除了我没人相信你
No one does but me.

105
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,730
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

106
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,400
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

107
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,190
- 你什么意思?
- 没什么
What do you mean? Nothing.

108
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,780
自从你进入那个幽灵王后的思想后
你就变得不一样了
You've never been the same since you got into the mind of that wraith queen.

109
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,740
什么?
What?

110
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,290
泰勒!
Teyla!

111
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,620
父亲?
Father?

112
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,810
我甚至都没法告诉你它有多么诡异
I cannot even begin to tell you how bizarre it was.

113
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,360
- 拜托  你想听诡异的?  让我告诉你
- 知道吗
- Please, you want bizarre? Let me tell you--
- you know what?

114
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
不用
Don'T.

115
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,070
早上好
Morning.

116
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,660
怎么了?
What?

117
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,870
泰勒昨晚梦见你了
Teyla had a dream about you last night.

118
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,990
罗德尼
Rodney...

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,330
真的吗?
really?

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,790
关于什么的?
What was it about?

121
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,000
其实它更像个恶梦
我还是不说的好
Actually, it was more of a nightmare, and I'd rather not talk about it.

122
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,460
我是不是那个冲锋的英雄
将你从怪物手中救出来?
Was i the dashing hero saving you from a big bad monster?

123
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,420
事实上  你就是那个怪物
Actually, you were the big bad monster.

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,210
真的吗?
Really?

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,470
我说过了  还是不说的好
Like I said, I'd rather not talk about it.

126
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,880
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

127
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,260
对不起  我有点头疼
I'm sorry. I have a headache.

128
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,680
昨晚没睡好
I did not sleep well last night.

129
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,890
她真的生我起了?
Is she really mad at me?

130
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,520
我没法控制她梦里的事情
I can't control what's in her dreams.

131
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,980
真的?  你认为你没法控制一个人的梦?
Really? You think you can't control a person's dreams?

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,070
我父亲在我七岁时就读白鲸我听
My father read me moby dick when I was seven years old.

133
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,780
我是说  真的  那男的在想什么?
I mean, seriously, what was the man thinking?

134
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,370
你知道我做了多长时间
被鲸鱼吃掉的梦吗?
You have any idea how long I had nightmares about being eaten by a whale?

135
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,160
- 它们没有停止  对吗?
- 没有
- They haven't stopped, have they?
- No.

136
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,040
声音从外面传来
It's coming from outside.

137
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,000
我走向门口  听见跑步声
I go to the opening. I hear darts.

138
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,050
我拉开帐篷  然后
I pull open the tent, and

139
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,420
他进来了
he comes inside.

140
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,720
我知道那不是真正的谢帕德中校
I know it's not really colonel sheppard,

141
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,180
可我不禁觉得他很奇怪
but I can't help but feel different towards him.

142
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,850
你认为是我的潜意识在告诉我
些什么吗?
Do you think it's my subconscious trying to tell me something?

143
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,390
如果你和谢帕德中校之间真的
有什么事
If there is something real going on between you and colonel sheppard

144
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,230
是你认为要说的
that you feel you need to address

145
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,150
那你应该那么做
you definitely should.

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,480
否则  别为此困扰
Otherwise, don't let it bother you.

147
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,280
我以前有过十分可怕的恶梦
I've had horrible nightmares before

148
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,080
梦到我小的时候父亲被带走
Of my father being taken when I was a little girl,

149
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,990
然后被猎杀
the cullings since,

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
但是都没有这种感觉
but none of them have felt like this.

151
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,000
当我醒来时
When I woke up,

152
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,420
几乎喘不过气来
I could barely catch my breath.

153
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,670
我知道这听起来很愚蠢  但
I know it sounds silly, but

154
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,960
我想我害怕睡着
I think I'm actually afraid of falling asleep.

155
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,350
生理上  你一切正常
Well, physically, there's nothing wrong with you.

156
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,310
除了你描述的那些症状
Other than the symptoms you've described,

157
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,560
它们都是由缺乏睡眠引起的
which can all be attributed to lack of sleep.

158
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,390
这个短期内应该会有效
These should help for the short term,

159
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,610
可如果问题持续
but if the problem persists

160
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,570
你一定要再过来
you definitely need to come back

161
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,900
你没法想象睡个安稳觉现在
对我来说有多重要
You have no idea how good the thought of a solid night's sleep makes me feel at this point.

162
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,610
我想我知道
Oh, I think I do.

163
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,950
我不确定自从来到这里后我是否
安稳的睡过
I'm not sure I've had one since I got here.

164
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
谢谢你
Thank you.

165
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,490
别客气
Don't mention it.

166
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,580
- 睡个好觉
- 你也是
- Have a good night.
- You too.

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,130
凯勒医生  这里有紧急医疗事故
Dr. Keller,  we have a medical emergency.

168
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,340
凯勒医生  请速到医务室来
Dr. Keller, please report  immediately to the infirmary.

169
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,000
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,910
是泰勒  她有严重的腹腔疼痛
It's teyla. She's in severe abdominal distress.

171
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,420
说你给她开了些药?
Says you gave her some medication?

172
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,790
我给她开了些药帮助睡眠  泰勒?
I prescribed some ambien to help her sleep. Teyla?

173
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,090
她起来吃消夜
Went to the mess for a late-night snack,

174
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,380
她开始抱怨胃痛  然后疼痛就加剧了
she started complaining about her stomach, and then she just doubled over.

175
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,640
我以为你要上床睡觉  你吃了
我给你的药片吗?
I thought you were going to bed. Did you take one of those pills I gave you?

176
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,180
没有
No.

177
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,010
好的  尽量放松  让我看看
Okay, just try to relax. Let me have a look.

178
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,020
抓着她
Hold her for me.

179
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,030
上帝啊
Oh, my god.

180
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,070
医生  做点什么
Doctor, do something.

181
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,450
好吧  我们得让她保持镇静  然后
okay, we-we need to sedate her, and, uh--

182
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
天啊
Oh, god.

183
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,930
这是真的吗?
Can you believe this?

184
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,170
对不起  医生
Sorry, doc.

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,710
没想吓你
Didn't mean to scare you.

186
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,260
我们在装雷达  我不小心划伤了
We were sparring. I got in a lucky shot.

187
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,380
可现在是半夜
It's the middle of the night.

188
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,050
对你来说或许是
Maybe for you.

189
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
坐下  让我看看
Sit down, let me have a look.

190
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,600
你需要缝针
You're going to need stitches.

191
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,860
我想我教他太多了
I guess I taught him too much, huh?

192
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,520
嗯  我也这么想
Yeah, I guess so.

193
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,150
知道吗  你不用呆在这儿  我能行
You know, you don't need to stick around. I'm fine.

194
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,530
- 你确定？
- 嗯
- You sure?
- Yeah.

195
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,240
我想明天重赛
I want a rematch tomorrow, though.

196
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,990
嗯  那正是我担心的
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

197
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
晚安
Good night.

198
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,580
明天见
See you tomorrow.

199
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,870
有事吗?
Something wrong?

200
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,830
嗯?  没有  没事
Hmm? No, nothing.

201
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,550
我想他没和任何人约会  知道吗
I don't think he's seeing anyone, you know--

202
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,050
哦!  不  不
oh! Oh, no. No,

203
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,970
那  那没关系
that'S... that's quite all right.

204
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,760
知道吗  如果你躺下来会更好
You know, this would be easier if you lay down.

205
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
好的
Okay.

206
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,220
有人在吗
Hello! Is anyone here?

207
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,070
谁在!
Anyone!

208
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,490
伙计...
Hey, buddy...

209
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,120
你从哪跑出来的
what are you running from?

210
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,490
我也不知道
I don't know.

211
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,910
来
Come on.

212
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,610
抱歉 我...我是不是弄疼你了
I'm really sorry. Did I... did I hurt you?

213
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,740
不 不是
No. No... I'M...

214
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,450
抱歉
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,120
我不是故意的...
I didn't mean to...

216
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,950
你睡着了
you fell asleep.

217
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,290
我做了一个很奇怪的梦
I was having the strangest dream.

218
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,460
你真的没事吗
You sure you're okay?

219
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,460
嗯
Yeah.

220
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,550
你继续吧
Go ahead.

221
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,420
我快弄好了
I'm almost done.

222
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,100
这真恐怖
It was terrifying.

223
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,850
有个恶心的外星虫子从你的胃里
爬出来
There you were with this disgusting alien bug crawling out of your stomach

224
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,310
谢帕德上校居然表现得
这好像是他见过最酷的事情
and colonel sheppard was acting like it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen.

225
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,650
听起来跟那部电影一样
That sounds like that movie.

226
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,060
的确  外星人  你看过吗?
Yeah, alien. Have you seen it?

227
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,690
谢帕德上校经常提起这件事
Colonel sheppard speaks of it often.

228
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,480
我还记得我第一次看到它
I still remember the first time I saw it.

229
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,530
我一点都不觉得这很酷
I certainly did not think it was cool.

230
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,910
有一次  在医学院里
One time, in med school,

231
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,240
我居然轻易相信我生物实验课上的
搭档
I made the mistake of confiding to my partner in biology class

232
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,870
结果这成了我这辈子最恐怖的事情
that it had caused my all-time worst nightmares.

233
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
他把一条活生生的蛇
He actually planted a live snake

234
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,000
放进我在解剖的尸体里
inside a cadaver I was working on.

235
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,580
我小时候从来没见过
Well, I never saw it as a kid.

236
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,540
我从海报上看到这部电影会很恐怖
I knew from the poster it was going to be too scary.

237
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,710
不对  我那时候16岁
No, I was 16

238
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:52,050
那时我们附近的剧院举办了一个
恐怖复活节活动
when a neighborhood theater had a horror revival festival.

239
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,720
当时我觉得挺好的
I thought, great, you know,

240
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,510
电影约会  乔瑟琳·罗杰
date movie. So, jocelyn rutger

241
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,100
科学院的三年级学生
third period science

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,890
虽然有点古怪  但她有很棒的...
Bit of geek, but she had a great, uh...

243
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,690
算了  你们都知道女生一受惊吓就会
蜷靠在你肩膀上吗
anyway, you know how girls get all scared and curl up on your shoulder?

244
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,860
你们星球上的习俗还真是奇怪
Your planet has some truly strange rituals.

245
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
不管怎样  我一紧张就会吃东西
Anyway, I eat when I get nervous.

246
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,530
真的吗
Really?

247
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,610
- 我还真没注意到
- 所以...
- I hadn't noticed.
- Mm... so,

248
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,490
非常紧张  跟着了魔一样工作
very tense, working like a charm.

249
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,530
乔瑟琳在我旁边被吓坏了
我赶紧把花生和爆米花收起来放好
Jocelyn's all freaked out beside me, I'm packing away the goobers and the popcorn

250
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,700
然后那些外星人就从约翰·赫特
身体里冒了出来
and then the alien bursts out of john hurt.

251
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,910
你该不会
You didn'T.

252
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,960
吐了她一身
puked all over her.

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
我一定得看看这部电影
I have got to see this movie.

254
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,290
你们不觉得奇怪吗
Don't you think it's strange

255
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,960
我们每个人都有过很逼真的噩梦
that each of us has had incredibly vivid nightmares

256
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,670
而且谢帕德中校都出现在我们
梦中的某处
with colonel sheppard being somehow an integral part?

257
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,930
而梦中的谢帕德中校跟他本人
完全不像
Acting most unlike colonel sheppard.

258
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,090
除了我
Not me

259
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,930
你最近做过噩梦吗
Have you had any nightmares recently?

260
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,100
没有一天晚上是不做的
Not a night goes by.

261
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,720
昨晚  我梦到卡特中校邀我去她那
共进晚餐
Last night, I dreamt that colonel carter invited me to her quarters for dinner.

262
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,890
或许你不该告诉我们这些  罗德尼
Maybe you shouldn't be telling us this, rodney.

263
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,440
的确  我说的是噩梦
而不是男人的性幻想
Yeah, I said nightmare, not delusional male fantasy.

264
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,400
你们听我说
Wait and listen.

265
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,690
结果发现她要请我吃柠檬鸡
Turns out she was serving lemon chicken.

266
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,820
我是说  柠檬
I mean, lemon,

267
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,450
而且她请我去的唯一原因是
她要把泽兰卡提升为我的上司
and the only reason she invited me to dinner was to tell me she was promoting zelenka over me.

268
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,450
就这?
That's it?

269
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,030
然后我就被一条鲸鱼给吞了
Then I was eaten by a whale.

270
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,410
别问原因
Don't ask how that happened.

271
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,790
你们都认为我疯了吗?
Okay, do you guys really think I'm crazy?

272
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,330
我明白那只是梦  但是
I realize they're just dreams, but

273
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,290
首先是泰勒  紧接着你来看我之后
我又做了一个
first it was teyla, then right after you came to see me, I had one.

274
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,250
那之后我正好没再做梦了
你给我的药片让我一夜无梦
And that's when mine stopped. Those pills you gave me knocked me out cold.

275
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,460
我给罗恩疗伤时  他也做梦了
And then ronon had one while I worked on him.

276
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,800
这有什么大不了的?
What's the big deal?

277
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,510
就像你说的  这都是噩梦而已
不是吗?
It's like you said, it's just a few bad dreams, right?

278
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,020
或许我真不应该为此事打扰你
I probably shouldn't have bothered you with this.

279
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,190
而且我还没有确凿的证据
I know I don't really have any hard evidence.

280
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,150
相信我  我以前就见过有人把
直觉运用在一些极度疯狂的事情
Well, believe me, I've seen a good hunch go a long way in some pretty crazy circumstances.

281
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,990
尤其是在可疑的情况下
你最好用事实来证明
I'd always rather you were on your toes, especially with anything that seems suspicious.

282
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,330
我知道做点小噩梦不是那么严重
I know a few bad dreams isn't that significant.

283
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,330
这很自然  都是来自我们日常生活
的东西
It's only natural, given what we face on a daily basis, but

284
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,830
这次却不一样
this was different.

285
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,330
确实让我很困扰
It really rattled me.

286
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,290
接二连三地发生
Coupled with the sequential pattern.

287
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,080
首先是泰勒  接着是我
First teyla, then me

288
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,590
然后到罗恩  谢帕德中校都在
我们梦里扮演了一个反面角色
then ronon, all with colonel sheppard being a significant negative presence in our dreams.

289
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,880
你们觉得这说明了什么
Do you have any idea what's behind it?

290
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,300
我不知道
No, I don't know.

291
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,890
我想说的是  这一切都发生在
谢帕德中校在m3x-387碰了那块水晶后
Thing is, it started right after colonel sheppard touched that crystal on m3x-387.

292
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,520
我还以为你已经把他治好了呢
I thought you cleared him medically.

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,680
- 我是治好了 但
- 打扰一下
- I did, but--
- excuse me.

294
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,020
飞船人员的宿舍中心有紧急情况
There's an emergency situation at crew quarters atrium.

295
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,020
他们紧急呼叫求援
我们已经派人过去了
Security was called for and has been dispatched.

296
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,230
知道了  抱歉
Thank you. Excuse me.

297
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,490
把枪放下来  中校
Put down the gun, major.

298
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,070
我们好好谈谈
Let's talk this out.

299
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,030
谁把反复制人发生器拿过来  现在
Someone, get an arg. Now.

300
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,040
用那个朝他射击
Shoot him with it.

301
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,250
中校  跟我谈谈
Major, talk to me.

302
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,450
告诉我发生什么事了
Tell me what's going on?

303
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,830
照我说的做!
Just do it!

304
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,750
会  会造成什么伤害吗?
Okay, w-what's the harm?

305
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
我是说  如果他是人类的话
就不会伤害到他 对吗?
I mean, if he's human, it won't hurt him, right?

306
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,130
- 约翰  他在说什么呢?
- 别跟他讲话
- John, what is he talking about?
- Don't talk to him.

307
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,380
谢帕德中校是个复制人
Colonel sheppard is a replicator.

308
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,520
罗恩  我不知道你脑子里在想什么
Look, lorne, I don't know what's gotten into you...

309
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,400
我?
me?

310
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,060
不  不  原因不在我
No, no, no, no, it's not me.

311
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,980
中校  先把武器放下怎么样?
Major, how about you lower your weapon?

312
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,610
他是个复制人!
He's a replicator!

313
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,860
你们都不相信我?  那我开枪了
你们看好了
What, you don't believe me? I'll shoot him, you'll see.

314
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
你完全没有必要这么做
我手里没武器
that won't be necessary. I've got my hands up

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,120
我对你不构成任何威胁
in a very non-threatening way.

316
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,660
我叫人去拿反复制人发生器了
I've called for an arg.

317
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,040
- 你相信他的话?
- 当然不
- You believe him?
- Of course not

318
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,840
但是那对你也不造成伤害
而且能让他把武器放下来
but it won't hurt you, and it might help him to lower his gun.

319
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,710
你跟他是同伙的
You're one of them, too.

320
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,590
你们别光站在那!  冲他们开枪
把他们俩都打死!
Don't just stand there! Shoot them. Shoot both of them!

321
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,270
我拿着这个  没必要对你们俩开枪吧?
I take it I don't have to shoot either of you with this?

322
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,320
真高兴没人受伤
I'm so glad no one was hurt.

323
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,820
你什么都不记得了吗
And you don't remember anything?

324
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,620
不记得了
No.

325
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,200
10岁之后  我就再也没梦游了
I haven't had a sleepwalking  incident since I was, like, 10.

326
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,290
这对有梦游症的人来说很正常
It's quite common for someone suffering from somnambulism

327
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,120
他们在睡眠中会表现复杂的行为
to perform complex activities in their sleep

328
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,080
醒来后就什么都不记得了
and remember nothing upon waking.

329
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,260
所以你们认为
这与我碰过那个水晶有关?
So you think this has something to do with the crystal I touched?

330
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,010
一切都是从那以后开始的
That's when it seemed to start.

331
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,930
罗恩中校并不是第一个
Major lorne's not the only one.

332
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,430
每个案例中  受害者都说你在噩梦面
扮演一个负面的角色
In each case, the person being affected reports you being a significant negative presence in the nightmare.

333
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,560
这又不是我能控制的
Well, I can't control that.

334
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,270
对  可或许某种东西能
No, but maybe something is.

335
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,770
什么?
What?

336
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,730
你认为有人在他们的梦里假扮我?
You think someone's impersonating me in their dreams?

337
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,950
我知道很多外星实体都能这么做
Look, I've seen more than my share of alien entities that are capable of this.

338
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,620
奥尼尔中校有一次被一种以水晶形式
存在的神秘力量所击晕
Colonel o'neill was once knocked unconscious by an energy being that lived in crystal form.

339
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,620
而且那东西一度还变成了他的样子
It took on his appearance for a while.

340
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,540
据我所知  你曾经被一个外星组织
所控制
I read at one point, you were taken over by an alien entity.

341
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,500
对
Yeah.

342
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,630
这不是什么光彩的事情
Not a personal highlight.

343
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,590
问题是  你到底想要说什么?
The question is, what's the point?

344
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,880
或许它以我们的恐惧为能量
Maybe it's feeding on our fear.

345
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,340
我闭嘴好了
I'll shut up.

346
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,140
不  不用  那东西没这么大的能耐
No, no, it's not that big a leap.

347
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,260
只不过...
It's just...

348
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,010
我们没有任何证据
we don't have any proof.

349
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,680
首先是泰勒
First, it was teyla.

350
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,390
接着到我
I was next, and then

351
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,890
罗恩是在我给他治疗后发生的
ronon after I treated him...

352
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,650
我才是那个碰过水晶的人
可我却从来没做过一场噩梦
well, I'm the one who touched the crystal, and I've never had a bad dream.

353
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,780
或许这就是你出现在大家梦里的
原因
Maybe that's why you're appearing in everyone's dreams.

354
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,860
无论是什么在做都冠上你的名义
Whatever's doing this imprinted your image onto itself.

355
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,950
现在我明白了  不管它可能是什么
Now that I think about it, it's possible whatever this is,

356
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,450
它只局限于通过触碰来传播
its spread may be limited by touch.

357
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,500
那好
Okay

358
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,460
谁在事故发生之前与罗恩中校
有过接触  都要被隔离
anyone who's had contact with major lorne since the incident needs to be isolated.

359
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,460
如果这真的与某些外星球影响有关
If this is some sort of alien influence,

360
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,920
我们必须得找到方法来探测它
we have to find a way to detect it.

361
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,590
罗德尼  坐啊
Sit down, rodney.

362
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,470
我这样也不错  谢谢
I'm good right here, thank you.

363
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,770
已经联系上所有飞行在外的队伍
告诉他们暂时不要回来了
All off-world teams have been contacted and instructed not to return for the time being.

364
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,730
如有必要的话 星门的通行得严加限制
Gate travel will be restricted to an as-needed basis,

365
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,900
在接到通知前  所有不必要的
出征队员
and until further notice, all non-essential expedion members

366
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,360
都要求呆在营房中
will be restricted to quarters.

367
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,230
拜托 有必要这么做吗
Come on, is this really necessary?

368
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,900
不过是些噩梦而已  对吧?
It's just a few bad dreams, right?

369
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,070
说真的
The fact is,

370
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,360
我们还不清楚我们要对付的是什么
we don't really know what we're dealing with.

371
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,410
我们身边可能会有一个外星组织
We may have an alien entity on our hands

372
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,040
他们会随意地出现在任何人之间
capable of moving from person to person at will.

373
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,330
目前为止  我们能得知的唯一信息是
他们是怀有一定的恶意的
And so far, the only behavior we have to evaluate suggests a certain malice.

374
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,210
基于大家告诉我的信息
Now, based on what's been described to me,

375
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,210
谢帕德上校出现在大家梦中的形象
the personification of colonel sheppard in everyone's dreams is

376
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,760
都表现得是个不怀好意的人
behaving much like a sociopath.

377
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,800
那我有山羊胡子吗
Did I have a goatee?

378
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,550
目前  它只会让人做噩梦而已
Right now, all it's doing is causing some nightmares

379
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,140
但我们并不知道它到底有多大能耐
but we don't know if that's the limit of its capability.

380
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,520
你的意思是  这只是个开始
You're saying this is only the beginning.

381
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,310
我从没 见过这种事情
I've never profiled anything like this before.

382
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,020
它很可能会慢慢发展
It will likely progress,

383
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,730
并试图把危害扩大  造成大范围的影响
try to drive up the stakes, seek bigger thrills.

384
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,780
现在即使它局限于只能
能操纵一个人的潜在意识
Now, even if it's limited to manipulating the host's subconscious,

385
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,490
它也能对人造成严重的危害
it may be able to put someone in serious jeopardy.

386
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,660
我们到底在讨论什么  鬼王弗兰迪吗?
So, what are we talking, freddy krueger here?

387
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,370
拜托  我们现在连一丁点证据
都没有呢
Oh, come on! We don't have a single shred of hard evidence here.

388
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,330
我是说  就算我们有证据
那也只不过是一个可怕的人而已
I mean, until we do, this thing is just a bogeyman.

389
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,210
这就是为什么你们要回到
Exactly why you're going back to the planet

390
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,790
那个谢帕德上校摸到那块水晶的星球上
where colonel sheppard touched the crystal.

391
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,710
什么
What?

392
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,580
我们为什么要这么做?
Why would we do that?

393
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,840
正如你所说
Well, just as you said,

394
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,750
去收集点确凿的证据
to gather some hard evidence

395
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,840
去看看还有没有类似的东西
see if there are any more of these things.

396
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,430
我们得确切地知道它们是什么
它们又是怎么样运作的
We need to find out exactly what they are, and how they work,

397
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,010
如果可以的话 怎么去预防它
就像现在在罗恩体内那个
and if possible, how to detect if there really is something inside lorne right now.

398
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,850
谢谢
Thank you.

399
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,150
但  但你刚说取消星际飞行
But-but you said no more gate travel.

400
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,940
我认为那个决定很明智
I thought that was a wise decision.

401
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,110
我说过是在需要的基础上  麦凯
I said on an as-needed basis, mckay.

402
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,070
我想这个能行
I think this qualifies.

403
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,280
对  你不认为一个科学小组更合适...
Yeah, but don't you think a science team would be better suited for--

404
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,450
你就是一个科学小组  记得吗?
you are a science team, remember?

405
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,990
好吧  可你应该知道这是个很大的
星球
Okay, fine, but it's a big planet, you know.

406
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,250
我们可以投入更多人力
We could really use some more manpower.

407
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,790
我还是不敢相信你居然真让我
干这个
I still can't believe you're making me do this.

408
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,590
你赌输啦
Ah, you lost the bet.

409
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,710
这星球上一定存在着什么
There's definitely something on this planet.

410
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,050
对  但我很清楚的说过  是"有价值的"
东西
Yes, but I distinctly said "of value."

411
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,340
我可不认为这次探索有价值
I hardly call this particular discovery valuable.

412
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,010
这里
Over here.

413
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,060
就是这儿
There you go.

414
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,390
赶紧开始吧
Better get started.

415
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,320
- 罗德尼
- 什么事?
- Rodney...
- hmm?

416
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,070
别往里看
Don't look in it,

417
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,740
还有  无论你做什么  别碰它
and whatever you do, don't touch it.

418
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,030
我甚至都没在意它
I wasn't even thinking about it.

419
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
瑞迪克  这儿有株活的
Radek, we got a live one here.

420
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,830
比较下这两个应该会有帮助
It could be useful to compare the two.

421
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,330
那只是我的想法
That's just what I was thinking.

422
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,920
但是要小心  想摘取一株带有
活动实体的可能很危险
But be careful. It could be dangerous to try to harvest one with an active entity in it.

423
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,500
你又猜对了我的想法  可是
Once again, you've read my mind. However,

424
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,840
在你说完之后  我还是要说
你应该试试
when you're finished there, I say you give it a shot.

425
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,090
对  应该试试
Yeah, give it a shot.

426
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,930
你真认为带一株活的回去是安全的?
You really think it was safe to bring a live one back?

427
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,060
这些容积箱是不具备传导性的
Those containment tanks are non-conductive.

428
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,270
我们认为它需要传导性物质
才能移动
We believe it needs conductive material in order to travel.

429
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,650
而拥有一颗活水晶
And having an active crystal

430
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,610
能让我们校正这些手拿探测器
allows us to calibrate these hand-held sensors

431
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,530
来探测和它相关的能量踪迹
to detect the energy signatures associated with it.

432
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,910
幸运的话  如果某人体内携带了这些
生物  我们就能查出来
Hopefully, we'll be able to determine if someone is carrying one of these creatures inside of them.

433
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,990
只要它不知道我们的目的
As long as it doesn't know what we're up to.

434
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,750
否则  在我们扫描他们之前
它就会从那个人身体里转移出去
Otherwise, you'd think it would just transfer out of somebody before we could scan them.

435
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,040
你的推测是  他们不仅有能力还有
意识  并且随时处在戒备状态
You're assuming they're not only capable, but they're conscious and aware at all times.

436
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,130
它展示了到目前为止极高的智商
It's demonstrated pretty sophisticated intelligence so far.

437
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,300
你认为它有基础防御技能
You think it would have basic avoidance skills.

438
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,550
我们得修正下扫描仪以便在更大的
范围内操作来...
We're going to have to modify our scanners to operate at a range large enough to...

439
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,970
等等
wait a minute

440
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,470
- 我们可以校正城市范围生命迹像监测仪
- 哦  是啊 巫师先生
- we could calibrate the city-wide life-signs detector--
- oh, yes, mr. Wizard,

441
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,770
我们只需要打个响指  然后...
we're just going to snap our fingers and--

442
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,310
你在干嘛?
what are you doing?

443
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,140
我不知道  它...
I don't know, it'S..

444
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
它能将人催眠
it's mesmerizing.

445
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,770
你说过它很安全
You said it was safe.

446
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,940
我们说的是我们认为  但是...
We said we think. Still...

447
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,900
我不知道我刚刚做了些什么
I don't know what I was doing.

448
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,360
真难以置信  我突然有种冲动
很想去碰它
I can't believe it. I was suddenly overcome by the compulsion to want to touch it.

449
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,320
嗯  我们认为它就是那样
Yeah, we think that's how it...

450
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,240
捆住受害者的
ropes in its victims.

451
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,970
不在他体内
It's not in him.

452
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,100
你说过实体需要传导性物质才能
移动  对吗?
You said the entity needed conductive material to travel, right?

453
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,980
呃  根据...
Well, based on the...

454
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,020
是能量管
it's the power conduits.

455
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,650
它们几乎遍布整个城市
They run pretty much through the entire city.

456
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,520
它可能在任何人的体内
It could be in anyone.

457
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,900
凯特
Kate,

458
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,490
你在干嘛?
what are you doing?

459
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,740
我不想死
I don't want to die.

460
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,320
很好  从那儿下来
Good. Come down from there.

461
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,750
我不能
I can'T.

462
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,790
为什么不?
Why not?

463
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,920
帮帮我  求你了
Help me, please!

464
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,960
约翰  放开我
John, stop it.

465
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,380
放手  我得帮她
Stop it. I have to help her!

466
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,590
你在干嘛呢?
What are you doing?

467
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,760
约翰  走开!
John, get out of the way!

468
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,140
泰勒!
Teyla!

469
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,390
泰勒!
Teyla!

470
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,140
凯特!
Kate!

471
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,240
她没有出勤  我没法叫醒她
She did not report for duty and I can't wake her up.

472
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,630
她死了
She's dead.

473
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,620
我是卡特中校
This is colonel carter.

474
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,870
各位请注意
If I could have  your attention, please.

475
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,170
我很遗憾的告诉大家  今天我们失去
了探险队里一名十分宝贵的成员
I'm very sorry  to have to tell you  that we have lost  a valuable member  of the expedition today.

476
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,090
凯特·赫特米尔医生对我们所以人来说
都很重要
Dr. Kate heightmeyer meant  a great deal to all of us.

477
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,510
她的死是个巨大的悲剧
Her death  is nothing short of tragic.

478
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,800
同样  我也很遗憾的告诉大家  我们
面临的威胁仍然存在于我们之中
I'm also sorry  to have to report  that the threat we face  is still in our midst,

479
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,390
在进一步通知之前
and until further notice,

480
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,020
全面防范紧闭条款仍然有效
the full lockdown protocol  will remain in effect.

481
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,520
请尽量保持平静
Try to remain calm.

482
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,360
我们正竭尽全力保障大家的安全
We are doing everything we can  to ensure everyone's safety

483
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,150
并尽快解决现状
and to resolve this situation  quickly.

484
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,030
谢谢
Thank you.

485
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,410
那很好
That was good.

486
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,040
我是说
I mean,

487
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,170
当然很可怕
horrible, obviously.

488
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,210
恐怖而且可怕
Terrifying and horrible,

489
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,790
可我只是...
but I just...

490
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,550
我想说你听上去很坚强
I meant you sounded strong.

491
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,840
我肯定听到你的声音  他们至少会
感到一丝安慰
I'm sure they were at least a little reassured hearing your voice

492
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,220
当然你不需要我告诉你这些
but you don't need me to tell you that.

493
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,640
像今天这样  没关系
A day like this, it doesn't hurt.

494
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,730
谢谢
Thanks

495
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,660
我正准备来看你  可是
I was just about to come to see you, but

496
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,170
我不确定你是否想见我
I wasn't sure if you wanted to see me.

497
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,690
卡特中校?  打扰下
Uh, colonel carter? Excuse me.

498
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,110
我想我能够校正城市范围监测仪
I think I've managed to calibrate the city-wide sensors.

499
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,950
我是说  如果它能正常工作
I mean, if it is working properly.

500
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,200
我们有些麻烦...
We had some trouble with the...

501
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,660
我们检测到了一个
we have a positive reading.

502
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,580
知道是谁吗?
Do we know who that is?

503
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,670
你找我干嘛?
What do you need me for?

504
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,380
橡胶墙怎么回事?
What's with the rubber walls?

505
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,930
很抱歉  罗德尼
I'm sorry, rodney.

506
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,140
我必须走了
I have to go.

507
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,060
你在开玩笑吧
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

508
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,410
在罗德尼体内?
It's in rodney?

509
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,040
隔离室被绝缘材料包围着
The isolation room has been lined with insulating material

510
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,210
以防实体从他身上转移到其他人
体内
to prevent the entity from transferring out of him and into someone else.

511
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,170
如果我们没错
If we're right,

512
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,830
我们将它困住了
we've got it trapped.

513
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,920
是啊  可那帮不了麦凯  对吗?
Yeah, well, that doesn't help mckay much, does it?

514
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,670
如果这玩意在梦中将人至于死地
If this thing kills people in their sleep...

515
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,670
我们得想办法让它从他体内出来
we've got to find a way to get it out of him.

516
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,550
有人给我杯咖啡吗?  我已经觉得有点
困了
Someone want to  get me some coffee?  I'm already feeling  a little tired here.

517
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,470
我能给他点东西让他暂时保持清醒
I could give him something to keep him awake for a while, but

518
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,230
可它只能坚持一小会儿  在那之后
他将会有肺衰竭的危险
it will only work for so long before we start putting him at risk of pulmonary failure.

519
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,600
相信我  我很了解
Yeah, believe it or not, I've been there before, too.

520
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,650
你尽力吧
Do what you can.

521
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,400
我们会想到办法的
We'll try to come up with something.

522
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,280
坚持住  麦凯!
Hang in there, mckay!

523
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,740
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

524
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,570
好像我有很多选择似的
Like I have much choice.

525
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,460
你觉得它知道自己被困住了吗?
Do you think it knows it's trapped?

526
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,790
我不知道  怎么了?
I don't know, why?

527
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,590
或许有个办法...
Maybe there's a way to...

528
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,470
我不知道  和它理论
I don't know, reason with it.

529
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,970
呆在韦尔博士的旧办公室里让你
想到了这个  对吗?
Being in dr. Weir's old office made you think of that, didn't it?

530
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,390
通常我直接朝坏蛋开枪
Normally I just shoot the bad guys.

531
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,190
我们刚听说了
We just heard.

532
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,600
一定有我们能帮忙的
There must to be something we can do.

533
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,560
我们正在讨论这个
That's what we're talking about.

534
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,280
好吧  就算你能和它沟通
Okay, let's say for a second that you could somehow communicate with it.

535
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,650
你打算说些什么呢?
What were you planning on saying?

536
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,400
我不知道  我还没想到那里
I don't know, I hadn't gotten that far.

537
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,030
我害怕如果它靠恐惧生存  或者更糟...
It strikes me that if it feeds on fear, or worse,

538
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,330
比如杀死寄主的刺激感  那么...
likes the thrill of killing its host, then...

539
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,040
它就会抓住最后的机会
well, it would take the last chance it had.

540
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,960
杀死麦凯
To kill mckay.

541
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,540
那生存呢?
What about survival?

542
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,340
它被困住了
It's trapped.

543
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,300
如果没有一个活的寄主供它转移
它会死吗?
Will it die without a living host to transfer to?

544
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,930
我可不希望找到答案
I was hoping not to find out.

545
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,970
我们可以给它一个离开的机会
We could give it a chance to leave.

546
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,850
回家
Go home.

547
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,060
- 回到水晶里
- 对  当然  为什么不呢?
- Back into the crystal.
- Yeah, sure, why not?

548
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,680
让它通过星际之门回到自己的
星球上
Send it through the gate back to its planet.

549
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,400
我以前听说过人们能够在梦里
清醒的交谈
I have heard of people being talked through waking dreams before.

550
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,770
或许
Maybe...

551
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,530
或许麦凯能够被催眠
maybe mckay can be hypnotized into

552
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,650
进入一种能和它交谈的状态
a state where he could somehow communicate with it.

553
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,740
他曾成功地通过冥想进入一种
转换的状态
He has successfully meditated into an altered state before.

554
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,700
对  那是在他被基因转化了之后
Yeah, that was after he was genetically altered.

555
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,410
对不起  什么?
I'm sorry, what?

556
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
你们想让麦凯叫这玩意离开?
You want mckay to ask this thing to leave?

557
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,330
我们在谈论麦凯
We are talking about mckay.

558
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,540
可怕的并不只是他的力量
Scary things are not exactly his strength

559
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,760
他还面对着一个明显能操控他
潜意识的生物
And he is up against a creature apparently capable of manipulating his subconscious.

560
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,430
我希望能有办法让我们中一人进去
I wish there was a way for one of us to get in there.

561
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,970
进入麦凯的梦中?
Into mckay's dreams?

562
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,390
对
Yeah, you know,

563
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,140
帮助他  给他一些精神上的支持
help him out, give him a little moral support.

564
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,520
拜托
Come on

565
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,520
你见多识广  难道没遇到一种能让人
进入其他人梦境的办法吗?
all the things you've seen, you've never come across a way for one person to get into another person's dreams?

566
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,860
她去哪儿?
Where's she going?

567
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,400
怎么回事?
What's going on?

568
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,990
我不知道  但我觉得
I don't know, but I think

569
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,240
我就快要看到麦凯不为人知的
一面了
I'm about to see a side of mckay I never wanted to see.

570
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,200
不一定非是你不可
It does not have to be you.

571
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,540
当然  是我出的馊注意
Yeah, well, it's my bad idea.

572
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,040
是什么?
What was?

573
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,960
那个...
What...

574
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,340
十年前我们首次碰到这种技术
we first encountered the technology 10 years ago

575
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,550
在一个星球上  那里大屠杀的幸存者
on a planet where the survivors of a holocaust

576
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,680
完全生活在他们意识里的虚拟
世界里
were living entirely in a virtual world created in their minds.

577
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,350
从那以后  我们能修正并将它用于
星际小组成员的虚拟现实训练中
Since then, we've managed to modify it for use in the vr training of sg team members.

578
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,100
只需要一些轻微的校正就能将它
转入潜意识活跃状态
It only took some minor calibrations to tune it in to subconscious activity.

579
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,850
那么谢帕德会看见麦凯的梦?
So sheppard is actually going to see mckay's dreams?

580
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,820
老实说  我们没有检测技术在这方面
的作用
Well, to be honest, the technology is untested for use in this manner.

581
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,900
梦境比有意识的思维更随意
Dreams are much more random than conscious thought.

582
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,620
系统或许很难传达麦凯脑子里的
想法
It may be difficult for the system to translate what's going on in mckay's brain

583
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,740
使谢帕德中校理解
so that colonel sheppard can understand it.

584
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,250
我只希望他们两能够有办法互动
I'm just hoping that the two of them will be able to interact somehow.

585
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,210
你确定吗?
You sure about this?

586
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,630
不确定
Not really.

587
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,140
我有点糊涂了
I'm pretty screwed up.

588
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,720
我知道
You're telling me.

589
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,760
你准备好了我们就开始
We're ready if you are.

590
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,020
谢谢
Thanks.

591
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,270
我什么都没做呢
I haven't done anything yet

592
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,520
谢谢你的尝试
For trying

593
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,270
还有别说我没警告过你
and don't say I didn't warn you.

594
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,230
注入镇静剂
Administering sedative.

595
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,950
什么都没发生
Nothing's happening here.

596
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,750
他还没开始做梦
He's not dreaming yet.

597
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,240
哦  天啊
Oh, boy.

598
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,530
好鲸鱼
Nice whale.

599
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,110
乖鲸鱼  你是我的朋友
Nice whale, you're my friend.

600
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,990
你不想吃我
You don't want to eat me.

601
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,990
放弃吧
Give up.

602
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,950
你不会成功的
You'll never make it.

603
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,460
你太弱小了
You're too weak.

604
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,960
谢谢  谢谢你的鼓励  帮帮我
Oh, thank you. Thanks for the encouragement. Way to help out.

605
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,670
我为什么要帮你?
Why would I want to help you?

606
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,590
因为我以为
Because I thought you--

607
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,250
那不是我  罗德尼
that's not me, rodney.

608
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,170
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

609
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,380
你真可悲
You're pathetic.

610
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,840
你也会被卷进来
You might as well jump in.

611
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,890
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

612
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
哦  上帝啊
Oh, god,

613
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,980
我得回去  我得回去
那是我唯一的机会
I have to get back. I have to get back. It's my only chance.

614
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,860
你会死在这儿
You're going to die out here.

615
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,900
闭嘴!
Shut up!

616
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,110
别听他的  罗德尼
Don't listen to him, rodney.

617
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,320
你说的轻松!
你为什么不帮我划船?
That's easy for you to say! Why don't you help me row?

618
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,700
知道吗  这比我想象的更奇怪
You know, this really isn't as strange as you lead me to believe.

619
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,790
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

620
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,830
那个怎么样?
What about that?

621
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,630
我讨厌小丑
I hate clowns.

622
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,090
你们可以尽情的划
You can paddle all you want.

623
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,260
可你们哪儿都去不了
You're not going anywhere.

624
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
他说的对  我们会死在这儿
He's right! I'm going to die out here!

625
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,890
他想让你害怕  别让他得逞
He wants you to be afraid. Don't give him what he wants!

626
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,560
他不能真的伤害你
He can't really hurt you.

627
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,890
那你就错了
That's where you're wrong.

628
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,240
出什么事了?
What happened?

629
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,530
准备
Clear.

630
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,570
他心脏停搏
He's in cardiac arrest.

631
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,630
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

632
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,380
我已经尽力了
I've done all I can.

633
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,340
他死了
He's dead.

634
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,250
这都是你的错  约翰
This is all your fault, john.

635
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,340
如果你没碰那个该死的石头
麦凯现在还活着
If you hadn't touched that stupid rock, mckay would still be alive right now.

636
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,010
我以为你会帮助他
I thought you were going to help him.

637
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,930
我试了
I tried.

638
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,180
你真够朋友
Some friend you are.

639
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,890
中校  妥协吧
Colonel, you've been compromised.

640
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,520
我决定将你离职
I'm relieving you of duty.

641
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,610
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

642
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,500
没事了  没事了
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

643
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,660
尽量放松
Just try to relax.

644
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,620
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

645
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,330
你刚刚心脏停搏了
You were in cardiac arrest.

646
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,460
那个实体
The entity...

647
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,800
它在谢帕德中校体内
it's in colonel sheppard.

648
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,890
你现在可以放弃
You can quit now.

649
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,270
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

650
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,900
哦  是的  你怕
Oh, yes, you are.

651
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,900
我是你唯一害怕的
I'm the one thing you are afraid of.

652
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,490
你让你的朋友失望了
You failed your friends.

653
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,360
你给他们带来灾难
You brought this on them

654
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,910
却没有办法阻止它!
and there is nothing you can do to stop it!

655
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,320
他的心率很高  这很危险
His heart rate is dangerously high.

656
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,150
你能叫醒他吗?
Can you wake him up?

657
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,990
我可以试试  可是以他的身体状况
事情可能变得更糟
I could try, but in his physical state, that could make things worse.

658
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,870
而且实体仍将在他体内
Yes, and the entity would still be in him.

659
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,830
把我和他再连接起来
Hook me up to him again.

660
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,950
起来
Get up.

661
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,160
来啊  约翰
Come on, john.

662
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,540
打啊!
Fight!

663
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,120
不
No.

664
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,290
那正是你想要得
That's what you want.

665
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,750
赫特米尔的死都是你的错
It's your fault heightmeyer's dead.

666
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,050
麦凯的死也是你的错!
Your fault mckay is dead!

667
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,590
我没死
I'm not dead.

668
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,270
你赢不了
You can't win.

669
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,570
是的  我们可以
Yes, we can.

670
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,150
你害怕电击  所以我还活着
You're vulnerable to electric shock. That's why I'm still alive.

671
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,280
你在完成工作之前就离开了
You left before you could finish the job!

672
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,330
这到底怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

673
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,740
你是哪一个?
Which one are you?

674
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,860
是我
Me.

675
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,870
好的你还是坏的你?
Good you or bad you?

676
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,580
是我  是我
Me me.

677
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,120
是真的你吗?
Is that... you you?

678
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,960
我想是
I think so.

679
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,340
谢谢
Thanks.

680
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,460
好吧  这真太奇怪了
Okay, this is really weird.

681
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,380
我知道
You're telling me.

682
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,550
我还以为会有很多...辣妹呢
I thought there'd be more... hot girls

683
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,390
是啊
Yeah

684
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,610
我有个主意
Hey I have an idea.

685
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,860
我们离开这儿如何?
How about we get out of here?

686
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,610
听起来不错
Sounds like a plan.

687
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,130
睡不着
Couldn't sleep.

688
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,630
嗯  我也是
Yeah, me too.

689
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,140
- 尽管我之前吃了些零食...
- 嗯  我们都睡不着
Thought I'd have a little snack before I... yeah, we couldn't sleep either.
