111
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,990
Behati在我这

112
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,020
我们需要Candice到标记处来

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,110

准备登台

117
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,880
我觉得我从小到大

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,170
就一直在模拟天桥走秀

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,460
我第一次知道时尚秀时

120
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,150
我好像才四岁

121
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,710
我的梦想

122
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,700
就是参加维密时尚内衣秀

123
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,140
对于来自巴西小镇的我来说

124
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,130
这太了不起了

125
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,290
我就想成为那些女孩中的一员

126
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,720
加入这个不可思议的大家庭

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
我18岁时

128
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,610
我就定下目标

129
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,000
要参加维密时尚内衣秀

130
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,170
却不知道这意味着什么

131
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,070
我当时年纪小  缺乏安全感  很害怕

132
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,220
我来维密的第一件事

133
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,340
就是参加时尚内衣秀的模特选拔

134
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,050
很多人问我们

135
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,250
你们选拔都看重什么

136
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,130
对我们来说  最重要的是找到

137
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,390
热情向上  积极开朗的人

138
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,870
我们要找一位美丽健康的女性

139
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,660
我从没这么紧张过

140
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,900
把果冻和水泥混起来的感觉

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,310
-就是当时我腿的感觉  -慢点  慢点

142
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,880
这是个成为巨星的好机会

143
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
这是个成为巨星的好机会

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,310
我当时很年轻  对我来说简直不可思议

145
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,150
我能够参加走秀  能够站上天桥

146
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,740
我见到了Heidi  Laetitia  Stephanie

147
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,800
还有Tyra Banks  Gisele  Adriana

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,980
天呐天呐  真不敢相信我居然在这

149
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,790
她们太美了

150
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,990
I never imagined that I would be on that runway.

151
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,180
我从未想过自己能参与维密内衣秀

152
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,690
"And we're gonna let it burn, burn, burn "

153
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,260
"Burn, we're gonna let it burn... "

154
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,360
My first time doing the VS Fashion Show,

155
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,560
第一次加入维密内衣秀

156
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,180
改变了我的模特生涯

157
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,380
维密能推动你的事业

158
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,070
提高了我的知名度

159
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,200
提高了我的知名度

160
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,310
大家都知道你是谁

161
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,410
大家都知道你是谁

162
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,270

331
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,120
"This ain't no texting "

332
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,750
"No, I got no biz, but it is what it is "

333
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,950
"I don't really have much to say "

334
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,310
"I was over it

335
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,810
"The second that I saw her name "

336
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,240
"I got two, two

337
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,410
"Two letters for you

338
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,230
"One of them's whoo! And the other one's "

339
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,900
"'Cause what you got to do is go get yourself a clue "

340
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,200
"Only two, two, two

341
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,010
"Letters to choose

"One of them's whoo! And the other one's "

343
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,100
"SMH, I'm pressing send on you "

344
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,830
"Could've been this, couldn't been that "

345
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,720
"We done been there, we done been back "

346
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,640
"You ain't with it, could've said that "

347
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,540
"Why you trippin', let me hear that "

348
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,040
"I ain't trying to argue all morning "

349
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,910
"I do it all for you

350
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,880
"You know you're my right eye "

351
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,760
368 00:20: 00:21:01,059 "Baby, let me show you

352
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,970
"Oh, I know what's been going on "

353
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,660
"Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant "

354
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,850
"What makes you think I'll stick around "

355
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,130
"I'm not as stupid as you sound, and you "

356
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,290
"Sound really dumb right now

357
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,230
"From A to zed

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,800
"Ooh, ah

"I got a lot of nasty things

"Blowing up in my head

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,940
"But none of them are worth my time "

362
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,000
"You're not even worth this rhyme "

363
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,860
"And I don't, I don't "

364
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,610
"Give a flying

"Yeah "Letters for you "

"What you trippin' on, huh" "

381
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,050
"Girl, you know you're wrong, huh "

382
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,020
"Don't let these girls drive you crazy "

"I was over it the second that I saw her name "

"SMH, I'm pressing send on you "

392
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,660
"I got two, two, two letters for you... "

393
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,460
停止排放干冰

394
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,060
停止排放干冰

395
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,780
Clyde  倒数60秒  撤下巴黎街灯

396
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,700
"'Cause what you gotta do "

397
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,530
"Is go get yourself a clue

"Only two, two, two, two...

00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,730
"I'm pressing send on you. "

400
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
今年的假日广告是在巴黎拍的

401
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,060
开拍

402
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,660
犹如梦境一般

403
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,580
妙不可言

404
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,420
我们决定在夜间拍摄

405
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,050
午夜拍广告  感觉有些挑逗

406
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,070
从全新的视角来拍摄

407
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,880
内衣和天使们

408
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,210
我们睡了一白天  晚上八点才开始做造型

409
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,740
接着整晚都在拍广告

410
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,320
我们的生物钟的确与众不同

411
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,420
凌晨六点  我们还在香榭丽舍大街拍外景

412
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,670
当时我只穿着内衣

413
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,250
戴着翅膀走来走去  没啥大不了的

414
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,800
开拍

415
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,270
"I've been infected with restless "

416
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,590
"Whispers and cheats...

417
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,180
巴黎的夜晚灯火绚烂

418
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,450
它是光明之城

419
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,040
我们真的点亮了它的光芒

420
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,580
维密公司花下重金

421
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,050
让埃菲尔铁塔整晚闪烁

422
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,250
难以置信的美丽  特别和浪漫

423
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,490
"Thanit mafested...

424
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,040
我当时真是冻得要命

425
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,680
天上还下着雪

426
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,510
要是让我受冻

427
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,320
我就会不开心

428
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,830
这次的拍摄场面特别宏大

429
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,270
拍了许多动人心魄的美丽场景

430
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,440
是展现演技的好机会

431
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,850
为了展现性感  我通常会做这样的表情

432
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,720
这是搞怪版Behati

433
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,600
有点二的Behati

434
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,700
这是性感版Candice

435
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,670
这才叫性感

436
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,520
有何贵干

437
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,190
大概有一千多位娱记

438
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,580
想要拍到我们的照片

439
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,130
但广告拍摄依旧顺利

440
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,610
没什么能阻挡维密假日广告

441
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,500
Lais非常出色

442
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,300
她是我认识的最甜美

443
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,770
最温柔  最美丽的姑娘

444
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,360
我从没在天桥上摔倒过

445
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,840
但世事无常  一旦发生后果极其沉重

446
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,850
参加这个秀是每个女孩的梦想

447
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,310
我十分重视它

448
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,280
去年在彩排的时候

449
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,910
不知道怎么回事

450
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,830
我突然摔倒了

451
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,250
我觉得我的脚踝断了

452
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,440
恐惧感会一直萦绕在你脑海中

453
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,910
这件事真的特别可怕

454
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,240
在彩排中扭伤脚踝

455
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,030
然后无法参加走秀

456
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,030
这事太让人伤心了

457
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,910
好了

458
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,440
大家都吓坏了

459
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,910
因为他们说

460
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,840
看上去很严重

461
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,860
她的脚踝好像真的断了

462
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,060
我当然特别沮丧

463
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,780
我开始哭泣

464
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,560
当时的场面特别沉重

465
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,190
第二天  我醒来

466
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,290
试着站起来

467
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,470
还是不行

468
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,870
没法走路

469
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,620
我不得不

470
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,540
穿起她的装扮  替她走秀

471
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,720
那感觉太糟糕了

472
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,700
穿着她的装扮太难受了

473
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,400
因为那本是她的  不该由我去展现

474
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,210
今年  我做了更充足的准备

475
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,290
Lais  出来让我们看看吧

476
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,300
辣妹哟

477
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,340
试衣的时候

478
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,710
我告诉他们  如果我又摔倒

479
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,590
我一定会挥着翅膀飞起来

480
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,390
因为去年你出了意外  所以今年

481
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,370
我们希望你来走这个单元的开场

482
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,370
叫作"天堂飞鸟"

483
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,000
感谢你

484
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,970
抱歉

485
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,520
今晚  我无比兴奋和快乐

486
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,340
也很紧张

487
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,160
我希望Lais今年

488
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,460
能走一场最美妙的秀

489
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,180
穿最热辣的衣服

490
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,390
希望一切都如她所愿

491
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,520
我们都会在她身后支持她

492
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
为她欢呼

493
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,980
我一定会在后台支持她

494
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,150

其实都是社交媒体上的明星

600
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,490
发些东西到网上很好啊

602
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,640
我最开始接触的是Twitter

603
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
我从那里得到所有的消息

604
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,260
没有Instagram没法活啊

605
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,070
我觉得Facebook很棒

不好意思

609
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,060
她在社交媒体上很有影响力

610
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,390
这很好啊

611
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,330
网络平台很自由

612
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,330
没有任何限制  畅所欲言

613
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,320
她特别大胆

614
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,060
我没考虑太多  想做什么就做什么

615
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,600
我喜欢她这态度

616
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,810
她们的粉丝多得吓人

617
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,220
我在Instagram上有290万粉丝

618
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,710
总共得有上千万的粉丝

619
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,650
我每隔三四分钟

620
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,830
就会拿起手机看看

621
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,780
每次打开手机  都会看到新的东西

622
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,020
我发的大多都关于

623
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,610
家庭  工作和慈善的东西

624
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,930
鼓舞人心的名人名言

625
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,620
积极向上的消息

626
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,430
有时我发了不该发的照片

627
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,780
我所拥有的一切

628
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,270
就可能立刻毁于一旦

629
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,630
就好像按了一个巨大的红色按钮

630
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,660
一切瞬间爆炸

631
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,630
小心哦

632
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,180
悔推  你不能发任何让你后悔的东西

633
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,640
我想我以前删过一些东西

634
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,210
但我不记得是什么了

635
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,360
-删除  -我还没碰到情况糟糕到

636
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,650
我得找我的经纪人  让他"快删掉"

637
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,100
Instagram蒙羞

638
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,880
生命苦短  没空在Instagram上蒙羞

639
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,250
随便去谷歌搜一搜

640
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,730
很容易就搜到我的屁股了

641
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,940
太疯狂了

642
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,080
咱们现在应该干点坏事儿

643
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,310
-我知道  有"助"形象  -没错

644
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,860
这个品牌在世界上如此闻名

645
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,790
也得益于她们那些社交活动

646
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,830
这也是工作的一部分

647
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,590
是吗

651
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,690

652
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,970
穿上这身美丽的衣服还有翅膀

653
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,360
真是无比荣幸

654
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,680
其他人为我第一次表演而紧张

655
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,740
这也让我很紧张

656
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,890
我没办法停止  我脸上

657
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,330
这傻乎乎的笑  我都笑了好几周了

她才华横溢

744
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,250
还那么美丽

745
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,280
Taylor是典型的美国女孩

746
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,850
她就像美国梦一样

747
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,980
我想我们一定会玩得很开心的

748

太棒了

749
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,160
-我们已经是好多年的朋友  -闺蜜

750
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,850
看到她在工作的同时

751
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,420

752
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,060

753
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,680

广告之后  我的闺蜜Taylor Swift即将登台

756
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,610
要如何成为一位天使呢

757
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,670
竭尽全力

758
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,930
即使那样也还是不够

759
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,570
"I want your body, everybody wants your body "

760
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,960
"So let's jack, let's jack... "

761
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,120
这需要集中精力

762
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,530
需要下定决心  需要付出耐力

763
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,100
但缺乏力量的美是空洞的

764
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,300
这些姑娘的训练堪比专业运动员

765

我为走秀而锻炼

770
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,470
I work out for the runway, but mostly I work out for life.

771
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,330
但更多时候是在为自己的人生而锻炼

772
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:30,630
但更多时候是在为自己的人生而锻炼

773
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,500
