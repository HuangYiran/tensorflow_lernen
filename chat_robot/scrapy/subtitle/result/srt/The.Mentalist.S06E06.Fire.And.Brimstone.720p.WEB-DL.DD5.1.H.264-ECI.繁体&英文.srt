我們得找到基拉·汀斯利
We need to find kira tinsley.

21
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,410
她要么跟血腥約翰是一伙的
She either works for Red John,

22
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,500
要么馬上就要成為他下一個目標了
or she's about to become his next victim.

誰干的  告訴我
Who did this to you? Tell me.

00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,950
簡  她說什么了
Jane, what did she say?

25
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,300
她說血腥約翰左肩膀有個紋身
She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder--

26
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,570
三個點
Three dots.

Jane, don't do this, not without me.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,050
紋身嗎
A tattoo?

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,870
對
Yes.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,190
我們可以用那個來確定血腥約翰的身份
That we can use to identify Red John?

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,720
-是的  -太好了
- Yes. - That's great.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,810
所以我們只要一個個檢查疑犯
So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects

46
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,040
看哪個人身上就紋身就行了
one by one until we find out who has the tattoo.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,990
不行
No.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
為什么不行
Why not?

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,030
血腥約翰還不知道我發現紋身的事
Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
好吧
Okay.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,220
所以如果我們去查他們
So if we start checking suspects,

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
很有可能血腥約翰會發現此事
it's very likely that red john will find out.

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,690
然后在我們還沒機會接近他的時候就銷聲匿跡
And disappear before we have a chance of getting him.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,900
正是如此
Exactly.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,270
那你們打算怎么辦
Then what do you want to do?

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
把五名疑犯同時
Gather all five suspects together

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,070
集合到一個地方
at the same place, same time,

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,880
然后再檢查是否有紋身
And then start checking for the tattoo.

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,760
如何才能做到呢
And how do we do that?

60
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,570
就直接叫他們過來
We'll ask them.

61
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,330
你覺得他們會同意嗎
And you think they'll agree?

62
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,700
沒打算給他們選擇的余地
Wasn't planning on giving them a choice.

63
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,570
就算成行了  還有個問題
Even so, there's a problem.

in connection to two homicides.

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,820
對  二十多年前的懸案
Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago.

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,530
真的假的
You're kidding,

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,650
都過去那么多年了
after all this time,

69
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,180
聯調局現在才跟進嗎
the F.B.I. is moving in now?

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,590
他們肯定是有了什么新的
Well, they must have found something new--

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,020
-法醫證據  目擊證人  -那斯特爾斯在哪
- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles?

72
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,480
關鍵就是這個  沒人知道他在哪
Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows,

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,560

Not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago.

74
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,010

We'll find him.

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,430

必須找到他
We have to.

我配合你的計劃
I'm on board with your plan.

I want to be there when you reveal Red John.

Okay.

83
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,480
我說真的
Seriously.

84
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,280
-我說了好的  -說是說了  但你說的肯定不算數
- I said okay. - Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,330
是嗎  你怎么知道
Did I not? Uh, how can you tell?

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
這事沒有商量的余地  簡
This is non-negotiable, Jane.

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,760
我百分百同意
I agree 100%.

88
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,650
我認為我之前說得夠清楚了  探員們
I think I've made myself clear, agents.

89
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,740
我完全不知道布萊特·斯特爾斯在哪
I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts.

90
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,940
對  你說了
Yes,

91
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,090
而我們也表達得很清楚了  你這說法我們不買賬
and we've made it clear that we're not buying it.

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,820
斯特爾斯把天眼組織的領導權留給了你
Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize,

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,590
但他卻沒有告訴你他躲藏在哪里嗎
but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding?

94
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,740
這根本說不通
Doesn't make sense.

95
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,890
斯特爾斯自始至終
Stiles has and always will

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,310
都將教徒的需要放在他自己之前
put the church's needs before his own.

97
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,850
這次也一樣
This time is no different.

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,240
他不想讓我知道是因為他想保護我
He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me.

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,970
也因為他不想被人找到
And because he doesn't want to be found.

100
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,500
我不覺得布萊特·斯特爾斯擔心是否會被找到
I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found.

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,140
你看起來很有信心
You seem confident.

102
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,410
這叫信仰
Call it faith.

103
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,900
斯特爾斯在我們這個
You see, Stiles' time

104
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,350
現實世界里的時間  是有限的
in our... reality is limited.

105
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,670
就在我們說話的這會
As we speak,

106
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,470
他正在做好心理和身體上的準備
he's preparing his mind and body

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,410
以擺脫我們這個物質世界的束縛
for a departure from the confines of our material world.

108
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,060
他要死了嗎
He's dying?

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,510
這是非常天真
That is a very naive,

110
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,790
非常無知的想法
very ignorant way of looking at it.

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,250
布萊特·斯特爾斯不會死
Bret Stiles is not dying.

112
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,800
他也不能死
Bret Stiles cannot die.

113
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,290
他是要將自己提升到一個新的高度
He is elevating himself to another plane,

114
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,250
我們這種道行不夠的
one lesser men like ourselves

115
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,650
要非常艱難才能觸碰到這種高度
can only strive to reach.

116
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,100
顯然我們中有人對此是無法理解的
And one some of us obviously can't comprehend.

You know how I am about heights.

Okay. What is it?

130

我甚至不知道能不能信任你
I'm not even sure I can trust you.

133
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,730
血腥約翰有一些位高權重的同伙
Red John has some very powerful allies.

134
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,800
派翠克  不是吧
Patrick, come on.

135
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,300
好吧  但不能在這說
Okay, but not here.

136
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,010
周四晚上八點見面
Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,800
周四  為什么
Thursday? Why?

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,430
我需要時間找一個安全的見面地點
I need time to find a safe place to meet.

139
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,030
好吧  在哪見
Fine. Where?

140
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,650
等到了那天再告訴你
I'll let you know the day of.

141
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,330
太扯淡了
This is crazy.

142
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,570
我已經犯過很多次錯誤了
I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John

143
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,710
總是低估了血腥約翰
a number of times now.

144
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,470
我不想再犯這種錯誤了
I don't want to make that mistake again.

145
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,770
如果你想知道線索  就要聽我的
If you want the information, it's on my terms.

146
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
好吧
Okay.

你說話算數嗎
Did you mean what you said?

157
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,640
我覺得我是講信用的人
I like to think I'm a man of my word.

This is about Red John, isn't it?

169
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,440

176
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,190
從這個世界  飛升到
My ascension from this world

177
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,130
一個世外的天地
to a world beyond.

178
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,220
不要為我哀悼  我的子民
Do not mourn me, my children,

179
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,220
因為這并非逝去
for this is not a passing,

180
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,120
而是啟程
but a departure.

181
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,570
我保證

Listen to me, Don, you don't have a mistresst.

You have a vindictive screwball who's about to ruin your life.

如果還沒完  也別擔心  唐
If it doesn't, don't worry, Don.

There are plenty of ways to keep a woman quiet, OK?

194

So why am I here at 8:00 a.m.?

201
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,710
我有個調查需要你的幫助
I need help with an investigation.

202
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,600
什么調查
What investigation?

203
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,000
這不重要
It's not important.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,010
是么  如果你找我幫忙那這就很重要
Really? It is if you want my help.

我不能告訴你
I can't tell you.

得了吧  特蕾莎  我還不了解你嗎
Come on, Teresa. I know you better than that.

207
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,040
你和簡對血腥約翰的調查
What, you and Jane got something going on

208
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,510
有進展了吧
with the Red John case?

209
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,210
也許吧
Maybe.

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,060
"也許"  是啊
"Maybe." Yeah, right.

211
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,390
為什么要搞得這么神秘
What is with all the secrecy?

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
說真的  為什么要瞞著我
Seriously, why are you always holding out on me?

213
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,940
你們該不會覺得我是血腥約翰吧
You don't think I'm Red John, do you?

214
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,060
你們就是這么想的  是嗎
You do, don't you?

215
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,810
聽著
Tell you what.

216
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,770
你要想找我問話  那就逮捕我
You want to question me, you arrest me.

217
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,340
否則就別把我扯進來
Otherwise, you leave me the hell out of this.

If asking's not gonna work, I won't ask.

221
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,670
你已經不為加調局工作了
You're no longer with the CBI.

222
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,500
你現在無法得到執法人員所能得到的保護了
You don't get the same protection law enforcement gets.

他明天晚上想見你一面
He wants to see you tomorrow night.

225
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,080
你如果不去  他就會認為你是血腥約翰
If you don't show up, he will assume you're Red John.

226
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,140
然后他會找你麻煩的  雷
And, Ray, he will come after you.

227
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,130
你開玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

228
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,160
你了解簡的  你知道他身上發生了什么
You know Jane. You know what happened to him.

229

你也知道血腥約翰對他做了些什么
You know what Red John did to him.

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,660
如果是我  我不會拿這個試探他
If I were you, I wouldn't test him.

我可不怕派翠克·簡
I'm not afraid of Patrick Jane.

232

那去和他見一面又有什么關系
Well, what's the problem with showing up?

我如果去了  你和簡
If I do this, will you and Jane drop

234
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,150
就不會再懷疑我是血腥約翰了嗎
the whole that "I'm Red John" business?

235
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,960
以后絕對不會了
For once and for all.

What time?

I don't want to arrest him. I just want to talk to him.

你幫我這個忙  算我欠你的
You do this, and I will owe you.

Maybe we can use that to our advantage.

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,810
有什么問題嗎
Is...there a problem?

286
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,390
-沒有  -沒有
- Uh, no. - No.

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,000
-我沒問題的  -我知道

你在哪里
Where are you?

我就干點跑腿的活
Oh, just running some errands.

一切都好嗎
Everything okay?

295
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,440
好極了  有事嗎
Yeah, right as rain. What's up?

296
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,740
哈弗內答應了
Haffner's in.

Good. What about Stiles?

Yes.

別跟我說你嫁給那個只會傻笑的呆子了
Oh, don't tell me you married that genial oaf.

你知道的
Ah...you know,

323
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,540
能見他我再高興不過了
nothing would please me more than to meet with him.

324
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,780
我真的很樂意  但是
I mean, really, I would love to. But...

325

很不幸的是  鑒于我現在的境況
unfortunately, my circumstances--

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,200
好像不太能成行
it's probably not gonna happen.

327
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,960
你是說因為聯邦調查局嗎
You mean because of the F.B.I.?

328
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,690
你功課做得不錯嘛
Mm. You have been doing your homework.

329
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,250
他們不知道我來了
They don't know I'm here.

330
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,710
所以他們也就不知道你在這里
Which means they don't know you're here.

331
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,460
但你要是不肯見簡  他們就會知道了
But they will if you don't agree to meet with Jane.

332
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,680
你的確變了  不是嗎
You have changed, haven't you?

333
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,960
你去過厄瓜多爾嗎
Have you ever been to Ecuador, by any chance?

334

沒有
No.

335
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,370

在那傳教來著
doing missionary work. Uh...

那里的人很不錯
lovely people.

338
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,310
不過有個年輕人
But there was a young man there...

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,640
他很窮  但野心勃勃
he was underprivileged, ferociously ambitious.

340
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,610
我在他身上看到了些東西
I saw something in him.

341
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,200
所以我決定試著幫幫他
So I decided to try and help him.

342
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,050
我幫他付學費
You know, I-I paid for his school fees,

343
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,710
之類的
that sort of thing.

344
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,610
其實也沒什么  但你猜怎么著
N-nothing really much, but wouldn't you know it?

345
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,120
這么多年之后
All these years later,

that same man is now Minister of State.

347
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,530
我很為他高興
I'm happy for him.

348
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,560
他邀請我住在這豪華的領事館里
Anyway, he invited me to stay in this palatial consulate.

349
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,310
在這一片小小的外國領土上
This morsel of foreign soil.

350
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,100
外國領土  如你所知
Foreign soil, of which, as you know,

351
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,120
是不受你們加調局  聯調局
is outside the jurisdiction of you, the F.B.I.,

與任何美國法律管轄的
or U.S. law enforcement.

353
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,500
所以呢  格蕾斯  你的威脅不管用
So, you see, Gracie, your idle threats are just that.

354
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,820
當然  很高興能再見到你
Well, it's been so lovely seeing you again.

355
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,140
幫我跟簡問個好

Thanks. I feel a lot better.

- In... - The Red John case.

我們馬上就能確定兇手了
We're close to identifying him.

363
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,190
真是個好消息

You really think you've got him?

366

是的
I do.

367
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,480
一旦你們有了切實答案要立刻告訴我
I'll know the second you have something concrete.

368
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,240

You will, sir.

369
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,860
此案結束的時候我要在場
And I want to be there when you end this.

370
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,050
就等您這句話呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

371
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,250
喂  是我
Yeah, it's me.

372
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,300
我剛和派翠克·簡談了點有趣的事
I just had a very interesting conversation with Patrick Jane.

-不太好  -你找到他了嗎
- Not so good. - Did you find him?

376
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,420
找到了
Yes.

377
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,850
那還有什么問題
Then what's the problem?

378
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,340
他住在厄瓜多爾領事館里
He's at the Ecuadorian consulate.

379
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,510
只要他在里面  我們就動不了他
As long as he's there, we can't touch him.

380
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,240
你打算怎么辦
What do you want to do?

381
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,000
我來對付斯特爾斯
I'll handle Stiles.

382
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,260
他不會也不必跟你出來
He's not gonna come with you. He doesn't have to.

383
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,750
相信我的說服力
I'll be persuasive.

384
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,300
那是什么
What is that?

385
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,230
霰彈槍
A shot gun?

386
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,530
火力夠大了嗎
You sure it's big enough?

387

先聽我說完
Just hear me out, please.

390
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,150
你不希望我在場
You don't want me to be there.

391
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,990
是的
No, I don't.

392
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,600
你不希望我在場是因為你覺得
You don't want to be there because you think

393
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
我會阻止你殺血腥約翰
I'm gonna try and stop you from killing red john.

394
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,320
你的意思是你不會嗎
Are you saying that you won't?

395
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,000
我想說的是
What I'm saying is some men--

像血腥約翰這種禽獸
men like Red John--

397

根本連上庭受審的資格都沒有
they don't deserve a trial. They don't deserve a jury.

398
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,170
這種人就該就地正法
They deserve what they have coming to them.

399
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,590
等等  讓我搞搞清楚
Wait, l-let me get this straight.

400

After close to 20 years working in law enforcement,

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,900
竟然就這么改變原則了嗎
you're just-- you're changing your mind?

402
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,490
在血腥約翰案上嗎  沒錯
About Red John? Yes.

403
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,930
我很驚訝  里斯本
I'm surprised, Lisbon.

407

這種事情上  你絕不會騙我的
You would never lie, not about something like this.

408
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,420
是不是
Right?

409

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,110
威脅我嗎
Threats?

423
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,620
這不是你的風格啊
That's so out of character.

424
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,130
我說的話句句當真
I mean every word of it.

425
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,670
確實
Yes.

426
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,380
我相信你
I believe you do.

427
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,910
可是派翠克
But you see, Patrick,

428
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,140
將死之人還怕什么死亡威脅呢
a dying man does not fear death.

429
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,200
省省吧
Oh, please.

430
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,310
裝模作樣騙騙你那些信徒還行
This charade might work on your disciples.

431
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,700
騙我就算了吧
It doesn't work on me.

432
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,460
你太高估我了
You think too highly of me.

433
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
非常不幸的是
Unfortunately,

434
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,310
這次不是裝的了
it's not a charade.

435
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,350
你還剩多長時間
How long have you got?

436
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,120
已經擴散到血液了
It's spread to the blood.

437
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,320
已經無藥可醫了  我不知道
There's nothing they can do. I don't know...

438
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,170
也許兩周  也許一個月
Two weeks, a month.

439
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,970
聽我說
You see...

440
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,130
這不是針對你
it's not personal.

441
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,680
只是現在
It's just that...

442
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,430
時間對我來說太寶貴了
my time now is very precious.

443
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,970
今晚我還是需要你來
I'm still gonna need you tonight.

444
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,410
看在上帝的份上  為什么
For god sake, why?

445
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
有什么事如此重要
What's so damned important?

446
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,230
血腥約翰
Red John.

447
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,870
我終于接近他了
I'm close.

448
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,220
前所未有的接近
Closer than I've ever been.

449
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,530
血腥約翰
Red John...

450
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,080
聽著
Look...

451
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,200
今晚我若能去見你
nothing would give me more pleasure

452
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,350
那是再高興不過了
than to be with you there tonight.

453
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,130
但是
But?

454
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,180
我的情況比你想象的復雜
There's more to this than you know.

455
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,680
我被困在這兒還有別的原因
There's--there's more keeping me here.

456
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,620
聯調局嗎
The F.B.I?

457
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,910
對  事實正是如此
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

458
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,430
他們跟我到這里
You know, they tracked me here.

459
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,840
就等著我出去
They're just waiting for me to leave

460
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,220
然后逮捕我
so they can arrest me.

461
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,510
不是我想呆在這兒的
Look, I'm not choosing to stay here,

462
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,990
我被困住了
but I'm trapped.

463
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,100
這么說聯調局是唯一的問題了
So the F.B.I's the only thing that's keeping you here?

464
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,310
注意  前門有動靜
Eyes up, we've got movement at the front entry.

465
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,630
是天眼組織的車
That's a Visualize car.

466
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,800
他們在偷偷往外轉移什么人
I think they're sneaking someone out.

467
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,700
隨時準備行動
Get ready to move.

468
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,490
立即行動  行動  上
Go now! Go! Go! Go!

469
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,350
-不許動  -不許動
- Don't move! - Don't move!

470
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,750
把手放在方向盤上
Hands on your steering wheel!

471
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,240
把手放在我們能看見的地方
Keep your hands where we can see 'em.

472
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,610
你們好  先生們
Hello. Gentlemen.

473
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,940
有什么能為你們效勞的嗎
Something I can help you with?

474
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,950
斯特爾斯入局了
Stiles is in.

475
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,640
我們該出發了
We'd better get going.

476
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
我們可有很長一段車程
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

477
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,610
把他帶走
Take him.

478
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,580
{\an8}晚上八點  馬里布  雪松街1309號見  走便道

479
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,170
{\an8}信息已發送

480
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,370
那么薩城警局只有等著了
Well, then Sac P.D.'s just gonna have to wait.

481
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,520
我不想用職權壓人
Look, I-I don't wanna pull rank...

482
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,690
但若有必要我會的
but I will.

483
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,480
凱文  回頭我再打給你
Kevin, I gotta call you back.

484
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,230
我需要一輛車
I'll be needing a car.

485
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,650
我們要去干什么
What are we doing?

486
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,680
我想看看日落
I want to see the sunset.

487
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,280
里斯本  有些話我想跟你說
There's something I want to tell you, Lisbon.

488
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
很早以前就應該跟你說了
Something I should have said a long time ago.

489
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
謝謝你做的一切
I want to thank you for everything that you've done.

490
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,670
晚點再謝也不遲
You can thank me later.

491
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,710
不
No, I...

492
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,810
我必須現在就說
I need to say this now.

493
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,020
你
You have...

494
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,930
不知道你對我意味著什么
no idea what you've meant to me.

495
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,890
你對我有多重要
What you mean to me.

496
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,580
謝謝你
Thank you.

497
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,360
差點忘了  我有個驚喜給你
I almost forgot. I have a surprise for you.

498
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,510
在這等我
Wait here.

499
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,070

00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,880
請停車
Please.

505
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,480
我叫特蕾莎·里斯本
My name is Teresa Lisbon.

506
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,830
我是加州調查局探員
I am an agent with the California Bureau of Investigation,

507
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,130
現在我要征用你的車
and I need to borrow your car.

508
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,190
這是緊急情況
It's an emergency.

509
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,030
什么  不行
What?! No way.

510
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,700
立即下車  快
Get out. Now. Come on.

511
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,800
快
Come on.

512
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,210
太過分了
This is outrageous.

513
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,870
我要報警
I'm calling the police.

514
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,490
好主意  謝謝
Good idea. Thanks.

515
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,460
-簡  -喂  里斯本
- Jane. - Hello, Lisbon.

516
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,130
簡  別這么做  別扔下我這么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

517
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,250
對不起
Listen, I'm sorry.

518
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,890
簡  求你了  你身處險境
Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger!

519
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,400
沒事的
I-it's gonna be okay.

520
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,960
我不會有事的
I-I'm gonna be okay.

521
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,110
不可能
No, you're not.

522
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,280
你這樣做是在自尋死路
You do this, and you're throwing your life away.

523
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,140
再見  里斯本
Bye, Lisbon.

524
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,980
簡

你好  派翠克
Oh. Hello, Patrick.

527
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,960
我來早了嗎
Am I early?

528
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,390
不早  來得正好  坐吧
No, no. Right on time. Have a seat.

529
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,480
911  您遇到了什么緊急情況
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

530
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,850
我是加州調查局的

00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,650
特蕾莎·里斯本探員
with the California Bureau of Investigation.

532
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,660
請派警員到馬里布的雪松街1309號
I need officers at 1309 Cedar Street in Malibu.

533
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,220
有探員需要立即支援
I have an agent who needs immediate assistance.

534
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,550
我讓你們五個聚在一起是有原因的
I brought you five together for a reason.

535
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,710
有人可能知道了
Some of you may know that reason.

536
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,490
也有人可能猜到了
Some of you may have guessed.

537
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,150
你們中的一個人
But one of you here...

538
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,260
是血腥約翰
is Red John.

539
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,830
什么  在我們幾個中間
What?! One of us?

540
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,060
我們其中之一是血腥約翰
One of us here is Red John?

541
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,370
真有意思
Well, that's very interesting.

542
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,670
-是誰  -我不知道
- Who is it? - I don't know.

543
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,270
我們到這來就是為了找出答案
And that's what we're gonna find out.

544
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,390
你是想說這個房間里的某個人
Wait, you're trying to say that one of us in this room...

545
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,560
是個連環殺手
is a serial killer?

546
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,960
-我很確定  -太荒唐了
- I know it. - No, this is crazy.

547
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,520
我向你保證完全不荒唐
I can assure you it's not.

548
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,520
我向你保證  我才不跟你在這兒胡鬧
Well, I can assure you I'm not sticking around for this crap.

549
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,210
坐下
Sit down.

550
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,240
一步都別想往門口走
Do not move toward the door.

551
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,800
誰都不準走
No one is leaving.

552
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,960
放輕松  派翠克
Take it easy, Patrick.

553
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,570
我看起來很緊張嗎
Do I look distressed?

554
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,160
別動
Don't.

555
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,630
我會開槍的
I will shoot you.

556
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,390
其他人也一樣
That goes for the rest of you as well.

557
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,310
慢慢把你們的槍拿出來  放在地上
Take out your weapons slowly, place them on the floor,

558
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,660
推到我這邊來
and push them toward me.

559
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,030
謝謝
Thank you.

560
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,550
謝謝
Thank you.

561
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,140
行了  派翠克
Okay, Patrick.

562
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,290
夠了
This is... this is enough.

563
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,840
該到此為止了
It's gone far enough.

564
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,020
不  這才剛剛開始呢

為這一刻  我等了十年

多年來  血腥約翰一直很狡猾
All those years, Red John has been smart.

567
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,510
你們中的某個人一直很狡猾

568

很謹慎  除了這次
Careful. But not this time.

569
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,390
這一次  你露出馬腳了
This time, you made a mistake.

570
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,950
基拉·汀斯利死之前跟我說了件事
Kira Tinsley told me something before she passed.

571
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,940
她告訴我殺她的人  也就是血腥約翰
She told me that her killer-- Red John--

572
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,310
有個紋身
has a tattoo.

573
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,200
左臂上有三個點
Three dots on his left arm.

574
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,960
就在肩膀上
On the shoulder.

575
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,960
你們都得
And you all...

開始脫吧  快
Let's go. Come on.

579
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,750
對了  脫掉
That's it. Take it off.

580
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,030
太荒唐了
Nonsense.

581
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,800
很好
Very good.

582
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,400
不是你想得那樣
It's not what you think.

583
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,490
-你弄錯了  -住嘴
- You got it wrong. - Enough.

584
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,750
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

585
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,830

You stay there.

591
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,410
