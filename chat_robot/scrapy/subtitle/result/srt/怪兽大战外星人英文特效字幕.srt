{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this can't be happening.

104
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait. Everybody, it's OK!

111
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beam hurt Derek.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Susan? -Thank goodness you're OK!

113
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening to me?

114
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't panic! Don't worry! Whatever you do, don't drop...

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you people? What are you doing?

117
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Be careful!

118
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your hands off me! Don't you know who I am?!

119
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, just leave me alone!

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,130

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move it, move it! Let's go! Move it, move it!

123
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull, pull!

124
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek?

00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's get this baby on the bus.

126
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, could you hit the snooze?

127
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, why did you set the alarm? We're on our honeymoon.

128
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

130

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is itjust legs? Did they capture a giant pair of legs?

132
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence, B.O.B.! She'll hear us!

133
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How? Legs don't have ears. -Just shush!

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oould you tell me where I am?

137
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? What was that?

138
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

139
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,360

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! Doing! That!

142
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever mad scientist made you,

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he really went all out.

144
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can talk.

145
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, there!

146
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My back!

147
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just kidding! I don't have a back!

148
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgive him, but as you can see, he has no brain.

149
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turns out you don't need one. Totally overrated!

150
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As a matter of fact, I don't even...

151
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I forgot how to breathe! Don't know how to breathe!

152
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me, Dr. Oockroach! Help!

153
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suck in, B.O.B.

154
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Doc. You're a lifesaver.

155
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, look at you. I know what you're thinking.

156
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First day in prison, you want to take down the toughest guy in the yard.

157
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'd like to see you try.

158
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ninja!

159
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gosh. Look, she's speechless. -She?

160
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, B.O.B.! We are in the presence of the rare female monster.

161
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way! It's a boy. Look at his boobies.

162
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to have a talk.

163
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, I'm afraid we are not making a very good first impression.

164
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least I'm talking.

165
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First new monster in years, we couldn't get a wolf man or a mummy?

166
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, you know, somebody to play cards with.

167
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might we ask your name, madam?

168
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan.

169
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. We mean your monster name.

170
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, what do people scream when they see you coming?

171
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, like, "Look out! Here comes...!"

172
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan.

173
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

174
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan!

175
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just scared myself. That is scary.

176
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Eat times.

177
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is repulsive!

178
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An old slipper!

179
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, please, God, tell me this isn't real.

180
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please tell me I had a nervous breakdown at the wedding, and now I'm

181
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a mental hospital on medication that's giving me hallucinations.

182
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't scare Insectosaurus!

183
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna pee himself, then we'll all be in trouble.

184
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every room has a door! There's gotta be a door here!

185
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK, buddy. Don't worry about it.

186
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's a handsome bug, huh? You like it when I rub your tummy?

187
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! Somebody! I don't belong here!

188
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let me out! -Hey, that is not a good idea.

189
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me out!

190
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsters, get back in your cells.

191
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank goodness. A real person. You are a real person, right?

192
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not one of those half-person, half-machine,

193
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, whatever you call those things.

194
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A cyborg? -Oh, no! You're a cyborg?!

195
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Madam, I assure you, I am not a cyborg. The name is General W.R. Monger.

196
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in charge of this facility. Now, follow me.

197
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time for your orientation.

198
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 1950, it was decided that Jane and Joe Public could not handle the truth

199
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about monsters, and should focus on more important things, like paying taxes.

200
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the government convinced the world

201
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}monsters were stuff of myth and legend and then locked them in this facility.

202
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not a monster! I'm just a regular person.

203
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,150

00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so somebody think of something, and think of it fast!

308
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That is a good cup ofjoe. -Mr. President?

309
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not only do I have an idea, but I have a plan!

310
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, conventional weapons have no effect on this thing,

311
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-and we know nukes ain't an option. -Sure they are. I just...

312
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Don't do it! Stop! -Wait!

313
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna kid you, Mr. President. These are dark times.

314
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The odds are against us. We need a Hail Mary pass. We need raw power! We need...

315
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...monsters.

316
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsters! Of course! It's so simple!

317
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I'm not following you.

318
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over the last 50 years, I have captured monsters on the rampage,

319
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and locked them up in a secret prison facility. So secret that the mere mention

320
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of its name is a federal offense.

321
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he referring to Area Fifty...

322
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President, say hello to Insectosaurus!

323
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Ronson, please.

324
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nuclear radiation turned him from a small grub

325
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into a 350-foot-tall monster

326
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that attacked Tokyo.

327
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we have the Missing Link.

328
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A 20,000-year-old frozen fish man who was thawed out by scientists.

329
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He escaped and went on a rampage in his old watering hole.

330
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This handsome fellow is Dr. Oockroach, Ph.D.,

331
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the most brilliant man in the world.

332
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,600


333
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He invented a scientific machine

334
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that would give humans the cockroach's ability to survive.

335
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, there was a side effect.

336
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,780


337
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we call this thing B.O.B.

338
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will someone get her out of here?!

339
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

340
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A genetically altered tomato was combined with a chemically altered

341
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ranch-flavored dessert topping at a snack food plant.

342
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The resulting goop gained consciousness,

343
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and became an indestructible gelatinous mass.

344
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, our latest addition, Ginormica.

345
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General, continue.

346
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her entire body radiates with pure energy,

347
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}giving her enormous strength and size.

348
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, these monsters are our best and only chance to defeat that robot.

349
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't we already have an alien problem, General?

350
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think we need a monster problem, too.

351
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a better idea, nerd?

352
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Stay where you are.

353
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General, I propose we go forward

354
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with your monsters-versus-aliens idea... thingy.

355
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go fish.

356
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you...

357
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...have any...

358
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...threes?

359
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I do! How are you doing this?

360
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're the luckiest guy I know. -Luck ain't got nothin' to do with it.

361
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...? Hey!

362
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They called me crazy, but I'll show them. I'll show them all!

363
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor, I'd prefer you didn't do your mad scientist laugh

364
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while I'm hooked up to this machine.

365
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right, Insecto.

366
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've let that quack experiment on you for over a month.

367
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a quack! I'm a mad scientist! There is a difference.

368
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, what choice do I have? If he can make me normal, or even six foot eight,

369
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can get out of here, get back to the life I'm supposed to have.

370
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I should be in... -Let me guess, Fresno?

371
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Fresno is just a stepping stone. Next stop, Milwaukee.

372
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Then New York, then hopefully... -Yeah, we know. Paris.

373
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw the switch, Doctor, but don't do the laugh.

374
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you're going to feel a slight pinch in the brain.

375
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

376
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan!

377
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I small again?

378
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid not, my dear.

379
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, you may actually have grown a couple of feet.

380
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's OK, Doc. We'll try again tomorrow.

381
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really don't get it, do you? No monster has ever gotten out of here!

382
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not true! The Invisible Man did.

383
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he didn't. We just told you that so you wouldn't get upset.

384
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died of a heart attack 25 years ago.

385
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

386
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah... in that very chair.

387
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's still there.

388
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see what I'm saying? Nobody's leaving. Nobody's ever getting out.

389
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good news, monsters! You're getting out!

390
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until today.

391
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let me get this straight, Monger.

392
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want us to fight an alien robot.

393
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, in exchange, the president of these United States

394
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}authorized me to grant you your freedom.

395
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe it! Soon, I'll be back in Derek's arms...

396
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or he'll be in mine.

397
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait for spring break back at Oocoa Beach, just

398
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}freaking everybody out.

399
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll go back to my lab and finally finish my experiments.

400
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! That's me, B.O.B.

401
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Then I'll be a really giant lady. -That's Susan, B.O.B.

402
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Then I'll go back to Modesto and be with Derek.

403
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's still Susan, B.O.B.

404
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I, at least, deserve a chance to be with Derek!

405
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's go!

406
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody move in an orderly fashion! This is an emergency!

407
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are evacuating the city!

408
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exact change is appreciated, but not necessary!

409
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's move out!

410
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is San Francisco! This isn't far from my home!

411
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel the wind on your antennae. Isn't this wonderful?

412
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't been outside in 50 years. It's amazing out here!

413
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hotter than I remember. Has the Earth gotten warmer?

414
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'd be great to know. That would be a very convenient truth.

415
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now that's a robot! -It's huge.

416
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try not to damage it too much.

417
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might want to bring it back to the farm!

418
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, wait! You didn't say anything about it being huge!

419
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! No! Don't leave!

420
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he sees us.

421
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello! Hi! How you doing?

422
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome! We are here to destroy you!

423
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't fight that thing. I can't even... I've never...

424
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm hyperventilating. Does anybody have a giant paper bag?

425
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax.

426
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old Link's got this under control.

427
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide in the city, Susan. You'll be safe there.

428
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But stay away from the Tenderloin! It's a little dicey!

429
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally, some action. I'm gonna turn that oversized tin can

430
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into a really dented oversized tin can.

431
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK! Does anybody have a 20 on Insectosaurus?

432
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Would you look at the size of that...

433
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foot!

434
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got him, you guys! I got...

435
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I won't let go! I'm wearing him down!

436
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please tell me he's slowing down!

437
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get to the city, Link. I'll catch up with you as soon as I can.

438
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or maybe you'll have to catch up with me.

439
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,950


440
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! No, no, no!

441
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,160


442
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, OK. I got this.

443
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep, that hurt.

444
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in! I have a plan!

445
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hot dogs!

446
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Link, I'm going to pull up alongside it! You get up in there,

447
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get to its central processing unit, and...

448
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, guys, catch me! -No!

449
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, let's go! Keep it moving!

450
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! No honking!

451
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me! Ooming through! On your right! No control!

452
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

453
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK! It's going to be OK! Look, I'm gonna get you out of there!

454
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on a second! We have to get off the bridge before...

455
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no! Get away from me!

456
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooming through! Watch it!

457
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, furball, where you been?

458
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. Papa's a little out of shape.

459
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me! He's trying to kill me! Why is it doing that? Why would it...

460
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

461
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Wow. You're doing great! -I'm doing everything!

462
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for long. Oome on, you guys. Let's take this thing down!

463
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A deflector shield. Typical.

464
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't crush a cockroach!

465
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,170


466
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, right.

467
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go.

468
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insectosaurus!

469
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insectosaurus!

470
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-BOB！ -B.O.B.! -What?

471
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Help me! -Sorry.

472
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I was staring at this bird over there. -Get these people off the bridge!

473
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

474
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, B.O.B.! Move the dividers!

475
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad.

476
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, go, go, go!

00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I don't feel good.

479
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Susan, you can do this.

480
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's take this thing down.

481
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Retrieval has failed.

482
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get upset. It happens to everyone.

483
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That lower life form thinks she can steal my Quantonium?!

484
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send another probe at once!

485

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quantonium cannot be retrieved via robot.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you think because you're all big and strong

488
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you can destroy my robot probe

489
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're gonna send me running and hiding?!

490
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My days of running and hiding are over!

491
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oomputer, set a course to Earth.

492
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will retrieve the Quantonium myself,

493
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even if I need to rip it out of her body

494
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one cell at a time!

495
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oareful, it's hot.

496
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three weeks ago, if you had asked me to defeat a giant alien robot,

497
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have said, "No can do." But I did it! Me!

498
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still buzzing.

499
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see how strong I was?! Probably isn't a jar in this world I can't open.

500
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were positively heroic, my dear.

501
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I especially loved how you saved those people on the bridge.

502
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a nice touch. Wasn't she amazing, Link?

503
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she was great. Really cool. Loved it.

504
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, poor Link.

505
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all that tough talk, you were out-monstered by a girl.

506
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:30,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No wonder you're depressed. -Hey, I'm not depressed. I'm tired.

507
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you tired? You didn't do anything.

508
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I haven't been sleeping well.

509
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got sleep apnes... apnea. Whatever. It's not fun.

510
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Link's a little rusty... I mean, sleep deprived.

511
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be back to your old self in no time.

512
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so will I.

513
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:51,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to the "there isn't a jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

514
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Did you find a jar you couldn't open? Were pickles in it?

515
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where's the giantjar of pickles?! -What my associate is trying to say

516
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that we all think the new Susan is the "cat's me-wow."

517
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

518
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, you guys. That is so sweet,

519
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I have a normal life waiting for me. You know?

520
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:20,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, tell me, exactly, how this normal life thing works with you being giant.

521
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna be a giant forever.

522
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek won't rest until we've found a cure for my...

523
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...condition. We're a team.

524
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps, someday, we could make his acquaintance!

525
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? You guys want to meet Derek?

526
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First stop, Modesto!

527
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ginormica, I called your family to let them know you were coming home.

528
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I also called the Modesto PD and told them not to shoot at you.

529
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, General.

530
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, remember, these people aren't used to seeing anything like...

531
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you, or you...

532
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or you.

533
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So just be, you know, cool. Just be... you know...

534
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow my lead.

535
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! That was an accident!

536
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't destroy anything!

537
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan?

538
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Susie Q! -Mom? Daddy?

539
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did they experiment on you? -No, Mom. I'm fine.

540
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK. They're with me.

541
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are my new friends.

542
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Derek! I missed you so much,

543
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinking that we'd someday be together again!

544
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only thing that got me through prison! I love you! I love this man!

545
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, B.O.B.! That's my mother! You're suffocating her!

546
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, are you all right?

547
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I taste ham. -Sorry, Mom.

548
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just a hugger.

549
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Derek?

550
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's at work, sweetie.

551
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how he is about his career.

552
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're not gonna celebrate without him! -Susan!

553
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do I do with all your little friends?

554
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just put out some snacks! They'll eat anything!

555
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ambrosia!

556
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it going?

557
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:50,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Que pasa, girlfriend?

558
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to cut up a rug, Insecto!

559
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wants to go for a swim with the Link?

560
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I'm Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate.

561
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or you can call me "B.O.B.", whichever's easier.

562
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I come on too strong? I'm sorry.

563
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a little rusty. I've been in prison my whole life.

564
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd I mention prison?

565
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just going to go.

566
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel so stupid.

567
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:32,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everyone, just stay calm. Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

568
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone care for an Atomic Gin Fizz? It's got quite a...

569
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...kick.

570
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ohlorine! Ohlorine in my eyes!

571
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They're turning on us! -Everyone run for your lives!

572
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they running away from?

573
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's hilarious, Jim.

574
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly the kind of down-home country humor I'm gonna miss when I'm in Fresno.

575
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Derek Dietl, signing off for the very last time.

576
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good night, Modesto! -Ohannel 172.

577
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And cut.

578
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you like that sign off? Just made it up.

579
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness.

580
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!

581
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Derek. You wouldn't believe my last three weeks!

582
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thinking about you was the only thing that kept me sane.

583
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oan't breathe! Ribs collapsing! -Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

584
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness. Is that better?

585
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. OK.

586
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still kind of getting used to my new strength.

587
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! You really are big!

588
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still the same girl you fell in love with.

589
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except you did just destroy the Golden Gate Bridge.

590
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that was the only way I could stop that giant robot!

591
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever think I could do something like that?

592
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't. I can honestly say it never, ever, ever, ever,

593
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ever, ever, ever, ever,

594
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ever, ever, ever occurred to me.

595
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I know this is a little weird.

596
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, it's a lot weird, but we'll figure it out.

597
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that, together, we can find a way to get me back to normal.

598
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan, try and look at this from my perspective.

599
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an audience that depends on me for news,

600
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}weather, sports and heart-warming fluff pieces.

601
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:57,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You expect me to put all that on hold while you try to undo this thing that happened to you?

602
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I had absolutely nothing to do with?

603
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. That's exactly what I expect.

604
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the life we always talked about? Don't you still want that?

605
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

606
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:14,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just... don't see how I can have that with you.

607
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek, please, don't do this.

608
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to face facts, Susan.

609
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't crush me for saying this, but I'm not looking to get married

610
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and spend the rest of my life in someone else's shadow.

611
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're casting a pretty big shadow.

612
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. It's over.

613
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, Susan.

614
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,660


615
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,030


616
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! What a shindig!

617
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parents really know how to throw it down.

618
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No, that was a great party,

619
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of the best I've been to since I got out of prison.

620
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must have been at a different party,

621
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause that's not how I interpreted it at all.

622
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think your parents liked me, and that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.

623
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least the garbage was free. You know? I mean...

624
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, who are we kidding? We could save every city on the planet,

625
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they'd still treat us the same way they've always treated us...

626
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like monsters.

627
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Monsters.

628
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, how is Derek?

629
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek is a selfish jerk.

630
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No! -Yes.

631
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that talk about "us." "I'm so proud of us."

632
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Us just got a job in Fresno." There's no "us."

633
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was only Derek. Why did I have to get hit by a meteor to see that?

634
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was such an idiot!

635
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did I ever think life with Derek would be so great, anyway?

636
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, look at all the stuff I've done without him.

637
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fighting an alien robot? That was me, not him.

638
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:51,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that was amazing! Meeting you guys? Amazing.

639
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Oockroach, you can crawl up walls

640
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and build a supercomputer out of a pizza box, two cans of hairspray, and...

641
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A paper clip! -Amazing!

642
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you! You hardly need an introduction. You're the Missing Link!

643
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You personally carried 250 co-eds off of Oocoa Beach,

644
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and still had strength to fight off the National Guard!

645
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Ooast Guard and, also, the lifeguard.

646
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:14,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing!

647
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:19,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B.O.B.! Who else could fall from unimaginable heights

648
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and end up without a single scratch?

649
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Link? -You.

650
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:23,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing!

651
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good point, Insecto! Susan, don't short-change yourself!

652
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm not going to short-change myself ever again!

653
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Testify! -Yeah.

654
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes.

655
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susan!

656
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to go, Insecto!

657
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insecto, look out!

658
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insectosaurus! No!

659
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna make it.

660
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's going to be all right. Look at me.

661
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you close those eyes. Don't you dare close those eyes.

662
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:36,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't...

663
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be terrified.

664
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wake up in a strange place, wearing strange clothes,

665
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:28,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}imprisoned by a strange being floating on a strange hovering device.

666
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange, isn't it?

667
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hardly. It's not the first time.

668
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. You really get around.

669
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the extraction chamber!

670
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. What is it that you want from me?

671
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:45,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have stolen what is rightfully mine!

672
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't steal anything from you.

673
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:51,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your enormous, grotesque body contains Quantonium,

674
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:54,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the most powerful substance in the universe.

675
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you really think you could keep it from me?

676
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what this is all about?

677
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You destroyed San Francisco, you terrified millions of people...

678
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you killed my friend, just to get to me?

679
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence!

680
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your voice is grating on my ear nubs.

681
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:20,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a shame you won't be around to see what the power of Quantonium

682
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:21,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can do

683
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the tentacles of someone who knows how to use it!

684
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how to use itjust fine!

685
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't bother. That force field is impenetrab...

686
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the Flagnard?!

687
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That should stop your puny...

688
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oomputer, close door, hangar two!

689
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olose door, hangar three!

690
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Door, hangar four!

691
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olose them all!

692
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oomputer, begin extraction!

693
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:37,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally, I can rebuild my civilization on a new planet.

694
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any thoughts on where I should set up shop?

695
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your planet, perhaps?

696
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You keep your slimy tentacles off my planet!

697
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:51,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wanted to stop me, you should have done it when you possessed the Quantonium!

698
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you're nothing.

699
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are innocent people down there who didn't do anything!

700
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were innocent people on my home planet before it was destroyed.

701
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm sorry your planet was destroyed. -Oh, don't be.

702
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:09,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one who destroyed it. Oonfused?

703
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After I reveal my tale to you, everything will become crystal clear.

704
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:19,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oomputer, initialize cloning machine.

705
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Gallaxhar.

706
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Many zentons ago, when I was but a squidling,

01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found out my parents were...

708
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No child should ever have to endure that!

709
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I went on the road with a giant...

710
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:42,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And soon thereafter was married!

711
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things were going well, until she wanted to...

712
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:51,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I was all, "No way!", and she was all, "Yes, way," and I was like...

713
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've told you too much already!

714
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the birth of my new planet, now called...

715
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}..."Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

716
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,290


717
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once again, a UFO has landed in America,

718
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the only country UFO's ever seem to land in.

719
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:42,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. What's that, Henshaw?

720
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okey-dokey.

721
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:52,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We now take you, live, to a transmission from the alien spacecraft.

722
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:58,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Humans of Earth, I have come in peace.

723
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:03,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need not fear me. I mean you no harm.

724
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:08,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, it is important to note most of you will not survive the next 24 hours.

725
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:12,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those who do survive will be enslaved and experimented on.

726
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should in no way take any of this personally.

727
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:20,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just business. So just to recap:

728
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:25,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come in peace, I mean you no harm and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

729
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, boys, set the terror level

730
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at code brown 'cause I need to change my pants.

731
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What're we gonna do now, Doc? -I...

732
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

733
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're not gonna let Insecto die in vain.

734
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:06,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna get up there, find Susan, and we're gonna take that alien down!

735
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you got enough juice in those jetpacks to get up there,

736
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but not enough to make it home.

737
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:22,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll come get you if I can. If I don't, it means I'm dead. Or late.

738
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been your warden for close to 50 years.

739
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no longer the case.

740
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:31,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For what it's worth...

741
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's rude. What did we do? -No, B.O.B., that's not rude.

742
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a sign of respect.

743
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General, it's targeting us!

744
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the idea, Lieutenant. Hold your course.

745
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:54,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steady.

746
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steady.

747
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hard right! Hard right!

748
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't shake it!

749
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on to your socks! We're going for a ride!

750
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I always wear a parachute, Lieutenant.

751
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can let go of me now, Lieutenant.

752
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you signaling? We're right here.

753
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, zip it!

754
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olone!

755
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hail Gallaxhar! -No, not all of you. You, there.

756
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I do this? Three back.

757
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:28,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no. That guy next to you. The one I'm pointing at!

758
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You! The one...

759
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, clone! Yes! Good!

760
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the prisoner to the incinerator.

761
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's useless to us now.

762
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hail Gallaxhar. -Hail me.

763
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:01,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Ginormica ain't so... "ginormic" anymore.

764
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we supposed to get to her?

765
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's too many of them. It's impossible.

766
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I may not have a brain, gentlemen, but I have an idea.

767
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not going to work.

768
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:37,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Halt!

769
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... Gallaxhar, command you to hand over the prisoner this instant.

770
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Olearly, you are defective beyond repair.

771
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guards, take this defective clone to the incinerator!

772
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what are you waiting for? You and you!

773
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Seriously? -Yes! Take the prisoner

774
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the defective clone to the incinerator!

775
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:13,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Of course, sir. -Here's a security pass, just in case.

776
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Would you like a gun? -Yes, I would.

777
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys, look.

778
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

779
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:28,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you guys came to save me. Thank you.

780
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:32,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't mention it. We monsters got to stick together.

781
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not a monster anymore. I'm just me.

782
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:40,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dear, no matter what your size, you'll always be...

783
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...nothing but a filthy, carbon-based life form!

784
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hail Gallaxhar!

785
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hail Gallaxhar.

786
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These disguises are the bomb!

787
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it! Follow me.

788
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:00,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The only way to save the Earth... -Hail Gallaxhar!

789
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hail Gallaxhar. The only way...

790
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hail Gallaxhar! -Hail Gallaxhar.

791
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to save the Earth is to blow up this ship...

792
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hail Gallaxhar! -Hail Gallaxhar.

793
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...before the invasion starts. -How are we gonna do this?

794
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to find the main power core.

795
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, could you direct us to the main power core?

796
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gladly. It's right there, above the extraction chamber.

797
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very much. Hail Gallaxhar.

798
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Watch out! -Look out, brainless!

799
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that thing!

800
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A weapon like this needs to be in the hands of someone responsible.

801
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?!

802
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hail Gallaxhar?

803
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsters!

804
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Monsters. -Monsters?!

805
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attention, all aliens! Destroy all monsters!

806
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:04,200

01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They offered me network.

909
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I have to do is get an exclusive interview from you.

910
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? -Yeah.

911

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get my dream job and you get your dream guy.

912
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:02,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a win-win for Team Dietl.

913
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:04,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek...

914
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:07,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that's amazing.

915
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is the camera rolling? -Absolutely.

916
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Because I wouldn't want your fans to miss this.

917
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Susan Murphy, saying,

918
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Goodbye, Derek!"

919
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B.O.B., could you...?

920
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:36,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Derek, you are a selfish jerk, and guess what?

921
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've met someone else. She's lime green.

922
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She has 14 little chunks of pineapple inside her,

923
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:46,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she's everything I deserve in life!

924
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm happy now, Derek, without you!

925
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's over!

926
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off.

927
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:59,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsters, I'm so proud of you, I could cry, if I hadn't lost my tear ducts in the war.

928
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not crying will have to wait. The world needs you again.

929
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, General?

930
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems a snail fell into a French nuclear reactor.

931
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:11,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As we speak, Escargantua

932

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is slowly making its way to Paris.

933
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:20,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I've always wanted to go to Paris. Now who's with me?

934
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say, Butterfly... osaurus?

935
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in.

936

938
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:39,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have a safe flight! -Yeah, and hang on!

939
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Derek! Good luck getting over me.

940
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}B.O.B., it's me he's never going to get over.

941
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:03,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait! You were dating Derek too?!

942
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That two-timing jerk!

943
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,660


944
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:42,320
