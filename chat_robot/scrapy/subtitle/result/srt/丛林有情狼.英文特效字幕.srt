00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's time to ride the slide and taste the wind.

3
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey, you are totally genius.

5
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Air wolf!

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys. Guys.

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're not moving!

8
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This caribou is mine.

9
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, I'm not a caribou. I'm your sister!

10
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gotcha.

11
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Omegas don't play like this.

12
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I just did.

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,590

15
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was I thinking?

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was great!

18

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are flying today, guys.

19
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey?

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate?

21
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing up here?

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm practice hunting for our lunch.

23
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good, 'cause I'm about to lose mine.

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are?

25
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll try to swallow it.

26
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate!

27
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's time to go.

28
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm coming, Dad.

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where're you going?

30
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alpha school. It goes till spring.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Spring?

32
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But that's a whole winter away.

33
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But by next spring, she will be a trained Alpha,

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}the future leader of the pack.

36
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.

37
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Learn to keep the peace.

38
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And Humphrey,

39
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}remind us all to have fun.

40
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But... But...

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alphas and Omegas can't...

42
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How do you say it?

43
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's our custom. The law of the pack.

44
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wolf pile!

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Silly Omegas.

46
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take a left! Thirty degrees!

47
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Salty, give us some sail draft!

48
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think I taste the wind.

49
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, just a bug.

50
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!

51
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- All right! - Hang on, boys!

52
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, we really need to work on the... brakes!

53
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Brakes? - Brakes?

54
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wolf pile!

55
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get your butt out of my face.

56
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What did we hit?

57
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Spring.

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look who's back from Alpha school.

59
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Forget about it, Humphrey.

60
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate's an Alpha now.

61
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you're an Omega.

62
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're friends, okay?

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Exactly. Just friends. End of story.

64
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You better set your sights over there.

65
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.

66
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

67
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Looks like we're eating caribou tonight, boys.

68
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey. Hey.

69
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eastern Pack wolves.

70
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.

71
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Great. There goes dinner.

72
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And there goes Kate.

73
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Holy... - Caribou!

74
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Scatter to the sides!

75
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at those moves.

76
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Settle the score, leader.

77
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you all right?

78
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yeah, I'm fine. - Hey, what's your problem,

79
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you stupid Eastern dog? That was our hunt.

80
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't just snake it out from under us.

81
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can-do, back off.

82
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You better listen to the girl.

83
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, break it up. Can-do, Hutch, break it up!

84
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, Omegas, duty calls.

85
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!

86
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hey! - Candy!

87
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Kate. - Humphrey?

88
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm still going to tear this snaggletooth fool apart.

89
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, lower the boom!

90
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.

91
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, guys, come on. Don't get your fur in a bunch.

92
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You wolves are making us look bad.

93
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, that's a moon I don't want to howl to.

95
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Western hunt group, get back to the den.

96
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The two of you, go home.

97
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now!

98
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Omegas, good job.

99
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Great. My first hunt, and I blew it.

100
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy. You were amazing.

102
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, if anyone's hungry,

103
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}they can eat...

104
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They can always eat...

105
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

106
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Here.

107
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They can eat berries.

108
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Berries are really nutritious.

109
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.

110
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.

111
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Luckily, the Omegas were there to break up the fight.

112
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Lilly. - What?

113
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.

114
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, you're slouching.

115
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you, honey.

116
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you see how strong and beautiful you are?

117
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My...

118
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Any food is a blessing, dear.

119
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Winston? Come join us for dinner?

120
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now!

121
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you, honey.

122
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.

123
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not for my pack.

124
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, Dad.

125
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just those Eastern Wolves.

126
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's not your fault, Kate.

127
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When they crossed into our territory,

128
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}they broke pack law.

129
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Winston.

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can-do was jumped by a group of Eastern Wolves.

131
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It ain't nothing.

132
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quickly, bring him into the den.

133
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Winston, honey, whoever did this,

134
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's rip his tail off and shove it down his throat.

135
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sir, are we just going to

136
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}let them keep raiding our hunts

137
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and...

138
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Put our Alphas on alert.

139
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Already done, sir.

140
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good job.

141
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated.

142
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Instead, now, keep an open mind,

143
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just want you to have an open mind here,

144
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we bring you berries.

145
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How about squirrels?

146
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bad joke.

147
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Flying squirrels.

148
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Winston!

149
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tony! You're looking good.

150
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My back feels like wood. I got this disk that keeps cracking.

151
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Drives me crazy.

152
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.

153
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yeah? - Yeah.

154
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like that little game of tag during our hunt.

155
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.

156
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know there's no caribou left in the east.

157
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got a problem.

158
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unite the packs, Winston. It was you who gave the big speech

159
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that your daughter Kate and my son Garth

160
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}would marry and unite the packs.

161
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?

162
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry. She knows.

163
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good.

164
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then she can meet Garth tonight at the moonlight howl.

165
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I won't let my pack starve, Winston.

166
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

167
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That would be a big mistake.

168
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate. It's...

169
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's okay, Dad. I understand.

170
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's... it's my responsibility.

171
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, we got to get ready for the moonlight howl.

172
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, girls.

173
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girls?

174
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are cool.

175
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, let me go ahead...

176
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}prepare the girls for your arrival and you guys meet me there.

177
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Game on.

178
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girls.

179
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, you look so beautiful.

180
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, if Garth gets out of line,

181
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}take those beautiful teeth of yours,

182
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}go for the throat, and don't let go until the body stops shaking.

183
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If my little girl doesn't want to do this,

184
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}if she's not ready...

185
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry, Dad. I'm ready.

186
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Lilly.

187
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Okay.

188
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your fur... it looks fantastic tonight.

189
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, my Gosh. - I had...

190
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Omega alert.

191
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I will handle this.

192
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It totally relaxes the knots.

193
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey.

194
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey.

195
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's all I've got.

196
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow. This is a new feeling.

197
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I saw the whole thing, guys.

198
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And, I cannot believe they didn't just fall all over you.

199
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When you yelled, ''Hey,'' I thought you cinched it right there.

200
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you think you can do better?

201
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please.

202
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The next girl that comes up the hill, she's mine.

203
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've never seen her look that good.

204
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate is hot.

205
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be right back.

206
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey.

207
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do you think you're going?

208
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey, you know the rules.

209
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're not allowed to howl with her. She's an Alpha.

210
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We can eat together.

211
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But we can't, you know, howl together.

212
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, I know. I... I was just...

213
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}kidding.

214
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.

215
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Friends for life!

216
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ugly.

217
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, do you see Garth?

218
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Great.

219
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not even sure what he looks like.

220
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I'm sure...

221
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we'll know him when we see him.

222
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Kate.

223
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

224
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Garth.

225
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly, stand up.

226
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Garth, hello. Good to see you.

227
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Humphrey? - My butt! My butt.

228
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It really hurts.

229
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You should really do something about that cough.

230
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Be careful, Kate. There's something going around.

231
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tails and ears are falling off, literally.

232
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Name's Humphrey.

233
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Garth.

234
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow. You are a...you are a big one, aren't you?

235
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow. You're practically a moose.

236
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where you hiding them antlers?

237
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who's the coyote?

238
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who's the coyote? I get it.

239
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's good, 'cause I'm, like...

240
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one important.

241
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly, why don't you take little coyote

242
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey and run along?

243
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Humphrey.

244
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.

245
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, tell me about yourself.

246
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What does Garth like to do?

247
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I'm really into fitness, you know?

248
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rabbit sprints, tree squats.

249
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know us Alphas got to keep fit to lead the pack.

250
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, what really gets me going is...

251
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Was it good for you?

252
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unbelievable.

253
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know...

254
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just...just...

255
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on a sec 'cause I'm going to be right back.

256
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I... I need some water. Some water.

257
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay? So, I'll... just... hold on.

258
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No worries. I'll just keep my vocal chords warm.

259
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah.

260
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Oh, he's no one important".

261
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Just take little coyote Humphrey and run along."

262
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Coyote.

263
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where's Barf? - It's Garth.

264
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And we're just taking a little break.

265
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A break?

266
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? Is that so strange?

267
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding?

268
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I always like to take a break 10 minutes into a howl.

269
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I do.

270
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your howling partner, he's not a...he's not a stud.

271
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not a stud but, like, it's like "stud"

272
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but...a dud. A dud. That's it. Isn't he?

273
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

274
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He is not a dud.

275
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}In fact, Humphrey, you'd be surprised

276
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to find that he is...strong!

277
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's... He's...

278
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Proud! -Yes! Yes.

279
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Proud. And he's... What's the word I'm looking for?

280
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An Alpha's Alpha.

281
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.

282
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You make me so mad!

283
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, I was just kidding.

284
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're kind of cute.

285
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really? You think... So, wow. Okay. Cute. Yeah.

286
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's...look...Thank you, first of all,

287
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but do you mean "Cute" in,

288
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}like, a rugged, kind of handsomely ''Cute''?

289
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Again with the butt.

290
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}These mosquitoes are out of control.

291
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll meet you on Mars,

292
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}right after I eat the Milky Way.

293
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That sounds good.

294
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Save some for me.

295
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bag them up, boys. We're going to Idaho.

296
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got it, chief.

297
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. There we go. Watch out there.

298
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate?

299
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where am I?

300
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey?

301
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that you?

302
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate! Where are we?

303
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know.

304
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe we're dead.

305
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nope. Definitely not dead.

306
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}At least they left us some water.

307
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got water?

308
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nope. Definitely not water.

309
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, what are you doing?

310
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Trying to get out.

311
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Calm down.

312
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen, maybe they're taking us to

313
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}where there's more food.

314
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or maybe we are the food.

315
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

316
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah.

317
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. Set them free.

318
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at them go.

319
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow.

320
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This isn't Jasper.

321
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, but it sure does... Rock!

322
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quick, get down!

323
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are they doing?

324
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What a smashingly brilliant story this is.

325
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The golfing goose from the low

326
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}regions of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.

327
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's using the wrong club.

328
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could you do me a favor, Needles,

329
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and shut the hole that makes the words.

330
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Looks like they're playing some sort of weird game.

331
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe they can tell us how to get home.

332
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. And if they can't,

333
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we can eat them.

334
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. Follow my lead.

335
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, I'm right behind you.

336
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now you will see, this shot is mine.

337
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.

338
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just a minute!

339
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's ugly, but a good runner.

340
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did you see that? Did you see that?

341
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.

342
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You mark it ''Birdie'' because it would have gone in.

343
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Technically, sir, it might have gone in.

344
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That silly bird stopped my shot from going in.

345
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, I will not take an extra stroke.

346
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mark it Birdie!

347
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it... it was an obstacle.

348
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And everyone has to play with the obstacles.

349
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, we wouldn't want to lie.

350
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is not a lie. This is not a lie if you are French.

351
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash,

352
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}a hyphen, in between there.

353
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I say French. - Canadian.

354
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- French. - Canadian.

355
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- French! - Canadian, sir.

356
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}May I just say, though, that you are a wonderful golfer.

357
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you are a very good caddie.

358
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take off!

359
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paddy, what is wrong with you?

360
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello.

361
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are two wolves.

362
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have not seen many wolves in these parts.

363
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I am not afraid of wolves. No.

364
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I Iike wolves.

365
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you a few questions.

366
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. Quick! Look behind you!

367
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Grab him!

368
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you want to face the French Resistance?

369
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's French-Canadian!

370
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My butt! My butt! My butt!

371
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Omegas.

372
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is not a game anymore!

373
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't you wash your feet?

374
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look out for the trees!

375
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch that.

376
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nice one, sir.

377
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gotcha.

378
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no.

379
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's got to hurt.

380
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How do you like it now, wolf?

381
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hole in one, sir.

382
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You have bit of more than you can chew this time, my friend.

383
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Help!

384
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My goodness. I... Look out for the...

385
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. No. No. No. No. No.

386
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's a goner for sure.

387
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait, what are you looking at? What are you looking at?

388
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, Frank.

389
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. You have a question?

390
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. Where are we?

391
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Idaho?

392
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ida-who?

393
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oui, Idaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes,

394
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and a few billion potatoes.

395
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sawtooth National Wilderness.

396
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are we doing in Idaho?

397
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You were relocated to repopulate.

398
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They want you big wolves to make a lot of little wolves.

399
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sounds good to me. Park shouldn't be without some wolves.

400
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, only for the good of the park.

401
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So you two are undomesticated partners?

402
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paddy, please. Don't be rude.

403
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?

404
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are an item?

405
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Well... - No.

406
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You wolves, you are funny.

407
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We have to get home now.

408
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's going to be trouble if I don't get back to Jasper.

409
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right. All right. You're freaking out.

410
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not freaking out. I just have to get home.

411
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is this about Barf? - It's Garth.

412
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And it's about responsibilities.

413
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, I don't expect you to understand.

414
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can you help me?

415
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I need to get home fast.

416
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, Miss Fast.

417
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where is home sweet home?

418
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jasper Park, Canada.

419
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jasper park? Get out of here.

420
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We love Jasper Park!

421
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.

422
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paddy, please. We've toured it many times.

423
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I dated a pintail from Jasper once.

424
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She never stopped quacking. Drove me nuts.

425
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Drove her right to me.

426
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bound to happen. Bound to happen.

427
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you can help me, then, get home.

428
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We haven't played Jasper in quite a while.

429
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think it would be a smashing idea.

430
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is true. So, of course I will help.

431
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I like you two. You make me laugh.

432
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you didn't eat me,

433
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}so I owe you favor.

434
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where did she go?

435
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe I should ask you.

436
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know that's not my style.

437
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My wolf, Can-do, knows your style.

438
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just want to say one thing.

439
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If any of you wolves have hurt my daughter,

440
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I will personally rip out

441
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}your eyes and shove them down your throat

442
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}so you can see my claws tear your carcass open!

443
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mom?

444
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.

445
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, since Kate stood up Garth,

446
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I could show him around until she gets back.

447
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wouldn't say ''Stood up.''

448
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Garth!

449
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sounds good to me.

450
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, come on, Garth.

451
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Isn't that sweet? She gets it from me.

452
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll give her till the full moon.

453
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It is beautiful out there.

454
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Almost makes you want to hit the potato patch.

455
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you haven't already hit the outdoors, get on out your door.

456
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The weather today is...

457
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your ride home.

458
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quick! Get in!

459
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? Boxed up twice in one day.

460
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are the odds?

461
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hide! - Hide!

462
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That right there is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.

463
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lucky for you, they travel

464
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}every year to Jasper right after Sawtooth.

465
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The day's looking pretty, and so is my woman.

466
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is the song we met to.

467
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come here, you. Let's dance.

468
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Down here. - Hurry.

469
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, he was in a motorcycle gang, and she was a librarian.

470
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And opposites attract, if you will.

471
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Exactly. In this case, it was a bookstore that also sold beer.

472
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, they met.

473
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. We have to get in.

474
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. Here we go.

475
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're just a dream.

476
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm like a little bunny. Aren't I, dear?

477
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I love you, Deb.

478
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I love you, too.

479
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.

480
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, back in a box.

481
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good luck, you two!

482
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We will be watching out for you from above!

483
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I'll be watching out for you.

484
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He will be breathing heavily.

485
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

486
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey?

487
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, why is this called Rabbit Poo Mountain?

488
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because this is where rabbits like to poo.

489
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was just kidding.

490
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I get it. You're a funny Omega.

491
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Make me laugh.

492
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What am I?

493
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got me.

494
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a turtle that fell and can't get up.

495
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's pretty good.

496
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. What's this?

497
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's turtle road kill.

498
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What else can you do?

499
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just do turtles.

500
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, it's my turn.

501
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You want to see something an Alpha can do?

502
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would my mother approve?

503
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Of course.

504
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, okay then.

505
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep searching. We must find her before tomorrow night.

506
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Winston?

507
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry, Eve.

508
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's the finest Alpha I've trained.

509
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not, Winston.

510
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's also the finest Alpha I've ever trained.

511
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We stopped.

512
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's wrong with you? - I have to go.

513
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't leave. Can't you hold it?

514
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No! I can't.

515
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, did you try crossing your legs?

516
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}-Yes! - Holding your breath?

517
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes! I almost passed out.

518
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Closing your eyes and... - In or out, I am going.

519
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would you hurry?

520
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't go when I feel pressured.

521
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go!

522
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is he doing?

523
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The packaging's wolf-proof.

524
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where is he?

525
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Humphrey.

526
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a rabid wolf!

527
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Max, bring that gun!

528
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?

529
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Max, they're getting away!

530
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not if I can help it.

531
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No! - We're trapped.

532
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got you both now.

533
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shoot them!

534
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nicely done, Max.

535
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Thinking with my belly instead of my head,

536
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}not a good idea. I get it.

537
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I say we build a comfy den...

538
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm going home. - Great.

539
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're going home, and it's raining.

540
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not stopping.

541
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rain, rain, go away.

542
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out of here, rain no one wants you around

543
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

544
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's... It's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.

545
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}'Cause you're wet and you really are going to ruin our day

546
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.

547
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right! Well, I'll just do it backwards.

548
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That actually worked.

549
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate?

550
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's not a good idea.

551
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on, Kate!

552
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

553
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on, Kate! I'm coming!

554
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me think. Let me think.

555
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey!

556
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't worry, Kate. It's all part of my plan.

557
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can see that.

558
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.

559
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Grab your what?

560
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Take those Alpha jaws and grab...

561
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My tail. My tail.

562
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.

563
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That tickles. My tail hurts!

564
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who knew I was ticklish there?

565
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't take any more.

566
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

567
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!

568
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your tail. I'm so sorry.

569
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My tail's actually fine,

570
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}last time I checked.

571
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. Let's get out of the rain.

572
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

573
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

574
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sir, we've searched the entire territory.

575
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Still no sign of Kate.

576
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sir?

577
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We must defend our territory.

578
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Fore!

579
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, well, well. What do we have here?

580
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I say, we've caught them at quite the bad time.

581
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I'd say we caught them at a good time.

582
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Indeed, sir. Indeed.

583
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing here?

584
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, the question is what are you doing here?

585
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I give you a first class ticket home...

586
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a straight shot right to the pin.

587
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And you blow it? - Yep.

588
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Over a cupcake.

589
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.''

590
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Actually, they're quite delicious.

591
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There has to be another way for us to get to Jasper.

592
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Another way? Another way?

593
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Always another way. What am I, a travel agent?

594
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. What, are you kidding me?

595
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A great sportsman like yourself

596
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}always knows a few ways to win the game.

597
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, there could be a train.

598
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Actually, there is a train. It's the Canadian Express and...

599
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paddy, please. It's called the Canadian Express...

600
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.

601
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right by Jasper Park.

602
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- If you can catch it... - You'll be home in no time.

603
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No time. Very fast.

604
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Great. So where do we board?

605
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do you board?

606
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch this.

607
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}On the other side of that mountain.

608
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Paddy, please.

609
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on!

610
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let it slip, but may I say,

611
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that was a stupendous shot.

612
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You may, and it was pretty good, wasn't it?

613
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Indeed, sir. Indeed.

614
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dinner for two.

615
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a new move I've been working on for stalking prey.

616
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:44,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're good.

617
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thanks. Now you try.

618
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. I...

619
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not much of a hunter.

620
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. You'll do great.

621
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just do what I do.

622
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

623
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ready?

624
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- One. - One.

625
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Two. - Two.

626
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Three!

627
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly!

628
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:21,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly?

629
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A turtle, right?

630
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you, I don't hunt.

631
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe this will help.

632
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow.

633
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}''Wow'' what?

634
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your eyes. They're beautiful.

635
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on. Let's try again.

636
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It sure is pretty out there. - Yeah.

637
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'll race you to the top. - You're on.

638
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.

639
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:16,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey?

640
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Omega one, Alpha zero!

641
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:27,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay! Okay!

642
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!

643
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I get it. I get it. I get it.

644
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How's that for a girl's throw?

645
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Very funny.

646
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, look who's having fun.

647
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, I should go check on the train.

648
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait, wait, wait!

649
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait, wait.

650
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, there.

651
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you?

652
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I'm a wolf.

653
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've never seen a wolf. You are really strange.

654
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Am I now?

655
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're totally weird.

656
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going to get you!

657
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Look out! Look out!

658
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, you asked for it.

659
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

660
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm really sorry.

661
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, poo.

662
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mad...

663
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mad bear.

664
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate! Get the snowballs ready! Mad bear on the attack!

665
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:59,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Canadian Express! Humphrey, the train is coming!

666
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate!

667
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey?

668
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:06,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's wrong with you?

669
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That!

670
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't move. We can handle this.

671
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We can?

672
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, we're in trouble.

673
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.

674
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown,

675
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and one of the bears says,

676
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Does this taste funny to you?"

677
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A simple "boo" would have sufficed.

678
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Man.

679
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch this. One more. One more.

680
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get up. Kate, get up.

681
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where are those two?

682
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why must they make this so difficult?

683
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I believe the term is

684
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"high maintenance couple", sir.

685
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stuck between the cliffs and the claws. This isn't good.

686
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good luck joking your way out of this one.

687
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's your name, sir?

688
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:44,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Growl. All right.

689
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you need a hug?

690
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?

691
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good talk!

692
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, need a ride?

693
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jump! Trust me!

694
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you, you could trust me.

695
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hang a left!

696
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go right!

697
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why are you looking at me like that?

698
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unbelievable. They have missed the train.

699
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or not.

700
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know. It's not very good, is it?

701
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well...

702
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was so awesome. You with the snowballs.

703
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you with that little

704
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}bear in that snowball fight. It was so cute.

705
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But then you with the log!

706
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The look on your face was so good.

707
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And then we...

708
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, we make a pretty good team.

709
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers! What do you think?

710
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think you're crazy.

711
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You think I'm...

712
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I'm telling you,

713
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we're onto something here.

714
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stick with me, pup.

715
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll go places.

716
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I'll keep that in mind.

717
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. Take a deep breath.

718
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Howl from right here.

719
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I'll join in.

720
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey,

721
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}what are you doing?

722
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. The moon,

723
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}the moment. I just thought...

724
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.

725
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}See? That's so good.

726
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. You better go.

727
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But no one has to know.

728
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please. Go, now.

729
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

730
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dad.

731
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Howling with an Omega, are we?

732
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I was just... - Get with the others.

733
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's going on?

734
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're going to take the valley, and our caribou.

735
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Dad! - Lilly, what's wrong?

736
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!

737
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on!

738
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just do it. She howled at the moon with you.

739
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was just the moment.

740
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bonjour, my furry friend.

741
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:17,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

742
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you guys crazy?

743
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's up for debate.

744
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And where is... Mademoiselle.

745
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's sleeping, so be quiet.

746
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. Quiet.

747
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you guys doing here?

748
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Making sure that you don't forget the run of the course.

749
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.

750
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do not miss it.

751
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jasper, few miles, got it.

752
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good.

753
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've got to say, your

754
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}girlfriend looks quite pretty when she sleeps.

755
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's not my girlfriend.

756
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You should work on that.

757
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's the full moon, Winston.

758
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can see that, Tony.

759
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I didn't want it to come to this.

760
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But here we are.

761
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

762
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

763
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

764
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

765
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:54,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

766
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop the insanity! Go organic!

767
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate.

768
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, wake up. Wake up.

769
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey? Where are we?

770
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're... We're in Jasper.

771
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're home.

772
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yup. We're home.

773
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- There's something... - There's something...

774
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please, you first.

775
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey, I just wanted to tell you,

776
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:01,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}these past couple of days, they've been, kind of, fun.

777
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:06,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've been, kind of, fun.

778
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really?

779
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really.

780
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, that's... That's great.

781
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you, we make a pretty good team.

782
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:18,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We do.

783
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Well.

784
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no.

785
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't tell me. You have to go to the bathroom again.

786
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why, do you see a truck stop?

787
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just wanted to tell you I... I...

788
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I... I just wanted to tell you... - No.

789
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I... I love...

790
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, geez.

791
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:54,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All I asked was for you to follow our customs, unite the packs.

792
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:58,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, no. Your daughter had to up and run away.

793
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I didn't run away.

794
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate!

795
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's back!

796
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:18,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We were so worried. - Where have you been?

797
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- In Idaho. - Idaho?

798
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What were you doing in Idaho?

799
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We were taken by humans to another park.

800
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We were supposed to repopulate.

801
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.

802
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:38,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey actually helped me get home.

803
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What a nice boy.

804
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I came back... - You came back to marry Garth.

805
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

806
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And unite the packs!

807
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good for the pack, good for the belly.

808
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:40,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Marry? You're getting married?

809
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes. Isn't it great?

810
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No more fighting during hunts.

811
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.

812
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We're going to unite the packs.

813
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Welcome back, Humphrey.

814
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good job bringing her home.

815
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow. It's a big crowd.

816
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. Good times.

817
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I heard you and Garth spent some time together.

818
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly.

819
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry.

820
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sure he's perfect marrying material.

821
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, if you like that sort of thing, big,

822
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}brawny, and perfect.

823
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.

824
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry. I know.

825
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, I liked it.

826
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right on the pin.

827
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Marcel! Paddy!

828
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When it comes to hugs,

829
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:14,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we are all French, Paddy?

830
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I'm English, so we don't hug!

831
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But for a first, I'd say that was a good one.

832
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm so happy to see you two.

833
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We flew in to see that you made it home.

834
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And what do we find?

835
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You're getting married! - You're getting married!

836
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. I'm getting married.

837
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who told you? - I did.

838
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey.

839
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We should be going.

840
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:43,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, yes.

841
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excuse me. A flea.

842
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:55,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And a little something for your big day.

843
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

844
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just wanted to say good-bye.

845
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good-bye?

846
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. I'm thinking about doing a little traveling,

847
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you know, seeing where the train takes me.

848
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And maybe I'll visit our friends the bears.

849
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Our old buddies, see how they're doing.

850
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll tell them you said hi.

851
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?

852
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:21,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing.

853
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,

854
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}not Humphrey, the lone wolf.

855
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.

856
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't doubt that.

857
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, Marcel, I am a stickler for tradition,

858
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but this one, I just don't understand.

859
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}These wolves are mysterious creatures.

860
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tony.

861
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So...

862
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:16,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you ready?

863
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:17,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

864
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:19,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good.

865
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you okay?

866
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:25,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You bet.

867
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No problems on this end.

868
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ready to go, go, go.

869
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, you want to start this thing or me?

870
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll start together.

871
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Start together. Yeah.

872
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, what's happening?

873
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They're accepting each other's scent.

874
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And now, the nibble on the ears.

875
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you think I can make it?

876
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks,

877
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you should see an open train car.

878
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, avoid truck stops, bears,

879
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and that hideous dessert. What is it called?

880
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Cupcakes, sir. - Yes. Cupcakes.

881
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I will. Thanks, guys.

882
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:12,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental about cupcakes.

883
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They really are quite delicious.

884
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wouldn't know.

885
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:22,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And finally, they will rub noses

886
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to symbolize that they are mates!

887
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, what are you doing?

888
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I...

889
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't.

890
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't!

891
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, you can't?

892
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is this, Winston?

893
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why can't she marry Garth?

894
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Quiet.

895
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:05,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?

896
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Because I...

897
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:13,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I fell in love with an Omega.

898
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An Omega?

899
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Humphrey? That sly dog!

900
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:37,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An Alpha in love with an Omega. That's against pack law.

901
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dad.

902
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I also am in love with an Omega.

903
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

904
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have you done to my son, Winston?

905
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:52,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An Omega and an Alpha? An Alpha and an Omega?

906
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eve, help me out.

907
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:03,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is madness. This isn't our custom.

908
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:07,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This isn't our way. Take the valley!

909
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,250
