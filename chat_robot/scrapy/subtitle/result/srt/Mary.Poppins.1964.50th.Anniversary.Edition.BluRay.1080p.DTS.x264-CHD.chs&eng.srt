1
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,241
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree

2
00:01:56,492 --> 00:02:00,537
烟囱清扫工就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

3
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,248
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

4
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,670
当他和你握手的时候，幸运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you

5
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,760
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

6
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,136
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

7
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:17,846
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

8
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:26,088
女士们，先生们
All right, ladies and gents...

9
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,717
这样的场合，幽默诗正好派上用场
comical poems suitable for the occasion...

10
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,512
即兴创作，当场发表
extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.

11
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:34,724
好的，我们开始
All right, here we go.

12
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,727
这是我们共同的天地
Room here for everyone Gather around

13
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,189
警察先生克尽职守
The constable's "responstable".

14
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,361
听起来还不错吧？
Now, how does that sound?

15
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,117
你好，拉克小姐 让我为你献上一首
Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you

16
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:58,707
拉克小姐喜欢和安德鲁在公园散步
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

17
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:03,047
你好啊，安德鲁
Hello, Andrew.

18
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:07,926
啊，考利夫人 一个关于你的故事
Ah, Mrs Cory a story for you

19
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,889
你的女儿过去比你矮……
Your daughters were shorter than you...

20
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,017
但现在，她们长高了
but they grew.

21
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:24,277
亲爱的帕西蒙小姐
Dear Miss Persimmon...

22
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,281
嗯？
Yes?

23
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,785
风，从东方刮来
Wind's in the east

24
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,829
雾，在四处弥漫
Mist comin' in.

25
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,919
一件酝酿已久的事情看似就要发生
Like something is brewin' about to begin

26
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:45,009
没人能够预测未来
Can't put me finger on what lies in store

27
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,762
但我知道将要发生的一切……
But I feel what's to happen...

28
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:52,600
都曾经发生过
all happened before.

29
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,148
对不起，刚才说到哪里了？
I'm sorry. Where was I?

30
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,387
谢谢，谢谢你的支持
Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.

31
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:32,645
啊，拉克小姐，谢谢。
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

32
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,107
天主保佑你
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

33
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,860
您就是慷慨的化身
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

34
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:42,740
您就免了。
No charge.

35
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:47,786
哦，是你啊！你好。
Oh, it's you! Hello.

36
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,707
你是说，樱桃树大街17号么？
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

37
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,544
好吧，跟我来。
All right. Come along with me.

38
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,716
这就是樱桃树大街
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

39
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,344
一个很可爱的地方
Nice little spot, you might say.

40
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,724
17号就在前面
Number 17's just down a bit.

41
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,730
这个能给人留下深刻印象的大房子第一眼看上去并不舒服
Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye...

42
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,398
它是退役海军上将
is the home of Admiral Boom...

43
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,568
鲍默将军的家
late of His Majesty's Navy.

44
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,571
他的房子就像一艘船
Likes his house shipshape, he does...

45
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:23,784
他做事更是井井有条，一丝不苟
shipshape and bristol fashion at all times.

46
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:31,542
报时枪准备 准备完毕，将军
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

47
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,545
还有3分零6秒 是，将军
Three minutes and six seconds.
Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:38,717
将军一向以准时而闻名
What he's famous for is punctuality.

49
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,136
全世界都以格林尼治时间为准
The whole world takes its time from Greenwich.

50
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:45,183
但人们说格林尼治以将军的时间为准
But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom.

51
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:46,935
情况还好么，将军？
What cheer, Admiral?

52
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:50,354
下午好，年轻人。你要到哪儿去？
Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

53
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:53,858
17号那儿有个聚会，我想去看看
Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

54
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,821
把这事记入航海日志 是，将军
Enter that in the log.
Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,989
应该提醒你，年轻人
A word of advice, young man:

56
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,076
17号地区的暴风雨迹象已经很明显
Storm signals are up at Number 17.

57
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,494
天气马上就要变坏
Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

58
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:08,708
谢谢，我会留神的
Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.

59
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,754
这就是樱桃树大街17号
Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

60
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:17,259
乔治?班克斯先生的住所
Residence of George Banks, Esquire.

61
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,221
噢，将军的话一点都没错
Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.

62
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:24,601
17号地区的天气很恶劣
Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake.

63
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,394
别理她！ 住嘴！
Leave her alone!
Shut up!

64
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,148
我告诉你，不要试图阻止这个恶人！
I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!

65
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,526
让她走，我说，她走了真好！
Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance!

66
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:33,694
从她踏进门的那刻起，我就没喜欢过她
I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

67
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:38,575
但没有了保姆，谁来对付那两个孩子？我么？天！
But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

68
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,911
瞧她那高傲的样子！
Her and her high and mighty ways!

69
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,955
还有她那张脸，我已经受够了
And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

70
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,373
事实上，布里夫人！你就是把全世界的财宝
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute...

71
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,127
都堆在我面前，我也不会再多呆一分钟
not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

72
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,797
不，不，卡蒂保姆，别走！
No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

73
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,215
别挡着门
Stand away from that door, my girl!

74
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,885
你让我们怎么和主人说孩子的事呢？
But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

75
00:07:56,136 --> 00:08:00,933
这与我无关。这是那两个小野兽最后一次从我这溜走。
It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

76
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:04,145
他们一定在什么地方。你去动物园找过了么？
They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park?

77
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,064
你了解简和迈克尔
You know how Jane and Michael is.

78
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,149
你难道不担心狮子会抓住他们吗？
Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya?

79
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,737
你知道他们是多喜欢在那笼子周围玩
You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

80
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:13,947
我不想再废话了
I said my say, and that's all I'll say.

81
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,741
这所房子已经和我永远一刀两断
I've done with this house forever.

82
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,494
好啊，好极了
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

83
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,538
出门当心别摔了，宝贝
And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

84
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,918
噢，别这样，卡蒂保姆！
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

85
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:29,464
班克斯夫人！她回来了！
Mrs Banks! She's home!

86
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,926
我们女儿的女儿会敬仰我们 我们将一起欢唱
Our daughter's daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus

87
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,012
“干得好，主张参政的姐妹们”
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

88
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,262
卡蒂保姆，艾伦，晚上好
Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.

89
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,517
我们举行了一场盛大的聚会！
We had the most glorious meeting!

90
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,937
威伯尼夫人把自己绑在首相的马车车轮上
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the Prime Minister's carriage.

91
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,399
你们真应该去看看 班克斯夫人，我有句话要对你说
You should've been there.
Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.

92
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,027
还有阿什列夫人被抓走了
And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison...

93
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,196
她一路上边唱歌边散发传单
singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

94
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,282
我很高兴你回来了，夫人，我已经尽力了
I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me...

95
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,702
谢谢你，卡蒂保姆
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

96
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,330
我就知道我不会看错的
I always knew you were one of us.

97
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,334
我们是身着裙装的战士
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

98
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,337
为妇女的投票权而英勇地战斗
And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

99
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,467
尽管我们尊敬每一个男人
Though we adore men individually

100
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:16,224
但作为一个群体，他们是愚蠢的
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

101
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:20,812
班克斯夫人 甩掉昨日的枷锁
Mrs Banks.
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

102
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,440
肩并肩，我们走向自由
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

103
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:28,152
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

104
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:32,449
她们将一齐欢唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

105
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,577
“干得好 主张参政的姐妹们”
"Well done Sister Suffragette"

106
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,831
可能的话，我不想冒犯你，但是……
Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I...

107
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,711
从肯辛顿到比林斯门呼声此起彼伏
From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries

108
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,673
从这片土地的每一个角落 妇女们站起来了
From every corner of the land womankind arise

109
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,636
政治平等 权利平等
Political equality and equal rights with men

110
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:55,182
潘克赫斯特夫人又被铐上
Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

111
00:09:55,434 --> 00:10:01,231
我们不再做温顺的附属品
No more the meek and mild subservients we

112
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:05,944
为了我们的权力英勇奋斗
We're fighting for our rights militantly

113
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:07,571
Never you fear

114
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:11,408
班克斯夫人，我能插句话么？
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

115
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,663
甩掉昨日的枷锁 班克斯夫人！
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Mrs Banks!

116
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:19,292
肩并肩我们走向自由
And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

117
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:23,798
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

118
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,470
她们将一齐欢唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

119
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,638
“干得好” 班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

120
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,515
“干得好” 班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

121
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,976
班克斯夫人！
"Well done, Sister Suf..."
Mrs Banks!

122
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:40,357
什么事？ 班克斯夫人，我有件事要告诉你
What is it, Katie Nanna?
Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you.

123
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,861
孩子们在哪里？ 夫人，孩子们……
Where are the children?
The children, madam...

124
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,905
确切地讲，不在这里
to be precise, are not here.

125
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,907
他们又消失了
They've disappeared again.

126
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,243
卡蒂保姆，你确实太粗心了
Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you.

127
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,287
这已经是这周的第三次了
Doesn't it make the third time this week?

128
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:56,250
第四次，夫人。如果不是气愤之极的话
The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it.

129
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,751
我并不想说他们的坏话
I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but...

130
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:00,212
你估计他们什么时候能回来？
Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

131
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:04,216
这可不好说。现在请你算一算我的薪水
I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll...

132
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:08,597
噢，天，卡蒂保姆！你不是要走吧？ 班克斯先生会怎么说？
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

133
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:12,142
他回家后，发现孩子们不见了会很生气的
He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing.

134
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,688
艾伦，把这些拿开，你知道这东西会让他多恼火
Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

135
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,606
是的，妇人
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,776
卡蒂保姆，我请求你，再想一想
Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider.

137
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,446
想想孩子们，想想班克斯先生
Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks.

138
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:27,867
他刚开始适应你
He was just beginning to get used to you.

139
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,581
各就各位！
Posts, everyone!

140
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:44,511
4，3，2，1，点火！
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

141
00:11:56,024 --> 00:12:01,529
卡蒂保姆，我请求你…… 我的薪水，请！
Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
My wages, if you please.

142
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,617
今晚早了点，是吗？将军
Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?

143
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,953
胡说，正点报时，跟往常一样
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

144
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,374
银行里的事情还好吧？
How are things in the world of finance?

145
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,878
从没有比现在更好的时候了，货币坚挺，贷款利率不断上升
Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

146
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,840
英镑成了全世界的宠物
And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

147
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,259
很好 先生，你那儿的情况怎么样？
Good man.
How do things look from where you stand?

148
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,887
很难讲
Bit chancy, I'd say.

149
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,557
起风了，气压也下降了
The wind's coming up and the glass is falling.

150
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,434
我不喜欢这种情况 好，好，好
Don't like the look of it.
Good, good, good.

151
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:34,315
班克斯，毫无疑问你将赶上坏天气的
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather.

152
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:38,862
班克斯！你听见了么？
Banks! Do you hear me?

153
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,032
你好，卡蒂保姆。那一定很重吧。
Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy.

154
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,912
让我来吧
Allow me.

155
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,830
哼！
Hmph!

156
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:51,542
多可爱的帽子啊！
What a very pretty hat.

157
00:12:57,258 --> 00:13:01,010
就像一位国王
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

158
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,974
骑着他的骏马，谢谢
Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you.

159
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:09,395
当我摆脱白天的喧嚣，回到家，回到妻子身边
When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife

160
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,358
我是多么心满意足，我的生活多么愉快！
How pleasant is the life I lead

161
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,693
亲爱的，有件事和孩子们有关 是的，是的，是的
Dear, it's about the children.
Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:18,572
我按照日程表精确地管理着我的家！
I run my home precisely on schedule

163
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:22,535
6点01分 我走进家门
At 6:01 I march through my door

164
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:26,539
6点02分 放下我的手套和手杖
My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

165
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,459
我的生活始终如一！
Consistent is the life I lead

166
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,587
乔治，孩子们不见了。 太美妙了。
George, they're missing.
Splendid. Splendid.

167
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,467
1910年在爱德华国王的统治下
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

168
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:39,971
做一位英国男人是多么光荣 这是一个男人唯上的时代
King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men

169
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:43,974
我是城堡的主人 统治者
I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege

170
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:47,563
我管理着我的仆人，孩子们和妻子
I treat my subjects, servants children, wife

171
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:50,066
严格且温和，贵族的行为理应高尚
With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige

172
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,902
现在6点03分，我领地的继承人们
It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

173
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:57,739
已经洗过了，吃饱了
Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

174
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,828
我会拍拍他们的头，打发他们去睡觉
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

175
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,709
啊，我的生活多么气派！
Ah, lordly is the life I lead

176
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:12,758
威妮弗蕾德，孩子们在哪儿？ 他们不在这里，亲爱的
Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.

177
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,344
什么？他们当然应该在这儿！他们会在别的地方吗？
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

178
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:19,764
我不知道，乔治 你不知道？
I don't know, George.
You don't know?

179
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:23,644
他们不见了。卡蒂保姆到处都找遍了
Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

180
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:27,689
我要立即处理这件事
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

181
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,445
请给我接警察局，快！
Give me the police station, quickly, please.

182
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:36,199
我想这件事不必麻烦警察，事实上……
I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter...

183
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,201
请别试图用什么事实把事情弄得模糊不清
Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.

184
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:42,414
唯一的事实，很明显，卡蒂保姆不能胜任她的工作
One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.

185
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:46,710
她使得这个家陷入混乱，我要教训教训她……
She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to bo...

186
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:50,340
哦，她已经走了，是吗？
Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

187
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,759
是的，亲爱的，刚刚走
Yes, dear, only just.

188
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,053
喂，呃……我是乔治?班克斯
What, uh... Yes. George Banks here.

189
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:59,474
樱桃树大街17号。出了件急事
Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.

190
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,978
请立即派一名警察
I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

191
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,648
乔治，警察来了！
The policeman's here, George!

192
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:08,818
什么？噢，真及时！服务真好！
What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service.

193
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:11,738
谢谢！晚安
Thank you so much. Good night.

194
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,824
请进，警察先生，请进！ 谢谢！
Come in, Constable. Come in.
Thank you, sir.

195
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,619
我在公园那边巡逻时
While going about my duties on the other side of the park...

196
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,663
发现了两件遗失的贵重物品
I noted some valuables that had gone astray.

197
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,165
我相信是你的，先生 贵重物品？
I believe they're yours, sir.
Valuables?

198
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:25,211
来，过来
Come along, now. Come along.

199
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,090
简！迈克尔！
Jane! Michael!

200
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,842
威妮弗蕾德，请别激动
Winifred, please don't be emotional.

201
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:35,262
哦，他们今天走了很多路，精疲力尽了
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

202
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:39,436
孩子们，过来
Children, come here at once.

203
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,026
怎么回事？ 对不起，我们和保姆卡蒂走散了
Well?
I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

204
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:50,196
你知道的，今天风很大，而这个风筝对我们来说大了点
You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

205
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:54,200
在某种意义上说，先生，是风筝跑走了而不是孩子们
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

206
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,704
谢谢，警察先生。我想我能够控制这件事
Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

207
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,542
说实话，这风筝并不好。我们自己做的
Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves.

208
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,503
也许你可以帮我们做一个……
Perhaps if you helped us to make one...

209
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,507
哦，那很重要，先生。风筝很难控制
Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things.

210
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,301
就在上周，我和我的孩子们……
Why, only last week with me own youngsters...

211
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,970
我非常感谢你送他们回来
I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children.

212
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,350
如果你到厨房看看，厨师会给你弄些吃的
And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

213
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,729
谢谢你，先生。我该回去工作了
Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

214
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,065
谢谢你，警察先生
Thank you, Constable.

215
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:26,278
晚安，小姐。晚安，夫人，晚安，先生
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

216
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,366
厨师会给我弄些吃的。我从没……
Cook'll find me something. I never...

217
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,912
乔治，我非常非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

218
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,249
我猜你大概要谈谈这件事
I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

219
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
的确！
I would indeed!

220
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,920
艾伦，带简和迈克尔到楼上去
Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

221
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:45,258
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:50,346
我就知道。谁首当其冲的负担这一切？
I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?

223
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:51,973
我！就是这样！
Me, that's who!

224
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,728
他们不想要一个诚实勤劳的人
They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here.

225
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,273
他们需要的是动物园看守
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

226
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:02,526
我很抱歉，亲爱的。我当初之所以选中了卡蒂保姆……
I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna...

227
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,612
是因为她看上去那么严厉
I thought she would be firm with the children.

228
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,655
她看上去会严格地要求孩子们。
She looked so solemn and cross.

229
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:10,284
威妮弗蕾德，不要把效率和急躁混为一谈
Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

230
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,287
下次我会试着干得好一点
I'll try to do better next time.

231
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:15,374
下次？亲爱的，过去的四个月里你已经换了六个保姆
Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months!

232
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:19,169
个个都是不称职的灾星 我同意
And they've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.

233
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,297
给孩子们选保姆是一项重要而细致的任务
Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task.

234
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:27,804
它要求深入的观察，公正的判断，还有识别人的能力
It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.

235
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:32,309
在这种情况下，只好由我亲自来……
Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh...

236
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,435
呃，处理了
select the next person.

237
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,021
噢，乔治？！ 显然想要选出一位合适的保姆
Oh, would you, George?
Obviously the way to find a proper nanny...

238
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,107
就应该采用恰当的方式
is to go about it in a proper fashion.

239
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,070
我要在《泰晤士报》上登一则广告。请你记下来
I shall put an advertisement in the Times. Take this down please.

240
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,071
当然，是的，亲爱的。 招聘
Yes, of course, dear.
Wanted.

241
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,323
呃，不，呃，要求一位……
Uh, no. Uh, required.

242
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:51,539
严厉、受人尊敬言谈稳重的保姆
Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.

243
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,459
以为英国的保姆应该像一位将军
A British nanny must be a general

244
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,089
帝国的未来就掌握在她的手中
The future empire lies within her hands

245
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,260
因此我们需要塑造孩童的人
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

246
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,179
应该是一位能够发号施令的保姆
Is a nanny who can give commands

247
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,807
你记下来了么，威妮弗蕾德？ 噢，是的，亲爱的，一字不差
You getting this, Winifred?
Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

248
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,644
一家英国银行的运作在准确无误的基础上
A British bank is run with precision

249
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:16,356
一个英国家庭也要求丝毫不差
A British home requires nothing less

250
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:21,321
传统，纪律和规则是我们的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

251
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:25,866
失去了这些，将陷入混乱，灾难，无政府状态
Without them, disorder catastrophe, anarchy

252
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,747
总之，可怕的混乱
In short you have a ghastly mess

253
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,041
精辟，乔治！很有启迪
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

254
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,085
《泰晤士报》会很满意的
The Times will be so pleased.

255
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,712
父亲？ 什么？
Father?
Yes?

256
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,215
我们已经商量过了
We've discussed everything...

257
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,677
对今天的所做作为，我们感到非常抱歉
and we're very sorry about what we did today.

258
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,972
我想应该是的
I should certainly think so.

259
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,723
从卡蒂保姆那里跑走是不应该的 是这样
It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
It was indeed.

260
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,059
我们这么干的目的就是想要换一位新的保姆
And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

261
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,230
很明智。我很高兴在这件事上能得到你们的帮助
Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

262
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,358
我们认为你会同意的。所以我们写了一份广告
We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

263
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,777
什么广告 招聘新保姆的
Advertisement for what?
For the new nanny.

264
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,655
你们写了一份广告…… 乔治，我想我们应该听一听
You wrote an advert...
George, I think we should listen.

265
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:04,910
你说过你需要我们的帮助 但我是……哦，好吧
You said you wanted our help.
But, I... Oh, very well.

266
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,413
为两位极其可爱的孩子招聘一个保姆
"Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children."

267
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,126
及其可爱的？应该说是“极其难管”的
"Adorable." Well, that's debatable, I must say.

268
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:15,588
如果你想得到这个职位
If you want this choice position

269
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,927
你应该开朗活泼
Have a cheery disposition

270
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:24,515
简，我不是…… 面庞红润，没有疣子
Jane, I don't...
Rosy cheeks, no warts

271
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:29,396
那是我加进去的 精通各种游戏
That's the part I put in.
Play games, all sorts

272
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:34,318
你必须善良和蔼，聪明机智
You must be kind You must be witty

273
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,364
恬美可爱，且美丽漂亮
Very sweet and fairly pretty

274
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:39,657
好了，简直荒唐透顶…… 乔治，别这样！
Well, of all the ridic...
George, please!

275
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:43,995
带我们出游 款待我们
Take us on outings Give us treats

276
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:47,791
为我们唱歌 还要带上甜点
Sing songs Bring sweets

277
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,835
从不发火
Never be cross or cruel

278
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:56,800
绝不拿蓖麻油和薄粥糊弄我们
Never give us castor oil or gruel

279
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:00,680
爱我们如同自己的子女
Love us as a son and daughter

280
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:05,685
还有不能有大麦茶味儿
And never smell of barley water

281
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:09,148
这条也是我加进去的
I put that in too.

282
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:13,777
如果你不斥责我们，压制我们
If you won't scold and dominate us

283
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,616
我们绝不会做让你恨我们的事情
We will never you give you cause to hate us

284
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:24,664
我们不会藏起你的眼镜，让你找不到
We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

285
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:30,337
把青蛙放在你的床上，或把胡椒粉倒进你的茶里
Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

286
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,757
好保姆，快点来
Hurry, Nanny

287
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:38,680
此致……敬礼
Many thanks Sincerely

288
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:43,728
简和迈克尔?班克斯敬上
Jane and Michael Banks

289
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:45,729
谢谢。非常有趣
Thank you. Most interesting.

290
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,523
现在我听够了你们的胡言乱语
And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense.

291
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:52,320
回房间去吧
Please return to the nursery.

292
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,958
他们毕竟是个小孩子，他们只是想帮帮忙
They were only trying to help. They're just children.

293
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,044
我知道他们还是小孩子
I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred.

294
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,880
我很庆幸我决定介入这件事情
I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand.

295
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,425
“游戏，唱歌，甜点”
"Play games, sing songs, give treats."

296
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:17,055
荒唐！毫无疑问
Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever.

297
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:21,059
该开始行动了
Now is the time for action.

298
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:25,065
请告诉我《泰晤士报》的号码 不，我当然不知道号码
Give me the Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

299
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,775
哦，乔治，你总是这么强势
Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

300
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,986
泰晤士报？我是乔治?班克斯
The Times? George Banks here.

301
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:35,951
樱桃树大街17号。我要在你们的栏目上登一则广告
17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

302
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,930
报时枪准备好了么？ 准备完毕，将军！
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

303
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,559
请报告，宾纳克先生
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

304
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,604
是。风向已经转变，好像来自一个新的区域
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

305
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,399
是的 先生？ 什么事？
So it is.
Sir?
What is it?

306
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,237
左舷船首好像出事了
Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

307
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:15,243
我不得不说，一群可怕的人
Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

308
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:24,796
门外的保姆排起了长队，先生。能让她们进来了么？
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

309
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:28,259
艾伦，我说过了8点钟开始，就8点
Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be.

310
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,302
还有12秒
You see? Twelve seconds to go.

311
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,305
10，9，8…… 各就各位！
Ten, nine, eight... Posts!

312
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,934
7，6，5，4……
Seven, six, five, four...

313
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:40,354
3，2，1！
three, two, one!

314
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:44,526
艾伦，现在8点整了
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

315
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:47,113
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

316
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,991
艾伦，我已经告诉你多遍……
But I have told you time and time again, Ellen...

317
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:52,826
我不喜欢做事没有条理
I dislike being hurried into things.

318
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:59,084
我不明白，他们一点也不符合咱们的广告
I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

319
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,681
迈克尔，看！
Michael, look!

320
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,230
不会是一个巫婆吧。
Perhaps it's a witch.

321
00:23:57,482 --> 00:24:01,360
当然不是，巫婆都是骑着扫把
Of course not. Witches have brooms.

322
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:20,047
就是她，咱们想要的人。她看了我们的广告
It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

323
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:25,137
她符合咱们的每一个条件
Rosy cheeks and everything.

324
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:30,600
艾伦，你可以把她们带进来了，一次一个
Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

325
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:34,312
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:39,152
你请进，每次一位 谢谢
You may come in one at a time.
Thank you.

327
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:42,864
哦
Oh.

328
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:49,204
你就是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？
You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?

329
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,500
我说，你是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？
I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

330
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,127
噢，是的，当然
Well, well ye... Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

331
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,296
你带了推荐信吧？我可以看看吗？
You brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

332
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:59,465
哦，我的原则是不提供推荐信
Oh, I make it a point never to give references.

333
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,592
依我看，那已经过时了
A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

334
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:04,555
是么？我们还是有必要看一看
Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

335
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:08,098
现在，看看广告上的要求吧
Now then, the qualifications.

336
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,854
第一条：开朗活泼
"Item one: A cheery disposition."

337
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,855
我从不生气
I am never cross.

338
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:15,942
第二条：面庞红润
"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

339
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:17,527
显而易见
Obviously.

340
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:21,448
第三条：会做各种游戏
"Item three: Play games, all sorts."

341
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,159
我可以肯定孩子们会发现我的游戏花样繁多
Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

342
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:27,704
这张纸，你从哪里弄到的？我记得我已经把它撕了
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

343
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:31,793
抱歉，第四条：必须善良和蔼
Excuse me. "Item four: You must be kind."

344
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,046
我很善良，但非常严格
I am kind, but extremely firm.

345
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:37,340
你丢了什么东西吗？ 啊！是
Have you lost something?
Ah! Yeah.

346
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:40,344
那张纸，我想我……
That paper, you see. I thought that I...

347
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,972
你是乔治?班克斯先生吗？ 什么？
You are George Banks, are you not?
What?

348
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:46,098
你登了广告招聘保姆，是吗？
And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

349
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:50,022
乔治?班克斯 那就好
George Banks.
Very well then.

350
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:52,899
我撕了它，转过来
I tore it up, turned it over.

351
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,193
又撕了一下，然后扔在哪儿
Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

352
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:58,321
请原谅，你生病了吗？
I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

353
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:01,074
我希望没有
I hope not.

354
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,411
现在谈谈我的薪水吧。关于这一点这上面很模糊
Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

355
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,124
是很模糊 我们有必要明确下来
Very obscure.
We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

356
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:09,876
的确有必要 每隔一个星期二我得休息一天
Yes, we must indeed.
I shall require every second Tuesday off.

357
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,839
每个星期二
Every Tuesday.

358
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:20,430
另外，规定一个试用期也许是明智的做法
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

359
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:31,191
我给你一个星期的时间
Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

360
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:36,404
我去看看孩子们，谢谢你
I'll see the children now. Thank you.

361
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:54,675
迈克尔，把你的嘴闭上，我们不是鳕鱼
Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish.

362
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:58,555
别光站在那儿看，走吧
Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward.

363
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:02,308
动作快点
Spit spot!

364
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,769
乔治？ 哈？
George?
Aah!

365
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,813
乔治，你到底在做什么？
George, what on earth are you doing?

366
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:10,109
我还以为你正在面试那些保姆呢 刚才还是！
I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was! I was!

367
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,943
你是说你已经选完了？
You mean you've selected one already?

368
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,780
是的，都结束了。 那么，她在哪儿？
Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
Well, where is she?

369
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,450
什么？她在孩子们的房间里
What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

370
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,120
我的意思是让她开始工作了。 你太英明了
I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
How clever of you!

371
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,165
要是我一定会把事情搞砸的
I would have muddled the whole thing.

372
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,545
告诉我，她是不是符合我们的所有要求？
Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

373
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:31,466
一切都发生得太快了，我的意思是……
Well, i-it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

374
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,927
她严厉吗？她会发号施令吗？
Will she be firm? Will she give commands?

375
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:37,473
她能塑造孩子们吗？
Will she mould our young breed?

376
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:41,226
我想她能
You know, Winifred, I think she will.

377
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,479
那么，也许最好让艾伦
I think she will. In that case...

378
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,732
告诉其他的人可以走了
perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

379
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:51,403
其他人？哦，是的，艾伦？ 是的，先生？
The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
Y-Yes, sir?

380
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,617
告诉其他人可以走了，这位置已经有了合适的人选
Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

381
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:59,620
其他人？ 是的，其他人。
The others, sir?
Yes, the others.

382
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,584
她以为我们需要几个保姆
How many nannies does she think we need in this house?

383
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:10,467
这个位置已经有了合适的人选
The position has been filled.

384
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:17,851
恐怕我们的房间不够整洁
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

385
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,144
就像一个大熊的窝，对吗？
It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

386
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:22,772
你的包真滑稽 是地毯
That's a funny sort of bag.
Carpet.

387
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,941
你是说包里装的是地毯吗？ 不，是用地毯做的
You mean to carry carpets in?
No. Made of.

388
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:29,362
这是你的房间，从这里可以欣赏到公园
This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

389
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:32,197
嗯
Hmm.

390
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,412
好吧，毕竟不是白金汉宫
Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.

391
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,666
还挺干净
Still, it's clean.

392
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,336
我觉得它很合适
Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.

393
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,007
只是到处需要整理一下
Just needs a touch here and there.

394
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,343
首先，就像我常说的那样
Well, first things first.

395
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:54,932
挂帽子最合适的地方就是衣帽架
I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

396
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:12,534
哈！这怎么能用呢？
Ah! This will never do!

397
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:21,169
我更喜欢大一点的
I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

398
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:23,923
但是里面是空的呀！
There... But there was nothing in it.

399
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:27,093
不要根据表面现象作判断
Never judge things by their appearance.

400
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:31,430
即使是一只地毯包。我就从来没有
Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.

401
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,691
美丽的东西永远是快乐的
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

402
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:48,615
嗯，也许应该更亮一些
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

403
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,796
我们最好多留心这家伙
We better keep an eye on this one.

404
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,590
她很狡猾。 她棒极了。
She's tricky.
She's wonderful.

405
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:07,010
这下好多了！
Much better!

406
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:11,057
我瞧瞧
Now, let me see.

407
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,399
奇怪，我总是随身带着的。一定放在什么地方了
That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

408
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,361
什么东西？ 类型测量尺
What?
My tape measure.

409
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:26,282
你找它来干什么？ 我想知道你们俩个属于哪一类。
What do you want it for?
I want to see how you two measure up.

410
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,706
这是我见过的最好笑的事情。我知道它就在里面的某个地方
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

411
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,669
啊，哈哈，找到了
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is.

412
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,089
好，过来，快一点！
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

413
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,677
抬起头来，迈克尔。别无精打采的。
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

414
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,433
跟我想的一样“非常倔强，多疑”
Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

415
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:54,104
我没有！ 自己看
I am not!
See for yourself.

416
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:57,190
极其顽固，且多……
"Extremely stubborn and sus..."

417
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,777
多疑！
Suspicious.

418
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:03,657
轮到你了，简
Now you, Jane.

419
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:08,954
嗯，“爱傻笑，不把东西放好”
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

420
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:11,623
那么你呢？
How 'bout you?

421
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:16,003
我们来看看吧，拿着！
Very well. Hold this for me.

422
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,551
正如我所预料的，“玛丽?泼平斯”
As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

423
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:24,722
“一切都近乎完美”
"Practically perfect in every way."

424
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:28,725
玛丽?泼平斯！这是你的名字吗？真可爱
Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

425
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:31,228
谢谢。我也一直很喜欢它
Thank you. I've always liked it.

426
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,732
现在，我们可以开始了吧？ 开始什么？
Now, shall we get on with it?
Get on with what?

427
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:37,068
在广告里，你不是特别提到了会做各种游戏吗？
In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

428
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,195
哦，是的！ 很好，那么……
Oh, yes!
Very well, then.

429
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:42,533
我们的第一个游戏就叫做“好的开始是成功的一半”
Our first game is called "Well Begun Is Half Done".

430
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,034
我不喜欢，听上去不太好
I don't like the sound of that.

431
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,245
换个名字就叫“让我们开始整理房间”
Otherwise entitled, "Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

432
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:51,292
我告诉过你她很狡猾
I told you she was tricky.

433
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,546
我们可以开始了么？ 玛丽?泼平斯，你认为这是个游戏么？
Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

434
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,342
这取决于你如何看待它
Well, it depends on your point of view.

435
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,095
你要知道，在每一件我们必须要完成的工作里
You see, in every job that must be done...

436
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:03,345
都蕴含着快乐的成分
there is an element of fun.

437
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,767
你要发现快乐，抓住它！
You find the fun, and snap!

438
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,103
工作就变成了游戏
The job's a game.

439
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:13,942
你承担的每一项任务都变得轻松
And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake

440
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,278
愉快，充满了乐趣
A lark, a spree

441
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,199
显而易见
It's very clear to see

442
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:24,911
一汤匙糖可以
That a spoonful of sugar

443
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,582
帮助你把药喝下去
Helps the medicine go down

444
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,710
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

445
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:36,716
只要一汤匙糖就能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

446
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:42,723
让人意犹未尽
In a most delightful way

447
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:49,732
正在筑巢的知更鸟，没有空闲去休息
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest

448
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:53,903
它要一点一点地收集筑巢的材料
While gathering his bits of twine and twig

449
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:58,491
尽管它那样执着于工作，但它仍然唱着快乐的歌
Though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot

450
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:05,664
因为他知道，歌声会使工作变得轻松愉快
He knows a song will move the job along

451
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,721
因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

452
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:23,142
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

453
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:27,855
只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

454
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:33,946
让人意犹未尽
In a most delightful way

455
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,723
蜜蜂采集花蜜
The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

456
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,479
嗡嗡嗡，飞来飞去，从不厌倦
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

457
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,401
因为它们从采过的每一朵花里只汲取了一点点
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

458
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,945
因此…… 因此……
And hence
And hence

459
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:51,406
它们发现…… 它们发现……
They find
They find

460
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:57,996
它们的任务不再沉重
Their task is not a grind

461
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:08,550
真无耻
Cheeky.

462
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,680
别没完没了得了
Don't be all day about it, please.

463
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:44,088
放我出去！
Let me out!
Let me out!

464
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,686
放我出去！
Let me out!

465
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,982
好了！非常……
Well, that was very...

466
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,568
非常感谢……
Thank you now...

467
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,822
现在，你应该结束了！
When you've quite finished!

468
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:10,409
谢谢！
Thank you.

469
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,082
到此为止吧。请拿上你们的外套和帽子
That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please.

470
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:16,915
接下来，我们去公园
It's time for our outing in the park.

471
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,545
我不想出去，我还想整理房间
I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

472
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:22,923
适可而止是最好不过的了，请跟上来
Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please.

473
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:26,261
让我瞧瞧，你这样子还不够好
Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like.

474
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,846
幸好，还有时间
Still, there's time. There's time.

475
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:32,893
动作快点！出发
Spit spot! And off we go.

476
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:37,106
因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

477
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:41,027
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

478
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:44,697
只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

479
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:49,994
让人意犹未尽
In the most delightful way

480
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:23,156
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

481
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,911
我做我喜欢的事情，我喜欢……
I does what I likes And I likes

482
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,956
我做的事情
What I do

483
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,000
你好，热爱艺术的人！
Hello, art lovers.

484
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,504
正如你所看到的，今天我是个马路画家
Today I'm a screever and as you can see

485
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:42,969
马路画家是最高水平的艺术家
A screever's an artist Of highest degree

486
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,934
这是我记忆中所有的作品
And it's all me own work from me own memory

487
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,311
虽然不是出于英国皇家艺术院
Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

488
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,980
但是看上去还是非常不错的吧？
Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

489
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:57,110
黑烟囱……冒黑烟
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

490
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:02,908
我画我喜欢的，我喜欢我画的
I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

491
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,914
我不索取任何报酬
No remuneration do I ask of you

492
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:11,792
但我的帽子很欢迎
But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

493
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:17,673
一两个铜板
Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

494
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:27,018
等等！别动
Wait! Don't move.

495
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,229
千万别动
Don't move a muscle.

496
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,692
就呆在那儿！
Stay right where you are.

497
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:39,615
我就知道！玛丽?泼平斯！
I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

498
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:43,827
很高兴再见到你，伯特。这是简和迈克尔
It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

499
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,582
我上次看见他们，正在追一只风筝，对吧？
Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

500
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,877
玛丽?泼平斯要带我们去公园
Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

501
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,341
去公园？我知道玛丽?泼平斯是不会的
To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.

502
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,467
别的保姆会带孩子们去公园，但是……
Other nannies take children to the park.

503
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,931
你们现在是和玛丽?泼平斯在一起，一下子你们就到了连做梦都想不到的地方
When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of.

504
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:04,017
迅速到你都还没察觉
And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle"...

505
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,811
最不寻常的事情就开始了
the most unusual things begin to happen.

506
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,397
你再说什么，我一点也不知道
I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

507
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:13,109
好吧，你知道我本来不应该说的，但是……
Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind...

508
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:16,113
她脑子里有一个令人兴奋的好地方
is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.

509
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:19,576
沿着这些线就能到哪儿，对此我是不应感到惊讶的
Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised.

510
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,995
“在泰晤士河上泛舟”如果你们喜欢出游，那绝对是个好去处
"Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing.

511
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:26,750
我们到了
Here we go.

512
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:39,305
马戏团。去看看可爱的马戏团如何？有狮子和老虎
The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers.

513
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:42,475
举世闻名的杂技演员为你……
World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats...

514
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:45,854
表演精彩绝伦的节目
of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.

515
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:49,566
Ta-da!

516
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,298
Ta-da!

517
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:16,094
哦，那太可爱了。如果你愿意的话，我更想去那儿！
Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

518
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,182
很美，是吗？典型的英国乡村景象……
Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside...

519
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,726
好像出自一位真正的乡村爱好者之手
as done by a true and lovin' hand.

520
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:24,688
沿着这条路走下去，翻过这座山……
Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair...

521
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,067
有一个乡村集市，不过你现在看不见
down that road and uh, over the hill.

522
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,529
这儿根本就没有路
I don't see any road.

523
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,240
什么？没有路？
What? No road?

524
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:40,289
只要在这儿添点东西就行了……
Just wants a bit of somethin' here...

525
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:44,919
还有那儿
and a bit of somethin' there.

526
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:49,840
好了，一条乡村小路很适合旅行和探险
There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

527
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,384
请让我们去吧，玛丽?泼平斯
Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please?

528
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:56,222
多可爱的地方啊！你不觉得它很可爱吗？
Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

529
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,893
现在正是时候，玛丽?泼平斯。没人注意
Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

530
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:01,103
求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯！
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

531
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:05,025
我可不愿意出自己的丑，谢谢了
I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

532
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:09,070
好吧，我自己来
All right, I'll do it myself.

533
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,281
你要干什么？ 变个小魔法
Do what?
Bit of magic.

534
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,408
魔法？ 是的，很容易
A bit of magic?
It's easy.

535
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,163
让我来看看。你头脑里想着
Let's see. You think.

536
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,540
眨一下眼睛
You wink.

537
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:23,336
眨两下
You do a double blink.

538
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:27,673
闭上眼，跳！
You close your eyes and jump.

539
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:33,389
什么都没发生啊
Is something 'sposed to happen?

540
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,519
伯特，别胡闹了！
Bert, what utter nonsense!

541
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,690
你为什么总是把很简单的事情弄复杂了
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

542
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:44,026
把手给我，迈克尔。抬起头
Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch.

543
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:47,862
1，2
One, two.

544
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:06,132
玛丽?泼平斯，你看上去真漂亮
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

545
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:10,261
你真的这样认为吗？ 凭良心说，确实是。就像我初次见到你的时候一样
Do you really think so?
Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

546
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:12,724
你也很棒，伯特
You look fine too, Bert.

547
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:15,018
我记得你说过那儿有一个集市
I thought you said there was a fair.

548
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:18,480
是的，沿着这条路往前，山后就是，记住了吗？
So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

549
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,816
快来！我听到了旋转木马的声音
Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

550
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:26,615
告诉他们是伯特让你们去的 别摔了，弄脏了画！
Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

551
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,827
多么美妙的一天
Ain't it a glorious day

552
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,997
就在这五月的早晨
Right as a mornin' in May

553
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:37,209
我想要飞翔
I feel like I could fly

554
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:40,628
别闹了，伯特
Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

555
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:45,050
你见过这么嫩绿的草地吗
Have you ever seen the grass so green

556
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:50,682
或比这更湛蓝的天空吗？
Or a bluer sky

557
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:55,853
噢，跟玛丽在一起就是一个快乐的假日
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

558
00:42:56,105 --> 00:43:00,317

Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

559
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,572
灰暗阴沉的日子里
When the day is grey and ordinary

560
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:08,576
玛丽让它阳光明媚 噢，的确

Oh, honestly!

561
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:13,374
幸福在她的周围荡漾

562
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,586
洋水仙正对着小鸽子微笑
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

563
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:21,924

Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed, that's me.

580

你是裹在破旧衣裳里的钻石
Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

581

Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that?

00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:14,140
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!

643
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,726
哦，是的，绝对，发现狐狸了
Oh, yes, definitely. A view Halloo.

644
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:20,437
发现狐狸？
View Halloo?

645
00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:25,527
天！又是那些英国兵！
Faith and begorra! 'Tis them Redcoats again!

646
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:29,363
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!
View Halloo!

647
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,367
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!

648
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:33,369
Oh, musha, musha.

649
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,373
可怜的家伙，让我来帮你一把吧
Poor lit'I bloke. Let's give him a hand.

650
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:39,959
圣人啊，保佑我们！
Saints preserve us!

651
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,630
呀！
Yikes!

652
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:47,844
跑啊！
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

653
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:59,273
你上来吧，抓好了！
Up you go. Now hang on.

654
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:06,655
你看清楚了么？这可是了不起的旋转木马
Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

655
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,450
过来比试比试呀，你们这帮坏蛋
Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns.

656
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:12,077
我能揍扁你们
I can lick the lot of ya's.

657
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:17,082
快点，美人，快点！
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

658
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,723
噢！骑手们，我可以先行一步吗？
Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

659
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:11,643
当然可以，夫人
Certainly, ma'am.

660
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:15,815
谢谢 不客气，夫人
Thank you.
Not at all, ma'am.

661
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:31,206
非常好的成绩，先生们
Excellent time, gentlemen.

662
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:35,794
哦，是的，非常好 完美的成绩，当然
Oh, yes, quite.
Perfect day for it, of course.

663
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:40,424
多漂亮啊
Oh. Oh, how nice.

664
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:44,221
万岁！万岁！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

665
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:47,849
万岁！万岁！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

666
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:52,146
现在别动，看镜头
Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

667
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,690
玛丽?泼平斯，请你谈谈取得胜利后的感受
Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

668
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:57,025
好的，我…… 赢得了巨大的财富和荣誉吧？
Oh, well I...
Gaining fame and fortune.

669
00:56:57,278 --> 00:56:59,738
是的 可以将你的照片刊登在报纸上吗？
Uh, Yes.
Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

670
00:56:59,988 --> 00:57:01,279
当然，我很愿意
Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

671
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,867
除了你精彩的照片外，你能说几句话描述一下你的心情吗？
Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

672
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:07,286
好的，我…… 有没有一个词能形容你此刻的心情
Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

673
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,875
先生们，先生们，很抱歉
Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.

674
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,376
不过有一个非常好的词
On the contrary, there's a very good word.

675
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:14,963
对吧，伯特？ 告诉他们是什么吧
Am I right, Bert?
Tell 'em what it is.

676
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,965
好的
Right!

677
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:21,553
那就是“超级霹雳快乐的不得了”
It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

678
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,723
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

679
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,935
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

680
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:31,063
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

681
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:34,317
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

682
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:37,112
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

683
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:40,575
当我还是一个小男孩的时候，我很害怕说话
Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

684
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:43,701
我父亲拧着我的鼻子说我太差劲了
Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

685
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:46,914
但有一天我学会了一个词，它救了我的鼻子
But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

686
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:49,626
你听过的最长的一个词
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

687
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,252
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

688
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,366
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

689
00:57:56,618 --> 00:57:59,412
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

690
00:57:59,662 --> 00:58:02,414
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

691
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:05,375
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

692
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:08,295
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

693
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:11,380
他周游世界
He's travelled all around the world and everywhere he went

694
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:14,050
每到一处他就用这个词，人们都说她很聪明
He'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent"

695
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:17,344
我和罗马的公爵，印度的邦主一起消遣
When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

696
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,139
我说这个奇怪的词，他们便请我喝茶
I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

697
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:23,435
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

698
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:26,395
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

699
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:29,398
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

700
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:32,443
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

701
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:35,154
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

702
00:58:35,404 --> 00:58:36,821
你知道，你也可以倒过来说……
You know, you can say it backwards, which is...

703
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:39,157
了得不的乐快雳霹级超
dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.

704
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,659
但你不认为这样太长了点吗？ 毫无疑问
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
Indubitably.

705
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,995
所以当你实在无话可说的时候，没有必要沮丧
So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

706
00:58:44,246 --> 00:58:47,414
就想想这个词吧，然后你会有很多话要说
Here, here! Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

707
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:50,292
不过，要小心用好它，因为它会改变你的生活
But better use it carefully or it could change your life

708
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,834
比如说？ 怎样？
For example.
Yes?

709
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:55,422
一天晚上，我对一个女孩说起它，这个女孩就成了我的妻子
One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

710
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:59,967
她还是那么可爱
Ow! And a lovely thing she is too.

711
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:04,095
那就是，超级霹雳快乐的不得了
She's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

712
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,516
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

713
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:09,019
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

714
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:15,107
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

715
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:25,784
简！迈克尔！
Jane! Michael!

716
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:32,331
靠近些
Stay close now.

717
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,753
哦，伯特，可惜你那些美丽的画
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

718
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:40,047
没关系，它的出处还有好多
Well, there's more where they came from.

719
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:44,093
再说，我就要改行了，这鬼天气，真能热死人
Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

720
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,553
来吧，孩子们 再见，伯特
Come along, children.
Bye, Bert.

721
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:49,431
再见
Bye-bye.
Bye, Bert. Bye.

722
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:51,557
再见，简和迈克尔
Bye, Jane and Michael.
Bye, Bert.

723
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:55,353
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

724
00:59:55,605 --> 01:00:01,109
La dum da da dum
da da da da dum

725
01:00:15,456 --> 01:00:20,334
不，不，我不想吃你这讨厌的药。
No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

726
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,713
必须得吃么，玛丽?泼平斯？
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

727
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:28,842
弄湿脚的人就必须得吃药
People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

728
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:36,100
我不想吃，我真不想……
I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
Oh!

729
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:47,402
酸橙汁！味道好极了！
Lime cordial! Delicious!

730
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:51,906
草莓汁！
Strawberry! Mmm!

731
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,286
朗姆酒
R-R-Rum punch.

732
01:00:57,537 --> 01:01:01,081
真可口
Quite satisfactory.

733
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:04,668
玛丽?泼平斯，你永远都不会离开我们的，是吗？
Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

734
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,963
你的枕头底下有没有手帕？ 嗯
Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
Mm-hmm.

735
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:09,798
如果我们发誓做一个乖孩子，你会留下来吗？
Will you stay if we promise to be good?

736
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,802
阿呃！那是一个脆弱的诺言。轻易地许下，轻易地违背
Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

737
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:16,512
没有了你，我们该怎么办？
Whatever would we do without you?

738
01:01:16,764 --> 01:01:19,474
我将呆到风向改变了为止
I shall stay until the wind changes.

739
01:01:19,726 --> 01:01:21,810
但是，玛丽?泼平斯，那会多长时间呢？
But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

740
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:24,061
请安静些，你们该睡觉了
Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

741
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:28,358
哦，我们根本睡不着。今天遇到了那么多有趣的事情
Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

742
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:31,319
有吗？ 是啊！当我们跳进伯特的粉笔画里
Did they?
Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

743
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,154
我们骑着旋转木马，突然所有的木马都一跃而起
And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and...

744
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,405
我们飞驰在原野上
And we all went riding in the countryside!

745
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:40,327
真的吗？
Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
Really?

746
01:01:40,578 --> 01:01:43,705
玛丽?泼平斯，你都不记得了吗？你还得了赛马冠军
Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

747
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:47,875
一个像我这样受尊重的人出现在赛马会上？你们怎么敢暗示这样的事
A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

748
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:50,418
但是我看见了，是你！
But I saw you do it!

749
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:54,049
别说了，否则，我就要叫警察了！明白吗？
Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

750
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:56,174
确实是这样的！我看见了！
It did happen! I saw it!

751
01:01:56,426 --> 01:01:59,386
去睡觉吧 不，我不想睡
Go to sleep.
No, I don't want to go to sleep.

752
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:02,014
玛丽?泼平斯，我们太兴奋了！
Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

753
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:05,226
好吧，随你们的便
Very well, suit yourselves.

754
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:08,437
保持清醒
Stay awake

755
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:13,359
别放松你的脑子
Don't rest your head

756
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:16,819
别躺在
Don't lie down

757
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:22,033
你的床上
Upon your bed

758
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:26,704
当月亮漫步在……
While the moon drifts

759
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:31,540
夜空的时候
In the skies

760
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:36,296
别睡着了
Stay awake

761
01:02:36,547 --> 01:02:45,179
不要合上你的眼睛
Don't close your eyes

762
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:52,936
虽然整个世界都已入睡
Though the world Is fast asleep

763
01:02:53,188 --> 01:03:01,570
虽然你的枕头柔软舒适
Though your pillow's soft and deep

764
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:09,912
你并没有昏昏欲睡
You're not sleepy as you seem

765
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:15,124
别睡着
Stay awake

766
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,002
别打盹
Don't nod

767
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:23,632
别做梦
And dream

768
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:29,762
别睡着
Stay awake

769
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:35,351
别打盹
Don't nod

770
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:45,153
别做梦
And dream

771
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,291
今天天气很好，宾纳克先生。
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!

772
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:03,294
今早不会再有人睡懒觉了，装双倍的火药
No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

773
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:05,713
双倍的火药？是，将军！
A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

774
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:10,510
会震得更厉害，是吗？
Shake things up a bit, what?

775
01:04:10,553 --> 01:04:13,555
多可爱的早晨啊，艾伦 的确是，夫人
Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
Indeed it is, ma'am.

776
01:04:13,805 --> 01:04:16,765
你把那些臭鸡蛋放到我的包里了吗？ 放了，夫人
Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:19,935
在艾伯特礼堂的集会结束后，我们将去唐宁街……
After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street...

778
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:23,397
把这些东西扔在首相的身上
to throw things at the Prime Minister.

779
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:26,692
你今天早上看上去非常好，乔治
Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

780
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:28,986
厨房里那可怕的噪声是怎么回事？
What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

781
01:04:29,237 --> 01:04:32,781
那是厨师在唱歌 唱歌？她怎么了？
It's Cook singing.
Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

782
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:36,199
她快乐得像一只蟋蟀，老实讲……
She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact...

783
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:39,245
从你雇用玛丽?泼平斯那天起，这屋子里似乎发生了……
since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing...

784
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:41,496
不同寻常的变化 有这回事？
seems to have come over the household.
Is that so?

785
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:44,750
就拿艾伦来说吧，她今早没有打碎一只盘子
Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

786
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,335
真的？那太不同寻常了 还有……
Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
And another thing.

787
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:51,423
他和厨师总是像猫见了狗一样打个不停，但是今天
She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today...

788
01:04:51,674 --> 01:04:56,803
艾伦，亲爱的，我来给你开门吧 谢谢
Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
Thanks ever so, ducks.

789
01:05:03,143 --> 01:05:07,312
艾伦，快停止你那恐怖的歌声吧！
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!

790
01:05:07,522 --> 01:05:09,982
把窗户关上，那鸟叫得我头痛
And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

791
01:05:10,233 --> 01:05:14,278
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

792
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:21,952
安静点，你们闹得主人头痛
Quiet! You're giving the master an headache.

793
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,746
我很担心你今天早上感觉不好
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

794
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:28,374
谁说我的感觉不好？我非常健康
Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle.

795
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,252
我只是搞不懂为什么每个人都这么兴奋
I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

796
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:34,379
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

797
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,216
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

798
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:42,053
这花真可爱，谢谢，宝贝！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

799
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:45,682
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

800
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:47,933
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

801
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:50,562
停！停！停！ 早上好，父亲
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Good morning, Father.

802
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,440
早上好 玛丽?泼平斯教给我们最有趣的一个词
Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

803
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:56,693
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

804
01:05:56,944 --> 01:05:59,571
你们到底在说些什么？超级……
What on earth are you talking about? Supercali...

805
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,488
究竟是什么意思？
Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is.

806
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,740
当你不知道该说什么的时候，你就可以这样说
It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

807
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:06,535
但是我总是知道我该说些什么，走开，请你们快点离开这里
Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

808
01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:11,372
好的，父亲 超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Yes, Father. Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:16,085
威妮弗蕾德，你能解释一下这不体面的喧闹究竟是为什么吗？
Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

810
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,880
我没觉得有什么需要解释的
I don't think there's anything to explain. Do you?

811
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:21,423
很明显你今天早晨有点不舒服
It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

812
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:23,427
孩子们近来只是想让你感觉好一些
The children just came in to make you feel better.

813
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:26,096
我最后一次声明
I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all.

814
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:29,432
我并没有感到不舒服，我的状态很好
I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood.

815
01:06:29,683 --> 01:06:32,267
我不需要别人的安慰
I do not require being made to feel better!

816
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:35,938
但是你常说希望我们的家充满了欢乐和愉快
But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

817
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:38,772
威妮弗蕾德，在愉快和轻率不负责任之间……
Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation...

818
01:06:39,025 --> 01:06:41,443
我要做一点区分
between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

819
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:45,697
打断一下，亲爱的，大家各就各位！
Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

820
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:48,324
我并不反对任何人的欢乐和愉快
I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant.

821
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:50,326
但我坚持合乎传统的礼仪
But I do expect a certain decorum.

822
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:53,288
我要告诉你的是，我不会袖手旁观
I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by...

823
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:58,501
看着那个女人，玛丽?泼平斯摧毁这个家庭的规矩
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and...

824
01:06:58,919 --> 01:07:01,296
自从她来了以后
There's something odd, I may say extremely odd...

825
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:03,964
这房子里出了很多非常奇怪的事情
about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived.

826
01:07:04,215 --> 01:07:09,219
我想让你知道，我已经注意到了 是的，亲爱的
And I want you to know that I've noticed it!
Yes, dear.

827
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:13,015
还有件事情 什么，亲爱的？
One thing more.
Yes, dear?

828
01:07:13,265 --> 01:07:15,057
找个人把钢琴修理一下
I suggest you have this piano repaired.

829
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:18,227
当我坐在一件乐器前面的时候，我希望它别走调
When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

830
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:21,272
可是，乔治，你平常不弹呀！
But, George, you don't play.

831
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:26,736
夫人，这并不重要！
Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

832
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:42,500
让我来看看，首先，我们得去找一位调音师
Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners.

833
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:45,253
然后去考利夫人的……
And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...

834
01:07:45,503 --> 01:07:48,922
商店，买些姜味面包 哈，姜味面包！
Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

835
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:51,509
然后还要到鱼贩那儿买一尾新鲜的鳎科鱼
And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole...

836
01:07:51,761 --> 01:07:53,011
以及一品脱对虾
and a pint of prawns.

837
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:56,013
呃，迈克尔，别在后头慢慢吞吞的
Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

838
01:07:56,264 --> 01:08:00,433
哈嗨！
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

839
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,270
很高兴见到你们 早上好，将军
Good day to you!
Good morning, Admiral.

840
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:08,609
迈克尔，今天我们去哪儿探险？
Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today?

841
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:12,403
是去和霍屯督人战斗，还是去寻找宝藏？
Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

842
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:14,697
我们打算去买点鱼
We're going to buy some fish.

843
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:18,116
非常好！全速前进
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

844
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:20,202
遵命，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

845
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:22,328
小伙子，让我们继续
Let's put our backs into it, lad.

846
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,792
注意外表整洁，这是这儿的规矩
More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

847
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:31,963
是安德鲁
It's Andrew!

848
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:37,636
唔，不要太快，我一个字都没听清你说的
Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying.

849
01:08:38,846 --> 01:08:44,351
又发作了？可怜的人！
Again? Och! Oh, the poor man!

850
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,777
天主保佑你
Bless you.

851
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,239
当然，不能耽搁，我们立刻就去
Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.

852
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,117
非常感谢你
And thank you very much.

853
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,495
他说了什么？ 他说，不客气
What did he say?
He said, "You're welcome".

854
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:07,830
他还说了什么？ 我认为他什么都没有说
What else did he say?
I don't think he said anything.

855
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:10,041
你总是什么都知道
You know best, as usual.

856
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:16,672
我以为我们要去买点鱼 计划有些变动
I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
There's been a change of plans.

857
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:21,551
跟上，别走丢了
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

858
01:09:28,392 --> 01:09:30,727
安德鲁，担心起不了任何作用
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

859
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:34,481
你为何不回家休息休息一会儿呢？
Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

860
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:47,764
哦，伯特，很高兴你也在这里 我已听说就立即赶过来了
Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
I came over the moment I heard.

861
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:49,849
他怎么样了？
Well, how is he?

862
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,768
说实话，我从来没见他这么糟糕过
I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!

863
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,020
他们怎么跟来了？你知道，这病有传染性
How about them? It's contagious, you know.

864
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:59,483
我们会长水痘吗？ 绝对不会的
Shall we get spots?
Oh, highly unlikely.

865
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:03,862
哦，艾伯特叔叔 天主保佑，保佑我的灵魂
Oh, Uncle Albert!
Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

866
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:07,366
是玛丽?泼平斯，我很高兴
It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...

867
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:10,827
我很高兴见到你，玛丽 艾伯特叔叔，你发过誓的
I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

868
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:13,705
我知道……
Oh, I kn... I know, I...

869
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:17,501
我努力了，真的……
But I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I...

870
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,379
但是我太喜欢笑了，你知道吗？
But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well...

871
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,049
我一旦笑起来，就无法控制
And when I start, it's all up with the...

872
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,884
就像现在这样
That's what happens to me.

873
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:31,055
我喜欢笑！我的天！
I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!

874
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:34,683
你看到了，我情不自禁
I can't help it. You can see that.

875
01:10:34,934 --> 01:10:38,478
我就是喜欢笑，没别的
I just like laughing, that's all.

876
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:42,481
简，你敢！你会让他病情恶化的！
Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse.

877
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:47,153
情况确实挺严重的 是的，无论如何，你都必须保持严肃
It's really quite serious!
Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face.

878
01:10:47,403 --> 01:10:52,156
上次，我们花了三天时间才把他弄下来
Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

879
01:10:53,077 --> 01:10:56,621
我爱欢笑
I love to laugh

880
01:10:56,955 --> 01:11:00,457
爽朗的清晰的长久的笑
Loud and long and clear

881
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:04,292
我爱欢笑
I love to laugh

882
01:11:04,878 --> 01:11:08,089
一年比一年严重
It's getting worse every year

883
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,425
我越是笑
The more I laugh

884
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:14,512
就越是感到高兴
The more I fill with glee

885
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:18,724
你在这里起不到任何帮助 越是高兴
You're no help at all.
The more the glee

886
01:11:19,184 --> 01:11:22,477
我就越是一个愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

887
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:24,563
这很令人为难
It's embarrassing.

888
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:29,566
我就越是一个愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

889
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:37,658
有些人从鼻子里笑出来
Some people laugh through their noses

890
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,746
听上去就像这样
Sounding something like this

891
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,582
真烦人！
Dreadful!

892
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,836
有些人从牙缝里笑出声来
Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

893
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:52,672
嘶嘶嘶，就像一条蛇
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

894
01:11:52,924 --> 01:11:55,968
依我看，一点意思都没有
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

895
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:59,471
有些人笑得很快
Some laugh too fast

896
01:12:00,431 --> 01:12:05,352
有些笑得很短暂
Some only blast

897
01:12:05,644 --> 01:12:09,855
其他人，就像鸟儿一样咯咯地笑
Others, they twitter like birds

898
01:12:11,108 --> 01:12:13,025
你知道么，你和他一样严重
You know, you're as bad as he is.

899
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:18,823
有一种人从不掩饰他们的情绪
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

900
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:27,497
当有趣的事情向我袭来
When things strike me as funny

901
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:32,168
我无法将它隐藏
I can't hide it inside and squeak

902
01:12:32,169 --> 01:12:35,505
不得不哈哈大笑
As the squeakelers do

903
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:42,595
只要一开始笑，就得开怀大笑
I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

904
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:45,848
然后
And laugh

905
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:47,432
哈哈大笑
Too

906
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:49,434
太好了！
How nice!

907
01:12:49,686 --> 01:12:52,854
我一直期待你也来
I was hoping you'd turn up.

908
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:57,109
我们在一起过得很愉快
Turn up! We always have such a jolly time.

909
01:12:57,609 --> 01:13:02,113
我们爱笑
We love to laugh

910
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:05,950
爽朗的清晰的长久的笑
Loud and long and clear

911
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:09,829
我们爱笑
We love to laugh

912
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,289
这样每个人都能听到
So everybody can hear

913
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:16,042
你越是笑
The more you laugh

914
01:13:16,293 --> 01:13:18,670
哎哟，你们两个别笑，回来
Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

915
01:13:18,922 --> 01:13:21,048
你越是充满快乐
The more you fill with glee

916
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:24,883
你越是快乐
The more the glee

917
01:13:25,136 --> 01:13:30,348
我们就越是愉快的人
The more we're a merrier we

918
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:37,439
欢迎你们，小朋友，请随意
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

919
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,442
没错，把椅子拉上来
That's right. Pull up a chair.

920
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:42,275
是的，拉上来……
Oh, pull up...

921
01:13:42,527 --> 01:13:45,529
我不得不说你们是在出洋相
I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

922
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,408
说到出洋相，我倒是想起我的哥哥
Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.

923
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,827
他在钟表厂有一份轻松的工作
He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

924
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:54,036
在钟表厂？他做什么？
In a watch factory? What does he do?

925
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:59,041
他一整天闲着做鬼脸（作钟表面）
He stands about all day and makes faces!

926
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:04,755
他在一家钟表厂做鬼脸……
He makes faces in a watch fact...

927
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:09,218
你编的吧？
You made that up. I know.

928
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:13,471
太好了
That's so good!

929
01:14:13,723 --> 01:14:18,183
瞧瞧你们的样子
Such behaviour!

930
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:25,066
这是我见过的最不光彩的一幕，我情愿我不再叫玛丽?泼平斯
Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

931
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:28,485
说到名字，我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）
Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

932
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:31,989
那他的另一条腿叫什么？
What's the name of his other leg?

933
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,325
很有意思吧？那他的另一条腿叫什……
Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other...

934
01:14:35,577 --> 01:14:37,828
孩子们，下午茶时间到了
Now, then, children, it's time for tea.

935
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,289
我可不愿意我的日程被打乱
I will not have my schedule interrupted.

936
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,251
哦，请留步，看，我已经为你们准备了上好的茶
Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

937
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,501
这茶已经凉了
And it's getting cold!

938
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:52,090
我本以为你会……
Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that...

939
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,012
好极了！非常感谢！
Splendid! Thank you very much!

940
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:59,515
请把脚收回去。啊，当心面包和黄油
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

941
01:14:59,766 --> 01:15:03,603
我知道她会这样做的。 这也是合乎传统的茶。
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

942
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:07,063
我猜，你想要我做的下一件事情就是为你倒茶
Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out.

943
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:11,775
好吧，如果有必要，我一定去做
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

944
01:15:11,777 --> 01:15:15,697
如果你们不要像一群笑个不停的猎狗
If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas!

945
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:17,657
两块糖吗？艾伯特叔叔？ 是的，谢谢
Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
Yes, please.

946
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:20,994
伯特，你呢？ 噢，不，不，不要糖
Uh, Bert?
Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

947
01:15:21,245 --> 01:15:24,705
我很高兴你上来。如果你不来的话，就不好玩了
I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

948
01:15:24,957 --> 01:15:28,001
给你自己还有迈克尔加点牛奶
Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

949
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:30,169
你不觉得今年的这个时候天气非常的好吗？
Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

950
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,629
哦，是的。呃，谈到天气……
Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather...

951
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,839
有一天，天很冷
the other day when it was so cold...

952
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:38,551
我的一个朋友想去买件长一点的内衣
a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know.

953
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:41,846
售货员问，你打算要多长的（也可理解为：你打算要穿多久的）
The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"

954
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:47,142
我的朋友回答说，大概从9月到3月
And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

955
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:54,316
简！别太放肆了！
Jane! Control yourself!

956
01:15:54,568 --> 01:15:58,905
孩子们，麻烦你们坐到桌子旁边来
Children, will you please sit up properly at the table?

957
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:02,073
你的茶，艾伯特叔叔 噢，谢谢，亲爱的
Your tea, Uncle Albert.
Oh, thank you, my dear.

958
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:07,579
我很开心，多么希望你们能一直留在这里啊
I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

959
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,497
我们很高兴不得不留下，因为没有路下去
We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

960
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,126
哦不，路是有的
Oh, no, there is a way.

961
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:15,754
坦诚地讲，我不愿提起它……
Frankly I, I don't like to mention it...

962
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,004
因为你得不得不想一些悲伤的事情
because you have to think of something sad.

963
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:20,257
那么请开始吧
Then do get on with it, please!

964
01:16:20,508 --> 01:16:23,260
让我想想看
Let me see.

965
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,763
我知道一件非常合适的事情
I've got the very thing.

966
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:30,516
昨天隔壁的女士应声去开门，一个人站在门外
Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there.

967
01:16:30,768 --> 01:16:35,772
他对女士说，我非常抱歉，我刚刚轧了你的猫
And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

968
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,484
哦，真悲惨 可怜的猫咪
Oh, that's sad.
The poor cat.

969
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:42,779
接着，那个人说，我很愿意替代那只猫
And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat."

970
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,867
女士说，可以，但有一点，你捉老鼠的技术好不好？
And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

971
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:54,289
我真的很努力让自己伤心点，但是……
Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do.

972
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:58,919
一切都那么好笑，我不能……
But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't...

973
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,463
我禁不住……
I can't help...

974
01:17:03,466 --> 01:17:07,010
这已经够了
That will be quite enough of that!

975
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,470
我们该回家了
It's time to go home.

976
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,304
唉，那太让人难过了 哦，不！
Oh, that is sad.
Oh, no!

977
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:16,268
那是我听过的最难过的事情了
Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

978
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,312
来吧，孩子们
Come along, children. Spit spot!

979
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:21,065
你们必须得走吗？
Must you really go?

980
01:17:21,315 --> 01:17:23,941
你知道，大家来看望我
You know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

981
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:28,196
我们一起过得很愉快，然而他们不得不回家
And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home.

982
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:32,409
对此我会感到非常非常的伤心
And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

983
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:35,119
别难过，我们会很快再来的
Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

984
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,163
我们过得非常开心
We had a lovely time.

985
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:39,791
伯特，照顾好艾伯特叔叔，好吗？
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

986
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:44,879
我会再陪他呆一会儿的 谢谢，来吧
I'll sit with him a while.
Thank you. Come on.

987
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:49,758
艾伯特叔叔，我有一个笑话专门留给这样的场合的
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.

988
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:53,177
你想听听看吗？ 好啊，我非常感激
Would you like to hear it?
I'd be so grateful.

989
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:56,806
不必客气，这是关于我爷爷的
Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see?

990
01:17:57,058 --> 01:17:59,309
有一天晚上，我爷爷做了一个恶梦
And one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

991
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,311
他害怕极了，以至于把枕头咬成了碎片
So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits.
Yes.

992
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:04,480
成了碎片……第二天早晨，我说……
To bits.
Yes.
Next morning I says...

993
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:06,022
你感觉还好吗？爷爷？
"How do you feel, Granddad?"
Yes.

994
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:11,820
他回答，呃，不坏，只是有点口干
He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

995
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,618
我常说，没有什么东西比得上一个好笑话
Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

996
01:18:17,869 --> 01:18:23,540
确实是，啥也比不上好笑话
No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That...

997
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:41,723
班克斯，你今晚晚了些，是吗？
Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?

998
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,894
我说，班克斯！出了什么问题了，班克斯？
I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks?

999
01:18:46,145 --> 01:18:50,106
班克斯！
Banks!

1000
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:57,279
噢，父亲，真高兴你回来了 想听个笑话吗？
Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
Want to hear a joke?

1001
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,991
我们今天下午和玛丽?泼平斯在一起过得非常愉快
We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

1002
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,577
说到下午的事情，那个笑话是这样的
Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this.

1003
01:19:02,828 --> 01:19:04,871
我知道有个人名字叫史密斯，他有条假腿
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

1004
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:07,915
史密斯？我们不认识叫史密斯的人
Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

1005
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:12,710
笑话还没有讲完，另一个家伙问，他的另一条腿叫什么名字
And there was a second chap, and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1006
01:19:12,963 --> 01:19:15,756
我们还在天花板上开了一个非常棒的茶会
And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

1007
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,633
哦，孩子们，请安静
Oh, children, please be quiet.

1008
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,552
玛丽?泼平斯说，如果我们乖，她还会带我们去那儿的
Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

1009
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:25,097
哦，玛丽?泼平斯这样说的吗？
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?

1010
01:19:25,348 --> 01:19:27,932
请回到你们自己的房间去，好吗？
Will you please return to your room.

1011
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:31,645
玛丽?泼平斯，请随我来好吗？
Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

1012
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:35,357
好的
As you wish.

1013
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:41,655
玛丽?泼平斯，我很遗憾，有些话我不得不说
Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

1014
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:47,702
晚上好，乔治，有什么问题吗？ 我恐怕是的
Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid there is.

1015
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:51,247
我很想留下来，但是我不得不换衣服了，因为今晚还有个集会
I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

1016
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:53,416
威妮弗蕾德，我希望你能留下来
Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

1017
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:55,418
好的，乔治，当然
Oh, yes, George, of course.

1018
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:59,588
玛丽?泼平斯，我不得不说，我对你感到非常失望
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

1019
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,300
终于轮到她了，我以前就听过主人这样讲话
She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

1020
01:20:03,552 --> 01:20:06,427
我不否认对于孩子们将全部的时间……
I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children...

1021
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,432
都浪费在毫无意义的游戏上，我应该承担一定的责任
to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

1022
01:20:10,683 --> 01:20:13,351
但是，现在已经到了让他们认识到生活的严肃性的时候
But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

1023
01:20:13,603 --> 01:20:15,521
但是，乔治，他们还是孩子
But, George, they're only children.

1024
01:20:15,771 --> 01:20:17,646
精确地讲，鉴于已经发生的……
Precisely. And in the light of what has happened...

1025
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:20,108
乔治，你肯定你在说些什么吗？
George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

1026
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,233
我相信我知道，威妮弗蕾德
I believe I do, Winifred.

1027
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:26,071
一家英国银行运作于准确无误的基础之上
A British bank is run with precision

1028
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:29,951
一个英国家庭也要运作与丝毫不差的基础上
A British home requires nothing less

1029
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:34,247
传统，纪律和规则是我们必须的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

1030
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,541
没有了它们，混乱，无序……
Without them disorder, chaos

1031
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,667
道德崩溃
Moral disintegration

1032
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:43,422
总之，带来的是可怕的，混乱不堪的局面 我非常赞同
In short you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.

1033
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:47,300
孩子们必须被引导，塑造和教导
The children must be moulded shaped and taught

1034
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:50,804
生活是一场终究要面对和参与的战斗
That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

1035
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:53,638
总之，我很惊讶地听到我的孩子们讨论……
In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about...

1036
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,516
跑到马路上的粉笔画里……
popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures...

1037
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,935
与驯马师联欢，猎狐
consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting.

1038
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:01,229
当然，这件事本身我并不反对
Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much.

1039
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,897
毕竟，它是传统的活动
At any rate, it's traditional.

1040
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,484
但是，在天花板上的茶会，请问是怎么回事？
But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.

1041
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:10,447
在天花板上开茶会，以及其它各种令人疑惑的出游！
Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

1042
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:14,826
如果他们必须出游的话，那么，出游应该有
If they must go on outings These outings ought to be

1043
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,828
明确的目标和……是的，实际意义
Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality

1044
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:19,662
还有那些愚蠢的话
These silly words like

1045
01:21:19,915 --> 01:21:23,167
比如超……超级……
Superca... Super...

1046
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:26,545
超级霹…… 超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Superca...
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1047
01:21:26,797 --> 01:21:28,297
是的，很好，就是你说的
Yes, well done. You said it.

1048
01:21:28,548 --> 01:21:30,716
到画里面
And popping through pictures

1049
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:34,635
毫无疑义，没有任何必要
Have little use fulfil no basic need

1050
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:37,097
他们需要开始认识真正的现实
They've got to learn the honest truth

1051
01:21:37,348 --> 01:21:39,474
尽管年纪还小，他们必须学会……
Despite their youth They must learn

1052
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:43,436
向您那样的生活 正是如此
About the life you lead
Exactly.

1053
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:48,692
他们需要体会统计分类帐差额簿的兴奋
They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

1054
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:52,903
成千个数字整齐地排成一行 很对
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.

1055
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:56,782
当瞥一眼显示利润上升的图标
When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

1056
01:21:57,032 --> 01:22:01,161
兴奋就溢满他们那小小的心灵 的确如此
Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely!

1057
01:22:01,412 --> 01:22:05,706
他们应该学着沿着你的脚印走路 是的
It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.

1058
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:09,627
满怀骄傲地沿着你的笔直且狭窄的道路前进 带着骄傲
To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.

1059
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:13,673
明天，正如你所建议的那样
Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

1060
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:17,302
简和迈克尔将会穿着整齐地和你一起
Jane and Michael will be at your side

1061
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:20,136
好极了，你说的准确无误……
Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...

1062
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:22,723
和我一起？去哪儿？
At my side? Where are we going?

1063
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:24,725
当然是去银行，完全按照您的建议
To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

1064
01:22:24,976 --> 01:22:26,893
我的建议？ 当然
I proposed?
Of course.

1065
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:29,563
现在，如果你不介意，明天对于孩子们来讲是个重要的日子
Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children.

1066
01:22:29,814 --> 01:22:34,984
我要让他们睡个好觉，晚安
I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

1067
01:22:43,994 --> 01:22:47,579
威妮弗蕾德，我说过要带孩子们去银行吗？
Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

1068
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:50,583
听上去确实是的，亲爱的 哦
It certainly sounded that way, dear.
Oh.

1069
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,918
为什么不呢？一个极好的主意！
And why not? A capital idea!

1070
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:56,172
这正是对付眼下混乱局面的一剂良药
Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary...

1071
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:58,590
他们在这里接触的都是女人的不切实际的想法
female thinking they get around here all day long.

1072
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:00,424
好主意，非常好
Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

1073
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:04,512
好主意，非常好
Good idea. Quite right.

1074
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:07,514
玛丽?泼平斯，我们不让你走
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

1075
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:09,601
走？你们到底在说什么？
Go? What on earth are you talking about?

1076
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:14,104
你不是被解雇了吗？ 解雇？当然没有！我从来没有被解雇过！
Didn't you get sacked?
Sacked? Certainly not!I am never sacked!

1077
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,983
哦，玛丽?泼平斯！ 好噢，好噢
Oh, Mary Poppins!
Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

1078
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:19,610
我也不是五朔节花柱，请别围着我转。
hurray, hurray, hurray...
Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

1079
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:22,779
但 但什么但……
But?
Goats butt, birds fly...

1080
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,949
孩子们，你们必须早点睡觉，明天要跟你们的父亲一起出去
and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

1081
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,118
别这样，求求你 跟父亲出去？
Come along, please.
An outing with Father?

1082
01:23:28,369 --> 01:23:30,162
是的 我不信
Yes.
I don't believe it.

1083
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:35,375
他以前从来没有带我们出去过 他从来没有带我们去任何地方
He's never taken us on an outing before.
He's never taken us anywhere.

1084
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,208
你怎么做到的？ 做到什么？
However did you manage it?
Manage what?

1085
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:39,962
你一定用了什么方式把这主意塞到他的脑瓜里了
You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

1086
01:23:40,213 --> 01:23:42,381
胡说！
What an impertinent thing to say!

1087
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:45,133
我怎么可能把主意塞进人们的脑袋里？真是的！
Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

1088
01:23:45,384 --> 01:23:47,676
他要带我们去哪里？ 去银行
Where's he taking us?
To the bank.

1089
01:23:47,928 --> 01:23:52,514
哇~迈克尔，去城里！我们能看到好多风景，爸爸会指给我们看
Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us.

1090
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:55,853
是的，多数风景他能发现
Well, most things he can.

1091
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:59,396
但有时候，我们所爱的人却不能看到……
But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own...

1092
01:23:59,647 --> 01:24:03,650
他眼皮底下的事情 眼皮底下的？
can't see past the end of his nose.
Past the end of his nose?

1093
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:07,779
是的，有时候一些小事情其实非常重要
Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

1094
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:09,865
哦，看啊！这是主教座堂
Oh, look! The cathedral.

1095
01:24:10,116 --> 01:24:13,202
爸爸每天都从旁边经过，他常看到
Father passes that every day. He sees that.

1096
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:19,332
每天清晨，在圣保罗大教堂的台阶上
Early each day to the steps of St Paul's

1097
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:25,880
有一位孤独的老妇人
The little old bird woman comes

1098
01:24:26,132 --> 01:24:29,217
用她自己独特的方式
In her own special way

1099
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:33,637
向人们叫卖着
To the people she calls

1100
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:36,681
来买吧
Come buy my bags

1101
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:40,769
鸟食
Full of crumbs

1102
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:44,023
喂喂这些小鸟
Come feed the little birds

1103
01:24:44,273 --> 01:24:47,400
照顾它们
Show them you care

1104
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:54,073
你会感到快乐
And you'll be glad if you do

1105
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:57,493
它们的幼鸟非常饥饿
Their young ones are hungry

1106
01:24:57,745 --> 01:25:00,747
它们的鸟巢非常简陋
Their nests are so bare

1107
01:25:00,997 --> 01:25:11,298
只要花您两便士
All it takes is tuppence from you

1108
01:25:11,548 --> 01:25:14,967
来喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1109
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,347
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1110
01:25:18,597 --> 01:25:21,682
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1111
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:25,394
两便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1112
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:28,731
来喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1113
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:32,318
她正是这样叫卖
That's what she cries

1114
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:35,153
在头顶上
While overhead

1115
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:39,156
鸟儿在空中盘旋
Her birds fill the skies

1116
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:44,745
主教座堂顶上的所有圣人和使徒雕像
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles

1117
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:51,002
都注视着她
Look down as she sells her wares

1118
01:25:51,252 --> 01:25:54,338
虽然你看不见
Although you can't see it

1119
01:25:54,589 --> 01:25:57,925
但每次有人显示出
You know they are smiling

1120
01:25:58,176 --> 01:26:01,428
他的爱心，购买鸟食的时候
Each time someone shows

1121
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:07,642
你知道雕像们正在微笑
That he cares

1122
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:11,061
虽然老妇人的叫卖声
Though her words

1123
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:15,149
微弱而简单
Are simple and few

1124
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,444
听，你听
Listen, listen

1125
01:26:18,695 --> 01:26:23,616
她在向你呼唤
She's calling to you

1126
01:26:23,867 --> 01:26:26,786
喂喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1127
01:26:27,036 --> 01:26:30,621
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1128
01:26:30,874 --> 01:26:34,751
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1129
01:26:35,002 --> 01:26:40,423
两便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1130
01:27:09,076 --> 01:27:11,702
虽然老妇人的叫卖声
Though her words

1131
01:27:11,954 --> 01:27:15,623
微弱而简单
Are simple and few

1132
01:27:15,874 --> 01:27:19,085
听，你听
Listen, listen

1133
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:24,256
她在向你呼唤
She's calling to you

1134
01:27:24,507 --> 01:27:27,800
喂喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1135
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:32,473
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1136
01:27:32,723 --> 01:27:38,436
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1137
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,521
两便士
Tuppence

1138
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:49,072
一袋
A bag

1139
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:11,884
现在给我记住，银行是一个安静且庄重的地方。所以要表现出我们最好的举止
Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

1140
01:28:12,135 --> 01:28:15,011
我还以为那是你的银行 好吧，我是银行里面一个年轻的职员……
But I thought it was your bank.
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers...

1141
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:17,515
所以在某种程度上是，有那么几分
so in a sense it is, sort of.

1142
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:21,642
迈克尔，看！
Michael, look!

1143
01:28:21,895 --> 01:28:23,729
是她 谁？
It's her!
Who?

1144
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,066
她是谁？ 卖鸟食的老妇人，就像玛丽?泼平斯所描述的
It's who?
The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be.

1145
01:28:28,317 --> 01:28:30,901
你确实看到她了，对吧，父亲？ 当然我能看到她
You do see her, don't you, Father?
Well, of course I can see her.

1146
01:28:31,153 --> 01:28:33,071
离我眼皮子这么近的我能看不到？
Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

1147
01:28:33,322 --> 01:28:36,366
听，父亲，她在叫卖
Listen, Father, she's saying it.

1148
01:28:36,616 --> 01:28:39,909
喂喂小鸟，一袋两便士
Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

1149
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:43,288
当然她在叫卖，她还能说别的什么吗？
Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

1150
01:28:43,539 --> 01:28:45,623
我们能喂喂这些小鸟吗？ 为什么？
Please may we feed the birds?
Whatever for?

1151
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,836
我从我的储蓄罐里面拿了两便士 就这一次，求求你了
I have tuppence from my money box.
Just this once, please?

1152
01:28:49,087 --> 01:28:52,297
把你的钱浪费在一群肮脏的鸟身上？当然不行
Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1153
01:28:52,549 --> 01:28:56,260
但是玛丽?泼平斯说…… 我对玛丽?泼平斯说得话不感兴趣
But Mary Poppins...
I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says.

1154
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,262
今天也不想再听到她的名字。现在快跟上来！
Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

1155
01:28:59,513 --> 01:29:01,347
但这是我的两便士！
But it's my tuppence!

1156
01:29:01,598 --> 01:29:04,934
迈克尔，我决不允许你把钱这样扔掉！
Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away!

1157
01:29:05,184 --> 01:29:09,020
等我们到了银行，我会教你该怎么处置你的两便士
When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence.

1158
01:29:09,273 --> 01:29:13,859
我想你也会发现这会非常有意思
And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

1159
01:29:46,975 --> 01:29:49,685
你好，班克斯。这些都是谁？
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1160
01:29:49,935 --> 01:29:52,270
道斯先生，它们都是我的孩子 我想也是
These are my children, Mr Dawes.
Well, so I assumed.

1161
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,648
但他们在这里干什么？ 他们想开一个户头
But why are they here?
They wish to open an account, sir.

1162
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:57,190
真的？ 是的
Oh, indeed?
Yes.

1163
01:29:57,443 --> 01:29:59,861
那么年轻人，你有多少钱呢？
And just how much money do you have, young man?

1164
01:30:00,112 --> 01:30:03,156
两便士。但是我想用来买鸟食 嘘！
Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1165
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:05,867
两便士
Tuppence?

1166
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:11,246
两便士？恰好就是我起家的资金
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1167
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:18,002
那是银行的主席，老道斯先生
That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes.

1168
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:19,836
金融界的一位伟人（也可翻译为巨人，大力士）
A giant in the world of finance.

1169
01:30:20,088 --> 01:30:21,422
一个大力士？ 嘘！
A giant?
Shh, shh, shh.

1170
01:30:21,673 --> 01:30:24,841
唔，父亲，这些是班克斯的孩子
Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.

1171
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:28,679
他们想来开个户头 噢，是么，孩子？
They want to open an account.
Oh, they do, do they, boy?

1172
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:31,473
好极了，好极了
Excellent. Excellent.

1173
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:34,059
我们总，总能让……
We can al-always use...

1174
01:30:34,311 --> 01:30:40,733
让钱发挥更大的作用，对吧？孩子
al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1175
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:43,569
这么说，你有两便士？
So, you have tuppence?

1176
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:45,694
我能看看吗？
May I be permitted to see it?

1177
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:48,114
不，我想用它来买鸟食，喂鸟
No. I want it to feed the birds!

1178
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:54,162
胡说！喂鸟，你能得到什么？更胖的鸟？
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

1179
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:59,375
但是，如果你把你的两便士
But if you invest your tuppence

1180
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,835
明智地存入银行
Wisely in the bank

1181
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:06,756
两便士将完好无损
Safe and sound

1182
01:31:06,757 --> 01:31:12,219
很快，那安全地投资在银行里的两便士
Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

1183
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:16,850

01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:51,591
我来解释吧，先生？ 来吧，班克斯
May I, sir?
Carry on, Banks.

1191
01:31:51,842 --> 01:31:53,926

Very well, my boy, give me the money.
No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

发展成为一笔巨大的财富
Semiannually

但英格兰的银行倒闭时……
When fall the banks of England...

1226

英格兰没落
England falls!

1227
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:21,897
你看到么吗，迈克尔？所有这一切都因
You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

伯特，是你啊！
Bert, it's you!

正是在下，听从你的吩咐
In the flesh, and at your service.

01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:10,723
你可真脏！ 哦，也许是有一两处污渍
You're filthy!
Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1255
01:37:10,975 --> 01:37:13,143
碰巧今天我是个扫烟囱的人
It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

1256
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,603
哦，伯特，我们吓得要命
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1257
01:37:15,855 --> 01:37:17,981
好了，好了，现在不用害怕
Now, now, don't take on so.

1258
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:21,024
伯特会向你们的父亲那样照顾好你们的
Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father.

1259

谁在追你们？ 我们的父亲……
Now, who's after you?
Father is.

1260
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,488
什么？ 他带我们去他的银行参观
What?
He brought us to see his bank.

1261
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:29,825
我不知道我们做了什么，但一定是非常糟糕的事情
I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

1262
01:37:30,076 --> 01:37:33,203
他让警察追我们，还有军队，所有人都在追我们
He sent the police after us, and the Army and everything.

1263
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:35,247
迈克尔，别这么夸张
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1264
01:37:35,498 --> 01:37:38,250
好吧，一定有什么误会
Well, now, there must be some mistake.

1265
01:37:38,501 --> 01:37:40,586
你们的爸爸是个好人，他爱你们
Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

1266
01:37:40,836 --> 01:37:44,630
不可不这样认为。你最好能看见他当时的那张脸
I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

1267
01:37:44,881 --> 01:37:46,591
他压根就不喜欢我们
He doesn't like us at all.

1268
01:37:46,842 --> 01:37:49,760
好了，别好像好像的，好吗？
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1269
01:37:50,011 --> 01:37:53,054
这是事实
It's true.

1270
01:37:53,306 --> 01:37:55,098
让我们坐一坐
Let's sit down.

1271
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:57,851
你知道，……
You know, begging your pardon...

1272
01:37:58,102 --> 01:38:01,146
我很同情你们的父亲
but the one my heart goes out to is your father.

1273
01:38:01,397 --> 01:38:05,233
他在那个冷酷的，无情的银行中日复一日地……
There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day...

1274
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:09,068
被一大堆冰冷的，无感情的金钱所包围
hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1275
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:10,989
我不喜欢看到任何生命被关在笼中
I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

1276
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,741
父亲被关在笼子里了？
Father in a cage?

1277
01:38:13,992 --> 01:38:16,868
笼子的尺寸和形状不同而已，你知道
They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1278
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,954
一些是银行形状的，用地毯什么的来制作
Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

1279
01:38:19,205 --> 01:38:22,166
父亲没有麻烦，我们有！
Father's not in trouble. We are.

1280
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:25,419
哦，你们确信？
Oh, sure about that, are you?

1281
01:38:25,669 --> 01:38:29,088
换个角度想想，你们有你们的母亲照顾你们
Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you.

1282
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:33,051
还有玛丽?泼平斯，琼斯警察，还有我
And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me.

1283
01:38:33,302 --> 01:38:36,012
谁来照顾你们的父亲呢？你们说说看
Who looks after your father? Tell me that.

1284
01:38:36,264 --> 01:38:38,974
当一些可怕的事情发生时，他该怎么办？
When something terrible happens, what does he do?

1285
01:38:39,224 --> 01:38:41,224
他只能自己照顾自己
Fends for himself, he does.

1286
01:38:41,476 --> 01:38:44,352
他向谁倾诉？没人！
Who does he tell about it? No one!

1287
01:38:44,604 --> 01:38:46,563
不能在家里倾诉他的烦心事
Don't blab his troubles at home.

1288
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:51,235
他只是毫无怨言，独自一人，安静地努力承受着
He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1289
01:38:51,485 --> 01:38:55,447
他并不是很安静！ 迈克尔，安静点
He's not very silent!
Michael, be quiet.

1290
01:38:55,698 --> 01:38:59,492
伯特，你确定父亲真的需要我们的帮助吗？
Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

1291
01:38:59,744 --> 01:39:02,495
呃，这个我不该说的
Well, not my place to say.

1292
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:06,331
我只注意到，一个父亲常常需要那么一点帮助
I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help.

1293
01:39:06,584 --> 01:39:10,461
来吧，我带你们回家
Come on, I'll take you home.

1294
01:39:16,718 --> 01:39:19,803
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1295
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:23,347
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1296
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:26,559
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1297
01:39:26,811 --> 01:39:29,979
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1298
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:33,482
或者和我接吻
Or blow me a kiss

1299
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:37,820
好运也会传染给你
And that's lucky too

1300
01:39:38,196 --> 01:39:41,156
当生活就想一串梯子
Now as the ladder of life has been strung

1301
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:44,576
你可以想想在梯子最底端的扫烟囱人
You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

1302
01:39:44,827 --> 01:39:47,954
虽然我成天跟炉灰打交道
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

1303
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:51,625
但在这整个广袤的世界里，没有其它家伙能比我更快乐
In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

1304
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:54,752
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1305
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:58,340
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1306
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:01,551
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1307
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:05,220
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1308
01:40:05,472 --> 01:40:08,474
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1309
01:40:08,725 --> 01:40:11,977
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1310
01:40:12,228 --> 01:40:15,230
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1311
01:40:15,482 --> 01:40:20,651
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1312
01:40:23,447 --> 01:40:26,073
噢，艾伦，去看看是谁，把他们打发走
Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away.

1313
01:40:26,325 --> 01:40:28,951
我已经迟到了！ 是的，夫人
I'm dreadfully late!
Yes, ma'am.

1314
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:32,246
好了，我现在可以离开了。 哦别，请陪我们到父亲回家来为止吧。
Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1315
01:40:32,498 --> 01:40:36,918
如果你跟他握手，他会感觉好多的。
He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

1316
01:40:37,168 --> 01:40:40,545
是孩子们 我想他们应该跟他们的父亲在一起
It's the children, ma'am.
Oh, I thought they were with their father.

1317
01:40:40,796 --> 01:40:43,757
你们不是又逃跑了吧？你们知道这会让我多痛苦吗？
You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1318
01:40:44,008 --> 01:40:45,926
哦夫人，准确地讲他们并不是逃跑
Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am.

1319
01:40:46,177 --> 01:40:48,469
然而，他们受了点惊吓，需要有人照顾
They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

1320
01:40:48,721 --> 01:40:52,515
哦，当然！玛丽?泼平斯会照顾他们的
Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.

1321
01:40:52,767 --> 01:40:55,059
噢，不，今天她休假
Oh, no, it's her day off!

1322
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:59,522
艾伦，我想请你…… 不行，夫人，我自己的活还没有干完呢
Ellen, I wonder if you would...
No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

1323
01:40:59,773 --> 01:41:02,608
好吧，你能问一下布里夫人吗？ 就算给我一百英镑，我也不干，夫人
Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1324
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:08,154
今天是烘焙日，你知道要煮多少东西么！
This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is!

1325
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:09,781
你怎么样，先生？
What about you, sir?

1326
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:12,451
你刚才已经非常热心地照顾这些孩子了
You've been so kind in looking after the children.

1327
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:14,993
唔……我吗？夫人，我……我不得不离开
Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well, l-l-I have to be moving along.

1328
01:41:15,246 --> 01:41:16,997
市长大人家的烟囱被堵住了
The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

1329
01:41:17,248 --> 01:41:19,792
烟囱，你可真聪明
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1330
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:25,337
我们客厅的烟囱糟糕透了。烟不断地往客厅冒
Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1331
01:41:25,588 --> 01:41:27,130
唔…… 非常谢谢！
W-W...
Thank you so much!

1332
01:41:27,382 --> 01:41:31,843
但，但是…… 还有，顺便带好孩子
But...
Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1333
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:33,887
市长大人家的马上就要剧烈地喷发了
The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

1334
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:36,849
哦，谢谢你，我会非常感激的
Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

1335
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:42,978
我必须得走了。我们勇敢的姐妹在监狱中正等着我领她们唱歌呢！
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song!

1336
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,483
再见，亲爱的，一会儿见
Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.

1337
01:41:52,782 --> 01:41:56,117
我骄傲地挑选猪鬃工具，是的，我骄傲
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

1338
01:41:56,367 --> 01:42:01,746
扫帚用来扫烟囱，用刷子来通烟道
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue

1339
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:04,999
这里很黑很暗
Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1340
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:08,002
现在，你将知道你的看法是错误的
There now. You see how wrong people can be?

1341
01:42:08,253 --> 01:42:13,091
这儿是通向你所谓魔法世界的一条通道
That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1342
01:42:13,342 --> 01:42:18,012
在上面烟雾如巨浪般翻滚，卷曲
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

1343
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:20,932
在星星和地面之间
'Tween pavement and stars

1344
01:42:21,182 --> 01:42:25,102
是扫烟囱人的世界
Is the chimney sweep world

1345
01:42:25,103 --> 01:42:27,604
这里几乎没有白天
When there's hardly no day

1346
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:30,691
也几乎没有黑夜
Nor hardly no night

1347
01:42:30,942 --> 01:42:34,945
所有的事物一半在阴影里
There's things half in shadow

1348
01:42:35,195 --> 01:42:38,239
一半在光线下
And halfway in light

1349
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:43,869
站在伦敦的屋顶
On the rooftops of London

1350
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,206
视野真开阔
Coo, what a sight.

1351
01:42:47,457 --> 01:42:49,749
我真希望我们能到上面去
I do wish we could go up there.

1352
01:42:50,001 --> 01:42:52,044
我也是！我喜欢烟囱
So do I! I like chimneys.

1353
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:57,091
非常正确！烟囱是一件完美的东西
Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1354
01:42:57,342 --> 01:42:59,593
她高高地建在屋顶上
She's built tall right up there on the roof.

1355
01:42:59,843 --> 01:43:03,096
当风向正确的时候，风吹过她的顶端
When the wind is just right, it blows across her top...

1356
01:43:03,347 --> 01:43:05,848
驱动烟从烟道中穿过
then draws the smoke right up the flue.

1357
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,727
拿着，用刷子感受一下底部的吸力
Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1358
01:43:09,978 --> 01:43:12,438
这就好像站在鲸鱼喷水口的底部
It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?

1359
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:17,984
迈克尔，小心，你永远不知道站在壁炉旁边会发生什么事情
Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace.

1360
01:43:18,695 --> 01:43:22,155
天啦！
Oh, bother!

1361
01:43:23,324 --> 01:43:27,618
迈克尔，迈克尔，下来！
Michael! Michael, come back down here.

1362
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,080
迈克尔，你在哪里？
Michael! Michael, where are you?

1363
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,580
好吧，我不得不说，这有点尴尬！
Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

1364
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:36,086
伯特，麻烦你不要出馊主意了！
Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads!

1365
01:43:36,587 --> 01:43:38,587
现在轮到下一个 我能跟在后面么？
There goes the other one.
Shall I go after 'em?

1366
01:43:38,839 --> 01:43:42,715
我们不能让他们像袋鼠一样在上面闲逛，对吧？
Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

1367
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:47,179
迈克尔，别害怕。事情正在……
Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going...

1368
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:56,186
你能立刻把你的东西放下吗？
Will you put your things on at once?

1369
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,108
请快一点
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

1370
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:03,611
你在这儿！我以为你丢下我们了。 我们没有这个意思
Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
We didn't mean to.

1371
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:06,406
真好，一切平安无事。事实上……
Well, no harm done. The truth is...

1372
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:10,117
这是你们所说的偶发事件
this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance.

1373
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,952
看那儿
Look there.

1374
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:17,373
一个茂密的雨林正等着我们去探索
A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.

1375
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:21,878
为什么不行，玛丽?泼平斯？ 求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯
Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
Please!

1376
01:44:21,879 --> 01:44:26,967
好吧，如果这是必要的
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

1377
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,137
同意
Fall in.

1378
01:44:31,388 --> 01:44:34,598
精神点，精神点。跟上！跟上！
Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it!

1379
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:38,644
排成一列，立正！
Get in line. Attention!

1380
01:44:38,895 --> 01:44:41,771
扛枪！
A-show arms!

1381
01:44:42,023 --> 01:44:46,569
向右转！
A-right turn!

1382
01:44:51,658 --> 01:44:56,453
齐步走！
Quick march!

1383
01:45:23,103 --> 01:45:26,814
喂，那儿！
Hello there!

1384
01:45:29,818 --> 01:45:33,612
很好，擦干净，迈克尔
It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

1385
01:45:38,201 --> 01:45:42,662
我们只能走到这里了，是吗？ 当然不
As far as we go, right?
Not at all.

1386
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:35,920
我说什么来着？整个世界都在你脚下
What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet.

1387
01:46:36,172 --> 01:46:42,093
只有鸟儿、星星和扫烟囱人见过
And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?

1388
01:46:51,562 --> 01:46:54,146
真棒，但我们必须走出这片夜色
Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air.

1389
01:46:54,398 --> 01:46:58,275
请跟我来
Follow me, please.

1390
01:47:06,367 --> 01:47:10,329
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1391
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:14,624
当你和一个扫烟囱人在一起，就如同与欢乐在一起
When you're with a sweep you're in glad company

1392
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:18,502
哪儿都不如一群快乐的人群
Nowhere is there a more happier crew

1393
01:47:18,754 --> 01:47:22,715
他们都这样唱着
Then them what sings chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

1394
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:25,633
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy chim chim

1395
01:47:25,886 --> 01:47:30,180
冒黑烟……
Cheree chim cheroo

1396
01:47:30,431 --> 01:47:33,183

1454
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,054
不，真的，这时候不行。
Oh, no, really, not at the moment.

1455
01:54:53,305 --> 01:54:57,850
争取妇女投票权！
Votes for women!

1456
01:55:07,819 --> 01:55:11,739
主人回来了！
It's the master!
It's the master, step in time It's the master, step in time

1457
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:13,907
这都是些什么？
What's all this?
What's all this
What's all this?
What's all this

1458
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,368
这都是些什么
What's all this
What's all this, What's all this

1459
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,910
排成一列踢腿。来跳舞
Link your elbows, step in time
What's all this?

1460
01:55:18,163 --> 01:55:19,913
提起你的膝盖
Kick your knees up
What's all this? Step in time

1461
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:22,206
伯特。
Kick your knees up, Kick your knees up
Bert.
Kick your knees up

1462
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:26,252
提起你的膝盖
Kick your knees up in time

1463
01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:30,673
祝好运，老爸，多美好的时光
Good luck, guv'nor.
Lovely time!

1464
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:34,509
祝你有个文雅的时光，老爸
Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

1465
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,643
祝好运，老爸
Good luck, guv'nor.

1466
01:56:20,387 --> 01:56:22,889
哦，父亲，这些扫烟囱人都握过你的手
Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand.

1467
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:25,432
你将会变成世界上最幸运的人！
You're going to be the luckiest person in the world!

1468
01:56:25,683 --> 01:56:28,477
来吧，孩子们，快点 等一等，玛丽?泼平斯
Come along, children. Spit spot.
Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1469
01:56:28,728 --> 01:56:31,604
这简直是件骇人听闻的事件
What is the meaning of this outrage?

1470
01:56:31,856 --> 01:56:36,025
你再说一遍？ 你最好给我一个合理的解释
I beg your pardon?
Will you be good enough to explain all this?

1471
01:56:36,278 --> 01:56:38,529
首先，我愿明确地解释一件事情
First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

1472
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:41,239
什么？
Yes?

1473
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:45,160
我从不解释任何事
I never explain anything.

1474
01:56:50,416 --> 01:56:52,918
是，我是班克斯
Yes. Banks here.

1475
01:56:53,169 --> 01:56:56,921
道斯先生！我非常非常的抱歉。关于今天在银行发生的事情
Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today.

1476
01:56:57,172 --> 01:57:01,341
我可以保证…… 今晚，先生？
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?

1477
01:57:01,593 --> 01:57:05,053
是的，班克斯。我们希望你9点准时到达
Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

1478
01:57:05,305 --> 01:57:09,266
不能迟到
Without fail.
Without fail.

1479
01:57:09,516 --> 01:57:11,559
为什么，班克斯。
Why, yes, Banks.

1480
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,311
这是极其严重的事件
It's extremely serious.

1481
01:57:13,562 --> 01:57:15,521
我们对这一系列决定非常遗憾
We regret this course of action.

1482
01:57:15,773 --> 01:57:17,064
我们非常遗憾
We regret this course of action.

1483
01:57:17,316 --> 01:57:20,026
毕竟，你和我们共事多年
After all, you have been with us a good many years.

1484
01:57:20,276 --> 01:57:23,569
毕竟，共事多年 在此之前是你的父亲
After all, you have been with us a good many years.
As was your father before you.

1485
01:57:23,822 --> 01:57:26,658
之前是你的父亲
As was your father before you.

1486
01:57:26,908 --> 01:57:32,120
是的，道斯先生。我会9点到
Yes, Mr Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

1487
01:57:52,557 --> 01:57:58,478
一个男人梦想着与巨人同行
A man has dreams of walking with giants.

1488
01:57:58,772 --> 01:58:04,151
在漫漫人生旅途中雕琢环境
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

1489
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:09,239
在他的热情
Before the mortar of his zeal

1490
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:13,117
凝固之前
Has a chance to congeal

1491
01:58:13,369 --> 01:58:15,661
奖杯是奖励给冲过终点线的人！
The cup is dashed from his lips!

1492
01:58:15,913 --> 01:58:18,039
激情尚未迸发便被浇灭
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1493
01:58:18,289 --> 01:58:22,041
他在他全盛时期被毁灭
He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

1494
01:58:23,253 --> 01:58:26,506
生活就像一杯朗姆酒，老爸。这是事实。
Life is a rum go, guv'nor. And that's the truth.

1495
01:58:26,756 --> 01:58:29,549
你知道我想什么吗？是那个女人——玛丽?泼平斯说的。
You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1496
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:33,094
从她踏进这所房子的那一刻开始，许多事情就发生了！
From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

1497
01:58:33,345 --> 01:58:36,430
玛丽?泼平斯？ 是的，当然。
Mary Poppins?
Yes, yes, of course.

1498
01:58:36,683 --> 01:58:40,602
我的世界曾经平静
My world was calm

1499
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:45,313
井然有序，值得效仿
Well-ordered Exemplary.

1500
01:58:45,565 --> 01:58:48,484
自打这个人带着被她唤醒的
Then came this person

1501
01:58:48,735 --> 01:58:53,531
混乱，来了以后
With chaos in her wake

1502
01:58:53,865 --> 01:58:59,078
现在我生活的抱负一下子
And now my life's ambitions go

1503
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:03,998
被打倒了
With one fell blow

1504
01:59:04,249 --> 01:59:11,505
这是相当难以
It's quite a bitter pill

1505
01:59:11,881 --> 01:59:13,131
表述的
To take.

1506
01:59:13,384 --> 01:59:15,384
这就那个姓泼平斯的女人！就是她造成的！
It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

1507
01:59:15,635 --> 01:59:17,927
我知道你说的这个女人
I know the very person you mean.

1508
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:20,179
玛丽?泼平斯，她就是那个唱着……
Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

1509
01:59:20,432 --> 01:59:23,268
一汤匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1510
01:59:23,518 --> 01:59:26,811
那就是全部
That is all it takes

1511
01:59:27,062 --> 01:59:29,397
它把面包和水
It changes bread and water

1512
01:59:29,648 --> 01:59:32,358
变成了茶和蛋糕
Into tea and cakes

1513
01:59:32,609 --> 01:59:34,068
你明白了吗？那正是我的意思！
You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1514
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,114
把面包和水变成茶和蛋糕！确实是！
Changing bread and water into tea and cakes! Indeed!

1515
01:59:37,364 --> 01:59:40,199
难怪这里每件事情都杂乱无章
No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

1516
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,910
一汤匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1517
01:59:43,161 --> 01:59:46,329
每天走很长很长的路
Goes a long, long way

1518
01:59:46,581 --> 01:59:49,375
有助于你的
Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1519
01:59:49,626 --> 01:59:52,210
健康
Every day

1520
01:59:52,461 --> 01:59:53,920
如果你问我，一个有益健康的问题
An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

1521
01:59:54,171 --> 01:59:56,171
你知道她怎么做的吗？我现在意识到了
Do you know what she did? I realize it now.

1522
01:59:56,423 --> 01:59:58,883
她怂恿我带简和迈克尔来银行
She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank.

1523
01:59:59,135 --> 02:00:01,344
这正是所有麻烦的开始
That's how all the trouble started.

1524
02:00:01,595 --> 02:00:03,887
怂恿你带孩子们出门远足？ 是的
Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
Yes.

1525
02:00:04,138 --> 02:00:05,764
真无耻！
Outrageous!

1526
02:00:06,015 --> 02:00:11,602
一个男人有许多重要的事情要去做。真可耻！
A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful!

1527
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:15,274
你是一个有身份的男人
You're a man of high position.

1528
02:00:15,525 --> 02:00:18,360
受同龄人的尊敬
Esteemed by your peers.

1529
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,946
当你的孩子们哭泣的时候
And when your little tykes are cryin'

1530
02:00:22,197 --> 02:00:26,074
你没有时间去擦干他们的眼泪
You haven't time to dry their tears

1531
02:00:26,326 --> 02:00:30,078
瞧瞧他们感激地小脸蛋
And see them grateful little faces

1532
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:33,709
冲着你微笑
Smilin' up at you

1533
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:36,002
因为他们的爸爸
Because their dad

1534
02:00:36,253 --> 02:00:40,714
总是知道什么是应该做的
He always knows just what to do

1535
02:00:40,965 --> 02:00:44,968
呃，我的意思是，瞧，我不认为我…… 就像你说的，老爸
Well, I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca...
Like you say, guv'nor.

1536
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:49,557
你不得不在石磨上
You've got to grind, grind, grind

1537
02:00:49,808 --> 02:00:53,060
不停地磨呀磨呀磨
At that grindstone

1538
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:55,770
虽然童年时光
Though childhood slips

1539
02:00:56,021 --> 02:01:01,109
就像沙子穿过沙漏
Like sand through a sieve

1540
02:01:01,484 --> 02:01:06,155
很快他们就长大
And all too soon they've up and grown

1541
02:01:06,406 --> 02:01:10,867
接着他们就离你而去
And then they've flown

1542
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,579
那时你再后悔
And it's too late

1543
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:19,709
就太迟了
For you to give

1544
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:26,300
就好像一汤匙糖
Just that spoonful of sugar

1545
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:30,594
能够帮助把药服下
To help the medicine go down

1546
02:01:30,846 --> 02:01:34,932
甜药
The medicine go down

1547
02:01:35,183 --> 02:01:38,102
好入口
Medicine go down

1548
02:01:38,353 --> 02:01:43,106
好了，再见，老爸，很抱歉给你惹了这么多麻烦
Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

1549
02:01:54,868 --> 02:01:57,119
父亲？
Father?

1550
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:59,954
我们对两便士的事情非常抱歉
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1551
02:02:00,206 --> 02:02:05,043
我们不知道那会引起这么大的麻烦
We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

1552
02:02:10,174 --> 02:02:14,844
父亲，给你两便士
Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.

1553
02:02:26,898 --> 02:02:31,319
这样能平息所有的风波吗？
Will that make everything all right?

1554
02:02:31,569 --> 02:02:35,572
谢谢
Thank you.

1555
02:05:25,483 --> 02:05:29,235
进来!
Come in!

1556
02:05:36,618 --> 02:05:39,745
把帽子脱掉，班克斯
Take your hat off, Banks.

1557
02:05:52,759 --> 02:05:56,595
晚上好，先生们
Good evening, gentlemen.

1558
02:05:58,097 --> 02:05:59,889
很好，继续
Well, get on with it. Go on.

1559
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:03,892
是，父亲
Uh, yes, Father.

1560
02:06:05,812 --> 02:06:09,688
在1773年，这家银行的一位职员……
In 1773, an official of this bank...

1561
02:06:09,942 --> 02:06:12,234
愚蠢地将一大笔钱借给
unwisely loaned a large sum of money...

1562
02:06:12,485 --> 02:06:16,571
往北美殖民地海运茶叶的贸易
to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.

1563
02:06:16,821 --> 02:06:20,533
知道后来发生了什么事？ 是的，先生，我想我知道
Do you know what happened?
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1564
02:06:20,785 --> 02:06:22,660
当船停泊在波士顿港的时候
Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston Harbor...

1565
02:06:22,912 --> 02:06:25,413
一群殖民地居民打扮成印第安人
uh, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians...

1566
02:06:25,665 --> 02:06:30,542
登上了船，举止非常粗鲁，还将所有的茶叶倾倒到海里
uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard.

1567
02:06:30,794 --> 02:06:33,545
导致茶叶味道变质
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking...

1568
02:06:33,797 --> 02:06:38,008
即使是美国人也不愿意喝
even for Americans.

1569
02:06:41,345 --> 02:06:45,056
很对。这笔借款成了呆账
Precisely. The loan was defaulted.

1570
02:06:45,308 --> 02:06:47,851
在这堵墙内的恐慌接踵而至
Panic ensued within these walls.

1571
02:06:48,102 --> 02:06:51,062
银行发生了挤兑事件！
There was a run on the bank!

1572
02:06:51,313 --> 02:06:53,231
从那时起到现在，先生……
From that time to this, sir...

1573
02:06:53,482 --> 02:06:58,486
这家银行还没有发生过一起挤兑事件
there has not been a run on this bank...

1574
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:01,446
直到今天！
until today!

1575
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:06,575
一场挤兑事件，先生，起因是你儿子的可耻的行为
A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.

1576
02:07:06,828 --> 02:07:10,247
对此你否认吗？ 我不否认，先生
Do you deny it?
I do not deny it, sir.

1577
02:07:10,498 --> 02:07:16,169
我只能情愿为我儿子的行为承担责任
And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

1578
02:07:18,381 --> 02:07:24,010
你还在等什么？继续！ 是，是的，父亲
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Uh, y-yes, Father.

1579
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,697
不，别这样！ 镇定！
No, not that!
Steady on.

1580
02:08:04,715 --> 02:08:07,299
好了，班克斯，你还有什么话要说的吗？
Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

1581
02:08:07,551 --> 02:08:11,387
先生，他们说……
Well, sir, they do say that...

1582
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:17,644
当你无话可说的时候，你就可以说……
when there's nothing to say, all you can say i...

1583
02:08:19,688 --> 02:08:24,233
班克斯，请搞清楚！我问，你还有什么说的吗？
Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

1584
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:28,570
只有一个词，先生 什么词？
Just one word, sir.
Yes?

1585
02:08:28,822 --> 02:08:32,741
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1586
02:08:33,285 --> 02:08:34,243
什么？
What?

1587
02:08:34,493 --> 02:08:37,328
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1588
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:42,375
玛丽?泼平斯是对的。这个词很特别，确实能让你感觉好多了！
Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

1589
02:08:42,418 --> 02:08:44,418
你在说什么？没有这个词
What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

1590
02:08:44,669 --> 02:08:47,921
不，有这个词。实际上，它是一个完美的词
Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually.

1591
02:08:48,173 --> 02:08:49,590
你知道有这样的事情吗？
Do you know what there's no such thing as?

1592
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:53,009
当所有的事情都说过并做过后，发生……
It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done...

1593
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:56,096
像你这样的事情……
that there's no such thing as you!

1594
02:08:56,347 --> 02:08:58,014
主题，先生！注意谈话的主题
Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence...

1595
02:08:58,266 --> 02:09:00,600
你想听一个绝妙的笑话吗？
would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?

1596
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:03,352
一个真正的笑话！ 笑话？真正的？
A real snapper!
Joke? Snapper?

1597
02:09:03,604 --> 02:09:06,690
是的，有两个优秀的年轻人，简和迈克尔
Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael.

1598
02:09:06,941 --> 02:09:10,234
有一天他们在街上相遇，简跟迈克尔说
And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael...

1599
02:09:10,485 --> 02:09:13,069
我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）
"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."

1600
02:09:13,321 --> 02:09:19,075
迈克尔问，真的？那他的另一只腿叫什么？
And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

1601
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:22,370
这个人疯了，叫警卫
The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

1602
02:09:22,621 --> 02:09:25,999
超级霹雳快乐得不得了，我感觉好极了！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

1603
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,209
班克斯，不准你打击我的父亲！
Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

1604
02:09:28,461 --> 02:09:30,753
这是那两便士 这是命中注定的，绝妙的
There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful...

1605
02:09:31,005 --> 02:09:33,880
超级霹雳快乐得不得了 的两便士
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious tuppence.

1606
02:09:34,133 --> 02:09:37,051
好好保护它，再见！ 班克斯，你要去哪儿？
Guard it well. Goodbye!
Banks, where are you going?

1607
02:09:37,303 --> 02:09:40,054
我不知道 也许跳进马路上的粉笔画里
I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture,

1608
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:41,723
去乡下远足
and go for an outing in the country.

1609
02:09:41,973 --> 02:09:45,225
或者骑着一匹旋转木马，赢得赛马比赛
Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

1610
02:09:45,477 --> 02:09:49,439
或者仅仅去放风筝！这只有泼平斯知道！
Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

1611
02:09:49,689 --> 02:09:53,608
泼平斯？ 我的保姆。那首荒谬的歌就是她唱的。
Poppins?
My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

1612
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:58,113
一汤匙糖让苦药服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1613
02:09:58,364 --> 02:10:00,115
甜药好入口
The medicine go down

1614
02:10:00,366 --> 02:10:04,369
甜药好入口……
The medicine go down The medicine...

1615
02:10:05,537 --> 02:10:08,247
像三月里的野兔般疯狂
Mad as a March hare.

1616
02:10:08,498 --> 02:10:13,043
一只叫史密斯的木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1617
02:10:13,712 --> 02:10:19,007
史密斯有条木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1618
02:10:19,508 --> 02:10:23,385
木假腿……
A wooden le...

1619
02:10:35,357 --> 02:10:38,525
父亲？父亲！
Father? Father!

1620
02:10:38,777 --> 02:10:40,612
父亲，下来！
Father, come down!

1621
02:10:40,862 --> 02:10:46,449
爸爸，爸爸！回来！
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1622
02:10:53,916 --> 02:10:59,545
风向转变了，非常精确地从西边刮来！
Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

1623
02:11:00,423 --> 02:11:02,466
她不关心我们身上发生的事情
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1624
02:11:02,716 --> 02:11:07,803
她只答应呆到风向转变为止。是吧，玛丽?泼平斯？
She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1625
02:11:08,053 --> 02:11:12,557
请把衣帽架递过来好吗？
Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

1626
02:11:13,225 --> 02:11:18,646
玛丽?泼平斯，你不爱我们了吗？
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1627
02:11:19,315 --> 02:11:21,941
不关心我们的遭遇了吗？
And what would happen to me
may I ask...

1628
02:11:22,193 --> 02:11:27,237
请问如果我爱所有的小孩，我该给谁告别呢？
if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?

1629
02:11:28,656 --> 02:11:31,491
是的，先生，没错。乔治 W 班克斯
Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks.

1630
02:11:31,744 --> 02:11:33,995
樱桃树大街17号
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1631
02:11:34,245 --> 02:11:36,455
大约6英尺高，是的。
About six foot one, I'd say, sir.

1632
02:11:36,706 --> 02:11:39,999
是的，今天早上第一件事情就是给他工作的银行打了电话
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning.

1633
02:11:40,251 --> 02:11:44,003
目前我们所知道的唯一事情就是，他昨晚就已经离开了
The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night.

1634
02:11:44,255 --> 02:11:47,257
他很沮丧，没说要干什么
No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

1635
02:11:47,508 --> 02:11:49,343
不会去投河吧？
Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.

1636
02:11:49,593 --> 02:11:53,470
在萨克福桥附近有一个非常合适的地点，因投河自尽而闻名
There's a nice spot there by Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

1637
02:11:53,723 --> 02:11:56,266
真的，艾伦！
Really, Ellen!

1638
02:11:56,516 --> 02:11:59,518
他看上去还不错，很镇定，先生
He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1639
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:02,688
没有阴谋，如果你知道我的意思。
No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.

1640
02:12:02,939 --> 02:12:06,192
呃，日常习惯嘛。几乎没有人知道 甜药好入口
Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down

1641
02:12:06,443 --> 02:12:08,443
甜药好入口
The medicine go down

1642
02:12:08,694 --> 02:12:11,112
只要一汤匙糖 是他！
Just a spoonful of sugar
It's him!

1643
02:12:11,363 --> 02:12:13,406
帮你把苦药…… 或者声音听起来像是他
Helps the medicine
Or something that sounds like him.

1644
02:12:13,657 --> 02:12:15,532
服下 班克斯夫人，能不能让房子里的人小声一点
Go down
Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise...

1645
02:12:15,786 --> 02:12:20,623
我听不到警长的声音了 他现在很兴奋
on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.
In the most delightful way

1646
02:12:20,873 --> 02:12:23,208
只要一汤匙糖
Just a spoonful of sugar

1647
02:12:23,459 --> 02:12:26,794
让苦药服下 乔治！
Makes the medicine go down
George!

1648
02:12:27,046 --> 02:12:29,338
哦，乔治，你没有去投河
Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.

1649
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:31,589
你真明智啊
How sensible of you.

1650
02:12:31,841 --> 02:12:35,052
好了，先生，找到他了！
It's all right, sir. He's been found!

1651
02:12:35,303 --> 02:12:37,221
不，还活着！
No, alive!

1652
02:12:37,472 --> 02:12:41,349
或者我以为。他正在亲吻班克斯夫人
Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

1653
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,726
我真的很担心，在银行发生了什么事情？
I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

1654
02:12:43,978 --> 02:12:46,730
我被解雇了，赶了出来，扔到了大街上
I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

1655
02:12:46,981 --> 02:12:51,234
一汤匙糖能让苦药服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1656
02:12:51,485 --> 02:12:54,904
他刚才的行为有点不正常
Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

1657
02:12:55,155 --> 02:12:58,157
甜药好入口 疯疯癫癫的
The medicine go down
Dotty as you please.

1658
02:12:58,408 --> 02:13:01,576
乔治，你在地下室到底在做什么？
George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

1659
02:13:01,827 --> 02:13:05,538
一会儿你就知道了。孩子们在哪里？简？迈克尔？
You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1660
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:08,957
你们的父亲在叫。 听起来不像是父亲的声音
Your father's calling you.
It doesn't sound like Father.

1661
02:13:09,211 --> 02:13:14,465
简？迈克尔？ 快跑去吧
Jane? Michael?
Run along. Spit spot!

1662
02:13:18,092 --> 02:13:21,053
你不会走吧，玛丽?泼平斯？
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1663
02:13:21,304 --> 02:13:25,516
快！快！
Spit spot.

1664
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:37,486
他修好了！
He mended it!

1665
02:13:40,823 --> 02:13:44,283
太好了！ 你怎么修的？
It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?

1666
02:13:44,534 --> 02:13:47,495
花两便士买了纸和绳子
With tuppence for paper and strings

1667
02:13:47,745 --> 02:13:50,789
双脚站在地上
You can have your own set of wings

1668
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:56,252
你可以让风筝拥有自己的翅膀 紧紧抓住绳子
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight

1669
02:13:56,504 --> 02:13:59,964
你就能像鸟儿一样飞翔
With your fist holding tight

1670
02:14:00,216 --> 02:14:02,258
来放飞你的风筝吧
To the string of your kite

1671
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:04,969
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1672
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:08,513
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1673
02:14:08,766 --> 02:14:12,102
让它飞向空中的最高处
Up to the highest height

1674
02:14:12,353 --> 02:14:15,480
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1675
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:19,274
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1676
02:14:19,527 --> 02:14:22,654
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1677
02:14:22,904 --> 02:14:26,281
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1678
02:14:26,533 --> 02:14:32,119
哦，让我们去放风筝
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1679
02:14:32,413 --> 02:14:34,665
你不认为，一个好风筝需要一条合适的尾巴吗？
A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

1680
02:14:34,915 --> 02:14:39,793
那是我说的，先生。去放飞风筝！
That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite!

1681
02:14:40,045 --> 02:14:43,922
哦，不，先生。我不是说你
Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

1682
02:14:44,174 --> 02:14:47,510
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1683
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,845
让它飞向空中的最高处
Up to the highest height

1684
02:14:51,097 --> 02:14:54,264
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1685
02:14:54,517 --> 02:14:58,061
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1686
02:14:58,312 --> 02:15:01,439
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1687
02:15:01,691 --> 02:15:05,110
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1688
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:10,990
哦，让我们去放风筝
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1689
02:15:11,534 --> 02:15:15,036
当你高高地放飞风筝
When you send it flying up there

1690
02:15:15,286 --> 02:15:18,372
立刻你会感觉自己比空气还轻
All at once you're lighter than air

1691
02:15:18,623 --> 02:15:23,501
你能在吹过房子和树林的风里起舞
You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees

1692
02:15:23,752 --> 02:15:27,045
用你的手紧紧握住绳子
With your fist holding tight

1693
02:15:27,297 --> 02:15:29,423
系上你的风筝
To the string of your kite

1694
02:15:29,675 --> 02:15:31,634
放！
Oh, oh, oh
Now!

1695
02:15:31,885 --> 02:15:35,596
让我们去放风筝

1699
02:15:46,524 --> 02:15:48,733
班克斯，你在这里啊
Oh, there you are, Banks.

1700
02:15:48,985 --> 02:15:50,902
我要祝贺你
I want to congratulate you.

1701
02:15:51,153 --> 02:15:54,948
绝妙的笑话。叫史密斯的木腿
Capital bit of humour. Wooden leg named Smith.

1702
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,367
或者琼斯或者其他
Or Jones or whatever it was.

1703
02:15:57,618 --> 02:16:00,537
父亲在笑中死去
Father died laughing.

1704
02:16:00,788 --> 02:16:05,417
噢，我很抱歉，先生 不，没什么可抱歉的。
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1705
02:16:05,668 --> 02:16:07,877
在他的一生中从没有见他这么快活过
Never seen him happier in his life.

1706
02:16:08,128 --> 02:16:10,254
他留下了一个新合伙人职位的空档
He left an opening for a new partner.

1707
02:16:10,505 --> 02:16:12,631
恭喜了
Congratulations.

1708
02:16:12,882 --> 02:16:16,260
谢谢你，先生 真的谢谢你
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1709
02:16:16,511 --> 02:16:19,513
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1710
02:16:19,763 --> 02:16:22,974
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1711
02:16:23,225 --> 02:16:27,728
哦，让我们一起
Oh, let's go

1712
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,523
去放风筝
Fly a kite

1713
02:16:32,734 --> 02:16:34,609
这需要感谢你
That's gratitude for you.

1714
02:16:34,862 --> 02:16:38,239
甚至没有说声再见吗？ 是，他们没说
Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.

1715
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:44,160
看看他们，你知道，你跟他们的父亲相比，他们更想念父亲
Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

1716
02:16:44,412 --> 02:16:48,790
那是自然 好吧，你不在乎？
That's as it should be.
Well, don't you care?

1717
02:16:49,041 --> 02:16:52,793
近乎完美的人从不允许在他们的思想中掺杂个人感情
Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1718
02:16:53,045 --> 02:16:58,466
真的是这样？我告诉你，玛丽?泼平斯，你别骗我了。
Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

1719
02:16:58,717 --> 02:17:03,011
真的？ 真的！我完全知道你对这些孩子们的感情
Oh, really?
Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children.

1720
02:17:03,264 --> 02:17:07,642
如果你会认为我继续保持沉默，我……
And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I...

1721
02:17:07,892 --> 02:17:12,229
那就乖乖地闭上嘴，谢谢
That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

1722
02:17:33,584 --> 02:17:38,336
再见，玛丽?泼平斯。别离开太久
Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.

1723
02:18:23,756 --> 02:18:26,047
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1724
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:29,427
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1725
02:18:29,677 --> 02:18:33,054
让它飞向空中的最高处

1726
02:18:33,306 --> 02:18:36,308
让我们去放风筝

1727
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:40,228
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1728
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:43,690
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1729
02:18:43,941 --> 02:18:47,193
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1730
02:18:47,444 --> 02:18:52,156
哦，让我们一起去
Oh, let's go

1731
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:57,411
