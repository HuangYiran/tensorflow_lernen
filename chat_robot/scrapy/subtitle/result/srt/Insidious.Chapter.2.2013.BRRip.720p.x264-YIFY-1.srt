00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,291
类好啊，我系伊莉丝来的，您就是罗琳吧？
Hi. I'm Elise.You must be Lorraine.

00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,624
系啊，幸会，实在是不好意思
Yes. Nice to meet you.I'm sorry it's so late.

3
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,824
为了我儿子的事，这么晚打搅您休息了
My day job kind of makes raising my son a night job.

4
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,264
没关系，不打紧的
Don't worry about it.

5
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,134
我平常工作都在夜间
In my line of work, things tend to happen when it gets dark.

7
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,739
亲爱的卡尔！
Ahoy, Carl!

8
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,644
伊姐！你能来真是太好了！
Elise, thank you for coming.

9
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,154
我实在是没辙了，只好打电话给你 
I didn't know what else to do, except call you.

10
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,951
我明白
Oh, I understand.

11
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,822
这事对你来说很棘手
You had a big problem and you thought

12
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,155
你怕我嫌麻烦是吗？
you'd make it my problem, too.Is that it'?

13
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,656
额，嗯
Uh, uh..

14
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,494
逗你玩儿！
I'm teasing.

15
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,432
我一向凑热闹不嫌事儿大的，卡尔
You know I'm always happy to help, Carl.

16
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,437
您喝点什么，咖啡还是茶？
Would you like some coffee or tea?

17
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,336
不用了，唔该
No, thank you.

18
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,999
如果没问题的话，我想马上开始做正事
I'd like to get started right away, if that's okay.

19
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,633
卡尔电话里跟我说
Carl told me on the phone

20
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,339
令郎身体有异常，是吗？
your son is the one affected, is that right?

21
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,846
是的，没错
Yes, that's right.

22
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,438
我儿子，乔什 
My son, Josh.

23
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,307
有东西跟着他
Something is following him.

24
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,879
拿给她看
Show her.

25
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,554
我给乔什做了全身常规检查
I started with all the usual checks,

26
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,993
做了心理健康测试，查阅了病历报告
mental health tests,medical records.

27
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,656
一切正常 
Everything normal.

28
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,896
直到我看到这些照片
Then I saw the photos.

29
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,203
六周之前首次发现异状
First noticed it about six weeks ago.

30
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,706
起初我们以为是相机破了
Thought it was a camera problem.

31
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,710
但后来发觉事态越发严重
Then it became apparent that it was more than that.

32
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,871
我问过乔什
I interviewed the boy.

33
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,750
他什么都不肯说，他很害怕
He won't tell me anything.He's afraid.

34
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,484
我也很怕
I'm afraid, too.

35
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,848
这屋里一定潜伏着什么，我能感觉到
There's something in this house.I can feel it.

36
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,083
这东西不想让我呆在这
It doesn't want me here.

37
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,613
我要见见乔什
May I meet him?

38
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,752
嗨，乔什，我叫伊莉丝 
Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.

39
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,550
我想问你几个简单的问题 
I would love to ask you some simple questions.

40
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,748
你喜欢住在这栋房子里吗？
Do you like living here?

41
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,918
恩，还好吧
Yeah, I guess

42
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,791
这附近有和你差不多年纪的小孩吗？
Are there a lot of kids your age in this neighborhood?

43
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,600
有几个，隔壁就有一个
A few.One kid lives next door.

44
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,293
那敢情好
That must be fun.

45
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,237
住在这屋里有没有感觉不舒服的地方？ 
Is there anything you don't like about living in this house?

46
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,808
我有时会做噩梦 
I have bad dreams sometimes.

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,213
是什么样的噩梦？
What happens in your dreams?

48
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,113
我们来做一个小试验，乔什
I'd like to try something with you, Josh.

49
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,159
阿姨保证，一点儿都不痛的
And I promise, it won't hurt.

50
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,723
全身放松
I want you to just relax.

51
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,435
听着摆针的声音
Listen to the ticking.

52
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,972
其他什么都不要想
Focus on it.

53
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,063
什么都不用管
Tune everything else out.

54
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,608
你感到好困，你好想睡觉
Feel yourself getting sleepier.

55
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,748
现在，我们进入你的梦境了，乔什 
We are now inside your dream, Josh.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,183
看看周围
Look around.

57
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,777
你看到了什么
What do you see?

58
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,353
我看到我自己
I see myself

59
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,352
在床上睡觉
sleeping in bed.

60
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,430
在你的卧室吗
Are you in your bedroom?

61
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,297
不是
No.

62
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,266
在一个黑暗的地方
I'm somewhere dark.

63
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,664
那地方一直都很黑
It's always dark here.

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,535
是你一个人吗？
Are you alone?

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,275
不
No.

66
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,640
她也在
She's here.

67
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,145
她是谁？
Who is "she"?

68
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,380
她说她是我的朋友
She says she's a friend.

69
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,713
她每天晚上都来看我
She visits me every night.

70
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,450
现在呢，她在哪里？
Where is she right at this moment?

71
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,617
她是不是就在这，我们身边？
Is she here in this house with us?

72
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,885
我想跟她聊聊
I'd like to talk to her.

73
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,405
这样吧，我们来玩个小游戏，乔什
Okay, we're gonna play a little game, Josh.

74
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,478
叫做“冷热自知”
It's called Hot and Cold.

75
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,014
我在屋里到处走
I'll walk around the house,

76
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,041
如果我靠近你的朋友，你就说“我热”；离得远，你就说“我冷” 
and you tell me if I'm getting warmer or colder.

77
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,489
我冷
Cold.

78
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,174
我热了
Warm.

79
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,869
我热
Warmer.

80
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,208
冷了
Colder.

81
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,604
我热了
Getting warm.

82
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,317
更热了
Hotter.

83
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,249
我好热
It's very hot.

84
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,004
请你，离开那里
Please get out of there.

85
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,543
你是谁？
Who are you?

86
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,309
侬想组撒？
What do you want?

87
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,028
咋了？
What happened?

88
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,199
我看到内家伙了，它绝非善类 
I saw what haunts him,and it's not a friend.

89
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,142
是一种寄生灵，我职业生涯从未碰到过此等恶灵
It's a, parasite. I've never felt such a malignant presence.

90
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,180
它想夺取乔什的肉身 
It wants to be him.

91
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,576
兰伯特太太
Miss Lambert,

92
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,243
我认为令郎拥有特殊的能力，一种天赋
I think your son has a unique ability a gift.

93
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:05,187
当他入睡时，他能够元神出窍，星光体投射
When he sleeps at night, he's able to go places, see things.

94
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,717
会看到各种肉眼看不见的灵魂
Things no living person is supposed to see.

95
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,396
而现在，那只寄生灵盯上他了
Only now, one of the dead has seen him, too.

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,365
佛祖啊
Oh.. my God.

97
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,500
那，你能阻止它吗？
Well, can you stop it?

98
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,904
我只能暂时封存
I could take away his gift

99
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,441
乔什元神出窍的能力
to suppress his memory of his ability.

100
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,874
如何封存？
How would we do that'?

101
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,047
我带你去
I'll show you.

102
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,409
请你赶快作法，让他忘掉这一切吧
Do whatever you have to make him forget.

One morning, Dalton just wouldn't wake up.

104
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,481
我们带他去看能够找到的最好的医生
We took him to the best doctors we could find,

105
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,282
但劳而无功
but none of them had any idea.

106
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,582
最后没办法，只好回到家里
Eventually,we just took him home,

107
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,719
可他仍然昏迷不醒
still in his coma.

108
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,088
之后那房子里，就开始发生各种怪事
Then things started happening around the house.

109
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,624
无法解释的怪象
Unexplained things.

110
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,294
搞得我心烦意乱，不得不搬家 
I got so freaked out, we moved.

111
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,395
但还是鬼影缠身
But they kept happening.

112
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:21,310
所以你相信，有某种超自然的灵魂力量？
And you believe that there was some sort of supernatural force at work?

113
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,277
你们什么时候雇佣那个灵媒师的？
When did you hire the services

114
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,341
也就是死者伊莉丝·蕊妮儿
of the deceased Elise Rainier?

115
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,419
我们，走投无路的时候
When we ran out of places to go.

116
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,317
根据你的口供，兰伯特太太 
It says in your statement, Mrs. Lambert,

117
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,330
昨天晚上，确切地说是昨晚10点 
that last night, at approximately 10:00 p.m.,

118
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,300
灵媒师伊莉丝对你丈夫实施所谓的“灵媒法事”
Elise put your husband into a state of hypnosis.

119
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,167
她声称你丈夫经过催眠
She did this as part of a ritual that

120
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,833
开始所谓的“星光体投射”
she believed would allow him to

121
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,175
可以令他的元神进入。。。
project his unconscious into a..

122
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,375
额。。不好意思，字写得有点潦草 
Uh..I'm sorry, I can't read my own handwriting.

123
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:04,353
进入灵界“里关世界”，在那他能够救出你们的儿子
..Into a spirit realm, where he could locate your son

124
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:08,017
并将他带回人间“表关世界”
and bring him back to consciousness.

125
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,955
我说，你真的相信这一切吗？
Now, did you really believe that would help?

126
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,861
我只能相信了，不管伊莉丝做了什么，她确实成功了
I had to. Whatever she did, it worked.

127
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,802
大盾苏醒了
Dalton woke up.

128
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,466
然后呢，你儿子醒了以后呢 
And what happened after your son woke up?

129
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,908
乔什！
Josh!

130
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,844
乔什你在哪？
Josh, where are you?

131
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,552
乔什！
Josh!

132
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,263
仁爱
Renai

133
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,237
我在这
I'm right here.

134
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,240
仁爱，怎么了
Renai!What?

135
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,874
哦不不不
Oh, no, no, no.

136
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,505
伊莉丝？伊莉丝！
Elise! Elise!

137
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,574
妈，快带大盾离开这，快叫救护车！
Mom, get Dalton out of here!Call an ambulance!

138
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,879
我晕，伊莉丝？伊莉丝？
No, no, no. Elise!

139
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,852
哦，不！
Oh, no!

140
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,287
不，不会的！
No, no!

141
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,354
干嘛？
What?

142
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,756
干嘛这么看着我？ 
Why are you looking at me like that?

143
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,732
你认为是我干的？
You think I did this?

144
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,638
你信任他吗？
Did you believe him?

145
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,570
-他是我丈夫
-回答我的问题
-He's my husband. 
-That's not what I asked.

146
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,079
是的，我信任他，我丈夫不会杀人的
Yes, I believed him. My husband isn't capable of killing anybody.

147
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,974
这是伊莉丝被杀一瞬间拍到的快照
This is a photo Elise took seconds before she was killed.

148
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,608
你能给我解释一下这张照片吗？ 
Can you tell me who that is in this picture?

149
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,988
我家里发生过很多怪事
There were a lot of strange things happening in our house.

150
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,116
我看到过各种鬼魂
I saw apparitions,lots of them.

151
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:52,219
得，你是说照片里的事是鬼干的？
Are you telling me that this is a photograph of a ghost?

152
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,499
可我对鬼没兴趣，兰太太 
Listen, I'm not interested in ghosts, Mrs. Lambert.

153
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,228
我关心的是制造这起凶杀案的活人
I'm interested in the living people who create them.

154
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,736
伊莉丝遭锁喉致死
Elise has marks on her neck

155
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,900
抠痕已证实是人类的双手所致
that were put there by human hands.

156
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:11,071
一旦鉴证科确认抠痕指纹和你丈夫的匹配，我会立刻通知你
I'll let you know if forensics matches those marks to your husband.

157
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,285
杰西卡，我们回来了
Jessica, we're home.

158
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,325
嗨孩子们！
Hey, guys.

159
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,158
-爸爸！给你看样好东西
-嘿！
-Dad! Look what I made. 
-Hey.

160
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,663
-是什么？
-易拉罐电话机 
-What?
-It's a cup phone.

161
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,494
看到没？耳朵听这头，可以听到那头讲的话
See? You put your ear in that,and I put my mouth in that.

162
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,866
好腻害，吾儿真天才也！谢谢你照顾他们
You are a genius.Absolute brilliance.Thanks for watching them.

163
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,495
-代我向令堂问好
-嗯谢谢
-Say hi to your mom from me.
-I will.

164
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,503
妈妈你放着罢，我来拿
Oh. Mom,I'll get that.

165
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,375
我上楼去铺床
I'll go up and make the beds.

166
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,021
好了
All right.

167
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,656
该睡觉了，小帅哥们
Time for bed, boys.

168
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,463
我们要在这呆多久？
How long are we gonna be here for?

169
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,697
还得在奶奶这住上一段日子
We're gonna be at Grandma's house for a little bit

170
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,829
因为警察在检查我们的房子
while the police work at our house.

171
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:14,142
拿晓得伐，这里可是爸爸的老家哦
You know, this house has been in the family for a long time.

172
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,873
你们睡的床
And you guys

173
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,806
就是爸爸小时候睡过的床 
get to stay in Daddy's old bedroom.

174
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,882
你小时候在这见过可怕的东西吗？
Did you see anything bad in here?

175
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,019
没有
No.

176
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,589
你也不会的，好吗
And neither will you, okay?

177
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,817
好吧
Okay.

178
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,325
晚安
Good night.

179
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
怎么了
What?

180
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,362
你病好了，爸爸很开心
Just glad you're awake.

181
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,503
晚安，孩子们
Good night, boys.

182
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,666
晚安
Good night.

183
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,402
嘿，盾哥
Hey, Dalton.

184
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,742
干嘛
What?

185
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,906
想不想玩这个
Look what I made.

186
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,507
一定要玩吗？
Do I have to?

187
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,752
是啊
Yeah.

188
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,546
这也太傻了
This is stupid.

189
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,219
来嘛，可好玩了，来，我问你问题
Come on, it really works. I wanna ask you something, all right?

190
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,727
好吧好吧，这绳子应该再紧些
All right, fine. The string needs to be tight.

191
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,593
-回去
-嗯
-Go farther back.
-Okay.

192
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,963
怎么样，好不好玩
So, what do you think of this?

193
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,564
我觉得傻到爆
I think it's stupid.

194
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,968
嘿
Hey

195
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,254
罗琳？
Lorraine?

196
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,443
放轻松
It's okay.

197
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,716
-阴魂不散！
-怎么了？
-It's still happening.
-What is?

198
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,885
楼下的钢琴自己在弹！
I heard the piano playing by itself downstairs

199
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,485
然后凯丽！她趴在地上哭！
and I found Kali on the floor of her room by her crib!

200
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,892
也许凯丽老早学会一个人爬进爬出了呢？
Well, maybe she climbed out of her crib.

201
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,397
她以前有没有爬出来过？
Has she ever done that before?

202
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,229
甚么？！你究竟是怎么了？！
What? What is wrong with you?

203
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,900
仁爱，我只想好好过日子，就这么简单 
Renai, I just want us to move on from this, that's all.

204
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,438
我想要回那个正常的家庭
I want us to be a normal family again.

205
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,766
正常你买了个表！那瘟神还在这！ 
There is nothing normal about this,okay?
These things are still here！

206
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,107
伊莉丝死了！打开天窗说亮话吧：她是被人杀害的！
Elise is dead! No one's talking about it!
Someone murdered her!

207
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,313
话都说到这份上了
Then let's talk about it.

208
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,904
你意思她是我杀的？
You think I did it?

209
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,149
不是！不，我不是这个意思
No. No, I don't.

210
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,481
好，很好
Good. Good.

211
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,850
因为我知道是怎么一回事
Because I know what happened.

212
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:54,288
我进入那鬼地方把我们的儿子救回来
I went into that place to get our son back

213
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,452
某个恶魔跟着我出来，杀了伊莉丝 
and something evil followed me and killed Elise.

214
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,196
你看到的
You saw it.

215
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,822
这一切你都亲眼看到的
You saw those things.

216
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,693
听我说，我们不会被打扰了，再也不会了
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna bother us, not anymore.

217
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,166
我们一家团聚了 
We have our family back.

218
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,935
儿子没事了 
We have our son.

219
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,004
这才是重点，不是吗？
Isn't that what we should be focusing on?

220
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,174
没错
Yeah.

221
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,004
尽管咱俩阅鬼无数
You think all the ghosts we've seen

222
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,141
但这并不能缓解我对伊莉丝的伤感
would somehow make me feel better that Elise is gone.

223
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,046
我是说，你我都确信
I mean, you and I have

224
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,645
灵魂可以游走在表里两界
firsthand knowledge that there's something out there beyond death.

225
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,924
可有什么用呢？
But it's not helping.

226
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,061
温故而知新，疑义相如析
Turns out the living version of someone is always better.

227
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,217
她从不忘记锁阅览室的门的
She never left the reading room unlocked.

228
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,632
你走前头
You first.

229
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,201
猜拳决定谁先走
Hunter, ninja, bear.

230
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,113
猎人！忍者！熊！（金刚注：类似石头剪刀布）
Hunter, ninja, bear.

231
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,643
臭狗熊
That's bullshit.

232
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,122
我堂堂上忍怎么会打不过熊呢？
How does a bear beat a goddamn ninja?

233
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,056
熊的鼻子比赤丸的还灵敏，懂吗？
Superior sense of smell, my friend.

234
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,067
我觉得这下面不会有什么线索
You know what'? I don't think we should be down here.

235
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,443
回去吧
Let's go back.

236
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,123
-有间暗房
-别碰
-That's a private room.
-You should stay..

237
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,750
瞧瞧，哦我的鸡巴蛋
See?Oh, my nuts!

238
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,321
白费力气
I'm not helping.

238
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:01,703
“乔什·兰伯特（1986）”

239
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,652
“你好，乔什，我叫伊莉丝”
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

240
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,145
“你好”
<i>Hey.</i>

241
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,488
“我想问你几个简单的问题”
<i>I would love to ask you some simple questions.</i>

242
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,655
“但关于这些问题，我希望你能如实地回答”
<i>But they're the good kind,the kind you can't get wrong.</i>

243
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,991
“你喜欢住在这里吗？”
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

244
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,156
“喜欢”
Yeah.

245
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,224
平淡无奇，没啥亮点
Amateur framing.Just horrible.

246
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,231
“有几个。隔壁就有一个”
<i>A few.One kid lives next door.</i>

247
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,040
“你能阻止它吗？”
Can you stop it?

248
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,203
“我只能消除乔什”
<i>I could try to take away his gift</i>

249
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,473
“元神出窍的能力”
<i>to suppress his memory of his ability.</i>

250
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,844
“如何消除？”
<i>How would we do that?</i>

251
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,144
“我带你去”
<i>I'll show you</i>

252
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,153
他在跟谁说话？
Who the hell's he talking to?

253
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,421
“我只能消除乔什”
<i>I could try to take away his gift,</i>

254
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,192
“元神出窍的能力”
<i>to suppress his memory of his ability.</i>

255
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,392
“如何消除？”
<i>How would we do that?</i>

256
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,523
“我带你去”
<i>I'll show you</i>

257
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,725
就在那
Right there.

257
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,726
离她远点
Leave her alone

258
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,075
睡吧，我走
Sleep.Then I flew away.

259
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,980
不要再离开我们了 
Please don't leave us again.

260
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,652
奶奶
Grandma?

261
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:01,653
嗯哼？
Mmm-hmm.

262
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,434
有个人站在你后面
There's someone standing behind you.

263
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,585
仁爱？
Renai?

264
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,815
-哎哟卧槽！乔什！
-妈妈！
-Oh, my God, Josh!
-Mom!

265
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,585
你看见没？我刚才看到有一个人！
Did you see her?I saw someone!

266
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,618
-不，你看错了
-是真的！我亲眼看到的！
-No. you didn't. 
-No. I did!!There was somebody..

267
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,093
妈，根本没有什么人 
Ma, there is no one here, okay?

268
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,290
因为如果真有人，仁爱和孩子们会吓坏的
Because if there was,that would scare my family

269
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,129
我不想再让仁爱担惊受怕了
and I don't need Renai hearing any of that stuff right now.

270
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,960
您明白吗？
Understand?

271
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,967
好吧，你说的对，额。。。
Yeah, you're right.Um..

272
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,741
也许是我的幻觉 
It was probably my imagination.

273
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,134
恩
Yeah.

274
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,737
好啦，早点休息吧
Sorry. You should get some sleep.

275
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,533
再玩一次？
You want some more?

276
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,140
好了，走远一点，线拉长一点
All right, go farther back so we can stretch it.

277
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,972
把线拉直
We need to make it tight.

278
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,477
爸爸？
Daddy?

279
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,175
-抓到你了！抓到你了！
-不会吧！
-I gotcha! I gotcha!
-Oh, my God!

280
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,013
我要吃了你！
I'm going to eat you.

281
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,108
妈妈
Mom?

282
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,817
宝贝，妈妈给你做早饭
Hey, honey, what do you want for breakfast?

283
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,188
想吃什么？
Anything you want.

284
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,456
爱谁谁
I don't care.

285
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,329
怎么了？
What's wrong?

286
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,167
出了什么事？告诉妈妈 
What's the matter?You can tell me.

287
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,403
我做了个噩梦
I had a bad dream.

288
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,538
这样啊
Okay.

289
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,976
好吧，那你梦见什么了？
I'm sorry.What was it about?

290
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,082
我梦见我睡在床上
I was in my bed sleeping.

291
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,543
奶奶走过来 
Grandma walked in.

292
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,492
我看见屋里还有另一个人
I could see someone else in my room.

293
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,987
不要再离开我们了
Please don't leave us again.

294
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,527
奶奶
Grandma?

295
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,194
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm.

296
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,228
有个人站在你后面 
There's someone standing behind you.

297
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,543
我很想醒过来
I tried to wake myself up.

298
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,275
但费了好大劲才起床
It took a while, but I did it.

299
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,850
我听见客厅有动静
I heard voices in the hallway.

300
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,118
你必须离开！
You got to go.

301
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,685
你走！
You have to go.

302
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,750
是爸爸
It was Daddy.

303
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,794
马上离开！
You have to leave.

304
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,024
他在跟什么人说话
And he was talking to someone.

305
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,591
走啊！
You have to go.

306
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,035
妈妈，爸爸是不是着魔了
Is there something wrong with Daddy, Mom?

307
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,370、
不
No.

308
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,871
不是的宝贝
No, honey.

309
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,918
他只是太累了
He's just been through a lot.

310
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,579
就是这样，大家都太累了
That's all.We all have.

311
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,816
好了，只是个梦罢了 
It's okay, it's just a dream.

312
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,255
我送孩子们去上学 
I'm gonna take the boys to school.

313
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,124
你再躺会吧，修身养性 
You should rest, relax a bit.

314
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,631
走吧，儿子
Come on, son.

315
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,058
去吧
Okay.

316
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,445
罗琳你还好吧？
Are you okay, Lorraine?

317
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,508
你电话里说有古怪？
You said something was wrong.

318
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,612
我不清楚伊莉丝是怎么死的 
Whatever it was that killed Elise,

319
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,090
我也不清楚究竟出了什么事，反正我觉得 
whatever it was that was haunting my family

320
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,426
我们家又闹鬼了 
is not done with us.

321
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:13,467
昨晚，我在屋里看到一个怪人
Last night I saw someone in my house.

322
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,929
我需要你们的帮助
I need your help.

323
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,100
你还记得伊莉丝第一次去你家的事吗？ 
Do you remember the first time Elise visited your house

324
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,202
为了乔什的事，那时候乔什还小
to talk to Josh when he was a boy?

325
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,144
我，这么多年来我一直
No. I did a lot to try to..

326
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,810
试图忘掉这件事，可如今。。。
Try to forget that part of my life, until recently.

327
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,354
这是那天晚上伊莉丝拍的灵媒录像带
（金刚注：桌面照片中间是导演，小彩蛋） 
All right. Well,Elise hypnotized him,

328
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,548
当时伊莉丝问了乔什几个问题
asked him a series of questions.

329
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,990
我数字修复了这盘录像带，提高了亮度
I digitized the actual footage taken from the night.

330
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,622
我剪了这张出来并放大加亮
I cropped and lightened the image.

331
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,057
怎么？！
What?!

332
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,903
罗琳，这个人是乔什吗？
Lorraine, is that Josh?

333
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,874
这怎么可能？！
How is that possible?

334
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,743
我们也搞不懂
We don't know.

335
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,547
要是伊莉丝还在就能帮我们了。。。
If only Elise were here to help us.

336
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,589
怎么了？
What?

337
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,334
喂？
Hello?

338
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,211
仁爱·兰伯特太太，我是圣代警官
Renai Lambert,this is Detective Sendai.

339
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,505
哦
Oh.

340
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,511
你好，警官
Hello, Detective.

341
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,078
上次我说过鉴证科验尸报告一出就打给你
I told you I would inform you once I got the forensics results

342
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,383
现在有了一些结果
Well, I got some.

343
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,254
初步判定伊莉丝·蕊妮儿脖子上的抠痕指纹
It seems the bruises on Elise Rainier's neck

344
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,760
与你丈夫的指纹不吻合
do not match your husband's hands

345
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,091
我们警方尚未排除疑点
We're not ruling anything out at this point,

346
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,961
我打过来是想通知你一声
but I just thought you should know.

347
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,425
谢谢你，警官，额。。。
Thank you. Detective.Uh..

348
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,097
我一直都盼着这个结果，太感谢了
I really needed to hear that.Thank you.

349
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:58,099
划啊划，划大船，荡起我们的双桨
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

350
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,795
轻轻进入你梦乡
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

351
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:24,185
好开森，好快乐，好高兴，好欢畅
<i>Merrily,merrily, merrily, merrily</i>

352
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,788
生活就是梦一场
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

353
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,824
凯丽？
Kali?

354
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,499
凯丽！
Kali?

355
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,699
凯丽！你在哪！
Kali, what's wrong?

356
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,844
凯丽！凯丽！
Kali! Kali!

357
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,713
多可爱的乖囡啊
What a beautiful little girl.

358
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,148
你好大胆！
Don't you dare!

359
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,718
佛祖啊！
Jesus!

360
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,060
上帝啊！真主啊！
Oh, my God.Oh, my God!

361
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,335
凯丽！
Kali!

362
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,360
凯丽！
Kali!

363
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,403
凯丽！
Kali!

364
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,947
凯丽！宝贝
Kali? Baby?

365
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,244
我的宝贝。。。凯丽。。。
My baby, Kali. Kali.

366
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,909
你好大的牛胆！！！
Don't you dare!

367
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,367
他来了
He's here.

368
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,940
卡尔？我叫斯佩克斯，我是打你电话那人 
Carl, I'm Specs. I'm the guy you spoke to on the phone.

369
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,637
-哦你好啊
-进来吧
-Oh, hello! 
-Come in.

370
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,777
-嗨卡尔
-哦
-Hi, Carl.
-Oh.

371
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,874
好久不见
It's been a long time.

372
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,248
久违了
Yeah.

373
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,951
看起来咱俩只有我一个人变老
Looks like I did the aging for the both of us.

374
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,251
快别这么说
Oh, please stop it.

375
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,793
斯佩克斯你已经认识了，这位是塔克
You met Specs.This is Tucker.

376
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,091
伊莉丝老提您的大名 
Elise talked about you a lot.

377
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,980
久仰久仰，她说您是天下
Oh, Yeah, said you were the second best person

378
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:11,990
第二大灵媒师
She ever worked with.

379
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,331
天下第二？我受精若宠啊
Second best, that's generous.

380
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,270
我一直想联系她
I had been meaning to catch up with her, to call her.

381
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,937
可总因为有事耽搁
But I always kept putting it off till the next week, you know?

382
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,242
而现在，她却不在了
And now she's gone.

383
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,307
也许今天能给你一个和她道别的机会
Well, maybe this is your chance to say your good-byes.

384
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,979
斯佩克斯在电话里跟我说你们请我来是要。。。？
Specs told me on the phone,but I'm not sure we should..

385
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,919
我们有很多疑问想知道答案 
We have questions that need answering,

386
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,323
唯一能解答这些问题的人是伊莉丝
and the only person we could think of to ask is Elise.

387
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,122
请你帮助我们，卡尔
Please help us, Carl.

388
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,493
帮我们与她取得联系
Help us contact her.

389
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,667
不同的灵媒师与里关世界联络有各自不同的方法 
Everybody has their own way of making contact.

390
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,171
我的叫做“投子问天”
This is mine.

391
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,799
先问问题，再掷骰子，灵魂会通过骰子回答
I ask questions and the spirits answer with the dice.

392
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,873
掷出的骰子中将会出现构成答案的字母组合 
You look for the words in the letters.

393
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,951
伊莉丝，我们呼唤你
Elise, we are calling out to you.

394
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,547
告诉我们你在不在这 
Tell us if you are there.

395
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,835
伊莉丝，请回答 
Elise, please talk to us.

396
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,898
提示我们你听见呼唤了 
Give us a sign that you can hear my voice.

397
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,673
好吧，我得解释一下
All right, I suppose I should've explained

398
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,019
这种方法是看几率的
that this isn't an exact science.

399
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,712
有时候确实无法连接里关世界 
Sometimes contact can't be made.

400
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:41,984
伊莉丝
Elise.

401
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,519
请你告诉我，你在这里吗？
Please tell me, are you here?

402
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,896
你在不在这？
Are you here?

403
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,674
-我去开灯
-别动！
-I'll go get..
-No!

404
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,178
不要破坏结界
Do not break the circle.

267
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:18,974
“我，在，这”

405
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,058
伊莉丝
Elise.

406
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,762
我们想知道是谁杀了你
We need to know who killed you.

407
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,862
告诉我们
Tell us.

408
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,706
“是，她”

409
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,450
她要干嘛？
What does she want?

410
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,619
有了
I see it.

411
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,487
哪里
Where?

412
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,335
“她，要，杀，人” 

413
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,933
她在哪？
Where is she?

414
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,077
潜伏
Hiding

415
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,914
她潜伏在哪？
Where is she hiding?

416
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,774
伊莉丝，告诉我们在哪能找到凶手？
Elise, tell us where lo find your killer.

417
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,674
我们的安格力斯小姐？
"Our Lady Angls"?

418
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,854
安格力斯小姐是哪路神仙？
Our Lady Angls,what does that mean?

419
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,945
是“天使”
It's "Angels."

420
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,790
圣母天使
Our Lady of the Angels.

421
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:57,558
是一家医院的名字 
It's a hospital.

422
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,786
我曾经在那上班 
I know because I used to work there.

423
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,471
仁爱？
Renai?

424
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,590
仁爱
Renai.

425
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,173
我大部分工作时间在这医院东区
Most of my work was in this East Wing.

426
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,080
现在这地方完全废弃了
But it's all closed now.

427
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,846
只剩下孤魂野鬼了
Now only the ghosts are left.

428
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,245
如今这世道，人比鬼更可怕
Personally, I prefer the ghosts to people.

429
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,618
问题是，我们到底要找什么？
The question is,what are we looking for?

430
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,722
伊莉丝指示我们来这一定有原因的 
Elise led us here for a reason.

431
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,560
别再想地点了
Just forget the actual building.

432
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,729
想想和你共事过的医生，护士
Think of the doctors,the nurses you worked with,

433
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,602
还有病人，所有人 
the patients, everyone.

434
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:39,824
妈妈！妈妈！
Mama! Mama!

435
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,569
怎么了？
What is it?

436
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,246
在那里面
In there.

437
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,148
这间房是用来干嘛的？
What was in this room?

438
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,451
这是重症加护病房（金刚注：ICU）
This was an ICU.

439
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,951
我记得很清楚
I remember it very well.

440
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,693
晚上我们做披萨吧？
Should we do pizza night tonight?

441
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:50,959
奶酪通心粉怎么样？
How about mac and cheese?

442
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,023
-嗨帕姆
-嗨罗琳
-Hi, Pam.
-Hi, Lorraine.

443
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,534
奶酪通心粉
Mac and cheese.

444
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,501
好，就这么说定了
Okay, that can be done.

445
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,367
保持安静，不要乱碰
Keep quiet.Don't touch anything.

446
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,141
他怎么样
How is he?

447
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,680
生命体征稳定
His vital signs are stabilizing

448
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,214
但反应还是很迟钝
but he's still unresponsive.

449
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,876
血压好多了
His blood pressure's doing better.

450
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:11,510
是啊，加了剂量之后
Yes, after we upped the dosage.

451
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,578
- 好的，那就维持计划
- 好
- Okay, let's keep him on that.
- Okay.

452
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,249
上一次检查血糖是什么时候？
And when was the last time you checked the glucose?

453
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,830
没事了，没事的
It's okay.It's okay.

454
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:36,709
几天后，我又遇到他
A few days later, I saw him again.

455
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,939
那是最后一次见到他
For the last time.

456
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,624
帕克？你怎么。。。
Parker, what are you..

457
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:02,637
你应该休息啊，你不该下床的 
You should be resting.You shouldn't be out of bed.

458
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,615
那天我儿子的事我向你道歉
Listen, I wanna apologize for my son the other day.

459
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,878
小孩子调皮不懂事
He was being a nosy kid.

460
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:39,568
嘿，希拉里，为什么让104房的病人
Hey, Hillary, why is the patient from Room 104

461
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,904
随意走动？
up and walking around?

462
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,409
你说什么？ 
What do you mean?

463
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,970
ICU病房的病人帕克·柯蓝 
The patient from ICU,Parker Crane?

464
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,641
“随意走动”是什么意思？
What do you mean,walking around?

465
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,980
刚才在电梯里我碰见他了 
I just rode down in the elevator with him.

466
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,645
他为什么要放弃治疗啊？
He should be in bed,on the monitor..

467
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:56,452
罗琳，那位病人昨天早上去世了
Lorraine, that patient died yesterday morning.

468
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,857
什么？！
What?!

469
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,427
他跳楼自杀了
He jumped to his death.

470
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,597
他得什么病住院的？
So, why was he here in the first place?

471
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:18,470
他试图割自己的鸡巴
He tried to castrate himself.

472
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,700
不，妈的
Oh, no.

473
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:48,208
别
No.

474
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,210
不，还不到时候
No, not yet.

475
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,406
求你不要
Please, no.

476
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:58,545
你的死灵正在侵蚀他的肉身
Your dead soul is killing his living skin.

477
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,747
我想活下去
I wanna live.

478
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,882
我想好好过日子！
I wanna live!

479
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,894
除非杀了她们！
Only if you kill them.

480
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,396
不，求你了，不要
No. Please, no.

481
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,330
我做不到，妈妈
I can't, Mother.

482
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,562
求你别再逼我了
Please don't make me do it.

483
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,603
你必须做！
You must!

484
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,937
否则你会日益衰弱！
Or you'll waste away.

485
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,790
找到了！
Yes, we can.

486
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,382
-真的？
-罗琳！
-No way.
-Lorraine!

487
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,897
就是这个人吗？
Is that our man?

488
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,522
帕克·柯蓝，是他！
Parker Crane, that's him.

489
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,302
这个地址，那里一定有事发生
This address,there's something there.

490
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,374
仁爱！没事了！仁爱！
It's okay, it's okay.Renai.

491
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,613
好了，好了，没事了，我在这 
It's okay. It's okay.You're okay. You're okay.

492
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,050
-天哪
-不要慌
-Oh, God.
-You're okay.

493
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,048
凯丽在哪？
Where's Kali?

494
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,749
她没事，她在楼上睡觉 
She's fine.She's in her room sleeping.

495
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,416
-她没事
-不，她不见了！不见了！
-She's fine. 
-No, she's not!No, she's not!

496
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,621
-她在睡觉！仁爱！
-不！不！
-She's asleep! Renai! 
-No! No!

497
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,129
凯丽！
Kali.

498
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,302
你看！我说了她没事的 
See! I told you，she's fine.

499
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,677
-我擦！
-出什么事了？告诉我 
-Oh, God!
-What happened? Tell me.

500
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:30,905
有人把我打晕了
Someone attacked me!

501
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,136
是谁？
Who?

502
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:35,149
在卧室，是一个女人，她打我！这屋又闹鬼了！乔什！
In the living room, a woman. She hit me.These things are back, Josh!

503
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,809
我们快走，赶紧带孩子离开这！
We have to go!We gotta get the kids

504
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,477
这房子根本不是人呆的地方！
and we gotta get out of the house!

505
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,850
不，跟这房子没关系，你懂的
No, it's not the house.You know that.

506
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,014
我上次说过了
We've been through this before.

507
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,489
是里关那只鬼，他们会跟过来的，你稍安勿躁
They will follow us You have to just not be afraid.

508
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:44,821
你得冷静下来
You have to relax.

509
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,156
冷静？你叫我怎么冷静！！
Relax? I can't relax!

510
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,423
到处都闹鬼！
There's ghosts everywhere!

511
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,829
我感觉我们都已经死了，就像在地狱！
It's like we're already dead!

512
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,422
不，不是的！
No, it's not!

513
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:53,831
没人死
No, it's not.

514
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,268
谁都没死
This is nothing like being dead.

515
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,836
我清楚，我见过鬼魂
I know.I have seen it.

516
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,773
我在那个世界见过它们
I have seen where these things exist.

517
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,837
它们想要的是
They want what you have.

518
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,345
寄生
Life.

519
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,382
但是它们斗不过你
But they have no power over you.

520
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:11,044
阻止它们的办法就是：无视一切，随他们自生自灭
All you have to do is ignore them, and they will go away.

521
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,836
我就说它会自己弹
See, I told you.

522
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,106
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

523
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,690
它刚才弹的是这首曲子
That's the song that's been playing.

524
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,589
什么曲子？你在说什么？ 
What song?What are you talking about?

525
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,931
你不知道这曲子吗？
You don't know that song?

526
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,259
是的，我不知道
No, I don't.

527
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,529
这曲子是我写的，是我为你写的 
That's my song,the song I wrote for you?

528
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,874
我们该关心的不是钢琴曲
Well, it's not the song that we should be worried about.

529
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,147
是那些不速之客
There's somebody in this house.

530
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,290
呆那别动 
Stay here.

531
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:12,503
瞧瞧，人都死了窗户还开着
Hey, look,they left the window open.

532
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,680
小心脚下
Watch your step.

533
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:36,659
有情况吗？
Do you feel something?

534
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:37,755
恩。。
Um..

535
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,370
我只能说这地方
Let's just say that this house is not a place

536
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,769
低端粗俗甩节操
where many good things have happened.

537
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:51,474
说不定有什么隐藏宝物呢 
Probably a lot of good collectibles in here.

538
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:07,994
这什么味道？
What is that smell?

539
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,021
斯佩克斯
Hey, Specs.

540
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,121
在
Yeah.

541
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:12,990
上楼
Upstairs.

542
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,858
我猜这应该是他的卧室吧 
I'm guessing this might be Parker Crane's bedroom.

543
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,364
看上去怎么更像女孩子的闺房
No, it seems a little girly for a boy's bedroom'

544
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,425
不觉得吗？
don't you think?

545
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:22,868
啥？
Why?

546
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,273
我意思是，这貌似是个娃娃屋
I mean, look at this dollhouse.

547
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,965
什么？
What?

548
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,407
我也有套娃娃屋
I had a dollhouse.

549
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,575
这是罗德岛红鸡
This is a Rhode Island Red.

550
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,712
好了，我们离开这
Come on, let's get outta here.

551
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,725
这是我的房间！
This is my room!

552
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,969
塔克
Tucker!

553
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,877
听，塔克，塔克
Listen,Tucker. Tucker.

554
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:47,119
你们不能在这
You can't be in here.

555
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:55,119
让她看见的话，她会让我杀了你们
If she sees you,she'll make me kill you.

556
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,886
大盾
Dalton.

557
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:25,991
大盾
Dalton.

558
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,592
什么事？
What?

559
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:40,331
我要给你看一出好戏~~
I have something to show you.

560
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,241
不要闹了，福斯特
Stop, Foster.

561
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,405
赶紧睡觉，别找麻烦
Just go back to bed. You're gonna get us in trouble.

562
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,507
我，不是，福斯特~~ 
I'm not Foster.

563
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,214
福斯特，醒醒！ 
Foster, wake up.

564
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,754
福斯特！醒醒！
Foster, please wake up!

565
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:57,977
你是谁？
Who are you?

566
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,317
被他杀掉的人其中一个
The ones he killed.

567
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,826
我们都被他杀了
We are many.

568
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,158
你要干嘛？
What do you want?

569
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,203
请救救我
Please help me!

570
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,844
我再也受不了！
Make the pain stop!

571
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,502
没事没事，妈妈在这，别怕别怕
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

572
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,733
好了好了，别怕宝贝
It's okay!It's okay! It's okay!

573
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:57,209
天呐！哦，天呐！
Oh, Jesus.Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

574
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:01,542
没事了，没事了
It's okay.It's okay. It's okay.

575
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,551
是梦，只是个梦
It was just a dream.It's just a dream.

576
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,985
只是个梦
It's just a dream.

577
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,490
你想联系她？没用的
You're trying to reach her, but you won't.

578
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,028
别再挣扎了
Not from over there.

579
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,027
好好当你的鬼吧
Shadows are your home now.

580
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,582
救命！
Help!

581
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,704
伊莉丝
Elise.

582
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,932
为什么引领我们到这来？
Why did you bring us here?

583
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,950
我们需要找到什么？
What are we looking for?

584
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:31,406
"MORS"?

585
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,770
拉丁文里面是指死亡？
Latin for "Death"?

586
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,184
卡尔
Carl.

587
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,617
这个女人就是出现在我家的怪人
This is the woman who was in my house.

588
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,691
罗琳！当心！
Lorraine, lookout!

589
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,601
出什么事了？
What happened?

590
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,002
-怎么会这样？
-把手电筒举高
-What happened?
-Give me a light over here.

591
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,445
对准这里！
Over here!

592
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,313
你根本不是伊莉丝！对不对！
You're not Elise, are you?

592
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:21,683
“对”

593
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,200
你是谁！
Who are you?

593
01:01:37,184 --> 01:01:39,278
“MATER MORTIS”

594
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,235
死人的母亲？
Mother of Death.

595
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,541
啥玩意儿？
What does that mean?

596
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:47,014
这是字面意思
It's literal.

597
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,051
其实是说一直给我们信息的
It simply means the mother

598
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,847
是帕克·柯蓝的母亲
of Parker Crane.

599
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:30,923
好，使劲
Okay, move that.

600
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:36,892
一，二，三
One, two, and three.

601
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:44,872
推过去
Pull it this way.

602
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,272
别碰任何东西
Don't touch anything.

603
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,963
伙计们
Guys.

604
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,372
“黑寡妇”
"Bride in Black."

605
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,164
我见过这个名字。。。
I know that name.

606
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,408
在哪？发现什么了？
Where? What you got?

607
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,540
“其中一个受害者侥幸逃出变态的魔窟”
"One of the victims managed to elude the killer.

608
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:39,211
“受害者向警方描述变态的样貌”
"Police said she described her attacker

609
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:44,884
“像是一个老女人穿着黑色的婚纱和面罩”
"as an old woman dressed in a black wedding gown and veil."

610
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,921
黑寡妇杀了15个人
Bride in Black claims his 15th victim.

611
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:52,689
15个。。。
Victims.

612
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,104
娘西撇
Oh my god

613
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,872
等等
Wait a sec.

614
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:07,540
额
Uh..

615
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,545
帕克就是黑寡妇！
Parker wore that dress

616
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,375
他绑架残杀受害者
to commit these murders.

617
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,816
他是个异装癖
It was his disguise.

618
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,650
是他母亲逼他杀人
He killed for his mother because she forced him to.

619
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:50,314
他想感受一个崭新的童年
He wanted his childhood back.

620
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,715
所以他看中了你儿子
That's why he went after your son.

621
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,780
-仁爱
-天呐，妈？！
-Renai!
-Jesus! Lorraine!

622
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:19,946
你上哪去了？
Where have you been?

623
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,317
听我说
I need to speak to you.

624
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:22,481
乔什，他在哪？
Where is he, Josh?

625
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,525
他身体感觉不太好，一整天都躺床上
He's not feeling well.He's been in bed all day.

626
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:25,894
大盾和福斯特呢？
And where are Dalton and Foster?

627
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,121
我刚从杰西卡那接他们回来
I just dropped them off at Jessica's.

628
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,662
-你怎么了？
-你和孩子们很危险
-Why? 
-You and the kids are in danger.

629
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:29,832
我会解释的，先上车
I'll explain, but not here.

630
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,091
快，快上车我们走
Please, let's just get in the car and go.

631
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:32,764
你是不是也看到了？
Have you been seeing them, too?

632
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,361
房子里的鬼魂？
Around the house?

633
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:41,005
跟房子无关，是乔什
It's not the house, it's Josh.

634
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,729
-她们走了
-开始行动
-They're gone.
-It's go time.

635
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:10,337
安上这个，我们就能听到了
Okay.We'll hear everything.

636
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,373
需要我们的时候就大叫
Sing out if you need us.

637
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,999
暗号是“墨西哥饼”
The code word is "Quesadilla."

638
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,732
-跟我念一遍，墨西哥饼
-墨西哥饼
-Say it with me. Quesadilla.
-Quesadilla.

639
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,040
等一下，暗号不是说好用“独角神兽”的吗？ 
I thought we agreed on "Unicorn" as the code word.

640
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,376
额，相对来说“墨西哥饼”更顺口
Uh.. "Quesadilla" is easier to bring up in conversation.

641
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,848
一点不顺口，你平常跟人讲话
Not at all.How would you bring up

642
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:24,106
会提到墨西哥饼吗？
"quesadilla" in a conversation?

643
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,540
-午饭时间了，吃墨西哥饼吧
-我说你们二位，二位同志
-It's lunch time. It's quesadilla time 
-Guys, guys

644
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:28,487
-我想吃墨西哥饼，可以给我来一块吗？
-二位哥哥，二位老大
-I'd love a quesadilla.Can I have a quesadilla?
--Guys, guys

645
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,717
二位神仙，说真的
Really

646
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,587
用哪个暗号并不重要 
I don't think it matters.

647
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,694
我需要帮助时你们会知道的，不用什么暗号
You'll know if I need you.It doesn't matter.

648
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,825
这是麻醉剂
Tranquilizer.

649
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:43,779
乔什：我带仁爱去逛街了，回头见   
妈

649
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,111
有事吗？
Can I help you?

650
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,277
我叫卡尔
My name's Carl.

651
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,245
额。。我知道你一定不认识我了，乔什
Uh, I know you don't remember me, Josh.

652
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:05,383
伊莉丝和我竭尽全力帮你忘记那件事
Elise and I did our best to make sure of that.

653
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,359
你说的没错，我确实不认识你 
You're right,I don't remember you.

654
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,631
你小时候遇到一些麻烦，你妈曾委托我来处理 
Your mother called me when you started experiencing some problems

655
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:16,397
我那时候有点害怕，事情没办好，于是我请来伊莉丝
and what I saw scared me so badly that I, uh, reached out to Elise.

656
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,035
如今伊莉丝去世了
Now Elise is gone.

657
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,932
我。。我想请你帮我来收个尾 
I was wondering if you could help give me some closure.

658
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,141
帮帮忙
I need it.

659
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:29,708
当然可以
Sure.

660
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:33,744
谢谢
Okay.

661
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:39,583
呼~~~~
Phew!

662
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:41,390、
真是有够刺激的！ 
This is pretty exciting.

663
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,431
咱可以当FBI了
I feel like an FBI agent.

664
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:58,110
妈，快告诉我到底怎么回事，你都知道些什么？
Tell me what you're thinking.Lorraine, what do you know?

665
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,944
我们一致认为：真正的乔什，还困在里关世界
I think that when Josh went into that other world,

666
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:04,577
某个恶灵附在他肉身上溜出来了 
something else came back.

667
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,684
我们已查清楚，这个恶灵
We believe it's a spirit that's killed

668
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,088
生前杀了很多人，现在他还会继续作恶 
many times before,and it'll kill again.

669
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,128
所以我才叫你赶快带孩子们跑路 
That's why I had to get you and the kids away from him.

670
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:17,164
昨天晚上，我像过去12年每天那样
Last night, when I looked into his eyes,

671
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,291
注视着他的眼睛
like I have every day for the last 12 years,

672
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,098
我第一次感到他那么的陌生
was the first time I didn't recognize him.

673
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,805
我细思恐极
I was scared of him.

674
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:27,136
现在有个灵媒师正在家中
Right now, at the house,

675
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:31,167
他是我和伊莉丝当年的朋友，他正在和乔什谈话 
there is an acquaintance of Elise's and mine, and he's talking to Josh.

676
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:33,941
我们计划驱逐恶灵
We're going to try to sedate him and when he's under,

677
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,984、
并救回真正的乔什
we're going to try to reach out to the real Josh.

678
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,986
可是万一失败了呢？
And what if we can't find him?

679
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,160
你身体还好吧？
Are you feeling okay?

680
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,794
我很好
I'm fine.

681
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,332
就醒来时感觉有点不舒服
Just woke up feeling a little under the weather.

682
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,998
我想问你的是
I suppose I wanted to ask you

683
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:58,039
关于伊莉丝的死，你有什么想法吗？ 
if you've any idea what happened to Elise.

684
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,868
不，我没想法 
No, I don't.

685
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,302
额。。。我
Look, I..

686
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,348
我得提醒你的是，额。。。
I should remind you that, um..

687
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,644
我不是来拉家常的
I'm not the person who's gonna look at you funny

688
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,550
我想听点不寻常的事
if you tell me something unusual.

689
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,643
恩恩
Mmm-hmm.

690
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,349
我亲眼目睹过很多人
I've seen things with my own eyes

691
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:20,184
睡着后能看见自己躺在床上
that most people have to go to sleep to conjure up.

692
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,987
伊莉丝将我送进那个到现在仍令我做噩梦的鬼地方 
Elise sent me to a place that still haunts my dreams.

693
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,869
可我救回了我的儿子
But I got my son back.

694
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:35,605
我不清楚，我离开那房间大概10分钟
I don't know, I left the room for about 10 minutes

695
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,611
等我回来时，伊莉丝已经死了
and when I came back Elise was dead.

696
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:41,705
是被人掐死的
She had been strangled.

697
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,248
这可真令人毛骨悚然
That's pretty horrific.

698
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:51,848
我想起来。
I guess.

699
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,249
噢！
Oh!

700
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,351
额。。。
Um..

701
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,064
你小的时候
When you were a boy,

702
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:02,103
说有个老妇经常骚扰你
you said it was an old woman who haunted you.

703
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:05,098
那么在你进入里关世界后
Did you see that same old woman?

704
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,696
有没有碰见那个老妇？
When you were in that other world?

705
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,238
没有
No.

706
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,576
好吧
Okay. Um..

707
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,579
对了，想喝点什么？
Say, would you like a drink?

708
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,892
额。。。额。。。水，一杯水就行了，谢谢
Water. A glass of water would be nice.

709
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:28,718
好了
Sure.

710
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,580
你在那找什么呢？ 
What you got there?

711
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,519
啊？哦！额。。
Huh? Oh. Uh..

712
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,751
没什么
Nothing.

713
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,261
你是不是在玩你的骰子
I thought maybe you were playing with your dice.

714
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,194
什么？
Excuse me?

715
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,094
我妈说你喜欢掷骰子
Mother tells me you like to play with dice.

716
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:12,865
是吗？你们早上还聊到我了？
Did She? I didn't realize you guys had spoken this morning.

717
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,538
这我用来算卦的
It's how I do my readings.

718
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:17,700
啊
Ah.

719
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,066
你背后藏着什么？
What have you got behind your back?

720
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:31,791
你骰子投出什么，我背后就藏着什么
Why don't you ask your dice what I have behind my back?

721
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:37,458
来吧，投子问天
Come on, roll them and see.

722
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,733
我妈说你这招那是相当的灵验
Mother tells me you were very good with them at the house.

723
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,703
投吧，很有意思
Come on, it'll be fun.

724
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,474
好吧
What..

725
01:12:58,541 --> 01:12:59,918
乔什背后。。
What does Josh..

726
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:09,162
应该是帕克·柯蓝背后藏着什么？  
What is Parker Crane holding behind his back?

727
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:17,622
“刀”

727
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,500
她永远都是对的！
She was always right.

728
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:24,370
你妹！
Shit!

729
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,507
啊！
Ah!

730
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,178
快啊！
Come on!

731
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,066
墨西哥饼！
Quesadilla.

732
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,067
- 卡尔！
- 在这！
- Carl!
- In here!

733
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,768
抓住了！
I got you!

734
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,094
我认得你，是吗？
I know you, don’t I?

735
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,367
既然能见到你，我想我不用再问这是哪了 
Well, if you're here, I guess I don't have to ask where I am.

736
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,937
他杀了你
He killed you.

737
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,810
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

738
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,644
我若再不回去，我的家人一定会被这畜生杀害的 
That thing is gonna murder my family if I don't get back.

739
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,048
可我被困在这，而且感觉离开肉身后 
I am trapped here.I'm getting weaker

740
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,450
灵魂日渐虚弱
the longer I'm away from my body.

741
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,283
伊莉丝呢？
Elise.

742
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,690
伊莉丝？她不在这
Elise, she's not here.

743
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,666
那我们就得找到她
Well, then we'll have to find her.

744
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,302
继续深入搜索
Into the Further we go.

745
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:48,348
你一定要杀了她们
You need to kill the others.

746
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:51,858
这是你唯一的生存机会
It's the only way to stay alive.

747
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:54,684
闭嘴！闭嘴！滚出我的脑子！
Shut up! Shut up!Get out of my head!

748
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,388
闭嘴！你滚！给我滚！
Shut up!Get outta here!

749
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,089
滚得远远的！
Get out of my head!

750
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:13,903
我刚收到塔克的微信，他说一切准备就绪 
Okay, I've just got a message from Tucker He says they're ready.

751
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,385
伊莉丝？
Elise?

752
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,617
伊莉丝！
Elise!

753
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,265
别喊了
Don't do that.

754
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:45,409
怎么了
What is it?

755
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,539
你前方站着个人 
There's someone standing in front of you.

756
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,642
我没看见有人啊
I don't see anybody.

757
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,880
他就在你面前 
He's right in front of you!

758
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:57,713
他在。。
He's..

759
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,157
他在跟你讲话
He's talking to you.

760
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,458
伊刚撒？
What's he saying?

761
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,791
他要你的孩子
"He's got your baby. "

762
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,390
他要你的孩子，他要你的孩子，他要你的孩子
"He's got your baby. He's got your baby.He's got your baby. "

763
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,059
他要你的孩子，他要你的孩子
He's got your baby.He's got your baby.

764
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:14,740
现在呢？他在做什么？
What's he doing now?

765
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,099
他好像。。。
He..

766
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:18,338
在给我们指路
He's pointing at something.

767
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,841
那边
Over there.

768
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,623
凯丽房间里有怪声，从婴儿监控器传来的
I heard this noise coming from Kali's room.It was on the baby monitor.

769
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,758
可能是电波串线收到别的信号
Probably just inteference.

770
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:41,824
不知道
I don't know.

771
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:46,202
可听起来很清楚，像是谁在窃窃私语 
It sounded so clear. It was like this whispering. It was..

772
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,933
吓死我了
Scared the hell out of me.

773
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,970
然后我去挺监控器，加大音量
Then I went to hear the monitor and turned up the volume

774
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,342
听到一个男人的声音
and heard a man's voice.

777
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:11,689
不！不！不！
No! No! No.

778
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,326
不！嘿！
No! Hey!

779
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:19,899
什么声音？
Who the hell is that'?

780
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:24,970
等等
Hold on.

781
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,509
你留在这
Stay here.

782
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,373
仁爱！！
Renai!

783
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,335
有人吗？
Hello?

784
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,045
乔什！不要！
No, Josh, no!

785
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,234
乔什！乔什！快啊！这有人！ 有人在窗帘里！
Josh! Josh! Quick! There's someone in here!Someone in the curtains!

786
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,266
乔什！乔什！
Josh! Josh!

787
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:31,367
仁爱！
Renai!

788
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,481
仁爱！
<i>Renai!</i>

789
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:45,283
别动她！
<i>Get away from her!</i>

790
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:47,383
离她远点！
<i>Get away from her!</i>

791
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,493
统统退散！
Go to hell!

792
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:16,516
乔什
Josh.

793
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:24,361
我想我应该说：见到你真高兴 
I wish I could say it's good to see you.

794
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,260
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

795
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:31,764
你不该在这
You shouldn't be here.

796
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,974
我们最终还是在这栋房子相遇了
We all pass through this place eventually.

797
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,800
希望早日离开这里，去个好点的地方
Hopefully, on our way to someplace better.

798
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,375
我已经去过美妙的地方了
I've seen that better place

799
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:43,374
可是我又回到这里，因为我听到了你的召唤 
but I came back here because I heard you calling

800
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,115
我想我能够帮你
and I think I can help.

801
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:50,188
卡尔，你怎么来了？
Carl, what are you doing here?

802
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,816
你不应该在这啊！
You are not supposed to be here

803
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,622
我感受到你了，伊莉丝
I felt you, Elise.

804
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,053
哦。。
Oh..

805
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,993
不，不是，你不是找我 
No, you didn't.No, you didn't

806
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:03,460
你是想找乔什才找到这里的 
You were looking for Josh and you found him.

807
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,338
乔什，你不属于这里 
Josh, you don't belong here,

808
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,842
你属于表关世界！ 
and neither does that entity belong in your world

809
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,206
我不知道怎么跟她斗
I don’t know how to fight her.

810
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,041
在黑暗的那一边
Out there in the darkness,

811
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:17,550
有个房间，密存着她一生的记忆
she has a home where all her memories live from her life.

812
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,347
利用那些记忆把她驱赶出你的肉身
Use those memories to draw her out of your vessel

813
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:22,389
这样你才能回到表关世界
so that you can get back into your body

814
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,514
可我怎么才能找到那地方呢
But where do I find her home?

815
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,588
只有你知道地点
Only you know where that is.

816
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:30,061
我不记得了
I don't remember.

817
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:34,365
那我们就去问问那个中招的乔什
Maybe we're asking the wrong Josh.

818
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:41,834
怎么了
What happened?

819
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,524
我看到内家伙了，它绝非善类 
I saw what haunts him,and ifs not a friend.

820
01:21:43,537 --> 01:21:45,174
是一种寄生灵
It's a parasite.

821
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:48,038
我职业生涯从未碰到过此等恶灵
I've never felt such a malignant presence.

822
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,083
它想附体在乔什身上
It wants to be him.

823
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:55,121
兰伯特太太，我认为令郎拥有特殊的能力，一种天赋
Miss Lambert, I think your son has a unique ability, a gift.

824
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,425
乔什
Josh.

825
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,626
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

826
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:10,960
关于那个老妇的记忆我全忘了 
I don 'I have any memories of the old woman anymore,

827
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,902
但是你还记得 
but you do.

828
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,901
我想知道她住在哪 
I need to know where she lives.

829
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:26,881
我带你去
I’ll show you

830
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,786
原来是这么回事
So that's what that was about.

831
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,121
卡尔
Carl?

832
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,224
乔什
Josh?

833
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,196
乔什
Josh?

834
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:56,899
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, honey.

835
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,211
我在等孩子们，还没回家 
I'm waiting for the boys.They're not home yet.

836
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,814
今天我朋友卡尔没来过吗？
Did my friend Carl stop by today?

837
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,851
没来
No, I don't think so.

838
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:25,938
你们这是自寻箱子！
You did this to yourselves!

839
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,749
呵呵，好久没这么疼过了 
It's been so long since I felt real pain.

840
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,513
仁爱，快来帮我
Renai, help me!

841
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,525
我忘了疼痛，但这不代表我忘记怎么让别人疼痛
I missed it, but not as much as I miss inflicting it on others.

842
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:08,478
仁爱，快离开这，快跑！
Renai, get out of here! Run!

843
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,383
一会再来收拾你，妈咪！
I'll come back for you, Mommy!

844
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,275
- 到了，孩子们
- 耶！
- Okay, guys, we're here.
- Yay!

845
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,331
谢谢你，杰西卡
Thanks, Jessica.

846
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:37,959
-谢谢
-不用谢，明天见
-Thank you.
-No problem.See you tomorrow.

847
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,308
走吧，福斯特
Let's go, Foster.

848
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,671
我不想这样的，仁爱 
I didn't want this, Renai.

849
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:47,114
她叫我杀了你们，我拒绝了
She wanted me to kill you, but I said no.

850
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:51,086
不过现在，我知道她说的是对的
But now, I know she was right.

851
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,594
你是个卑鄙无耻，忘恩负义的绿茶婊！ 
You are a miserable,ungrateful bitch.

852
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,971
你这一天到晚胡思乱想的，简直是浪费生命！
You have no idea how much you've wasted

853
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:09,509
你不是怕周围都是鬼魂么？
your life being afraid of the dead,

854
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:12,545
现在好了，马上你自己也成鬼魂了 
because pretty soon, you're going to be one of them.

855
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,975
然后，我把你带到我的小黑屋
Then, when I take you to my home in the dark,

856
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:20,147
你就会醒悟到你这绿茶婊短暂的一生
you'll realize how happy you should've been

857
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,121
最快乐的时光就是在被杀的那一刻！
for your brief,little moment in the sun.

858
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:43,704
妈妈！妈妈！
Mommy! Mommy!

859
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:45,536
爸爸！不要！
Daddy! No!

860
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,312
快跑！
Come on!

861
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,752
你好
<i>Hello?</i>

862
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,800
我的名字叫帕克！
<i>My name is Parker!</i>

863
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,358
这是什么？
<i>What is this?</i>

864
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:52,534
是你写的吗？
<i>Did you do this?</i>

865
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:57,635
你好大的胆子！
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

866
01:29:00,769 --> 01:29:02,043
但是，妈妈。。。
<i>But, Mommy..</i>

867
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:06,811
说实话
<i>Speak the truth.</i>

868
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:10,184
是你写的吗？
<i>Did you?</i>

869
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:15,558
-恩
-这不是你的名字！！！
-Yes.
-That is not your name!

870
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,696
帕克不是你的名字！！！
<i>Parker is not your name!</i>

871
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:23,131
那是你爹取的名字
<i>That is the name your father gave you!</i>

872
01:29:23,325 --> 01:29:25,464
你的名字
<i>Your name</i>

873
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,132
是玛丽莲 
<i>is Marilyn.</i>

874
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,143
你听清楚了吗？
<i>Do you understand?</i>

875
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,979
跟着妈妈说一次
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

876
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:39,510
我的名字叫玛丽莲
<i>“My name is Marilyn. "</i>

877
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:43,881
快说！！！
<i>Say it!</i>

878
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:45,686
我的名字叫。。。
<i>My name is..</i>

879
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:48,493
玛丽莲 
<i>Marilyn.</i>

880
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:53,689
乖囡
<i>Quiet, now.</i>

881
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:59,738
不做乖女孩，你就会。。。。 
<i>If you don't be a good little girl, you'll get..</i>

882
01:30:18,013 --> 01:30:20,425
妈妈！妈妈！我可以沉睡，然后去那个黑地方 
Mommy, Mommy, I can go into the dark place

883
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,085
找爸爸来救我们！
and find Daddy,if I go to sleep.

884
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:23,685
不不，这太危险了！
No, it's too dangerous.

885
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,095
你上次差点醒不过来
I nearly lost you once before.

886
01:30:25,186 --> 01:30:26,460
妈妈不能再失去你了 
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

887
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:30,024
我一定能找到爸爸，我保证我们会回来的，我保证
I can find him. I promise I'll find him.I promise.

888
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:31,894
一定会的
I will.

889
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:40,375
后退
Turn around.

890
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,552
没事的
It's okay!

891
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:55,886
小心
Be careful.

892
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,228
我爱你
I love you.

893
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,197
搞掉她，乔什！结束这一切！
<i>Destroy her, Josh!End this!</i>

894
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:47,707
我在哪？
Where am I?

895
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:16,261
放开她！
Let her go!

896
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,358
罗琳？
Lorraine?

897
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:23,702
他在哪？
Where is he?

898
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:24,869
他在下面
He's got Renai.

899
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:35,777
可恶！
What the hell!

900
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,752
帕克，我来消除她对你的记忆，你要帮我
<i>Parker, help me destroy the memories of her.</i>

901
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:16,754
这样你就解脱了
<i>It will set you free.</i>

902
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:19,025
求你让我进去吧
<i>Please let me in.</i>

903
01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:20,995
打开心门！
<i>Open the door.</i>

904
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:43,184
菇凉莫等闲，白发空悲切！ 
<i>Little girls need to learn to be good!</i>

905
01:35:03,331 --> 01:35:04,969
不要啊~~~~~~~~~
No!

906
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:25,820
宝贝
Baby!

907
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:27,493

909
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:34,896
伊莉丝
<i>Elise!</i>

910
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,339
乔什，快走！
<i>Josh, go now.</i>

911
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,842
我想带你一块走
<i>I wish I could take you with me.</i>

912
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,674
我走不了，但是卡尔可以走
<i>I can't.But you can take Carl.</i>

913
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:40,769
什么？
<i>What?</i>

914
01:35:41,002 --> 01:35:42,675
我说过你不属于这里
<i>I told you,you don't belong here.</i>

915
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,444
我和你拥抱时我听得到你的心跳声 
<i>I felt your heartbeat when I hugged you.</i>

916
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:47,076
你还活着，是时候该回表关世界了
<i>You're still alive.It's time to live again.</i>

917
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:48,745
你们两个快走
<i>But you both have to go now!</i>

918
01:35:49,277 --> 01:35:51,279
快离开这！
<i>Go now!</i>

919
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:53,052
快啊
<i>Go!</i>

920
01:36:19,307 --> 01:36:20,479
离开！
<i>Get away</i>

921
01:36:24,312 --> 01:36:26,758
回去！回去！
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

922
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:29,152
爸爸！
Daddy!

923
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,455
大盾？
Dalton?

924
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:34,827
大盾！
<i>Dalton!</i>

925
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,060
爸爸！
Daddy!

926
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:39,062
儿子你在哪?
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

927
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:40,504
爸爸！
<i>Daddy!</i>

928
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:42,397
哦！
<i>Oh!</i>

929
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:45,643
我的乖宝贝！你怎么会在这？
<i>Oh, good bay!What are you doing here?</i>

930
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,974
我来带你回家
<i>I came to bring you home!</i>

931
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,140
你怎么找到我的？
<i>How did you find me?</i>

932
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:51,945
我跟着你的脚步声
<i>I followed your steps.</i>

933
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,008
儿子快醒醒！
<i>Please wake up!</i>

934
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,178
你在哪？快回来吧！

935
01:36:58,346 --> 01:36:59,518
回到妈妈身边

936
01:36:59,614 --> 01:37:00,786

01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:05,255
回到妈妈身边
<i>Get back to me!</i>

939
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:08,091
小机灵，跟我来

940
01:37:10,258 --> 01:37:11,498

快醒醒！
Come on, wake up!

942
01:37:41,456 --> 01:37:42,560
是我
It's me.

943
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:45,737
宝贝，是我，没事了
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

944
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:47,969
都结束了
It's okay.

945
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:49,967
爸爸？
Daddy?

946
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:51,533
是的

947

谢谢你
Thanks to you.

950
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:01,983
我的好儿子，嘿，宝贝
My boys. Hey, buddy.

951
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:09,895
仁爱，是我，我回来了

我努力联系你，想尽一切办法 
I tried reaching you I tried everything.

953
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,334
我还弹了那首曲子
I played your song.

954
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:31,510
我早该想到那是你
I should've known it was you.

955
01:38:32,774 --> 01:38:35,380
只有你才会弹得那么烂
Only you could play it that badly.

956
01:38:53,194 --> 01:38:54,639
放马过来！
Bring in

957
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:04,876
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

958
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:06,877
好了
We're ready.

959
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:10,484
准备忘掉那种能力
Ready to forget once and for all.

960
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:12,558
不想再回到那个世界了，对吧
No more traveling, right?

961
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:16,091
我们只属于这个世界 
This is the only world we wanna be in.

962
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,959
很好，兰伯特先生
Good, Mr. Lambert.

963
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,760
那么，闭上眼睛
So then, close your eyes.

964
01:39:22,824 --> 01:39:23,928
小兰伯特先生也是
Both of you.

965
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:27,139
做个深呼吸
Now take a deep breath,

966
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:30,501
听着摆针的声音
and just listen to the ticking.

967
01:39:30,598 --> 01:39:34,978
你们感到很疲倦，很想入睡
Now feel yourselves getting sleepier and sleepier,

968
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:39,609
让那黑暗离你们越来越远
and let the darkness drift further

969
01:39:39,674 --> 01:39:42,848
消失不见
and further away.

970
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:13,878
-谁啊？
-我来带个口信
-Who is it? 
-I have a message for you.

971
01:40:13,975 --> 01:40:15,386
是关于艾丽森的
It's about Allison.

972
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:21,151
你们搞啥名堂？
Is this some kind of joke?

973
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:24,458
我们有一个好朋友，她。。
We have a close personal friend who has, uh,

974
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,294
她和艾丽森有交流
spoken with Allison.

975
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:27,457
那不可能
That's not possible.

976
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,365
你们走吧，不然我报警了 
You better leave now or I'm calling the police.

977
01:40:29,457 --> 01:40:31,300
等一下，布莱恩
Wait, Brian.

978
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,030
请问你们是什么人？
Who are you guys?

979
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:36,699
我们以助人为乐，太太
Uh.. We help people, ma'am.

980
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:41,137
-我们帮助那些受困扰的。。。。
-那位女士是谁？
-People who've been afflicted by..
-Who's the lady?

981
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,549
宝贝，哪位女士？
What lady, honey?

982
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,141
站他们后面那位
The lady standing behind them.

983
01:40:51,012 --> 01:40:52,013
嘘。。
Um..

984
01:40:52,647 --> 01:40:54,991
我们的这位朋友让我们转达：
Our friend told us to tell you

985
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,529
艾丽森的意外其实并不是意外
that Allison's accident was no accident.

986
01:40:57,585 --> 01:41:01,260
当她在医院复苏时
When she was resuscitated back to life at the hospital,

987
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:02,993
有灵魂跟着她回到了这里
she brought something back with her.

988
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:05,400
不只一个灵魂，有很多
Not just one thing, many things.

989
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:08,337
它们和你们一块住在这房间里
And they're living here in this house with you.

990
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,369
艾丽森
Allison.

991
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,350
艾丽森
Allison.

992
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:41,637
我地妈。。。
Oh, my God!

993
01:41:42,293 --> 01:41:46,637
