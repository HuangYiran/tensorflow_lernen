1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,720
Why would the President
want to kill your wife?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,690
Her very existence is a threat to him.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,120
So,you're telling me,he's so afraid of
a scandal that he would commit murder.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,330
Yes.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,900
This is crazy.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,650
And,assassinating him,how does that
even help you get his bone marrow?

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,360
It was the only way to get near him.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,820
I needed allies,resources,people inside
the White House to help arrange all this.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,350
So,we went to Kincaid's enemies.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,840
They were willing to assist,on the
condition that we guaranteed his death.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,350
And,what about your
team? Archer,Sandrine...

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,840
They're what,hired guns?

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,690
Do they know all this?

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,030
So you lie to them,too.

15
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,900
I told them what they need to know.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,820
And I suggest you do the same
with your family,especially Brian.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,140
Do you trust how he'll react?

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,950
You are out of your mind.

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,420
Innocent people are dead because of you.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,930
I didn't want it to happen
this way,but I'm in too deep.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,750
If I back out now,they'll get rid of me.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,330
And anybody else who's involved.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,620
My family.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,360
And your family.

25
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,530
You're an FBI agent,you can make a deal.

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,550
Go to the police,the
prosecutors,there's a way out of this.

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,860
There isn't.

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,680
I can't stop this thing.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,170
And neither can you.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,710
Well,I don't accept that.

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,550
What if I go to the President?

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,020
I'm meeting with his Chief of Staff
tomorrow,I could tell him what's going on.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
I don't think so.

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,170
The Chief of Staff just died
of a heart attack an hour ago.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,220
The Chief of Staff,and
now Hoffman's dead,too?

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,670
Just saw it on the news.

37
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,870
Police believe he was the victim
of an attempted carjacking.

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,330
Hoffman I can understand. He was
getting too close to the truth.

39
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,520
But Creasy? Why'd they take him out?

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,590
Creasy was never the boss.

41
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,830
Maybe the people up
the chain got cold feet.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,910
Decided to shut down the
operation. Eliminate loose ends.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,510
If that's true,why aren't we dead?

44
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,620
The night's still young.

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,510
Hoffman's murder wasn't a coincidence.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,630
I just spoke to the guy,he
knew what was going on.

47
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,850
Duncan and his friends are
nervous and they took him out.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,930
It's possible.

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,620
"It's possible"?

50
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,700
Well,I don't think they
would murder a federal agent.

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,730
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,350
They just gunned down
a teenager in our house.

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,140
They'll do anything to
get rid of the President.

54
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,750
I have a feeling it's
more complicated than that.

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,980
Why?

56
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,390
I just do.

57
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,630
I don't think they're terrorists.

58
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,740
I think there's something else going on.

59
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,450
This leaves us in a bad spot.

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,320
We don't know who we're
dealing with anymore.

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,080
Logan's our only partner now.

62
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,690
Partner? I'm not so sure.

63
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,360
I don't like the fact that he didn't
give us a heads up about Hoffman.

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,870
Or Creasy.

65
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,020
- It's not a good sign.
- I'm meeting him tomorrow.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,510
- I'll get some answers then.
- Just watch your step.

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,910
- Ellen figured it out.
- Excuse me?

68
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,460
Nina.

69
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,970
Her relationship to the
President. The bone marrow.

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,050
The more people who know,the
more complicated this becomes.

71
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,770
She's smart.

72
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,170
- She understands that.
- I know she's smart.

73
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,810
But will she keep her mouth shut?

74
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,620
Do you know something
that you're not telling me?

75
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,630
- Like what?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

76
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,210
Do you know why Duncan is doing this?

77
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,220
No. I have no idea.

78
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,350
One of my assistant's was there.

79
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,610
She saw it with her own
eyes,said it was horrible.

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,260
Gasping and convulsing...

81
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,130
I can't even think about his
poor wife and their little girl.

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,120
It's tragic.

83
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,620
Yeah.

84
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,260
I never cared for Quentin,but...

85
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,040
but any time a young man dies
in the prime of his life...

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,970
Like Peter?

87
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,560
Sort of.

88
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,100
What do you mean,"Sort of"?

89
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,790
The truth is,Peter was partially
responsible for his own death.

90
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,800
You think it was Peter's
fault that his plane crashed?

91
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,350
It was his fault that he thought he was invincible and could fly a
plane over the Rockies,at night,after 20 straight hours of campaigning.

92
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't look at me like that. I
loved him as much as you did.

93
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,610
For God's sake,I practically raised him.

94
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,060
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't
be honest about what happened.

95
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,360
I agree.

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,520
The way that my sister
compartmentalizes,and rationalizes,it's...

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,220
It's infuriating. "Peter
was too brash,so,he died."

98
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,490
There you go. As simple as that.

99
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,400
Well,she didn't want to face the truth.

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,170
It's just,I wanted to say to her,God,I wanted to tell her so
badly,the reason Peter died is because your husband had him killed.

101
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,550
Well,I'm glad you restrained yourself.

102
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,020
Here.

103
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,770
It wasn't easy,I swear.

104
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,320
Don't worry.

105
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,600
He'll pay for what he did.

106
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,440
He better.

107
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,330
- Are you losing faith?
- I'm losing patience.

108
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,180
And confidence.

109
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,160
I still have no idea if this doctor is going to
come through or if the FBI agent is doing his job.

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Vanessa,what are you saying?

111
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,330
I'm saying it's time for
us to get more involved.

115
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,120
I heard about our friend,Stan Hoffman.

116
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,680
Yeah. Sad. Another
random act of violence.

117
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,520
I thought we were going to
take care of that together.

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,930
Clock was ticking. Had
to take care of it myself.

119
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,200
Right.

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,130
- So,do you have the OR schematics?
- No,not yet.

121
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,220
Security plan isn't final yet.

122
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,560
Surgery's in five days.

123
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,710
I'll see what I can do.

124
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,620
My contact had a heart attack
last night. Who do I talk to now?

125
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,510
Should I be insulted? You have me.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,760
My deal was with Creasy. Not you.

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,610
So,with all due respect,I need to know
my side of this is being taken care of.

128
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,330
If they want to reach
out to you,they will.

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,220
Simple as that.

130
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,200
Oh,one more thing.

131
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,930
The five minute window you
requested in the operating room?

132
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,840
What about it?

133
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,580
It's getting harder to
make those arrangements.

134
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,650
That's non-negotiable.

135
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,770
Why do you need all that time?

136
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,770
We made a deal. I expect you
and your partners to honor it.

137
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll let them know.

138
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,600
- I just talked to our friend at the FBI.
- And?

139
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,190
He wants direct contact with you.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
It's not gonna happen. He talks to you.

141
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,910
<i>********</i>

142
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,770
That's what I told him.

143
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,240
I got his cell number. You ready?

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,350
Go ahead.

145
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,070
It's encrypted. I can't hack it.

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,560
So how do we get access?

147
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,510
We need a warrant.

148
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
A warrant? What are you talking
about,like going to a judge?

149
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,340
Who said anything about a judge?

150
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,420
I said we need a warrant,I
didn't say it needed to be real.

151
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,090
The President seems
to be a reasonable man.

152
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,130
Did you even try to
approach him directly?

153
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,040
I told you,that's not an option.

154
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,680
But how could you be so sure?

155
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,630
So,he had an illegitimate child.
That was over 30 years ago.

156
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,690
Kincaid raped Nina's mother.

157
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,250
What?

158
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,270
Kincaid was a young
congressman at the time.

159
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,620
Nina's mother was a young journalist.

160
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,320
She went to his hotel
room. For an interview.

161
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,450
And he raped her.

162
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,280
A few weeks later,she threatened
to go public with her story.

163
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,230
Kincaid tried to buy her silence.

164
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,810
How could you possibly know all this?

165
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,770
Burton Delaney was one of
Kincaid's closest advisors.

166
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,240
<i>35 Years Ago</i>

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,290
He told me what happened next.

168
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,010
I didn't force myself on
her,Burton. Now,you believe me,right?

169
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,280
It's not about what I believe.

170
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,450
It's about your reputation.

171
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,160
Your political future.

172
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,260
You're on the cusp right now,Paul.

173
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,820
This accusation could
derail your entire career.

174
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,060
I gave you the money to pay her off.

175
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,300
She wouldn't take it.

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,660
Double the offer. Everyone has a price.

177
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,890
Not this one.

178
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,230
We need to take a different approach.

179
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,740
Well,what exactly are you saying?

180
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,680
I'm saying this is a problem
that won't go away on its own.

181
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,570
If you can't buy silence,you have
to eliminate the source of the noise.

182
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,390
The woman's name was Kate Renner.

183
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,630
Burton knew her.

184
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,710
He couldn't go through with it,so...

185
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,560
he helped her get out of the country.

186
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,110
A few months later,he found out she
was pregnant with Kincaid's child.

187
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,940
- Where is she now?
- She died in childbirth.

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,070
Burton adopted the girl.

189
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,430
Nina. Raised her.

190
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,430
He never told her or
anybody else the truth.

191
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,090
The only reason he told me is because...

192
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,570
because Nina got sick.

193
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,980
So,now do you understand?

194
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,010
Kincaid is not a reasonable man.

195
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,660
<i>Hey,Boyd. It's Dad.</i>

196
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,650
<i>Did you get my last message?</i>

197
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,040
<i>I haven't heard from
you in a couple of days.</i>

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,070
<i>Hey,call me back,buddy.</i>

199
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,560
<i>Trying you again. Hey,call me back.</i>

200
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,440
<i>I'm sure you're
fine,but,I'm getting worried.</i>

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,870
<i>Okay? Talk soon. I love you.</i>

202
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,500
You just found this phone?

203
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah,it must have fallen out of his
pocket when he climbed in the window.

204
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,360
But this is the first time
I heard it ring,I swear.

205
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,330
Relax,I believe you.

206
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,410
What if Boyd's dad goes to the
police? What are we gonna do?

207
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,800
Maybe there's a medical solution.

208
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,490
If there were a medical solution,do you
really think I'd be going through all this?

209
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,720
Let me review Nina's files,maybe
I'll come up with something that...

210
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,030
I've talked to the best
oncologists in the world,Ellen.

211
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,440
There are no other solutions.

212
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,600
Look,I'm sure you're right.

213
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,020
But if I'm going to be standing over that
man,watching him die on the operating table,

214
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,440
I can't be wondering if Nina could
have been saved some other way.

215
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,170
You're right.

216
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,910
Read the files. Examine everything.

217
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,630
You'll come to the
same conclusion I did.

218
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,100
I'll send over Nina's medical
records to your office today.

219
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,770
Mr. President.

220
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,630
I'm afraid he was needed
in another meeting.

221
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,450
Ted Jankowski. Acting Chief of Staff.

222
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,380
It's nice to finally meet you.

223
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
- Something I can help you with?
- yes,there might be.

224
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,140
First of all,my condolences on Quentin.

225
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,420
I met him a few times. Great loss.

226
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,870
I need to speak with the President.

227
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,390
He and I were supposed to
discuss a major policy initiative.

228
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,870
- What initiative?
- I'm afraid it's classified.

229
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm sorry,but the President's
schedule is fully booked.

230
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
We can set something up for next week.

231
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,390
This matter is time sensitive.

232
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,040
Any chance I can get even a brief
meeting on schedule sooner than that?

233
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,750
Sorry,it's a busy week.

234
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,820
- Ellen?
- I found something in your wife's files.

235
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,970
1,249 people were tested,not
one of them was a match.

236
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,970
But there was one anonymous
donor who came close.

237
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,950
How close?

238
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,380
28%.

239
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,440
So? That's not enough
for a viable transplant.

240
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,420
I know,but this person could be
a relative,maybe even a sibling.

241
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,800
What I'm saying is,this person
could lead us to a better match.

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,150
If there were a better
match,we'd already know.

243
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,390
I'm trying to save your wife.

244
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,900
What do you need?

245
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,300
Name and address.

246
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,240
Give me the donor number.

247
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,950
With Creasy gone,I've
got no damn access.

248
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,150
You still think Kincaid will go
public with OTI before the surgery?

249
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,630
Possibly.

250
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,240
- I don't know.
- Why roll the dice?

251
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,530
- What are you saying?
- OTI is important.

252
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,760
Don't give this bastard a chance
to take that away from you.

253
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,370
Do we really want to bet the future
of this country on Dr. Sanders?

254
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,890
Or Duncan Carlisle?

255
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,570
They tried and failed.

256
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,690
Why should we believe
they'll pull it off this time?

257
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,480
Fair enough,but what
other options do we have?

258
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,720
It's not that easy
to kill the President.

259
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,190
What did you find?

260
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,610
The name of your mystery
donor is Sally Whitaker.

261
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,300
I'm texting you her address now.

262
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,960
Okay,perfect. I'll let you
know what I come up with.

263
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,400
Can I help you?

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm looking for Sally
Whitaker. Is she in?

265
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm afraid she's not.

266
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,180
Do you know when she'll be back?
I really need to speak with her.

267
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,430
What for?

268
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,810
Oh,I'm sorry,I'm with
the Reston Blood Bank.

269
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,600
I tried calling a few times,but
I couldn't get through.

270
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,120
It's about a recent donation Sally made.

271
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,240
I have the paperwork here somewhere.

272
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,950
Do you mind if I come in for a moment?

273
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,800
Okay.

274
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,980
But,you must have
some kind of a mix-up.

275
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,560
Sally never mentioned
anything about giving blood.

276
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,930
Are you sure? Our records
indicate she did make a donation.

277
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,540
It was earmarked for a very
sick patient,Nina Carlisle?

278
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,560
Never heard of her.

279
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,150
Miss?

280
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,890
Are you all right?

281
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,150
Sorry,I just,that photo there...

282
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,490
It just looks like someone I know.

283
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,370
Oh,yeah. Them.

284
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,390
Yeah,they're,friends of my wife.

285
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,650
Okay,well,I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

286
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,590
Can I just trouble you
for a glass of water?

287
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,470
I've been driving in
the car all day,I just...

288
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,410
Sure.

289
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,560
Thank you.

290
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,940
I understand the President's
going to New York tomorrow.

291
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,710
- Do you have his full itinerary?
- They just issued it to us.

292
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,390
I'm talking about his
unofficial itinerary.

293
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,390
The one that includes his
off-the-record meetings.

294
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,410
I will.

295
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm on his detail tomorrow.

296
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,450
He'll have at least one
off-the-record meeting tomorrow.

297
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,900
I want exact details. Time and
place. Operational security.

298
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,970
Everything.

299
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,030
Copy that.

300
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,860
Logan,one more thing.

301
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,390
I'm gonna need you to get
in touch with somebody.

302
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,050
Hey,sweetie. I'm with
customers,can I call you right back?

303
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,260
Sorry,my name's Ellen.

304
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,390
I found this phone in the street and
just called the last number dialed.

305
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,690
Oh,thanks so much,it
belongs to my husband.

306
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,540
Well,I just want to
return it to the owner.

307
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,410
That's so nice of you. I can come
get it wherever is convenient.

308
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,910
Well,I'm driving right
now,where are you?

309
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,700
North Arlington. Near
Wilson Boulevard and 20th.

310
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,180
Well,I can drop it
over to you if you like.

311
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,430
I have to head over there
in about a half hour,anyway.

312
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,430
Really? You're an angel. I'm in
the antique store on the corner.

313
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,020
See you soon.

314
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,580
Yeah?

315
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,900
- Raven gave me your number.
- Okay,I'm listening.

316
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,550
I'd like to meet in person.

317
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,800
- It's about a job opportunity.
- Where's the party?

318
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,770
I can tell you everything in person.

319
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,290
But Raven said to let you know that it'd
be a platinum level gig,platinum level pay.

320
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,550
Sounds good.

321
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,060
Meet me in 30 minutes at Mitchell Park.

322
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,650
- Southwest corner,I'll find you.
- See you there.

323
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,550
What,did you use a fake warrant?

324
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,180
Warrant was real. Signature
was fake. Nobody ever looks.

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,030
- So,what's this phone call about?
- I don't know.

326
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,790
You think it's anything to do with us?

327
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,150
In the past 24 hours,a Secret Service
agent and the Chief of Staff were killed.

328
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,060
The fact that Logan's reaching
out to some sort of operative?

329
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,270
It's not good.

330
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,100
I called you about your husband's phone.

331
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,640
I'm just finishing up some
paperwork,why don't you come on back?

332
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,500
You have some beautiful pieces here.

333
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,570
Who the hell are you?

334
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,310
Start talking.

335
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,060
Put the gun down. Please.

336
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,370
Who are you?

337
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,770
I'm a doctor.

338
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,300
My husband called me.

339
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,640
I know you came to the
house. You stole his phone.

340
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,360
What do you want?

341
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
I know you're related to Nina Carlisle.

342
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,600
You two are a 28% match
for bone marrow type.

343
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,220
Trust me,you don't want
to get involved in this.

344
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,170
I saw the wedding photo in your hall.

345
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,780
If you knew what was good for
you,you'd leave and never come back.

346
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,140
Well,I can't do that.

347
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,360
I know who you are.

348
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,930
You're Kate Renner.

349
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,260
Nina's mother.

350
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,950
I haven't heard that name in many years.

351
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,140
Why are you here?

352
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,920
Burton Delaney.

353
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,740
He told me your story,I'm sorry.

354
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,960
It was a lifetime ago.

355
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,050
I've moved on.

356
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,120
I thought you were dead.

357
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,910
That was the idea.

358
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,150
Must have been hard.

359
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,700
Giving up your child.

360
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,280
What do you want?

361
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,180
Your daughter is sick.

362
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,470
She has leukemia.

363
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,810
She needs a donor.

364
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,270
You're not a close enough match,but
I was hoping you could lead me to one.

365
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,510
If Nina has one other blood
relative,there's a chance.

366
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,150
Did you ever have any other children?

367
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,610
No.

368
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,930
I see.

369
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,720
Well,I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

370
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,850
Why is Nina's life so important to you?

371
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,230
Because...

372
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,440
I have a family too.

373
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,670
Hi,can I help you?

374
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,270
Yes,I'm John Norton.

375
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,490
Boyd's father.

376
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,290
Oh,right.

377
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,170
Boyd. Right okay.

378
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,890
I'm Brian Sanders. Come on in.

379
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,590
Nice to meet you.

380
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,260
Morgan's told me all about your son.

381
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,560
Oh,well...

382
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,350
I'm sure you heard the news.

383
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,770
No,I haven't. Everything okay?

384
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,820
Not exactly.

385
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm afraid,Boyd...

386
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,070
Well,he broke up with your daughter
in a rather cowardly manner.

387
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay.

388
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,110
Well,listen,not to worry.

389
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,680
Boys that age tend to not
have the highest emotional IQs.

390
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,350
Yeah,I agree.

391
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,250
That's why I'm here.

392
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,280
I'd like to talk to Morgan,in person.

393
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,400
I feel I owe it to her.

394
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,690
Okay. Sure.

395
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,370
Morgan!

396
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,160
Morgan?

397
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,840
This is Mr. Norton.

398
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,810
Boyd's dad.

399
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,790
We've met.

400
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,940
Hello,Mr. Norton.

401
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,320
Hi,Morgan.

402
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,930
Nice to see you,I...

403
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,010
wish it were under
different circumstances.

404
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,270
I felt I needed to come over and
apologize to you on my son's behalf.

405
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,630
That's so sweet of you,but
you didn't have to do that.

406
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,100
I'm fine.

407
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,500
Really,I'm okay.

408
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,150
I'm confused.

409
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,200
I'm sorry,Mr. Sanders,I
thought you knew.

410
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,790
Look,I heard from
Boyd about an hour ago.

411
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,590
He told me everything.

412
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,860
This is no ordinary target.

413
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,460
He's a man,like any other.

414
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,280
You pull the trigger,you get paid.

415
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,770
I want double what you're offering.

416
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,930
I can go back with that.

417
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,990
Anything else?

418
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,660
Yeah,I pick my team.

419
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,980
Okay.

420
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,470
I'll reach out to you later
today with more details.

421
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,520
Come to think of it,I
do have one question.

422
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,940
Why?

423
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,550
It's okay,Mr. Norton. My
parents know that I got pregnant.

424
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,380
Boyd shouldn't have run
out on his responsibilities.

425
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,490
I mean,now is not the time to ship
out on a fishing boat for three months.

426
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,910
Well,he's been talking
about that for a long time.

427
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,460
I know.

428
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,280
He has no idea how hard
the work's gonna be.

429
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,350
Well,I don't blame him...

430
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,010
Mr. Norton,and I
certainly don't blame you.

431
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,320
I appreciate that,Morgan.

432
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,370
Really,I do.

433
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,140
But you know,it's not
really Boyd's fault.

434
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,070
The truth is,I should
have set a better example.

435
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,790
I wasn't around enough
when he was growing up.

436
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,870
It was nice to see you again,Morgan.

437
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,620
Guess my son has a lot
of growing up to do.

438
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,560
I need your help. Take
a look at this photo.

439
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,120
Who are they?

440
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,150
The guy on the right is our contact
inside the Secret Service.His name's Logan.

441
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,550
He met up with that other
guy about a half an hour ago.

442
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,710
Duncan wants to know who he is.

443
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,950
I'll run it through facial
recognition. See if we get a hit.

444
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,410
Are you okay?

445
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,510
Yeah,I'm fine.

446
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,480
What happened with Sally Whitaker?

447
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,410
She's Nina's mother.

448
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,880
What?

449
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,120
Sally Whitaker's real
name is Kate Renner.

450
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,510
Are you positive?

451
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,130
Yes,I...

452
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,710
I saw a picture of you and Nina.

453
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,460
In her house.

454
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
And I confronted her and...

455
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,050
she confirmed everything
you said about Kincaid.

456
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,250
She's been living under an
assumed identity all these years.

457
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,280
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,480
What good would it have
done for me to tell you?

459
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,300
You don't think Nina would have
wanted to know her mother was alive?

460
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,620
Of course she would have.
That's why I had to lie.

461
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,610
You think I wanted to keep this
secret? I did it to protect everybody.

462
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,340
Nina,Kate,Sawyer.

463
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,910
- You could have told me.
- I could have.

464
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,150
But then what?

465
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,130
You'd be forced to lie to your wife
every day for the rest of your life.

466
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,380
I carried that burden
with me since she was born.

467
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,960
Trust me.

468
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,760
I did you a favor,Duncan.

469
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,090
You know I always
thought of you like a son.

470
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,700
I know you have.

471
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,100
So I'm gonna ask you one time.

472
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,980
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

473
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,650
- Excuse me?
- I don't want any more surprises.

474
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,920
I've told you everything.

475
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,020
Duncan,it's me.

476
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,070
What is it?

477
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,550
Kramer took a photo of a guy
talking to the Secret Service agent.

478
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,100
You got a name?

479
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,660
Robert Harper. Former Army
Ranger and decorated sniper.

480
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,080
Sniper?

481
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,430
Four tours of duty in Iraq.

482
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,770
Over 100 confirmed kills.

483
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,920
Duncan.

484
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,350
What is it?

485
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,340
The guy Logan was
talking to in the park.

486
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,190
He's a sniper.

487
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,990
They want to take me out.

488
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,130
They did the math and decided that it was
just too risky to continue the operation.

489
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,300
- Creasy,Hoffman.
- Now me.

490
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,750
They're mopping up.

491
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,780
- You should get out of the country.
- No.

492
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,170
- We've come too far.
- So,what do you propose?

493
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,950
Shoot the sniper before he shoots me.

494
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,900
What the hell just happened
back there with Boyd's father?

495
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,130
I found Boyd's phone.

496
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,440
And his Dad kept calling,

497
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,830
so Sandrine and I texted him back.

498
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,880
We made up a cover story,so that
Mr. Norton wouldn't go to the cops.

499
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,730
What?

500
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,450
I can't believe you. When
were you going to tell me this?

501
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,740
We didn't know he was
going to come over.

502
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,450
"We"? Hey. We're not
on the same side,Morgan.

503
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,240
We have to cooperate with them.

504
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,030
- Besides...
- Besides what?

505
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,680
They didn't mean to kill Boyd.

506
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,440
It just... happened.

507
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,690
Oh,for God sakes. Morgan,listen.

508
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,290
These people are holding us hostage.

509
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,160
They're evil. You see that,don't you?

510
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,660
- How are you feeling?
- Optimistic.

511
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,360
Now,frankly,I never liked the idea of sitting back
and relying on somebody else. I'm a Marine at heart.

512
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,570
- Only happy in the mud.
- But you clean up so well.

513
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,390
You can't have dirt on your
shoes in the oval office?

514
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,440
That is why I have you
to keep me civilized.

515
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,200
Not too civilized.

516
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,560
What about that FBI agent?

517
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,210
Carlisle.

518
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,140
- I'm handling it.
- Good.

519
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,390
I'm worried about Morgan.

520
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,370
She's starting to believe these guys.

521
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,510
What do you mean?

522
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,450
She helped them cover up Boyd's death.

523
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,200
It's like she's...

524
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,460
part of their team.

525
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,680
She told me what happened.

526
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,500
I don't understand why
you're so upset with her.

527
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,120
What do you mean you don't know why?

528
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,110
I think she did the right
thing,given the circumstances.

529
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
We're in too deep. We no longer
have the privilege of being...

530
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,160
- moralistic.
- What the hell does that mean?

531
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,370
I think your initial instinct was right.

532
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,100
- Initial instinct?
- That I should do what they want.

533
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,920
I know I told you to cooperate,but you
were the one who had the strength to say no.

534
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,480
You fought back.

535
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,040
I admire that about you.
You made the right choice.

536
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,680
Did I?

537
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,300
Too many people have died
since then. You almost died.

538
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,250
All to save one man?

539
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:42,750
No,I'm not willing to sacrifice our
family for the life of Paul Kincaid.

540
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,970
Where is that coming from?

541
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,020
Nowhere.

542
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,910
It's just a decision
that I have to make.

543
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,140
That's Duncan talking.

544
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,100
- What?
- He's been manipulating us from the start.

545
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,810
You gotta let me in. We
gotta be together on this.

546
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,940
If I do what he wants,then we're free.

547
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,750
We cannot trust him.

548
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,350
I disagree.

549
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,710
The guy was hard to track down
but I got an address for you.

550
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Thanks.

551
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,340
- Do you need any help?
- No,I got it.

552
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,910
And thanks for sticking around.

553
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,170
Archer was right about you.

554
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,990
You're good.

555
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,500
I'll take care of the sniper tonight.

556
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,830
<i>*******</i>

557
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,940
<i>*******</i>

558
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,970
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

559
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,570
I...

560
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,870
It's about my kid.

561
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,550
Well,go. I'll cover for you.

562
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,320
Thanks.

563
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,650
<i>BOARDING PASS ******</i>

564
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,370
What do you want?

565
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,140
This was in Boyd's pocket.

566
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Guess he meant it for you.

567
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,040
Where did you bury him?

568
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,620
Don't think about that.
Just keep the ring.

569
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,460
<i>President ********</i>

570
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,870
Did you kill him?

571
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,230
I went to his apartment,but
he wasn't there.

572
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,630
He's on a plane to New
York City right now.

573
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,490
If he's trying to kill you,why
is he on his way to New York?

574
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,350
Because I'm not the target.

575
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,290
The President is.

576
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,490
He's scheduled to be in
New York all day tomorrow.

577
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,560
The question is,where and when?

578
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,670
How are they planning to take him out?

579
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,770
Glad you could make it.

580
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,340
- Where's my son?
- Safe and sound. With his father.

581
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,190
Call him if you don't believe me.

582
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,620
I just needed to make sure you'd show.

583
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,880
What do you want?

584
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:37,410
I have a business proposition for you.

585
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,850
Low risk. High reward.

586
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,230
My kid is the one who
believes in fairy tales.

587
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,450
Not me.

588
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,890
I need a friend inside
Duncan's operation.

589
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,520
A friend?

590
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,840
You're talking to the wrong girl.

591
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,800
Okay,a spy.

592
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,890
Better?

593
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,560
What are you offering?

594
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,250
He spends the morning at the UN,but
security there is far too tight.

595
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,450
Lunch and photos at the New York Stock Exchange
and then a meeting at the Federal Reserve.

596
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,200
Both hard targets.

597
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,910
Doesn't seem viable.

598
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,950
Here.

599
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,370
At 5:30,the President has scheduled a meeting
with Mike Petrocelli,head of the Teamsters.

600
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,700
That meeting is a fiction.

601
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,890
How do you know?

602
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:36,670
Kincaid's got the unions in his pocket for years,and
he hates Petrocelli,he's not wasting an hour with him.

603
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,140
Unless it's an election year.

604
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,030
So where do you think he's going?

605
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,930
To church.

606
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,700
What?

607
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,900
When I was in his camp,

608
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,570
he always stopped by St.
Theodore's when he was in New York.

609
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,940
The church is on Broadway and 24th,which
is five minutes away from his 4:30 meeting.

610
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,410
- You think that's where he's going to be?
- I do.

611
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,250
And it's the perfect
place to take him out.

612
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,680
If they succeed,Nina dies.

613
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,050
Then we need to get there first.

614
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,870
