1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,503
穆斯女神 不管你从哪里得知 告诉我（他们的事）吧

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,240
这没什么 只是被猫抓伤了而已
It's nothing. It's just a cat scratch.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,080
又不是一次两次了
I've had a million of 'em.

4
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:34,726
我才不要为了这点伤就去看医生
I'm not going to the doctor for a cat scratch.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,420
我才不要为了这点伤就去看医生
I'm not going to the doctor for a cat scratch.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,520
你可能会有危险
Your life could be in danger.

7
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,620
Nick 这怎么可能
Nick, that's ridiculous.

8
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,100
- 你不了解她   - 她是什么人
- You don't understand what she is. - What is she?

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
她是个有魅力 成功的女人
She's an attractive, successful woman.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
你曾经救过她的命
You saved her life once.

11
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,820
你怎么突然这么针对她
What do you suddenly have against her now?

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,580
你有什么瞒着我
And what aren't you telling me?

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,910
难道你跟她之间发生了什么
Did you have some sort of a relationship with her?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,220
- 没有  - 那这到底是怎么回事
- No. - Then what is it?

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,900
她是个女巫 好吧
She's a witch, okay?

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,500
你不知道到底发生了什么
You don't know what's going on here.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,960
你得去看医生
You're going to the doctor.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,060
早上好
Morning.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,740
你已经去过商店了
You went shopping already?

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,940
是的 Shemanski公园的露天市场
You bet. Shemanski park outdoor market.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,660
吃货会在早上市场开门时
The true epicure always does his shopping

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,040
去选好东西
while the farmers set up.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,590
嗨 今晚你在哪儿吃饭
Hey, what are you doing for dinner?

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,710
看工作情况了 怎么了
That depends on work. Why?

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,160
我买了一级棒的素牛排
Well, I scored these primo veggie steaks.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
如果你来 我就多化一块肉
If I know when you're coming, I'll defrost an extra.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,350
- 素牛排  - 很美味的
- Veggie steaks? - They're excellent.

28
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,716
你知道的 再加上一点柑橘酢 零残忍
You know, a little ponzu? Cruelty-free.

28
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,716
{\a6}零残忍 是一种对于素食者的素食行为的定义

29
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,023
我怎能对这样的美味说不
How can I say "No" To that?

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,720
- 好  - Hank 你回来了
- All right. - Hank, you back?

31
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,410
恩 我马上出发
Yeah. I'm leaving now.

32
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,946
我在Fuller咖啡店等你
I'll meet you at Fuller's coffee shop.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,206
好的
Great.

34
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:52,710
我很期待你的素牛排哦
Hey, I cannot wait for those veggie steaks.

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,700
八点准时回来
8：00 sharp.

36
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,210
哇哦 你这是闹哪儿样啊
Okay. So what happened to you?

37
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,000
在考爱岛高空滑索
Ziplining in Kauai.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,820
着陆的时候有点激动过头 伤了跟腱
Landed a little too enthusiastically and tore my achilles.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
真要命 那医生怎么说
Man what'd the doctor say?

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,980
事实上 他坚持让我休息
Actually, he was very adamant.

41
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,480
"让你搭档把所有活都做了"
"Let your partner do all the work."

42
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:16,213
就好像现在不是这样似的
As if I don't already.

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
所以你一个人去索道滑行
So you were zip-lining alone?

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,520
这个嘛 还真不是
Well, not exactly.

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
- 你记得Nadine吗  - 你前妻
- You remember Nadine? - Ex-wife Nadine?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,260
恩 我带她一起去的
Yeah. I took her.

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,320
- 就想试试  - 唔
- It was kind of an experiment. - Whew.

48
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:29,763
我们仍然有很多共同之处
You know, we still have a lot in common.

49
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,740
我倒没看出来
I didn't see that one coming.

50
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,310
恩 我知道 我也没看出来
Yeah, I know. Neither did I.

51
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,660
我不在的时候发生了什么
Um, so what'd I miss?

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,060
跟往常没什么区别 有恶魔 还有些外星人
The usual.The devil. A couple of space aliens.

53
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:40,746
是啊
Yeah.

54
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,790
这可不是回火产生的暴击声
I don't think that was a backfire.

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,720
不是 你去看看 我呼叫支援
No. You go. I'll call it in.

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,196
警察 让我过去
Police! Let me through!

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,710
快走
Move!

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,240
- 你是爱我的  - Anton 让我离开
- You love me. - Let go, Anton!

59
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,996
Khloe 我们必须马上离开这里
Khloe, we have to get out of here now.

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,420
就是现在 宝贝快来
Now! Come on, baby.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,840
Anton 求你了
Anton, please.

62
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,380
Khloe 你是我的人
You're mine, Khloe.

63
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,840
不 Anton 放开我
No! Anton, let go of me!

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,220
放开她
Let her go!

65
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,440
快走
Get out!

66
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:14,393
Khloe
Khloe!

67
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,500
我是Burkhardt 我在Nolen书店追赶一名持枪嫌犯
This is Burkhardt, I'm in foot pursuit of an armed suspect at Nolen's books

68
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,060
在西北第一大街与戴维斯街分界处
on Northwest First and Davis.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,090
听说嫌犯跳进河里了
Heard the suspect took a dive into the river.

70
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,420
是啊
Yeah

71
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:54,516
- 活着还是死了  - 不知道
- Alive or dead? - I don't know.

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,480
但是如果他浮上来了 肯定是在我看不到的地方
But if he came up, it was not where I could see it.

73
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:57,906
你看到他了
Well, you have that look.

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,500
- 他是格林生物  - 所以他能够待在水下
- He's wesen. - So he could've stayed under.

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,006
也许吧
Maybe.

76
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,200
潜水员们正在搜寻
Divers are searching now.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,200
这个是受害者 Evan Childs
So this is the vic? Evan Childs?

78
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,120
是 他是个作家 这次是他的签售活动
Yeah, he was the writer. It was his book signing.

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,500
那个女孩儿呢 我看她认识开枪的人
What about the girl? I think she knew the shooter.

80
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,200
确实
She does.

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,580
据她所说 我是指Khloe Sedgwick
According to her, and by "Her" I mean. Khloe Sedgwick

82
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,415
30岁 死者的女朋友
age 30, girlfriend of the vic.

83
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,660
她说开枪的人名为Anton Cole
She said the shooter's name is Anton Cole.

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
我们正在找他的住址
We're running down his place of residence.

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,010
她有说怎么和他认识的吗
She say how she knew him?

86
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,420
这个嘛 他是她的前男友
Well, he's an ex-boyfriend.

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,880
这是宗冲动犯罪
So we're talking crime of passion.

88
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,380
- 我猜是  - 好吧
- That'd be my guess. - All right.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,490
我们来跟她谈谈
Let's talk to her.

90
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,400
跟我走
Follow me.

91
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,620
你认识Anton Cole有多长时间了
How long have you known Anton Cole?

92
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,590
两年多一点
Uh, a little over two years.

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
六个月前我们分手了
We... we broke up about six months ago.

94
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,385
那个时候你认识了Childs先生
That's when you started seeing Mr. Childs?

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,260
恩 算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,080
那时候你同时在和他们两个约会嘛
Were you seeing both at the same time?

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,600
不 我不会这样做的
No, I don't do that.

98
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,805
Anton 他只是 他无法释怀
Anton, he just... he wouldn't let go.

99
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:58,390
他一直打来电话 想让我们复合
He kept calling and wanting to get back together.

100
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
之后 Evan开始变得很烦躁
And then, Evan started getting pretty upset.

101
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,605
再之后 Anton开始出现在我家周围
And then Anton started showing up at my house

102
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,400
说Evan配不上我
saying that Evan wasn't good enough for me,

103
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,300
而他才是我的真命天子
but that he was.

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,160
你把这些跟警察局备案了吗
And did you report any of this to the police?

105
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,820
你们不明白
You don't understand.

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,080
不如你跟我们讲讲
Why don't you tell us?

107
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,240
这听起来挺吓人的
This is gonna sound pretty terrible,

108
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,820
但是男人们很容易为我倾倒
but guys fall for me pretty easily.

109
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,340
当他们爱上我的时候 他们就 他们就难以停下来
And when they do, they just... they don't stop,

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,290
之后事情会变得令人难以忍受
and it can get really oppressive.

111
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,695
我 我不是故意表现的很自负
I-I don't mean to sound conceited.

112
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,920
这就是事实
It's just the way that it is.

113
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,990
如果不是你的话
If it hadn't have been for you...

114
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,040
他很可能杀了我
He would've killed me.

115
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,560
谢谢
Thank you.

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,490
你会没事儿的
You're gonna be okay.

117
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,800
但你们还没有找到他
But you haven't found him yet.

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,840
这个嘛 还没有 但是我们会派一名警官守在你家门前 直到我们找到凶手
Well, not yet, but we'll put an officer in front of your house until we do.

119
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,540
如果他跟你联系 打电话通知我
If he contacts you, call me.

120
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,620
我看你是不会洗手了
Are you going to wash that hand?

121
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,380
瞎说啥呢啊
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,540
饶了我吧
Give me a break.

123
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,560
嗨 找到Anton的住址了 东南部的一栋阁楼
Hey, got a 20 on Anton's place of residence, a loft in the Southeast.

124
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,440
他风度翩翩并且才华横溢
He was such a gentle soul and so talented.

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,440
和他女朋友分手让他有些崩溃
He broke up with his girlfriend, and it kinda tore him up.

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,000
在那之后他有些自闭
And, well, he kept to himself after that.

127
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,115
当他过来的时候 他一般都说些什么
And when he would come over, what would you talk about?

128
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,260
大多关于他的艺术和Khloe 就是他的女朋友
Mostly about his art and Khloe, his girlfriend.

129
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,260
他说她是他灵感的源泉
He said she was his inspiration.

130
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,010
我觉得说的太浪漫了
I thought that was very romantic.

131
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,980
但个人认为 我觉得他说的太夸张了
But personally, I think he gave her way too much credit.

132
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,610
但那就是爱 不是吗
But I guess that's love, right?

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,820
好吧 多谢你的帮忙 现在我们就四处看看
Well, thank you for your help. We'll take a look around now.

134
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,705
好 如果需要记得打给我 我就在楼下
Well, call me if you need me. I'll be downstairs.

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
搜索队刚刚回报
Search team just reported in.

136
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,800
没有找到Anton的尸体
Anton's body has not been found.

137
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,140
没准儿他往下游走了
Doesn't mean he's not way downriver.

138
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,490
- 但是  - 这个"但是"吓到我了
- But... - It's the "But" That scares me.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,620
安全
Clear!

140
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,320
安全
Clear!

141
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,760
依我所见 这个男人看起来
In my humble opinion, it seems this guy

142
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,020
陷入到某种痴迷当中
was sort of obsessed

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,980
没准儿有点疯狂地迷恋着Sedgwick小姐
and maybe a little out of his mind with Ms. Sedgwick.

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,040
你这么想
You think?

145
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,140
有趣的是 他的风格似乎从印象派变成了神经病流派
Interestingly, his style seems to range from impressionistic to "WTF."

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,600
你们得来看看这个
Better take a look at this.

147
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,700
有预谋的冲动犯罪
A pre-illustrated crime of passion.

148
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
我猜这个可以证明了这是有预谋的
I guess that proves premeditation.

149
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,810
- Juliette  - Nick
- Juliette. - Nick!

150
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,940
太好了你接电话了
I'm glad I got you.

151
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
恩 我正在查案
Yeah, I'm in the middle of an investigation.

152
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,340
喔 不好意思 就占用你一会儿时间
Oh. I'm sorry. This'll really just take a second.

153
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,490
看 我 我知道这个也许有些莫名其妙
Look, I-I know this might seem a little bit out of nowhere,

154
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,040
但今晚你能过来和我一起吃个饭吗
but could you come over for dinner tonight?

155
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,200
恩 好的 出了什么事儿吗
Yeah, sure. Is there a problem?

156
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,110
没有 什么事儿也没有
No, not... not at all.

157
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,000
我只是觉得 如果我们能谈谈的话是很好的
I just thought it would be nice if we could talk.

158
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,720
恩 什么时候
Okay. What time?

159
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,400
- 大约八点钟  - 好的
- Around 8:00? - All right.

160
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
八点见
8:00. I'll see you then.

161
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
好 等会儿见
Great. I will see you then.

162
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,010
你和Juliette有事情
You doing something with Juliette?

163
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,260
恩 我们要一起吃个晚饭
Yeah, I guess we're having dinner.

164
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,760
怎么 情况变得越来越好了
What, things are getting better?

165
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,520
我完全不知道
If they are, nobody told me.

166
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,680
Nick 走吧
Nick.

167
00:08:58,515 --> 00:08:58,890
Nick
Nick.

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,660
- 嗯  - 我们走吧
- Yeah? - Let's go.

169
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,500
今天要去做物理治疗
I got a date with physical therapy.

170
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,340
稍后我再和你联系
I'll check with you after.

171
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,280
那个是Anton
Is that Anton?

172
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,220
恩
Yeah.

173
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,060
我没太看清他
I didn't get a very good look at him,

174
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,095
但是这已经相当接近他跑之前我所看的样子了
but this is pretty much what I saw before he ran.

175
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,395
恩 真希望我们能把它贴到全境通告上
Yeah, wish we could put that on an APB.

176
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,110
我不知道有没有用
I'm not sure that would help.

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,520
替我向Juliette问好
Say hi to Juliette.

178
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,800
祝你晚饭吃的顺利
Hope dinner goes well.

179
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,200
恩 我也想
Yeah, me too.

180
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:02,725
嗨 警探
Hey, Detective.

181
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,190
- 有什么情况吗  - 没有
- Any problems? - No.

182
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,290
她在里边 没有人进入 也没有人出来
She's inside. Nobody in, nobody out.

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,560
- 谁  - 我是Burkhardt警探
- Who is it? - It's Detective Burkhardt.

184
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,600
没事儿 你可以打开门
It's okay. You can open the door.

185
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,640
不好意思打扰你
Sorry to bother you.

186
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,120
只是需要做些后续调查
Just needed to do a little follow-up.

187
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,500
进来吧
Come on in.

188
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,380
让我先穿上些衣服
Let me just go put some clothes on.

189
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,560
- 晚上好  - 嗨 Monroe 我是Juliette
- Good evening. - Hey, Monroe, it's Juliette.

190
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,780
Juliette 你还好吗
Juliette! How are ya?

191
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,380
相当好 正在做晚餐
Pretty good. Just making a little dinner.

192
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,280
真巧 我也是
Yeah, me too.

193
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,810
听着 我打电话的目的是想在Nick来之前跟你聊一聊
Listen, the reason I'm calling is I wanted to talk to you before Nick got here.

194
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,720
Nick要去你那儿
Nick's coming over to your place?

195
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,480
- 是啊 我正在做晚饭  - 等会儿
- Yeah, I'm making his dinner. - Hold on.

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,840
你正在做你们俩的晚饭
You're making dinner for you and Nick?

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,310
是的
Yeah.

198
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
我 你知道的 我想要跟他谈谈
I, you know, I wanted to talk to him

199
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
关于最近发生的一些事情
about some of the things that have been happening lately.

200
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,100
我觉得晚饭会是
And I thought dinner would be...

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,080
那不是很重要
well, that's not important.

202
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,410
但在他到之前
But before he gets here, I...

203
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,160
我只想知道他是否跟你谈过我们之间的关系
I just wanted to know if he has said anything to you about our relationship or...

204
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,010
- 你和我  - 不 我和Nick之间的关系
- Yours and mine? - No, me and Nick.

205
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,795
我只是 我只是有点紧张
I'm just a... I'm a little nervous.

206
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,920
我希望能知道他是怎么想的
I wish I knew how he felt.

207
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,220
这个嘛 他一直在盼着这样的事情发生
Well, he's been waiting for something like this for kind of a long time.

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,300
所以我猜你只好
So I guess you're just gonna have to, you know,

209
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,960
静下心来 看看接下来会发生什么
get into it and see where it goes.

210
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,260
恩 你是对的 你是对的
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,640
多谢 这正是我需要听到的话
Thank you... that's exactly what I needed to hear.

212
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,095
- 多谢了 Monroe  - 祝你好运
- Thanks, Monroe. - Good luck.

213
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,140
多谢 拜
Thanks. Bye.

214
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,920
不好意思让你久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

215
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,260
你想跟我谈些什么
What was it you wanted to talk to me about?

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
我们还没有找到Anton
We haven't found Anton yet.

217
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,900
那他还活着
Then he's still alive.

218
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,440
我们必须假定这种情况继续追查下去
We have to proceed as if he is.

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,750
你不必亲自过来通知我
You didn't have to come all the way here to tell me that...

220
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,720
你本可以就打个电话
you could've just called.

221
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
我不是为这事儿才来的
That's not why I'm here.

222
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,000
你以前看过这个吗
You ever seen this?

223
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,580
呃 没有
Uh, no.

224
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,300
那是Anton的作品 我知道的
That's Anton's work. I know that.

225
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,895
看起来Anton已经计划很久了
It seems as though Anton has been planning this for a long time.

226
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,610
我们在他的阁楼里找到的
We found this in his loft.

227
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,710
你上次去那里是什么时候
When was the last time you were there?

228
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
几个月前
Couple of months ago.

229
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,810
他为你画了许多张画
You were the subject of a number of his paintings.

230
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,320
- 你做他的模特  - 是的
- Do you model for him? - Yes.

231
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,540
但是我也为其他人做过
But I've done that for others.

232
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,000
要不这些艺术品是怎么来的
That's how I get all this artwork.

233
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,590
我可负担不起
I never could've afforded it otherwise.

234
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,500
所以你迷恋艺术家
So you have a thing for artists?

235
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
我只是迷恋那些视野独特的人
I have a thing for people who see the world differently.

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,980
我启发他们
I inspire them.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,560
是吗 怎么启发
Yeah? How?

238
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,540
这很难用语言来言明
It's kind of hard to explain.

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,740
你可以试着解释看看
Well, why don't you try?

240
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,040
好吧
Okay.

241
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,320
就是这么开始的
That's how it starts,

242
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,860
但不是这样结束的
but it's never how it ends.

243
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,100
就那么 发生了些事情
It's just... Something that happens.

244
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
是不可抑制的
It's not something that can be controlled.

245
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,380
也是不该被抑制的
It's not something that should be controlled.

246
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,140
我从没勉强过他们
I never force myself on them.

247
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,680
他们想要我 也需要我
They want me, And they need me.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,160
可是却总没有善终
That doesn't always end well.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,160
嗯 很多伟大的艺术家都英年早逝 而且有暴力倾向 近乎疯狂
Mm, a lot of the great artists died young and violently, half-mad.

250
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,290
但我想他们任何一个人也不会想用盛名来换取完整而乏味的一生
But I doubt that any of them would trade their fame for banality and a longer life.

251
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,920
那你怎么来做出选择
So how do you choose them?

252
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
我想是靠天赋
I guess it's a talent,

253
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,290
内心的驱使 激情
a drive, passion,

254
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,260
就像我从你身上感受到的一样
like what I sense in you.

255
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,160
我不是个艺术家
I'm not an artist.

256
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,560
也许只是你还没发现罢了
Maybe you just don't know it yet.

257
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,500
你浑身散发着某种强大的力量
There's something that's just deeply powerful about you.

258
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,140
我不知道那是什么 但我被深深的吸引住了
I don't know what it is, but I'm drawn to it.

259
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
你怕了吗
Does that scare you?

260
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,380
- 应该如此吗  - 只有你能回答
- Should it? - Only you can answer that.

261
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,080
什么让你感到害怕
What scares you?

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,480
你留下后可能发生的事
What might happen if you stay.

263
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
我不该这么做
I shouldn't have done that.

264
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,080
- 我不会伤害你的  - 我知道你是什么
- I'm not gonna hurt you. - I know what you are.

265
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,070
听着 这只是个错误 好吗
Look, it was a mistake, okay?

266
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,225
- 你得赶紧离开  - Khloe 我是来帮你的
- You need to go. - Khloe, I'm here to help you.

267
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,600
你不用感到害怕
You don't have to be afraid of me.

268
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,300
我是Burkhardt
Burkhardt.

269
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,600
你要和Juliette一起吃晚饭
So you're having dinner with Juliette?

270
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
- Monroe  - 是的
- Monroe? - Yep.

271
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,010
两块解冻的高级素牛排
With two defrosted primo veggie steaks.

272
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,920
想起什么了吗
Ring a dinner bell?

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,520
喔 天哪
Oh, my God.

274
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,960
我该去Juliette那儿的
I'm supposed to be at Juliette's.

275
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,300
恩 她打过电话了
Yeah. She called.

276
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,600
那时我就开始怀疑你不会来了
That's when I began to suspect you might not be showing up,

277
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,740
除非你计划吃两顿晚饭
unless you're planning on having two dinners tonight.

278
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,800
我正在查案
I'm in the middle of an investigation right now.

279
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,590
- 我会给你打回去的  - 好吧
- I'll call you back. -  All right.

280
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,880
我得走了
I have to go.

281
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
我走之后锁好门
Lock the door behind me.

282
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,740
对不起 我迟到了
Sorry, I'm late.

283
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,740
我正有些担心呢
I was getting a little worried,

284
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,040
我想也许你改主意了
I thought maybe you changed your mind.

285
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,740
没有 只是被一件案子拖住了
No, just got held up on a case.

286
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,520
没事儿 嗯 你来了我就很高兴了
That's okay. Um, I'm just glad you're here.

287
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,540
快进来
Come in.

288
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,410
这地方看着不错
The place looks great.

289
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,990
我什么都没有动过
I didn't change anything.

290
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,250
晚饭有点凉了
Um, look, dinner's a little cold,

291
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,060
我去加热一下
so why don't I warm it up?

292
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,100
那么
So...

293
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,600
你想跟我谈什么
What did you want to talk to me about?

294
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,510
喔 直奔主题 好
Oh. Right to the point. Okay.

295
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:50,105
呃 我想也应该开门见山
Um, I guess no reason not to.

296
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,400
如果要不是你的话
If it hadn't been for you...

297
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,705
我的记忆越来越清晰了
Well, things are starting to get clearer for me.

298
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:57,315
"清晰" 也许不是最合适的词 不管了
"Clearer" Might not be the best word for it, whatever it is.

299
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,590
我知道我这几个礼拜对你很不好
You know, I know that I've been treating you unfairly these last few weeks,

300
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,620
我只想说声抱歉
and I just want to say I'm sorry.

301
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,680
Nick
Nick?

302
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
我猜是天赋
I guess it's a talent,

303
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,440
内心的驱使 激情
a drive, a passion.

304
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,840
- 就像我从你身上感受到的一样  - Nick 怎么了
- Like what I sense in you... - Nick?

305
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,320
啊
Yeah?

306
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,260
我正试着道歉
I'm trying to apologize.

307
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,660
为什么
For what?

308
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,405
为之前我们之间发生的那些事
For how things have been going between us,

309
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,380
还有 为我对你的方式道歉
and... How I've been treating you.

310
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
我想我可能是疯了
I thought I was losing my mind.

311
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,640
无论从哪点来看 我绝对是不太正常
You know, for all intents and purposes, I was losing my mind.

312
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,740
但也许这点儿代价是值得的
But maybe that's what it took,

313
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,805
因为关于你的记忆我开始想起来了
because my memories of you are coming back.

314
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,360
Nick
Nick.

315
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,395
- 也许不完整  - Nick
- Maybe not neatly... - Nick.

316
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,520
也没有逻辑性 但是我想让你知道 我开始记起你了
Or logically, but I do want you to know that I'm starting to remember you

317
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,560
还有那些我们做过的事儿以及我的感觉
and things that we did together and things I felt.

318
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,720
听着 我知道这很
Look, I-I know it's a lot of...

319
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,990
在我们经历过这么多事情之后
after everything we've been through...

320
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,405
对我来说真的太多了
Really a lot for me.

321
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,705
你难道不想说些什么吗
Don't you want to say anything?

322
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,020
Nick
Nick.

323
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:22,395
你听到我刚才说什么了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

324
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,615
不好意思 什么
I'm sorry. What?

325
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:31,905
听着 今晚我觉得有点累了
Look, I-I'm feeling a little off tonight.

326
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:38,610
我想 工作可能有点让我烦心了
I, uh, think work might be starting to get to me a little.

327
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,100
好 也许这不是个好时候
Okay, m-maybe this just wasn't a good time.

328
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,300
恩 也许你是对的
Yeah, you're probably right.

329
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,410
谢谢你理解
Thanks.

330
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,110
我们之后再谈吧
Let's talk soon.

331
00:18:58,005 --> 00:18:58,785
Nick
Nick?

332
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,095
你已经回来了
You home already?

333
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,590
- 是的  - 喔 老兄
- Yeah. - Oh, man.

334
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,500
你可别是为了第二顿晚饭才回来这么早
I hope you didn't come for a second dinner.

335
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,905
我只是在开玩笑
You know, I was just joking about that.

336
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,105
我 呃 我把两块素牛排都吃了
And I, um... I kinda ate both veggie steaks.

337
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,900
进行的如何
So how'd it go?

338
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,080
我是说 她说得好像这顿饭挺重要似的
I mean, she made it sound like this is gonna be sort of an important dinner.

339
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,010
- 我们没有吃成  - 怎么这样
- We didn't eat. - Ooh.

340
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,440
你为了吃晚饭去了她家 但你们却没吃
You went over to her house for dinner, and you didn't eat.

341
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
你们一定谈了好多吧
You must've had a lot to talk about.

342
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,540
那倒没有
Not really.

343
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,880
好吧 我只想说 "怎么会"
Well, let me just say, "Huh."

344
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,000
这本该是个重要的时刻
It was supposed to be the big moment, you know?

345
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,790
她记起了你
She's remembering you.

346
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,110
她邀请你去谈一谈
She invites you over to talk.

347
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,220
你想要怎样
Wha... What do you want?

348
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,860
这跟我想要什么没关系
It's not about me wanting anything.

349
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,940
- 我只是试着去 就是 去支持你  - 为什么
- I'm just trying to be, you know, supportive. - Why?

350
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,160
我是说 我的个人生活对你来说这么有趣吗
I mean, does my personal life interest you that much?

351
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,080
你再说一遍
Excuse me?

352
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,300
听着 我们没吃饭 也没谈什么
Look...We didn't eat, and we didn't talk.

353
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,000
你还需要知道什么
What more do you need to know?

354
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,000
我不需要知道任何事
I don't need to know anything

355
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,600
除了为什么你今天这个样子
except why are you acting like this?

356
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,340
听着 我不明白你说什么
Look, I don't understand this.

357
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,880
我回家的时候不想被盘问
I don't need to be grilled when I get home.

358
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,460
- 你知道吗 我在工作的时候已经够累了  - 被盘问
- You know, I do enough of that at work. - Grilled?

359
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,020
你这么想的吗
Is that what you think I'm doing?

360
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,705
几个小时以前
Let me just say a couple of hours ago,

361
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,280
我确实在弄烧烤 或者该说在用烤箱
I was indeed doing some grilling or... broiling actually,

361
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,280
{\a6}Grill有烧烤及盘问之意
至于grill是下方加热 像平常烤肉 broil则是上方直接加热 美国烤箱有这种功能

362
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,810
- 为了你说过你要来的晚饭  - 哦 天哪 你想让我
- for a dinner you committed to. - Oh, my God, do you want me

363
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,110
把晚饭的钱给你吗
to pay you for the veggie steaks?

364
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,540
不 我不想
No, I don't want you to...

365
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,340
这不是重点
that is so beside the point.

366
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,900
几个月来 你一直渴望Juliette能记得你
For months, you have been dying for Juliette to remember you.

367
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,980
现在 她终于记得了 但你却
And now, she finally does, and you don't even...

368
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,340
我是说 如果我有些困惑请原谅我
I mean, forgive me if I'm a little flummoxed.

369
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,800
怎么 你 你不说了
What, you're... you're done talking now?

370
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,700
你这就 你这就去睡觉
You're just... you know, you're gonna go to bed, or...

371
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,020
好吧 直接走了
Oh, you're leaving.

372
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,240
真行 你要去哪儿
That's interesting. Where are you going?

373
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:47,800
也许你该好好关注自己的生活了
You might wanna start looking into getting your own life.

374
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,660
你才是该好好想想怎么把自己房子拿回来
I think you need to start looking into getting your own house.

375
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,500
- 哈罗  - 和我实话实说吧
- Hello? - Just be honest with me.

376
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,120
- Nick恨我吗  - 呃 我也不确定
- Does Nick hate me?  - I, um, don't know, actually.

377
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,500
我是说 他刚来过 紧接着就离开了
I mean, he just got here, and then he left.

378
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,200
而且他心情不太好
And he wasn't in a very good mood.

379
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,940
他去你那里的时候发生了什么
What happened when he came over to your place?

380
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,980
我做了晚餐 然后就开始聊天
I made us dinner. And then, I started talking.

381
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,000
突然 一切好像都变了
And then, everything just sort of fell apart.

382
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,140
后来他就走了
And then he just left.

383
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,580
也许是工作上的事情
Maybe something's going on at work.

384
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
不知道 让我打给Hank问问
I don't know. Let me call Hank.

385
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,920
- 我会再打给你  - 好
- I'll call you back. - Okay.

386
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,980
- Griffin  - 嗨 Hank 我是Monroe
- Griffin. - Hey, Hank, it's Monroe.

387
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,740
Nick在工作中有遇到什么事吗
Is something going on with Nick at work?

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,700
怎么了
Why?

389
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,040
你知道他应该去Juliette家吃晚餐吗
You know he was supposed to have dinner at Juliette's?

390
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,400
- 他没去吗  - 去了
- Didn't he? - No.

391
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,880
然后他又来过我这儿
And then he comes over here,

392
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,780
我问他饭吃的咋样
and I, like, asked him how it went.

393
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,460
他却叫我自己管好自己 然后就走了
And he tells me to get a life, and then he leaves.

394
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,480
听起来不像他的作风
That doesn't sound like him.

395
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,000
他对我是什么都没说
I mean, he hasn't said anything to me.

396
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,280
或许他身上发生了些我们不知道的事
I mean, maybe he's got something going on we don't know about.

397
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,600
让我看看我能查出点什么
Let me see what I can find out.

398
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,060
啥事
Yeah?

399
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,260
我刚回到警局
Hey, I just got back to the precinct.

400
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,200
- 你在哪  - Bent Brick餐厅
- Where are you? - Down at the Bent Brick.

401
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,960
做点儿医生不让做的事儿
Just what the doctor didn't order.

402
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,180
我马上到 帮我留杯啤酒
I'm on my way. Save me a beer.

403
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,340
你见过这个吗
You saw one of those?

404
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,140
啥时候
When?

405
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,340
- 几小时以前  - 有什么要告诉我的吗
- A few hours ago. - Something I should know about?

406
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,920
我不知道她是谁
I don't know what she is.

407
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,200

Are you someone that I should know? I bet you are.

413

Dude, my girlfriend freaks out about Sci-Fi stuff.

414

She loves it. Let me see it...

415
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,520
嘿 别惹我

She's right over here. It's not even gonna get damaged.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

421
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,280

Let's not make a mistake here.

422
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,640
请冷静
Now, just calm down.

423
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,460
我 我很冷静

424
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,680
那家伙刚刚无缘无故打我
That guy just punched me for no reason.

425
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,380
Nick 要不你先回家吧
Hey, Nick, why don't you just head outta here, go on home?

426
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,320
这里我来处理
I got this.

427
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,240
呃 你想让他就这样溜掉吗
Okay, what, you're just gonna let him go?

428
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,920
你就这样让他走了 你可是个警察啊
You let him just walk out? You're just... you're a cop.

429
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,260
你就应该负责抓坏人什么的
You're supposed to arrest people.

430
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
你已经有点失控了
And you've had a little bit more than you can handle.

431
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,900
除非你想在醉汉拘留所里呆上一晚
Unless you wanna spend a night in a drunk tank,

432
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,560
你还是乖乖坐下 保持安静吧
I suggest you sit down and shut up.

433
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,580
- 我从没见过  -我也没
- I've never seen one. - Me neither.

434
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,360
Nick真的为了这画在酒吧里打了人吗
Nick really hit somebody in a bar over this?

435
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,420
我也不敢相信
I didn't believe it, either.

436
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,100
我是说 那人喝醉了
I mean, the guy was drunk.

437
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
Nick让他滚开
And Nick told him to back off,

438
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,920
但这还是有点过分
but still, it was a little over the top.

439
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,960
他在这里也是 那么过分
That's the way he was here... over the top.

440
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,640
那如果你俩都不知道这是什么
So if neither of you know what this is,

441
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,060
我们怎么知道我们要对付啥东西
how do we find out what we're dealing with?

442
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:05,940
什么
What?

443
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,600
这就是Marie姑妈的拖车啊
So this is Aunt Marie's trailer.

444
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,940
嗯 就是这个
Yep. This is it.

445
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,900
哇
Wow.

446
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,540
这些可是很稀有的东西
Wow, this is some really rare stuff.

447
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,320
是啊 这的确有很多稀有货
Yeah, there's some pretty rare stuff in here,

448
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,960
但我们得先研究这些
but we need to begin with these.

449
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,880
这些书都在这里啊
This is where the books come from.

450

还有其它东西
Among other things.

451
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,640
这真是一个名副其实的"格林生物学"研究博物馆
Yeah, it's a veritable museum of wesen-ology,

452
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,320
记载着格林们捕杀我们这些人
chronicling the grimms proud tradition

453
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,300
的骄傲历史
of hunting and beheading people like us.

454
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,020
哦
Oh.

455

Nice to know.

So we're looking for...

457
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,980
长这样的人
Somebody who looks like this.

458
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,780

00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,420
总有解药的吧 对吗
There's gotta be something, right?

544
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,380
哦 等一下
Oh, wait, wait.

545
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,680
呃 没有
Mm. Nothing.

546
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,040
那咋办 传说中的死亡之吻
So what? It's the proverbial kiss of death?

547
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,120
强烈的欲望可能和爱相混淆
Obsessive desire can be confused with love.

548
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,280
不管这是什么 这不是爱
Whatever this is, it ain't love.

549
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,780
的确不是 但感觉上也许很像
No, but it probably feels like it.

550
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,700
我觉得能打破这种情感的唯一手段
I think the only way to break an obsession like this

551
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,860
可能是真正的爱
is with the real thing.

552
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,320
- Juliette  - 哦 嗨
- Juliette. - Oh, hey.

553
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
我就觉得我能在这找到你们
I was hoping I would find you here.

554
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,660
嘿 怎么了
Hey, what's wrong?

555
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,780
我得回到那个拖车里
I need to go back to the trailer.

556
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,600
不是吧 又是拖车
Really? The trailer again?

557
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,740
在发生了上次的事之后
After what happened the last time,

558
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,040
你觉得这是个好主意
you sure that's such a good idea?

559
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,880
无论是好是坏 我都必须去
Good or not, I-I need to go.

560
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,360
好吧 呃
Okay. Um...

561
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,460
我们现在有点忙 但我可以
Um, we're sort of busy right now, but I could...

562
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:15,940
不
No.

563
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,680
- 什么不  - 我要钥匙就行了 Monroe
- No? - I just need the key, Monroe.

564
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,580
我得自己去
I need to go alone.

565
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,020
不管那晚上Nick带我去的时候发生了什么
Whatever happened the night that Nick brought me there

566
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,980
显然那非常重要
is clearly really important.

567
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,300
为了让我能理解
And in order for me to understand

568
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,380
现在发生了什么 我必须试着去
what's going on right now, I have to try to reconnect

569
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,440
想起当时发生的事
with what happened then.

570
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,940
她是对的 你应该让她去
She's right. You should let her.

571
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,740
好吧 我想
Uh, well, I think...

572
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,640
我应该让她去
I should let her too.

573
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:47,820
好的
Okay.

574
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,820
祝我好运 算了
Wish me luck, or... Whatever.

575
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,500
凶手可能是个神经病
Our killer might be a psychopath and all that,

576
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,020
我可不是什么粉丝
and I'm not saying I'm a fan or anything,

577
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,400
但你不得不说这家伙还挺有创意的
but you gotta give him some credit.

578
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,280
- Anton很厉害嘛  - 没人看见他画这个吗
- Anton's got an eye. - No one saw him do this?

579
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,520
- 在凌晨两点可没什么人  - 就算有人看见
- Not at 2:00 in the morning. - Well, even if they did,

580
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,820
波特兰也不是完全没有街头艺术嘛
street art is not exactly unheard of in Portland.

581
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,640
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

582
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,380
Nick
Nick!

583
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,800
- 嘿 我没法追上他  - 好吧 我去追
- Hey, I can't run him down. - Okay, I'm on it.

584
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,600
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

585
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,380
Nick画的
Nick drew it.

586
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,020
好的 我记得你告诉过我
Okay, I remember you told me

587
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,040
你能做的某些事
about something you could do,

588
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,780
你拥有的某种能力
some kind of ability that you had.

589
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,300
拜托 让我记起来
Come on, memory.

590
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,460
我知道和这些书有关
I know it had something to do with these books,

591
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,800
这些
these...

592
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,480
来自这些
From the...

593
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,920
诡异 十分诡异的画里
Weird, weird drawings.

594
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,840
你告诉我什么来着
What did you tell me?

595
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,840
你说了什么来着
What did you say to me?

596
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,620
加把劲啊 Nick
Come on, Nick.

597
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,140
请帮帮我 我在努力
Please help me. I'm trying.

598
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,340
我真的在拚命努力
I am... I'm really trying here.

599
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,000
看到这些书了吗
You see these books? You see these books?

600
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,420
看到这些书了吗
You see these books?

601
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,760
书里面是我的祖先所绘的图画
They're filled with drawings made by my ancestors

602
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,280
还有其他具有同样的能力问题的人
and others who had the same ability problem,

603
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,220
随便你怎么叫
whatever you wanna call it.

604
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,680
画上的生物是格林生物
And the drawings are of wesen,

605
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,980
他们喜欢这样称呼自己
which is how they like to refer to themselves.

606
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,760
我能看见他们
And that's what I can see,

607
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,900
格林也能
what the Grimms can see.

608
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,480
他们是存在于我们之中的物种
They're like species that exist within us.

609
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,920
呃 一部分人
Well, some of us.

610
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,140
总之 这里有狼人
Anyway, there are Blutbaden...

611
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,320
农夫猪
and Bauerschwein...

612
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,680
狐妖 和海狸怪 都在这本书里
Fuchsbaus and Eisbibers, and they're all in these books.

613
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,060
Juliette 说真的 我可不是在胡编乱造
Juliette, really, I am not making this up.

614
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,920
真的 我没骗你
Really, I am not making this up.

615
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,680
Griffin警探
Detective Griffin.

616
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,080
Hank 这是Rosalee和Monroe
Hank? It's Rosalee and Monroe.

617
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,880
- Nick和你在一起吗  - 没有啊
- Is Nick with you? - No.

618
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,900
- 我还指望他和你在一起呢  - 没 他不在警局里
- I was hoping he was with you. - No, he's not at the precinct.

619
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,120
Hank 听着 我们找到了更多关于穆赛的信息
Hank, listen, we found out more about the Musai.

620
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,620
如果她和Nick之间的联系已经建立
There's no way we can break the connection

621
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,980
那就没有办法断开了
between her and Nick if it's already been established,

622
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,540
至少我无能为力
at least not with anything I can do.

623
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,880
而且Nick失踪了
And Nick is in the wind.

624
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,240
不 他会去她所在的地方
No, he's gonna be going wherever she is.

625
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
如果他们在一起 情况只会变得更糟
And it'll only get worse if they're together.

626
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,000
那如果找到他们 我们该怎么做
So what do we do when we find them?

627
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,740
让他远离她 直到我们找出办法为止
Keep him away from her until we can figure out what to do.

628
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,260
- 队长  - 嗯 你找到他了
- Captain. - Yeah, you find him?

629
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,360
还没 是Monroe的电话
No. It's Monroe.

630
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,700
他认为Nick会跟随她而去
He thinks Nick will be going to her.

631
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,680
好的 打电话给
All right, call the officer

632
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,960
保护她的警员 我马上过去
protecting her house. I'm going over there.

633
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,840
我回头打给你
I'll call you back.

634
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,460
你还好吗
Are you okay?

635
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,440
我不知道 我感觉 奇怪
I don't know. I feel... Different.

636
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,200
那些我所见的东西和我所记得的事情
The things that I saw and the things that I remembered...

637
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
那你记起他带你过去的
So you remembered what happened

638
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,280
那天晚上发生的事情了
the night he took you there?

639
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,820
应该是的 当时我并不相信他
I think so. I didn't believe him.

640
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,040
我是说 他告诉了我所有的事情 但我仍然没相信他
I mean, he told me everything, but I didn't believe him.

641
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
那现在呢
And what about now?

642
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,640
你相信Nick 不是吗
You believe Nick, don't you?

643
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,920
你也是
And so do you.

644
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,340
我们都相信他
We do.

645
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,960
呃 因为当时 我觉得他疯了
Yeah, 'cause I just... I thought he was crazy.

646
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,420
当你了解之后 某些看似疯狂的事情
Some things aren't as crazy as they seem

647
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,960
其实并没有那么疯狂
when you kind of get to know them.

648
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,940
我得见他
I need to see him.

649
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,660
我要告诉他 我相信他
I need to tell him that I believe him.

650
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,860
他在哪
What... where is he?

651
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,320
呃
Uh...

652
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,180
Gates警员
Officer Gates.

653
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,380
我是Griffin警探
This is Detective Griffin.

654
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,220
我估计Burkhardt警探会出现在那边
I'm expecting Detective Burkhardt to show up there.

655
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,700
他一旦出现就通知我
Let me know as soon as he does.

656
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,980
他刚从我身边走过 朝着目标的房子过去了
He just walked past me heading for the subject's house.

657
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,520
队长已经在路上了 不要让Burkhardt警探离开
Captain's on his way. Do not let Detective Burkhardt leave.

658
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,180
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

659
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,480
我想要你
I need you.

660
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,020
你是个格林
You're a Grimm.

661
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,340
这无所谓
It doesn't matter.

662
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
你必须证明你自己
You have to prove it.

663
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,740
Anton在这里
Anton's here.

664
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:14,880
哪里
Where?

665
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,380
她是我的
She's mine!

666
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,760
我不能
I can't...

667
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,300
只要他活着就不行
Not as long as he's alive.

668
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:03,880
别打了
Let's go.

669
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,920
不 Khloe
No. Khloe...

670
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,480
- 长官 他已经被铐上了  - Nick
- Sir, he's handcuffed. - Nick!

671
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,160
- 她是我的  - 够了 别乱来
- She's mine! - Come on, that's enough!

672
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,860
- 我们抓到他了  - 你不能拥有她
- We got him.  - You can't have her.

673
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,520
你永远不会拥有她
You'll never have her!

674
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,740
- 永远  - 够了
- Never! - That's enough!

675
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
你觉得你能拥有她
You think you can have her?

676
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
没人能做到
No one can!

677
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,280
那么 长话短说 看来
So, long story short, it would seem

678
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,080
Nick看起来不像他平时那样
that the reason Nick hasn't been himself

679
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,020
对你 或者我 对我们所有人 是因为
with you or me or... or any of us is because...

680
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,020
呃 是因为他受到了
Well, because he's sort of been...

681
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,420
受到了另一个女人的影响
Under the influence of another woman.

682
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,880
但这 这不能算是他的错
But it's... it's not necssarily his fault.

683
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,760
她是 呃
She's, well...

684
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,240
- 她是  - 格林生物吗
- She's... - Wesen?

685
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,060
啥 Nick去年就试着告诉我这件事了
What? That's what Nick was trying to tell me last year.

686
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,360
是的
Yes.

687
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,640
而且我们觉得他现在可能有大麻烦了
And we think he could be in a lot of trouble right now.

688
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,700
这和我身上发生的事情很像吗
Is this anything like what happened to me?

689
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:02,920
是有点像
It is...

690
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,600
只是这次没有现成的解药
Except the antidote's not on the shelf.

691
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,100
那解药在哪
Where is it?

692
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,340
解药是你
It's you.

693
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,180
- 我们知道你是什么  - 真的吗
- We know what you are. - Really?

694
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,180
- 那我到底是什么  - 穆赛
- And what would that be? - Musai.

695
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,460
好吧 既然你知道这个 那你也会知道
Well, if you know that,

696
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,920
那不是我所能控制的
then you know that it's out of my control.

697
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
我并没有要他迷恋我
I don't ask for the attention that men give me.

698
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,280
看起来你也不是很想拒绝啊
You don't try very hard to refuse it.

699
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,500
呃 我为什么要拒绝呢 没有了我
Well, why would I? Without me,

700
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,840
- 他们就什么也不是  - 没有你 他们才能活命
- they would be nothing. - Without you, they'd be alive.

701
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,680
不管你对我的警探做了什么 都必须停止
Whatever you've done to my Detective, it's gonna stop.

702
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,840
我无能为力 我生来就是这样
Well, I can't help it. I was born this way.

703
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,320
你看 你警探的真正问题
You see, the real problem

704
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,680
在于他是个格林
with your Detective is that he's a Grimm.

705
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,040
一切都因为他的身份而发展的更加迅速
And it's all happening much faster because of who he is.

706
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,180
Nick拥有我从没体验过的能量
Nick has more power than I've ever experienced,

707
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,000
而我和他很般配
and I'm good for him.

708
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,000
你必须立刻停止这一切
You're gonna stop this right now.

709
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,740
我从没学会如何停止
I've never known how to stop it.

710
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,180
长官 你之前说嫌犯被收押的时候要通知你
Sir, you wanted to know when the suspect had been booked?

711
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,440
他现在就在牢房里
He's in his cell.

712
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,220
我不能
I can't...

713
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
只要他活着就不行
Not as long as he's alive.

714
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,540
你必须证明你自己
You have to prove it.

715
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,240
Anton在这里
Anton's here.

716
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,880
她没有给我们太多选择
She didn't give us many options.

717
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,300
是啊 是啊 有一件事可以肯定
Yeah, yeah, one thing's for sure:

718
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,440
我们不能让他接近她
We can't let her anywhere near him.

719
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,900
哦 那我们怎么做 把他锁起来吗
Oh, what do we do? Lock him up?

720
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,360
必要时可以 他现在在哪
If we have to. Where is he now?

721
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,760
嘿 看这个
Hey, look at this.

722
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,540
嘿
Hey.

723
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,100
有人知道Nick在哪里吗
Anybody know where Nick is?

724
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,880
在你内心深处
There's something that's just

725
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,040
有一股强大的力量
deeply powerful about you.

726
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,040
这种力量无法被控制
It's not something that can be controlled.

727
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,560
- Nick 不要  - 我不能
- Don't! Nick...  - I can't.

728
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,280
Nick 你要是开枪那我可罩不住你了
Nick, I can't protect you from this.

729
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,260
- Nick 停下 请听我说  - 只要他活着就不行
- Nick, stop. Please listen.  - Not as long as he's alive.

730
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,500
- Juliette 在这里  - 你怕了吗
- Juliette is here.  - Does that scare you?

731
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,160
看着我
Look at me.

732
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,960
我对眼光独特的人有感觉
I have a thing for people who see the world differently.

733
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,500
想想你现在在做什么
Think about what you're doing.

734
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,720
嗯 很多伟大的艺术家都英年早逝
Mm, a lot of the great artists died young

735
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,520
而且有暴力倾向 近乎疯狂
and violently, half-mad.

736
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,420
但我不认为他们之中的任何人会愿意
But I doubt that any of them would trade their fame

737
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,640
用他们的盛名换取完整而乏味的一生
for banality and a longer life.

738
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,500
请看着我
Please just look at me.

739
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,560
我从没强迫过别人
I never force myself on them.

740
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,160
我启发他们
I inspire them.

741
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,340
Nick 看着我
Nick, look at me!

742
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,540
- 呃啊  - 睁开眼睛
- Uhh! - Open your eyes.

743
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,120
你得看着我 Nick 睁开眼睛
You have to see me, Nick. Open your eyes.

744
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:22,680
Juliette
Juliette.

745
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,860
是我
Yeah.

746
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,340
你在这里干啥
What are you doing here?

747
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,920
我是为你而来 正如你曾经陪着我一样
I'm here for you, just like you were there for me.

748
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,140
谢谢
Thank you.

749
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,240
谢谢
Thank you.

750
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,040
你还想干啥
Really?

751
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,320
好吧 今天算你走运
Well, this is your lucky day.

752
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,320
我会放了你
I'm gonna let you walk.

753
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,320
你一旦出去
And when you do,

754
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,000
就得远离波特兰 并且永远不准回来
you're gonna leave Portland and never come back.

755
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,380
因为如果你回来了
Because if you do,

756
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,940
我的另一面可不是个警察
there's a part of me that doesn't wear a badge.

757
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,100
而且谁都不知道他会做出什么事
And there's no telling what he'll do.
