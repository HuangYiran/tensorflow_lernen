1
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:06,422
Sheppard呼叫Atlantis
Atlantis,this is sheppard.

2
00:00:06,422 --> 00:00:07,881
我正在接近星门
I'm on approach to the gate.

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,758
收到
Acknowledged.

4
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:12,469
自从我到飞马系以来 我在 嗯...
Since I've been in pegasus,I have set up,like,what,

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:14,847
好几个星球上建立了研究站
half a dozen research stations on various planets?

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:20,310
可我从没有见过你主动要去补给的
And I don't remember you ever volunteering to run a resupply mission to any of them.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,854
我可是个大忙人 Rodney
I'm a busy man, Rodney.

8
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,605
我只是刚好有点时间
I just happen to have a little free time.

9
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:28,610
而Mackenzie博士碰巧又在研究
一个住在热带天堂里的原始部落
And Dr.Mackenzie just happens to be studying a primitive tribe that lives in a tropical paradise,

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,778
他怎么说的来着?
and has-- how did he put it?

11
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,239
未谙羞耻为何物?
Little or no social inhibitions?

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,825
他们很友好
Well,they were very friendly.

13
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,370
怎么搞的?
What the hell?

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,372
怎么了?
What is it?

15
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,127
我想刚刚有人打了我一枪
I think somebody just took a shot at me.

16
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:47,045
有敌情 他们正在快速接近
I've got contact.They're closing fast.

17
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:48,589
是Wraith吗?
Was it wraith?

18
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:51,341
应该不是 但...
I don't think so,but--

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,928
不管他们拿什么打我的
那东西把我的系统短路了
Whatever they're shooting me with just shorted my systems.

20
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:58,056
我没法启动武器
I can't get weapons online.

21
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,355
你能回到星门吗?
Can you make it back to the gate?

22
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,732
Sheppard!
Sheppard!

23
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,026
Sheppard!
Sheppard!

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,028
Rodney?
Rodney?

25
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,864
Mckay?
Mckay?

26
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:57,282
<font color=#38B0DE>Stargate Atlantis
第4季 第5集</font>
<font color=#38B0DE>Stargate Atlantis
Season 4 Episode 05</font>

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,821
<font color="#ffff00">旅行者</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Travelers</font>

28
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,615
船很不错
Nice ship.

29
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,367
就是有点...
A little bit of a...

30
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:44,830
有点需要修修了 但是很有潜质
(fixer-upper只翻修以后还有价值的房子)
Little bit of a fixer-upper,but I can see the potential.

31
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:53,297
我不是说大规模的
I'm not talking about anything drastic,you know.

32
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:57,301
也许只要刷刷漆
放两个抱枕作装饰
Maybe just a paint job,some throw pillows.

33
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,560
我想你们不打算告诉我
这是怎么回事吧?
Look,I don't suppose you want to tell me what's going on here?

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,478
下面是这样的
Here's how we're going to do this.

35
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,647
我问 你答
I'm going to ask you questions,and you're going to give me answers.

36
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,149
够简单了吧?
Is that simple enough for you?

37
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,650
嗯
Sure.

38
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,446
你是谁? 你从哪来?
你如何得到你的飞船的?
Who are you,where are you from,and where did you get your ship?

39
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:23,035
真是巧 我也要问一样的问题
See,that's a funny coincidence,because I was going to ask you the same exact questions.

40
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,209
关键是我的手没有被绑在后面
[Punch] The difference is I'm not the one whose hands are tied behind his back.

41
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,299
那么 我再问一遍 你是谁?
你从哪来?你如何得到你的飞船的?
So,again,who are you,where are you from,and where did you get your ship?

42
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:41,887
出什么事了?
What happened?

43
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:42,971
我不太确定
I'm not entirely sure.

44
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,307
看上去 Sheppard的Jumper
在到达星门之前被攻击了
Looks like Sheppard's jumper was attacked before he reaches the space gate.

45
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,141
谁攻击的?
By who?

46
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:48,393
那个星球上的人
还在刀耕火种的时代
Well,the people on the planet aren't much past mud huts and blow darts,

47
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,270
所以我们可以假定不是他们
so we can assume they had nothing to do with it.

48
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,484
就在我们失去联系以后
星门附近有一个和打开超空间窗口
Just after we lost contact,there was a short burst of radiation in the vicinity of the gate,

49
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,945
很一致的短暂辐射爆发
consistent with the opening of a hyperspace window.

50
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:58,654
是Wraith吗?
Wraith?

51
00:03:58,654 --> 00:03:59,613
Sheppard说不是
Sheppard didn't seem to think so,

52
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:03,158
从Jumper上接收的一点
传感器数据可以证实这一点
and what little sensor data we've been able to pick up from the jumper seems to confirm it.

53
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,701
能量特征完全不同
The energy signature's all wrong.

54
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,955
而且也和古人的不一样
也就是排除了复制者
It's inconsistent with ancient technology as well,which pretty much rules out the replicators.

55
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:11,083
我们知道的本星系的其他种族
都没有超空间技术
We know of no other peoples in this galaxy that possess hyperspace technology.

56
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,211
当然 没有人能在被洗劫的时候
达到那么高级的水平
Of course not.No one reaches anywhere near that level of advancement without being culled.

57
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:16,588
那么是谁呢?
So then who was it?

58
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,760
我可以一整天都干这个
I could do this all day.

59
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:26,056
你的关节最后会酸的
Oh,your knuckles'll get sore eventually.

60
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,355
他有说什么吗?
Has he said anything?

61
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:34,815
只有他的名字
Only his name.

62
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,359
Reed Richards
(神奇四侠主角之一)
Reed richards.

63
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,069
他叫Sheppard
His name is sheppard.

64
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,698
我们截获了他最后的无线电通讯
We intercepted part of his last radio transmission.

65
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,826
我还不知道你的名字呢
I didn't catch your name.

66
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:49,538
你可以叫我Larrin
You can call me larrin.

67
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,707
你真的应该合作
You really should cooperate.

68
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:54,960
如果伤害太大就可惜了
It would be a shame to have to do too much damage.

69
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,379
我同意
I agree.

70
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:02,509
如果你们告诉我你们是谁
和你们的意图
Maybe if you guys tell me who you are and what you want,

71
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,052
我们可以达成协议
we could work out some kind of a deal.

72
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:07,264
那就不要吊起我的胃口
然后扫我的兴
Well,don't get my hopes up and then disappoint me.

73
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,474
和他说说上一个让我失望的人
后来怎么了
Tell him what happened to the last man that disappointed me.

74
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,642
我们不知道
We don't know.

75
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,644
从没找到他的尸体
We never found his body.

76
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:16,148
我猜你(Larrin)把他抛到了宇宙里
We assumed you blew him out into space.

77
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,608
我懂了
I get it.

78
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,736
好的
Good.

79
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,696
带上他
Bring him.

80
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,450
起来
Get up.

81
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,587
另一种折磨方式?
Another form of torture?

82
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,589
当你像我们一样长时间呆在宇宙里
When you spend as much time in space as we do,

83
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,759
你就很难吃到新鲜食物
you don't get a lot of fresh food.

84
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,805
多长时间?
How much time are we talking about?

85
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,810
这应该是一个对话 是吧?
This is a conversation,right?

86
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,937
双向的
A two-way street?

87
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:58,982
这就是我们的家
This is our home.

88
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:00,734
这艘飞船?
This ship?

89
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,486
还有其他类似的飞船
And others like it.

90
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:05,405
我们是旅行者
We're travelers.

91
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:07,741
你们一直住在宇宙空间
You live in space all the time.

92
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:11,578
在需要时我们才降落
比如 补给和交易时
We land on planets when we need to,for supplies,trade.

93
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,538
其他时候 我们保持移动
The rest of the time,we keep moving.

94
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:15,499
躲避Wraith吗?
From the wraith?

95
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:18,043
也许开始时是的
That may have been how it started,

96
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,046
但现在这就是我们的生活
but now it's just who we are.

97
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,590
没有别的意思 Larrin
Well,no offense,larrin.

98
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,801
但这听上去一点都不像生活
It doesn't sound like much of a life.

99
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,137
做群居动物也不是生活
Being a herd animal isn't much of a life.

100
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:34,601
而且 这些食物包含了必须的营养
Besides,the food has all the nutrients required.

101
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:40,690
听上去有点唐突
但是这东西味道不太好
Well,as tempting as that sounds,my jaw's a little sore right now.

102
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,360
事情并不总是这样
Things like that are necessary from time to time.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,570
虽然这不是获取信息
最有效的方式
Although it's not the most efficient way of getting information,

104
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,907
但这有助于人理解...
it does help people to understand...

105
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,284
他们的处境
their situation.

106
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:54,955
我的处境取决于你的仁慈
My situation being completely at your mercy.

107
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:56,665
没错
Exactly.

108
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:59,584
不管怎样 我了解你超过你的想象
Anyway,I know more about you than you think.

109
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,670
真的?
Really?

110
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,591
比如说 我知道你带有
可以操作Lantian科技的基因
For instance,I know that you carry the gene required to operate lantian technology.

111
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,010
我有什么?
I've got the what?

112
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,680
Sheppard 我知道你有你的秘密
Look,sheppard,I know you have your secrets,

113
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,850
如果你好好表现
我能让你保留一些
and if you stay on my good side,I may even let you keep a few of them.

114
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,270
但是如果你继续装蒜
However,if you continue to play ignorant with me,

115
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,940
我真的会把你抛到太空中去
I really will jettison you out into space.

116
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,694
一段时间以来我们听到传言说
一群新的人类到达了这个星系
For some time now,we've been hearing rumors about a new group of humans in the galaxy

117
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:29,114
他们用古人的技术和Wraith开战
using the technology of the ancestors to do battle with the wraith.

118
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:34,035
所以我们在一些空间星门附近
设置了间谍卫星网络
So we set up a network of spy satellites around dozens of worlds with space gates,

119
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,830
希望能有收获
hoping for an encounter.

120
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,248
终于我们成功了
Eventually we got lucky.

121
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:41,710
然后在我们第一次见面的时候
你攻击了我并解除了我船上的武器
And in the first meeting between our people,you attack me and disarm my ship.

122
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,963
你要使用星门
我不能允许
You were going through the gate,and I couldn't let that happen.

123
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:50,886
我们对任何能操作Lantian技术
的人都有特别的兴趣
You see,anyone capable of operating lantian technology is of particular interest to us.

124
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,929
所以你们取了我的血样
That's why you took a sample of my blood.

125
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:59,269
我们正在做一个控制界面适配器
它需要小量的遗传物质来工作
We're working on a control interface adapter that requires a small amount of necessary genetic material.

126
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,980
我么需要用你的血液做测试
We needed your blood to test it.

127
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,524
我猜你们进行的不是很顺利
I'm going to guess it didn't go so well.

128
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,734
为什么这么说?
Why would you say that?

129
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,360
如果不是的话
你们就不需要我了
Then you wouldn't have any use for me anymore.

130
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,404
不要低估你自己
Don't underestimate yourself.

131
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:13,366
你的用处可大着呢
There's all kinds of useful things you could do for me.

132
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:16,411
指挥官 我们快要到达坐标
Commander,we're approaching the coordinates.

133
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,245
明白
Understood.

134
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,456
跳出超空间
Take us out of hyperspace.

135
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,749
你是对的
Of course you're right.

136
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,418
控制界面还没有完成
The interface isn't fully operational yet.

137
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,171
跟我来
Come with me.

138
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,634
这是Nevik 我的首席科学官
Nevik,my chief science officer,

139
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:33,929
他坚持我们能更好的完善这个界面
insists that we have a much better chance of perfecting the interface

140
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,307
如果我们能对已经启动的
if we reverse-engineer it using lantian technology

141
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,850
Lantian科技进行反向工程
that's already been initialized.

142
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,604
我连反向工程是什么都不知道
I don't even know what reverse engineering is.

143
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,148
哦 你们想用我的飞船
Oh,you want to use my ship.

144
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:47,567
不是
Not exactly.

145
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:51,446
嘿
Hey!

146
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:58,578
启动护盾
Activate the force shield.

147
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:04,834
Sheppard 你能听见吗?
Sheppard,can you hear me?

148
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,920
你想告诉我你在做什么吗?
You mind telling me what you're doing?

149
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,256
和你做笔交易
Offering you a deal.

150
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,300
打开机舱[??BSG里怎么翻的??]门
Open the hanger bay doors.

151
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:23,103
这可不对
This is just not right.

152
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,020
别担心
Don't worry.

153
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,400
只要护盾不出故障你就没有危险
You're safe as long as the force shield doesn't malfunction,and that almost never happens.

154
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,819
你为什么要这样做?
Why are you doing this?

155
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,487
你想知道为什么?
You wanted to know what this is all about.

156
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,198
向下看看
Look beneath you.

157
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:40,495
我猜你认得这个技术
I'm assuming you recognize the technology.

158
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,247
那是一个Latian战舰
It's a lantian battleship.

159
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,873
它已经休眠了几千年了
It's been dormant for thousands of years,

160
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:47,752
而你要帮我让它工作起来
and you're going to help me get it operational again.

161
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:03,935
你们没有想过他们弃船
肯定是有充分理由的?
Has it occurred to you people they might have abandoned the ship for a good reason in the first place?

162
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,145
我们知道原因
We know the reason.

163
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,980
我们访问了日志
We were able to access the ship's logs.

164
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,398
他们被Wraith攻击了
They were attacked by the wraith.

165
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:10,984
他们失去了通讯系统
并且护盾正在减弱
They lost communication,and the shields were failing.

166
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:14,779
引擎也受到损伤
但是他们逃入了超空间
The engines were damaged as well,but they managed to escape into hyperspace.

167
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,158
然后他们发现他们的主推进器
在发出致命的辐射
Then they realized that their main drive was giving off deadly radiation.

168
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,826
他们被迫弃船
They were forced to abandon ship.

169
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:23,246
他们想回来修复
但是从来没有机会
They intended to return and effect repairs,but never got the chance.

170
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:29,044
从那以后这艘船就以一个200年的
椭圆轨道围绕附近的一个矮星旋转
The ship's been drifting in a 200-year elliptical orbit around a nearby dwarf star ever since.

171
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,296
那么 它从没被修复
So it's never been fixed.

172
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,339
不是
No.

173
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,049
我不想明说...
I hate to point out the obvious,

174
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:37,552
但是我帮你的一个条件是
你不杀我
but one of the reasons I agreed to help you was so that you wouldn't kill me.

175
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,054
如果我要死在辐射中...
If I'm going to die of radiation anyway--

176
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:40,096
别担心
Don't worry.

177
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:42,766
我们设立了护盾发生器
以保护关键的区域
We've set up shield emitters to protect key areas of the ship,

178
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:46,311
而且我们有辐射探测器
and we've all got radiation detectors.

179
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:48,938
带他到舰桥
Take him to the bridge.

180
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,648
从次光速推进器开始
Start with sub-light propulsion.

181
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,484
我去检查发生器
I'll go check the emitters.

182
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:55,362
我可以弄一个吗?
Don't think I could get one of those,too,do you?

183
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,326
这里
Here.

184
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:08,166
这艘船可有一万年历史了
You know,this ship is 10,000 years old.

185
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,378
我只是说如果它不工作
不是我的错
I'm just saying,for the record,if it doesn't work,it's not my fault.

186
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:14,464
你做就好了
Just get on with it.

187
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:21,596
太神奇了
Amazing.

188
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:24,599
我试验了两个月
都没能启动这些系统
I've been trying for two months to activate these systems.

189
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:27,102
我要调整界面适应神经输入
I need to calibrate the interface for neural input.

190
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,604
你可以从前进开始
Why don't you start by moving the ship forward?

191
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,980
你确定?
You sure about that?

192
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,565
我们就是为这个来的
That's why we're here.

193
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:36,111
你开飞船 我记录输入
然后复制它们
You fly the ship,and I record the inputs so I can replicate them.

194
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,696
- 好的 但是...
- 够了
-Okay,but--
-enough.

195
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,241
该死的 快开
Fly the damn ship.

196
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,660
好的
Right.

197
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:48,957
我刚才想说 你说"从前进开始"
I was just going to say,you said "start by moving the ship forward,

198
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:52,585
但你应该说 "先启动惯性消除"
" when you should have said,"start by initializing the inertial dampeners.

199
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,921
等一下!
" Wait!

200
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:08,059
我朋友有一把一模一样的枪
I have a friend who's got a gun just like this.

201
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,644
我终于知道他从哪弄来的了
I always wondered where he got it.

202
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:11,813
我会杀了你的
I'm going to kill you.

203
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,903
Silas 发生了什么?
Silas,what happened?

204
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:22,490
Nevik上面怎么了?
[Groans] Nevik,what's going on up there?

205
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,952
对不起 你的人现在没法说话
Sorry,your people aren't available right now.

206
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:27,745
Sheppard 你在做什么?
Sheppard,what are you doing?

207
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,666
你叫我开飞船 我正在开飞船
You said fly the ship,and I'm flying the ship.

208
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:41,926
我们说好了的
We had a deal.

209
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:44,888
我准备让你走以换取你的帮助
I was prepared to let you go in exchange for your help.

210
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,390
抱歉 我还没相信过绑架并折磨我
I'm sorry,I've never been able to trust anyone who kidnaps me

211
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,144
还威胁要把扔到宇宙中的人
and tortures me and threatens to blow me into space.

212
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,277
我们一无所获
We've got nothing.

213
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,196
下面没有残骸 也没有发射器信号
There's no wreckage,no transponder signal.

214
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,031
如果他在下面
我们现在就该找到他了
If he was down there,we would have found him by now.

215
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:03,990
那么他在哪?
Then where is he?

216
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,658
他不在轨道上 也不在星球上
He's not in orbit,and he's not on the planet,

217
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:09,996
那么唯一逻辑的假设是
攻击他的人在跳跃前把他带上了船
so the only logical assumption is that whoever attacked him must have brought him onboard before they jumped into hyperspace.

218
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,164
那么下一步怎么办?
So,what's the next step?

219
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,249
没有下一步
There is no next step.

220
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,709
我们没有办法追踪他
Look,we have no way of tracing him.

221
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,544
他现在可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere in the galaxy by now.

222
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:20,215
很抱歉但是有时候我们无能为力
I'm sorry,but sometimes there is just nothing we can do.

223
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:24,052
Sheppard 我要你让飞船跳出超空间
Sheppard,I want you to drop this ship out of hyperspace.

224
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,803
我不会的
I don't think so.

225
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,138
听我说
Listen to me.

226
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,766
我关闭了保护你所在区域
的护盾发生器
I've shut off the shield emitters protecting your areas of the ship.

227
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:34,020
现在舰桥充满了辐射
Right now,the bridge is being flooded with radiation.

228
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,066
你在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

229
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:41,653
你不会牺牲你自己的人
You'd never sacrifice your own people.

230
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:48,993
听着 我不想杀你
Look,I don't want to kill you,

231
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:53,748
但是如果你不交出飞船的控制权
我别无选择
but if you don't turn over the controls of this ship,I'll have no choice.

232
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,763
你很令我惊讶 Sheppard
You surprise me,sheppard.

233
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,349
只要我没有让你失望
Well,as long as I didn't disappoint you.

234
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:14,227
没有 我知道你会反抗
Oh,no,I knew you'd make some sort of a move.

235
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:18,231
只是我没想到会是这么..
I just wasn't expecting anything quite so...

236
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,066
聪明? 创新?
Clever? Creative?

237
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,401
鲁莽
Reckless.

238
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:24,404
你有可能把我们都害死
包括你自己
You could have killed all of us,including yourself.

239
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,699
我有一次把F16加速到16g
而没有昏过去
I once pulled 11 gs in an f-16 without passing out.

240
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:28,992
我知道我有把握
I figured I had a shot.

241
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,493
看来 我低估了你
Well,I underestimated you.

242
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:31,869
我也这么觉得
I feel the same way.

243
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,914
[???]
I mean,you've got the whole tough-as-nails routine down pat,

244
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:38,418
但是把自己的人
暴露在致命的辐射中...
but exposing your own people to killer radiation...

245
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:42,422
只有很特别的女人才会 不是吗?
it takes a special kind of lady to do that,doesn't it?

246
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,424
Larrin
Larrin...

247
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:48,678
事情不太好
it's not good.

248
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:52,640
他关闭了推进和导航系统
He shut down the propulsion and navigation system before he turned over the bridge.

249
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,851
当然了
Of course he did.

250
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:57,312
你有收集到足够的数据
来完成控制界面吗?
Did you collect enough data to finish the control interface?

251
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,563
我不知道 也许吧
I don't know.Maybe.

252
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:02,108
Nevik 如果你做不成
我们就被困在这了
Nevik,if you can't do this,we're stranded.

253
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,444
他怎么办?
What about him?

254
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,195
他不能再接近舰桥
He's not going anywhere near that bridge again.

255
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,280
不能信任他
He can't be trusted.

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,366
不过我们不能启动系统
他会和我们一起死在这
If we can't bring the system back online,he'll die out here like the rest of us.

257
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:11,451
问题是
That's the problem.

258
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:15,079
他看上去像是准备死的人吗?
Does he look like a man who thinks he's going to die?

259
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,042
检查次空间通讯阵列
Check the subspace communications array.

260
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,753
古人在战争中失去了通讯系统
The ancients lost the communications in the battle with the wraith.

261
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,963
它从没被修复
The system was never repaired.

262
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:26,591
检查一下
Check it.

263
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,399
怎么了?
What have you got?

264
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,526
记得我说过我们无能为力吗?
Ah,remember how I said sometimes there's nothing we can do?

265
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:50,031
我是对的 只是这次不适用
I was right about that,only it turns out this is not one of those times.

266
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,990
你找到他了?
You found him?

267
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,951
实际上是他找到我们了 听
Hmm,more like he found us.Listen to this.

268
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,372
这是次空间的声音
That is the sound of subspace.

269
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,458
它大部分是由多种辐射
造成的随机噪声
Now,it's mostly just random noise generated by various forms of radiation,

270
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,460
但是万能的古人
but the ancients,in their infinite wisdom,

271
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,755
编写了一个程序来检测人造样式
created a program that could sniff out artificial patterns.

272
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,925
这无疑是它们远距探测
高级生命形态的方式
It's no doubt a long-range means of detecting advanced life-forms,

273
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,301
有点像我们的SETI程序
(通过分布式计算寻找外星通讯)
kind of like our seti program,

274
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,845
只是古人的更强大
因为他们使用次空间
only much more powerful because it operates through subspace.

275
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:15,473
不管怎样 程序检测到了这个
Anyway,it picked up this.

276
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:19,519
这是什么?
What is it?

277
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,478
是Sheppard
That's sheppard.

278
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:22,188
我不知道为什么
他没发送一个普通消息
I do not know why he didn't just send a regular message.

279
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,065
也许他用的是一个坏的发送机
Maybe he was dealing with a damaged transmitter,

280
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:27,318
或者他想在不被发现的情况下
发出信息 但这肯定是他
or maybe he was trying to communicate without being detected,but it's definitely him.

281
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,070
你怎么知道?
How do you know it's him?

282
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,363
这是摩尔电码
It's morse code.

283
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:32,657
SOS
S.O.S.

284
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:40,039
怎么了?
What's happening?

285
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,835
这又是为了什么?
What was that for?

286
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,129
你知道你干了什么吗?
You realize what you've done?

287
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,339
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

288
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:52,677
不要再打了!
Stop that!

289
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,846
你停止说谎 我就停
I'll stop when you stop lying.

290
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:59,642
你修改了坏的通讯阵列
来发送信息 是不是?
You adapted the damaged communications array to send out a signal,didn't you?

291
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:03,187
是的
Yes.

292
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:06,983
你说过...
You said...

293
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,609
你会停止打我的!
you'd stop that!

294
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,736
没错
You're right.

295
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,488
也许该用枪打你
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

296
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,906
好吧
All right.

297
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,950
你没有觉得你反映过度了吗?
Don't you think you're overreacting a little?

298
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,035
你尝试着广播我们的位置是吗?
You were trying to broadcast our location?

299
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:19,245
知道怎么样了吗? 你成功了
Guess what?It worked.

300
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:23,583
有一艘船正在靠近
只是不是你想要的那一艘
There's a ship approaching,only I don't think it's the one you were hoping for.

301
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,625
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

302
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,086
来的是Wraith!
It's the wraith!

303
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,561
Wraith的飞船在找我们
The wraith ship is firing on us.

304
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,104
护盾在工作吗?
Do we have shields?

305
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,898
是的 但是只有20%
Affirmative,but they're only at 20%.

306
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,525
我们撑不了多久
We can't take this for very long.

307
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:57,909
如果你们要度过这个难关
你们需要我的帮助
If you want to get out of this alive,you're going to need my help.

308
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:05,625
我知道我们不信任对方 但是...
Now,I realize that you and I don't exactly trust each other,but...

309
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:11,380
但是如果Wraith要炸掉这艘船
那也没什么关系了 不是吗?
that's not going to make much difference if the wraith blow the ship up,is it?

310
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,133
你有什么想法?
What do you got in mind?

311
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:17,678
你可以先还击
Well,you can start by shooting back.

312
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,681
对
Right.

313
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,437
武器控制平台在走廊尽头
The weapons control platform is down that corridor.

314
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:27,647
我要回到舰桥去
I'm heading back to the bridge.

315
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,982
让护盾支撑的越久越好
Keep the shields up as long as you can.

316
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,957
太好了
Great.

317
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,338
小意思
Piece of cake.

318
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,675
护盾失效了
Shields are down.

319
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:58,761
你能多分配一点能源吗?
Can't you reroute any more power?

320
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,306
我无能为力
There's nothing I can do.

321
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:27,206
Silas Nevik 怎么回事?
Silas,nevik,what happened?

322
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,543
你们听见吗?
Do you read me?

323
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:55,985
Larrin
Larrin...

324
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,361
我是Sheppard
it's sheppard.

325
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,030
我没有给你通讯器
I didn't give you a communicator.

326
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,157
我启动了飞船的内部对讲系统
发生了什么事?
I activated the ship's intercom.What happened?

327
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,910
我不知道 飞船前部被封锁了
I don't know.The forward section's been sealed off.

328
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,162
你的人怎么样?
What about your people?

329
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,205
他们没有回应
They're not responding.

330
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:12,168
好消息是 Wraith的飞船被摧毁了
Good news is,the wraith ship's been destroyed.

331
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,795
你呆在那 我来找你
Stay where you are.I'm coming to you.

332
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,188
Sheppard 你在哪?
Sheppard,where are you?

333
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:35,149
辅助控制室
Auxiliary control room.

334
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:42,114
Sheppard?
Sheppard...

335
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,241
很抱歉
sorry about this.

336
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,993
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

337
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:48,537
目前为止 能做的不多
For the moment,not much.

338
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,748
超空间引擎离线了
Hyperdrive seems to be offline.

339
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,500
什么?
What?

340
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,918
有多严重?
How bad is it?

341
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:57,713
我不是这方面的专家
Well,it's not exactly my area of expertise,

342
00:20:57,713 --> 00:21:00,424
但是如果我看得没错
but if I'm reading this thing right,

343
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,592
引擎本身没有受损
the drive itself is undamaged.

344
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,678
也许只是控制系统短路了
Probably just a short in the control system.

345
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,846
我们可以简单地用旁路来解决
Then we can take care of it through a simple bypass.

346
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:08,057
放我出去 我应该可以修好它
Just let me out,and I should be able to fix it.

347
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:09,684
我可不会
I don't think so.

348
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,103
我们现在是活靶子 Sheppard!
We're a floating target out here,sheppard!

349
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,397
没事 放心
All right,take it easy.

350
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:15,731
我已经把发信器关掉了
I shut the transmitter off.

351
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,483
我的人应该已经收到信息了
My people should've got the message by now.

352
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:21,278
你没有理由假定Wraith飞船
没有广播我们的位置
There is no reason to assume that wraith ship didn't broadcast our position.

353
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,489
也没有理由假定它们这么做了
Well,there's no reason to assume they did.

354
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:24,699
听我说 Sheppard
Listen to me,sheppard.

355
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:27,201
我的一生都花在超空间引擎上
I've spent my entire life around hyperdrive systems.

356
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:28,452
我知道该怎么修
I know what I'm doing.

357
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,871
我从没说过我不相信你
I never said I didn't believe you.

358
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:32,957
别担心
Don't worry.

359
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:35,918
我的人会来的
My people will be here.

360
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:53,269
Sheppard的广播是从
这个星系附近来的
Sheppard was broadcasting from somewhere in the vicinity of this system.

361
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:56,522
传感器没有收到任何东西
Well,sensors aren't picking up anything.

362
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:59,650
让我看看能不能把范围扩大一点
Let me see if I can expand the range a little.

363
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,112
那里
There.

364
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,572
那是什么?
What is it?

365
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:06,615
也许是一艘船
Could be a ship.

366
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:09,118
他们太远了 没法获取准确的读数
但是那肯定使他们
They're still too far out to get any detailed readings,but that's got to be them.

367
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,995
以最大亚光速多久能到那?
How long to get there at maximum sublight?

368
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,414
5小时
It's five hours.

369
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:14,999
Lorne呼叫所有Jumper
This is Lorne to all jumpers.

370
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,125
我正在把发送坐标给你们
I'm sending you some coordinates.

371
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,378
以最大亚光速前往目标
Proceed to target at maximum sublight.

372
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:35,394
Larrin你在做什么?
Larrin,what are you doing?

373
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:39,732
听着 我的人来了以后
他们会修好超空间引擎
Look,once my people get here and get the hyperdrive back online,

374
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,525
然后我们会把你送到最近的星门
we'll drop you off at the nearest gate.

375
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:42,985
我保证
You have my word.

376
00:22:42,985 --> 00:22:44,570
还不够好
Not good enough.

377
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,822
什么? 我的保证还是我的条件?
What,my word or my deal?

378
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:49,033
两个都不好
How about both?

379
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,368
你是绑架我的人 记得吗?
You're the one who kidnapped me,remember?

380
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,496
但是我需要这艘船
Because I need this ship.

381
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,334
嗯
there.

382
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:01,253
我已经在帮你了
I did you a favor.

383
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,049
Sheppard...
Sheppard...

384
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,675
听我说
listen to me.

385
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,928
我们的舰队很老了
Our fleet is old.

386
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:12,598
我们本有资源建造新船
但是现在没有了
There was a time when we had the resources to build new ships,but now we don'T.

387
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:16,310
如果我们损失了一艘 就是一艘
When we lose one,it's gone for good,

388
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,395
尽管人口控制已经很严格了
and despite strict population controls,

389
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:23,234
我们还是没有足够的地方
there just isn't enough room for all of us anymore.

390
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:27,822
我们已经被迫
将一些人遗弃在地面上
We've been forced to abandon some of our own people on the ground.

391
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:32,076
(地面上的人)他们不比
这个星系里的其他人活的差
Well,they're no worse off than the rest of the people in this galaxy.

392
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,620
那好
Fine.

393
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,916
我们还是用硬方法解决吧
We'll do this the hard way.

394
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:46,048
Larrin 你在做什么?
Larrin,what are you doing?

395
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,856
Sheppard 你真把我给惹毛了
Sheppard,you are really starting to annoy me!

396
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:05,442
好好坐着就好 很快就会结束的
Just sit tight.It'll be over soon enough.

397
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,445
Silas Nevil 回答
Silas,nevik,come in.

398
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:10,447
Silas 收到吗?
Silas,do you read me?

399
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:11,574
放弃吧 他们已经死了
Give it up.They're gone.

400
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,992
你不能确定
You don't know that.

401
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:15,828
我不能 但是我可以查出来
No,but I can find out.

402
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:30,092
看上去飞船前部没人生还
Looks like there's no one alive in the forward section.

403
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:33,053
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,518
Larrin 你到哪去?
Larrin,where are you going?

405
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,229
在这艘船上你到哪 我都能跟踪你
I can track you anywhere on this ship.

406
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:44,732
你躲不过我的
You can't hide from me.

407
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,323
Larrin 停下
Larrin,stop.

408
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:55,951
我在你正前方收到了生命信号
I'm picking up another life-sign directly in front of you.

409
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:57,912
Silas
Silas...

410
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:58,746
不可能的
it's impossible.

411
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,999
他不可能活着离开那个区域
There's no way he got out of that section alive.

412
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:40,120
你没事吧?
You all right?

413
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,538
我没事
I'm fine.

414
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:43,290
它袭击了我
He just caught me off guard.

415
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,044
它们肯定是用Darts
从他们的飞船上逃出来的
They must've escaped in the darts before their ship was destroyed.

416
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,046
我们的机舱有加压
We left the hangar bay pressurized.

417
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:50,339
它们径直飞进来了
They flew right in.

418
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:51,173
它们?
They?

419
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:52,758
没错 还有3个
Yeah,there's three more.

420
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:54,301
我们可以用这个跟踪它们
We can track them with this.

421
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:55,678
你是从哪找到的?
Where did you get that?

422
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:57,346
辅助控制室
Auxiliary control room.

423
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,515
你得知道到什么地方找 快来
You got to know where to look.Come on.

424
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,310
我来拿他的枪
I'll get his weapon.

425
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:11,986
很顽强的小混蛋 不是吗?
Tenacious little bastards,aren't they?

426
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:14,697
我猜这个你没有多余的了
I don't suppose you have any more of these.

427
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:19,576
恐怕没有了
我想这个也不会有什么用
I'm afraid not,and I don't think this is going to be much good either.

428
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,379
停
Hold up.

429
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:33,090
这边来了一个
We got one coming this way.

430
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:41,390
现在怎么办?
What now?

431
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:58,032
等一下 Sheppard 你在干什么?
Wait,no,sheppard-- what are you doing?

432
00:26:58,032 --> 00:26:59,908
哦 真是好点子
What-- oh,brilliant plan.

433
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:01,660
让我们... 啊
Get us-- ow!

434
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:31,398
另外两个也来了
There's the other two.

435
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,318
什么 它们在开会吗?
What,are they having a board meeting?

436
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:44,161
没用的 我已经尽全力
加强传感器了
It's no use.I've done all I can to boost the sensors.

437
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,371
他们还是太远了
They're still too far out.

438
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,039
那么我们不知道
我们要对付的是什么
So we have no idea what we're dealing with.

439
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,291
他们为什么在太阳系边缘
那么远的地方?
Why would they be so far out on the edge of the solar system?

440
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,502
我觉得这个星系不会
正巧有一个星门
I don't think it's a coincidence that this system has a space gate.

441
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:54,338
他们可能是在前往星门时
跳出超空间太早了
They were probably headed for it when they dropped out of hyperspace too early.

442
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:55,130
为什么呢?
Well,why would they do that?

443
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,090
我怎么知道?
how should I know?

444
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,508
我们连他们是谁都不知道
We don't even know who they are,remember?

445
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:00,052
有什么区别呢?
Does it make a difference?

446
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:05,474
即使那是一个母舰舰队
我们也会尝试把他救出来
Even if it was a fleet of hive ships,would it stop us from trying to get him back?

447
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:10,270
不会
No.

448
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,273
如果你合作的 这一切都不会发生
You know,none of this would have ever happened if you would have just cooperated.

449
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,441
你现在就应该到家了
You'd be home by now,

450
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,360
而我会给我的人民带回一艘飞船
and I'd be headed back to my people with a ship

451
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,529
一艘能容纳上千男女老少的飞船
that could house a thousand men,women,and children.

452
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,949
如果首先像我求助
而不是攻击我的话...
Well,if you had asked for my help in the first place instead of attacking me--

453
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,117
我们不能冒这个险
we couldn't risk it.

454
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,619
什么险?
Risk what?

455
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:28,497
你可能会说不
You might have said no.

456
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:37,214
他们走了
They're leaving.

457
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,809
等一下
Hold up.

458
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,395
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

459
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,814
他们在我们和控制室之间
They're between us and the control room.

460
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,274
我们应该可以找条路绕过去
We should be able to find a way around.

461
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,776
时间不够了
我们不能让它们先到
There isn't enough time.We can't risk them finding it first.

462
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:01,321
有什么关系呢? 他们又不能开船
What does it matter?It's not like they can fly the ship.

463
00:29:01,738 --> 00:29:03,657
Sheppard...
Sheppard...

464
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:07,035
你有把控制器关掉 是吧?
you did shut down the controls,right?

465
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:08,829
- Sheppard...
- 我没有时间...
-Sheppard--
-there wasn't enough time.

466
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,206
如果他们在我们之前到达控制室
If they find that control room before we do,

467
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:13,292
他们不仅能开这艘船
they'll not only be able to fly the ship,

468
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:15,669
而且还可以
用内部传感器追踪我们
but they're going to be able to track us using the internal sensors.

469
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,714
相信我 我知道 还有
Believe me,I know,and by the way,

470
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:21,216
我是要去救你的命
I was busy saving your life at the time.

471
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:24,720
我的生命会有危险
The only reason my life was in danger in the first place is

472
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,475
是因为你把我们的位置
广播到了半个星系
because you decided to broadcast our position to half the galaxy.

473
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:33,645
你是想吵这个
还是想做一些实际行动?
Do you want to argue about this,or do you want to do something about it?

474
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:34,980
好吧
Fine.

475
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,316
有什么选择?
What are the options?

476
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:41,612
我们没法去控制室 也没有武器
Well,we're cut off from the control room,and we have no weapons.

477
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,780
不尽然 我们可以用那把椅子
That's not true.We have the chair.

478
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,827
我觉得Drone对
船中的Wraith不会有什么用
I don't think drones are going to do any good with a bunch of wraith in the middle of the ship.

479
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:51,705
如果他们不在船中间呢?
What if they weren't in the middle?

480
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,665
正经一点
Get serious.

481
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,835
你有更好的办法吗?
You got a better idea?

482
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,551
好吧
All right.

483
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:06,803
我就位了
I'm in position.

484
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:08,764
等待我的信号
Wait for my signal.

485
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:10,807
你确定你要这么做?
You sure you want to go through with this?

486
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:15,229
如果你没有成功
我会有负罪感的
I mean,if you don't make it,I'm going to feel responsible,

487
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,147
我真的不需要这个负罪感
and,well,I really don't need the guilt.

488
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:19,900
只要你不放得太早
我就不会有事
I'll be fine as long as you don't shoot too early.

489
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,569
我肯定你不是第一次
听一个女人说这个话
I'm sure it's not the first time you've heard that from a woman.

490
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:25,572
正好相反 我可以忍耐
On the other hand,I might be able to live with it.

491
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,371
我看到它们了
I got 'em.

492
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,289
来了
Here we go.

493
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:03,694
Sheppard 现在发射
Sheppard,now!

494
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,564
Larrin 回话
Larrin,come in.

495
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:46,069
Larrin?
Larrin?

496
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:59,166
在我吸光你的生命之前
and now,before I take the rest of your life,

497
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,877
你要回答我一个问题
you will answer my questions.

498
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:05,839
你们还有几个人在船上?
How many more of your people are on this ship?

499
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,801
我可以不杀你
也可以让你痛快的死去
I do not have to kill you,nor do I have to leave you like this.

500
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:12,512
所以你最好合作
It would be better if you cooperated.

501
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:15,307
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

502
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:22,064
告诉我你们还有
多少人在船上?
Tell me,how many more of you are onboard?

503
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:29,112
只要我打一枪...
It only takes one.

504
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:36,161
我看出来你已经进食过了
你的再生能力现在是最高的
I see that you've just fed,which means that your regeneration powers are at their highest,

505
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:41,667
但是我不相信
你能长出新的头来
but I seriously doubt you can grow a new head.

506
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,085
你要怎么样?
What do you want?

507
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:46,296
首先 你得把击昏枪给我
First,you're going to hand me the stunner.

508
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:49,007
慢慢地
Slowly.

509
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:59,059
然后 你得把你拿走的东西还给她
Next,you're going to give back what you took.

510
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,478
然后 你可以离开
Then,you're going to leave.

511
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:03,689
- 离开?
- 你们是坐Dart来的 对吗?
-Leave?
-You came in a dart,right?

512
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,273
(我们来的时候)机舱没有人看守
The bay was unguarded.

513
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:08,151
我们降落然后上了飞船
就像进入无人之境
We landed our darts and entered unchallenged.

514
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,529
那么 你怎么来的就怎么回去
Well,then,you're going to leave the same way you came.

515
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,031
这个恒星系的第二个行星
有一个轨道星门
There's a space gate orbiting the second planet in this system.

516
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:16,785
你可能要花一点时间
但是你肯定能到达
It may take you a while,but you'll get there.

517
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:23,583
如果我让她复原 就没有东西
可以阻止你食言或者杀我
If I restore her,there's nothing to stop you from going back on your word and killing me anyway.

518
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,127
没错
That's true.

519
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:28,213
我说有一半的机会
我会因为纯粹的仇恨而杀了你
I'd say there's a 50-50 chance I'll do it out of pure spite,

520
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:34,136
但是如果你不照做
我肯定会杀了你
but if you don't,I will kill you.

521
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:08,295
起来
Get up.

522
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:12,132
转个身
Turn around.

523
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,020
你没事吧?
You all right?

524
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,813
我不知道
I don't know.

525
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,858
那太奇怪了
That was so strange.

526
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:32,110
你的整个...
To have your...

527
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,199
生命危在旦夕
然后突然转圜了
whole life fading away,and then to suddenly have it back again.

528
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:40,952
事实上 这感觉很好
It actually felt kind of good.

529
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:42,078
我知道
I know.

530
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:43,955
在我身上发生过一次
Happened to me once,too.

531
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,582
说起来很复杂
Long story.

532
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,292
你起得来吗?
Think you can get up?

533
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,294
可以
Yeah.

534
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,675
放松...
easy...

535
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:58,345
我没事 没事
I'm okay.I'm all right.

536
00:34:59,095 --> 00:35:01,807
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

537
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:04,226
第二次
Again.

538
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:08,063
如果不是你想出这个计划
我们就已经死了
If you hadn't come up with the plan,we'd both be dead.

539
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:10,649
那么你是说我们会是很好的搭档?
So are you saying we make a good team?

540
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:13,151
别发神经了
Well,don't go crazy.

541
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:18,990
好的 但是为了...
Right,but in the interest of...

542
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:24,538
星际间的关系考虑
我想我们至少...
interstellar relations,I think we should at least just...

543
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:29,334
应该试着和平共处 对吗?
try to get along,right?

544
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:41,638
你一定是在看完笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

545
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:43,849
对不起
Sorry.

546
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,217
Larrin
Larrin...

547
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:21,428
对不起 Sheppard
sorry about this,sheppard,

548
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:24,347
你救了我的命 我真的很感激
and I really am grateful that you saved my life.

549
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:26,683
但是你用了一种
很奇怪的方法来表示
Well,you've got a funny way of showing it.

550
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,518
不要和我玩这个
Don't play hurt with me.

551
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:31,271
当你觉得你占上风的时候
你很容易变得很慷慨
It's easy to be generous when you think you have the upper hand.

552
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:32,731
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

553
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:36,651
你我都知道你没有在第一时间
就把我击昏然后关起来
We both know the only reason you didn't stun me and lock me up the first opportunity you got was

554
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:40,655
是因为你以为你的船会先到达
because you thought your ships were going to get here first.

555
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,284
但是你错了
You were wrong about that,by the way.

556
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:58,298
Larrin 见到你真是太高兴了
Larrin,it's good to see you again.

557
00:36:58,298 --> 00:37:00,675
相信我 我也是这么觉得
Believe me,I feel the same way.

558
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:02,552
你怎么找到我们的?
How did you find us?

559
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:06,848
在你们进入超空间之前
我们都在监控通讯
Well,we were monitoring communications before you jumped into hyperspace.

560
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,808
你知道他截走了飞船?
You knew he took the ship?

561
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,061
这个很明显
It seemed fairly obvious.

562
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,563
我们猜他的首要目标
是联系他的人
We guessed his priority would be to contact his people,

563
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:18,068
所以我们向我们原先位置附近
所有的星门发送了探测器
so we sent probes to all the space gates in the vicinity of our previous position.

564
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,404
终于 我们检测到了你的能量标记
Eventually,we detected your energy signature.

565
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:22,822
干得好
Well done.

566
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:27,744
现在 我要你派一些技术人员
来帮助我重启超空间引擎
Now,I want you to send over a couple of technicians to help me get the hyperdrive back online.

567
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,790
哦 还要一个保安队
Oh,and a security team as well.

568
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,292
马上就好
Right away.

569
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:46,388
哦 求你
Oh,come on.

570
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:57,065
好了 足够进行完全传感器扫描了
All right,close enough to do a full sensor sweep.

571
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,652
看上去有四艘船
Looks like we got four ships,

572
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,154
一艘是Lantian设计 Aurora级的
one of them lantian design.Aurora class.

573
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:04,322
另外三艘呢?
What about the other three?

574
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:05,740
我认不出这配置
I don't recognize the configurations.

575
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,866
Sheppard 在哪?
What about sheppard?

576
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:10,328
符合逻辑的假设是
他在发射信号的船上
Well,the logical assumption is that he's onboard the ship that transmitted the signal.

577
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,122
那是哪一艘呢?
And which one is that?

578
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:13,081
我不知道
Well,I have no idea.

579
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,833
我们就要进入火力范围了 博士
We're about to enter weapons range,doc.

580
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,209
我们瞄准哪一艘船?
Which ships do I target?

581
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:19,004
也许在攻击之前
我们应该试试通讯
Perhaps we should attempt to communicate before we attack.

582
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:20,714
我们对这些人一无所知
We know nothing about these people.

583
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,465
没事 但是现在
That's true,but right now,

584
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:25,093
我们唯一有的优势是
我们是隐形的
about the only thing we got working for us is the fact that we're cloaked.

585
00:38:25,093 --> 00:38:26,928
如果发射信号 我们就会暴露位置
We send a signal,we give up our position.

586
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:27,804
他说的没错
He's right.

587
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,181
他们可能攻击我们
或者跳回超空间
They could target us,or for that matter,they could just jump back into hyperspace.

588
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,891
我们就前功尽弃了
We'd be right back at square one.

589
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,894
我们不能走了这么远却一无所获
We didn't come all this way for nothing,right?

590
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:40,608
好吧 我来看看我能不能
找到方法阻止他们离开
All right,well,I'll see if I can figure out a way to disable them.

591
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:49,868
你肯定很乐意知道
超空间引擎已经修复了
I thought you'd be glad to know the hyperdrive repairs are almost complete.

592
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,911
那么 祝贺你们
Well,congratulations.

593
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,247
你们得到了你们要得东西
You got what you want.

594
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:56,750
是的 我们可以飞行和导航
Yes,it's true I can fly the ship and navigate,

595
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,045
但是还有不少系统我不能访问
but there are still dozens of systems I don't have access to,

596
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:03,256
还有 如果任何一个控制器关闭了
就会有点麻烦
and if any of the controls went down,it would be a problem.

597
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:05,091
那么 完善那个适配器吧
So finish the adapter.

598
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:08,553
你说过你可以对已经初始化的
系统进行反向工程
You've said you can reverse-engineer the systems that were already initialized.

599
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:10,805
是的 我们最终会的
Well,yes,we can,eventually,

600
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,767
但是如果我把你留在船上
事情会快很多
but it would go a lot faster if I keep you onboard.

601
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,894
你是一个xx 你知道吗?
You are a piece of work,you know that?

602
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,729
我知道你不同意我的策略
Look,I know you don't agree with my tactics,

603
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:20,732
但是对于船的用途我说得是实话
but I wasn't lying about why I need this ship.

604
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:23,568
我是为我的人民而这么做的
I'm doing this for my people.

605
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:26,488
听着
Look...

606
00:39:26,488 --> 00:39:30,408
我知道你觉得你在帮助你的人民
但是你错了
I know you think you're helping your people,but you're wrong.

607
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:32,660
什么?
Excuse me?

608
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,829
你们已经躲躲藏藏好几千年了
You've been running and hiding for thousands of years.

609
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,915
你们能活下来很好
You've survived,good for you,

610
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:40,668
但是现在你们的收益开始减小了
(Sheppard经济学的真好 还知道diminishing returns)
but now you're starting to see diminishing returns.

611
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:43,379
一艘船 能给你们多一点时间
One more ship,that buys you a little more time,but ultimately,

612
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,298
但是它最终不能改变什么
it's not going to change anything.

613
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:49,886
你的人民正在走向死亡
Your people are headed for a slow death.

614
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,597
我们还有什么选择呢?
What other choice do we have?

615
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:55,475
如果你还没听说
那你很快就会知道
In case you haven't heard,you will soon enough

616
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:57,018
Wraith正在受到攻击
,but the wraith are under attack.

617
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:58,269
被谁?
From who?

618
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:01,272
说来话长 但是他们损失惨重
It's a long story,but the point is,they're taking heavy damage,

619
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:04,025
即使他们没有被铲除
他们也会变得禁不起一击
and if they don't get wiped out,they're going to be vulnerable.

620
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:08,863
你们的人现在有超空间引擎
先进的武器 还有鬼知道什么东西
Now,you people have hyperdrives and advanced weapons,and god knows what else.

621
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:13,701
时间适当的时候
你们需要一种技术来达到平衡
When the time is right, a kind of technology to take the blance.

622
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,331
你是建议我们结盟吗?
Are you suggesting an alliance?

623
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:22,752
我没有邀请你吃晚餐 但是类似的
Well,I'm not asking you to dinner,but yeah,something like that.

624
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,587
在我让你承受了这么多以后?
After all I put you through?

625
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:28,424
就像你说的 你是为了你的人民
Well,like you said,you did it for your people.

626
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:32,679
我终究是理解错了你
I may have misjudged you after all.

627
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:36,015
好吧 博士 我们在火力范围内了
All right,doc,we're in weapons range.

628
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:37,016
我们有什么方案?
What do you got for me?

629
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:39,269
我们可以瞄准Lantian飞船的引擎
We can target the lantian ship's engines.

630
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,478
其他几艘怎么办?
What about the others?

631
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:43,064
我已经检查过传感器数据
但是其中的未知处太多了
I've been going over the sensor data,but there's still too many unknowns.

632
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,023
如果我们打错了地方
I mean,if we hit them in the wrong spot,

633
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:47,819
我们可能把他们给炸飞
也有可能Drone只能从护盾上弹过
we could blow them out of the sky,or the drones could just bounce harmlessly off the shields.

634
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,112
我们没有办法知道
there is no way to know

635
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,488
好吧 我们还有最好的选择
All right,well,it's still our best option.

636
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:52,907
我们不能让他们跑走
We can't risk them getting away.

637
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:07,172
他们走了
They're gone.

638
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:18,850
我检测到了东西
I'm getting a contact.

639
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:20,685
是一艘Jumper
It's a jumper.

640
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,270
一个生命信号
One life sign.

641
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,855
Sheppard中校 我是Loren少校
Colonel sheppard,this is major lorne.

642
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,023
是你吗?
Is that you?

643
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:27,817
是的 少校
That's affirmative,major.

644
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,652
很高兴听见你的声音
It's good to hear from you.

645
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:31,154
我也是 长官
Likewise,sir.

646
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:34,782
看起来我们差点失去你
Seemed like we came pretty close to losing you there.

647
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:39,037
你不会知道是怎么回事的
You don't know the half of it.

648
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:50,590
太好吃了
that's good.

649
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,342
真的?
Really?

650
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,344
当你跟一群宇宙流浪者呆久了
You spend enough time with a bunch of space nomads,

651
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,804
你就会开始珍惜你有的东西
you really begin to appreciate what you have.

652
00:41:56,804 --> 00:42:00,725
很难想象把一生
都花在船上是什么感觉
It's difficult to imagine spending one's entire life onboard a ship.

653
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:02,227
如果是我的话 我会疯的
If it was me,I'd go crazy.

654
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:03,978
那么我们就是最正常的人
They weren't exactly the most even-keeled people.

655
00:42:03,978 --> 00:42:06,064
我仍然不太确定
他们为什么让我走
I'm still not exactly sure why they let me go.

656
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:07,649
你向他们提出结盟
Well,you did offer them an alliance.

657
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:08,983
那肯定值点什么
That has to be worth something.

658
00:42:08,983 --> 00:42:11,986
或者他们发现
你带来的麻烦比你的价值还多
Or they figured out you'd be more trouble than you're worth.

659
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,572
这是一个可能
That is a possibility.

660
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:17,700
不 你肯定还有什么没告诉我们
No,there's something you're not telling us.

661
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,577
她很性感 是不是?
She was hot,wasn't she?

662
00:42:19,577 --> 00:42:21,037
我不知道你在讲什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

663
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:23,373
哦 我知道了 这太典型了
Oh,I knew it.That is so typical.

664
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:25,708
她打了我 Rodney
She had me beat,rodney.

665
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,835
她几次威胁要杀了我
She threatened to kill me several times.

666
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:30,004
这不是我们一起消遣去SPA那种
It wasn't like we were hanging out in the spa together.

667
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:32,423
不管怎样 我知道的是我每次被抓
Whatever.All I know is that every time I get taken captive,

668
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:33,424
都是Wraith干的
it's the wraith.

669
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:37,679
我就想被一个
性感的外星人抓住一次
Just once I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien.

670
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,222
你可能还有机会
Well,you may still get a chance.

671
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,682
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

672
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,767
她还在宇宙之中呢
She's still out there.
