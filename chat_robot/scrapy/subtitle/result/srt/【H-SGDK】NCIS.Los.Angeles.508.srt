00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,120
放下枪
Drop the gun!

3
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,210
站住

啊 漂亮小橱柜
Ah. Nice cabinets.

10
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,260
- 你自己做的  - 从刨木头开始都是
- You built those yourself?  - From scratch.

11
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,300
- 哇 做了多久  - 大约一个月
- Wow. How long did that take?  - About a month.

12
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,540
- 一个月  - 是呀
- A month?  - Yeah.

13
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,080
为啥你不干脆雇一个专业工匠呢
Why didn't you just hire a professional?

14
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,120
雇工匠的钱的一小部分足够我自己做了
I spent a fraction of what it would cost by doing it myself.

15
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,140
是啊 但是你花的时间是一个工匠工作时间的四倍
Yeah, but you spent quadruple the time a professional would have.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,920
你想说啥
And what's your point?

17
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:48,200
我的意思是如果你雇一个工匠
Well, my point is that if you'd hired a pro,

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
你就会有更多的时间来做你喜欢做的事情了
you could have spent more time doing the things you love.

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,660
是啊 我自己喜欢做橱柜呀
Yeah, and by doing it myself,

20
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,440
我给我爱的人存了更多的钱
I saved more money for the ones I love.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,720
我就不明白了
I just don't get it.

22
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,580
你当然不明白了 你又没有孩子
Of course you don't-- you don't have kids.

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,740
我说 你用钱都干嘛了
I mean, what do you spend money on?

24
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,810
我们都一样的工资
We have the same salary.

25
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,480
Hetty实际上送给你一个房子
Hetty practically gave you a house.

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,480
还有我还经常买单
And yet I'm always picking up the check.

27
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,440
难道我要阻止你大方吗
Who am I to deny your generosity?

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,520
另外 是你自己无能
Besides, this is about your inability

29
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,840
放弃掌控 雇一个工匠
to relinquish control and hire a professional.

30
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,300
我听到Sam又自己动手了
Am I hearing that Sam is DIY'ing again?

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,780
哦 是呀
Oh, yeah.

32
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,080
他刚用了一个月做了个架子
He just spent a month building some shelves.

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,000
橱柜
Cabinets.

34
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,549
那就花了我几周而已 现在 你就说是一个月了
And it was only a couple of weeks. Now, you said a month.

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,000
为啥你不雇个工匠呢
Why don't you just hire a professional?

36
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,320
- 用那些时间放松一下  - 正是
- Take that time for yourself to relax.  - Exactly.

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,340
这又是一个单身汉的观点
This coming from another one who lives alone.

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,000
啥
What?

39
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,980
手工让我放松
Building relaxes me.

40
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,860
另外 对一个男人来说
Besides, it's good for a man to know

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,460
他能用自己的手制作是极好的
that he can create with his hands.

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,760
我用我的手了啊 我用手
I use my hands. I use my hands

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,720
拿起电话 打给工匠
to pick up the phone and call a professional.

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
然后我用我的手
And then I use my hand

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,000
刷我的信用卡来付工钱
to use my credit card and pay that professional.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,680
- 这有啥好笑的  - 我告诉你笑点在哪儿
- Where's the fun in that?  - I'll tell you where the fun is.

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,680
笑点就是 呃 我们花钱雇来的人就能帮我们干活的时候
The fun is in the, uh, mojitos that we're sipping

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,880
我们就能畅享莫吉托(一种鸡尾酒)了
while the guy that we're paying is doing the work.

49
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,240
那就是我想说的
That's what I'm talking about.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,300
就是这意思
That's what I'm talking about.

51
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,150
不对 我完全赞同Sam
No, I totally agree with Sam.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,160
美女都喜欢男人制作东西 好性感
A woman likes a guy who can build things; it's sexy.

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,680
源于为她遮风避雨的吸引力
It stems from a primal attraction for shelter.

54
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,880
我盖过一个树屋 这性感吗
I built a tree house once-- how is that for sexy?

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,440
我保证那玩意儿肯定不在了
I guarantee that's not still standing.

56
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,500
- 或许不在了 不过在那地方我失去了  - 太过了
- Maybe not, but it's where I lost my... TMI.

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,320
控制 我原本要说的 我没抓牢 摔下来
Grip-- I was gonna say it's where I lost my grip, fell down,

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
断了我的尾椎骨 我还有疤 你想看吗
broke my coccyx-- I got a scar; you want to see it?

59
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,540
不想
No.

60
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,400
乌拉
Whoa.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,100
这是
Is that...

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,940
摩斯密码
Morse code?

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,270
我们有案子了
"We got a case."

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,190
是Eric 他在叫我们去控制中心
Eric. He's calling us up to ops.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,500
我觉得是时候干预一下(Eric)了
I think it's time for an intervention.

66
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,070
祝你好运 我要花点时间
Good luck with that. I have a small window

67
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,680
去联系莫利纳 卡特尔的线人
to contact the Molina Cartel informant--

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,540
我要去见他
I'm gonna take it.

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
我在控制中心给你打掩护
I'll cover you in ops.

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
这就像一个轻度按摩
It's like a gentle massage.

72

给我的臀大肌
It's in my glutes.

So we have a "Master thief," And then we have the "Other guy."

121
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
我就说说 作为搭档
I'm just saying, for partners,

122
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,600
这显然是价值的失衡

127
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,144
他很有可能寻求医疗救助

128
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,740
是的

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,420
你为什么就不能拿走我剩余的灵魂啊
Just take the rest of my soul, why don't you.

139
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,120
联邦探员
Federal agents!

140
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,700
安全
Clear.

141
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
安全 G 这儿
Clear! G, down here!

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,840
哈
Huh.

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
你对这些工具嫉妒吗
You having a little tool envy?

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,300
没有
Hardly.

145
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,840
但是这个相当令人佩服啊
But this is impressive.

146
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
这些人绝对知道自己要干嘛
These guys definitely knew what they were doing.

147
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,160
他们自己定制偷盗工具
They were building custom tools for their jobs.

148
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,600
貌似他们用暖通空调公司的名义
It looks like they were using the cover of an HVAC company

149
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,960
拿到了目标建筑的设计图
to get the layout of their targets.

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
我知道你这表情代表啥
I know that look.

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,740
这不科学
It just doesn't make sense.

152
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
我知道这些人
I understand these guys

153
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,800
做他们擅长的事情
were skilled at what they do...

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
有好工具帮忙
The right tools help.

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,460
但他们作为飞贼引以为傲
But they're glorified cat burglars.

156
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,840
这可是蓝领级的行动 手工活来的
It's a blue-collar operation, it's hands-on,

157
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,740
但想想 为啥偷能源部
but think about it, the Department of Energy?

158
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
这可是远远超过他们的薪酬级别
Mm. It's way above their pay grade.

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,180
那可不是他们典型的入室盗窃手法
That is not your typical B-and-E.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,460
嗯
Hmm.

161
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,780
貌似他有个停车位
Looks like he splurged for parking.

162
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,140
我们去看看
Let's check it out.

163
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,960
你想猜一猜是哪个吗
You care to take a guess?

164
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,280
那个
That one.

165
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,540
猜得好
Good guess.

166
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,880
他回家就被杀
Guess he came home to die.

167
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
在录像里 他只被打中了肩膀
In the video, he was shot only once in the his shoulder.

168
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,560
他身上有三个近身枪伤
He has three close-range wounds to the torso.

169
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,620
看这个血迹喷溅型态
Look at the blood spatter.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,740
杀手跟踪他回来的
He tracked him back

171
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,620
- 来灭口  - 或者
- to finish the job.  - Or...

172
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,960
凶手知道他会回来这儿
our shooter knew he was coming back here.

173
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,380
虎头蛇尾
Tied up loose ends.

174
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:33,940
G
G.

175
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,040
说茄子
Say "Cheese."

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,460
可能拍到了凶手
Might have gotten a shot of our guy.

177
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,880
我让神奇双胞胎来调查
I'll get the Wonder Twins on it.

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,500
他们从通风通道进来的
They came in through the ventilation system.

179
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,320
他们通过通风管道 跳到这个电脑的前方
They navigated the ductwork and dropped down in front of this station.

180
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,740
这层楼有多少这样的管道
How many systems on this floor?

181
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,080
- 呃 大概四十个  - 所以他们闯入这里
- Uh, maybe 40.  - So they break in,

182
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,380
他们俨然知道自己该黑哪个电脑
they know exactly which station to hack?

183
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,820
电脑系统没有被黑
The system wasn't hacked.

184
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,420
是正常登录的
It was accessed normally.

185
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,860
这就是为什么安保警报没有响 每台电脑需要
That's why no security was tripped. Every station needs

186
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,460
自己的密码登录他们的系统
a personal passkey to log on to their specific system.

187
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,380
这是谁的电脑
Whose station is this?

188
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,800
Roy Kessler的
Uh, Roy Kessler's.

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,860
但Roy是个好人
But Roy is a great guy.

190
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,580
让我猜猜
Let me guess,

191
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,360
好人会在周五的时候去喝玛格丽特酒
great guy that buys margaritas on Fridays?

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,680
- 嗯  - 然后今天还没有来上班
- Hm?  - And then didn't show up for work today.

193
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,860
事实上
As a matter of fact...

194
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
我需要他的住址
I'm gonna need his address.

195
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,400
我去打电话
I'm gonna call it in.

196
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,000
Roy Kessler订了一班离开Burbank的飞机
Roy Kessler has a flight booked out of Burbank,

197
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,100
你要赶快 他用了叫车服务
but you better hurry-- he's hired a car service

198
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,420
在二十分钟内接他去机场
to pick him up in 20 minutes.

199
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,200
好吧 Roy 让我们看看你带了啥
Okay, Roy, let's see what you got in here.

200
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,680
两条宽松裤
Two pair of slacks.

201
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,200
T恤
T-shirt.

202
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,900
出生证明
Birth certificate.

203
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,660
你去纽约就只准备带这些东西
You're taking a trip to New York and this is all you pack?

204
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,500
行程很匆忙吗
Are you in a rush?

205
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,320
我不了解你 但我去趟山谷都带了超多东西
I don't know about you, but I over-pack when I go to the valley.

206
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,720
也许他准备到那儿再买呢
Maybe he was gonna shop when he got there.

207
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,240
我能解释
I can explain.

208
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,600
我们知道你的钥匙被用于昨晚的抢劫
We know your passkey was used in the robbery last night.

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,700
你为什么要跑
Why were you running?

210
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,580
我知道这看上去像什么样...
I know how this looks...

211
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,680
我不认为你知道
I don't think you do.

212
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,120
好吧 听着...昨晚我和两个女孩在开派对
Okay, look... I was partying with these two girls last night.

213
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
我们不是一类人 但我想"泡她们" 好吗
Way out of my league. So I'm thinking working girls, right?

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,320
但那时我顾不了那么多
But at this point I could care less.

215
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,620
事情玩的有点过火
Things got a little crazy.

216
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
之后我只记得 我在家里醒来
Next thing I remember, I'm waking up at home.

217
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,140
独自一人
Alone.

218
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,940
我肯定是被下药了
I must have been drugged.

219
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,620
完全没照经典爱情故事的套路走啊
Nothing like a good old-fashioned honeypot.

220
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,920
直到我在新闻上看见抢劫的事
It wasn't until I heard about the robbery on the news

221
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,480
我才发现我的钥匙不见了
that I noticed that my passkey was missing.

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,540
所以你宁愿逃跑 也不愿意协助调查
So rather than help with the investigation, you decided to skip town.

223
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,680
我登录了系统检查窃贼们都看了什么东西 然后我慌了
I logged on to the system to see what the thieves accessed. I guess I panicked.

224
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,920
为什么
Why?

225
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,000
因为他们只拷走了部分MINDS的资料库
Because they only copied part of the MINDS databases.

226
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,960
哪部分的
Which part?

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
洛杉矶郡
Los Angeles County.

228
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,280
我们都很危险
We're all in danger.

229
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,720
所以我们从哪儿开始
Okay, so where do we even start?

230
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,640
挑选出最不可能的目标
Pinpointing a target's gonna be damn near impossible.

231
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,840
洛杉矶郡有4752平方英里
L.A. County's 4,752 square miles.

232
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,240
大海捞核啊
Got a nuke in a haystack.

233
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,000
我们不可能撤离整个郡的人
There's no way we can evacuate a whole county.

234
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
偷东西的人要么是为了赚钱
Whoever stole this thing is looking to make some coin,

235
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,640
要么就是到了恐怖袭击的最后阶段
or this is a terrorist attack in its final stage.

236
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,540
Stallworth的安全监控有好消息了
Well, the security camera from Stallworth's garage paid off.

237
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,280
枪手进入小巷的时候戴着滑雪面具
Our shooter entered the alley wearing a ski mask.

238
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,300
不好意思 这算啥子好消息
I'm sorry, how is that a payoff?

239
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,220
我们想着如果有人带着滑雪面具走来走去
Well, we figured someone walking around

240
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,320
一定会引起注意 所以我们查看了整个区域
in a ski mask would draw attention, so we scanned the area,

241
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,700
发现他在两个街区外用过付费电话
and we found him using a pay phone two blocks away.

242
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,560
一样的衣服 一样的身材 没戴面具
Same clothes, same build, no ski mask.

243
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,120
好吧 说真的 这年头谁还会用付费电话啊
Okay, honestly, who still uses a pay phone?

244
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,460
我宁愿去亲白脸猴也不要用付费电话
I'd rather kiss the Outbreak monkey than use a pay phone.

245
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,280
你是洁癖? 我可是见过你的公寓
How are you a germaphobe? I've seen your apartment.

246
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,160
哥对自己的细菌可没意见 而你 还有你们
Okay, I'm fine with my own germs, and you, of all people,

247
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,980
都不应雇家居清洁服务 我可是见过他们的清洁箱
should not be giving housekeeping notes. I've seen cleaner litter boxes.

248
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,160
喵~~
Oh, meow.

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,640
身份查到了吗
We got an I.D.?

250
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,520
没 面部识别还没有结果
No. Nothing through facial rec yet.

251
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,860
我去看看能否从那投币细菌培养皿
I'll see if the boys in blue

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,080
找到识别用图片
can pull a print off that coin-operated petri dish.

253
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
还记得我给你的口香糖吗
Remember that gum I gave you?

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,340
- 捡起来给你前掉浴室地板上了  - 一点都不好笑
- Dropped it on the bathroom floor first. - That's not funny.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,020
伙计们 枪炮军士Martin
Guys. Gunnery Sergeant Martin,

256
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,820
能源部的警卫 他刚做完手术 已经醒了
the D.O.E. Security guard, he just got out of surgery. He's conscious.

257
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,660
我去过两次中东 却在自家土地上被人枪击
Two tours in the Middle East, and I get shot at home.

258
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,140
还是当警卫被枪击的
And working as a security guard, no less.

259
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,340
- 你该庆幸你还活着  - 我可不这么确定
- You're lucky to be alive. - I'm not so sure about that.

260
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,580
子弹伤到了脊椎
Bullet nicked my spine.

261
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,720
医生不确定我还能不能走路
Doc's not sure I'm gonna walk again.

262
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,140
那就证明他们是错的
Then you prove them wrong.

263
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,380
你是个海军 海军就该这么做
You're a Marine; that's what you do.

264
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,220
好勒
Oorah to that.

265
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,080
关于事情经过 你有什么能告诉我们的吗
Is there anything else you can tell us about what happened?

266
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,580
给我手机
Uh... give me the phone.

267
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,700
你有线索
You got something?

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,100
我看见枪手开车跑了
I saw the shooter drive away.

269
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,200
晕过去之前试图拍了几张照片
Tried to snap a shot before I blacked out.

270
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,780
很棒的线索
This is a great lead.

271
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,240
海军训练的结果
Call it Marine training.

272
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,140
真是"好勒"
Oorah, indeed.

273
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,280
我听说你调出了Griffin的档案
I heard you pulled the Griffin file.

274
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,960
你是为这个来的吗
Is that why you're here?

275
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,840
还因为有个可能威胁洛杉矶郡的核弹这件小事吧
Well, that and the small matter of a possible nuclear bomb threatening L.A. County.

276
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,640
你认为Griffin是幕后黑手
You think Griffin's behind it?

277
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,640
我希望不是
I hope not.

278
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,900
这说得通
It makes sense.

279
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,680
几年前他们开始核侦测项目的时候
We suspected Griffin's team of selling secrets

280
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,680
我们就怀疑Griffin的团队在售卖机密
when they initiated the nuclear detection program years ago.

281
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,440
是的 但我们没有证据
Yes, but we couldn't prove anything.

282
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,820
但不代表他是无辜的
Doesn't mean he wasn't guilty.

283
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,960
你的调查毁了他的事业
Your investigation cost him his career.

284
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,980
他放纵的生活方式毁了他的事业
His destructive lifestyle cost him his career.

285
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,780
当然了
Of course.

286
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,740
你还在怪罪我放他走了
You still blame me for letting him go.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,880
我怪或不怪都不重要
Whether I do or don't is irrelevant.

288
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,020
重点是 如果Griffin是核袭击的幕后黑手
What matters is, if Griffin's behind a nuclear attack,

289
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,520
从海军部长到总司令都必然会怪罪于你
everyone from the SECNAV to the Commander in Chief most certainly will blame you.

290
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,180
这样的话 Henrietta
And that, Henrietta,

291
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,740
你这事业生涯就完了
will be the end of your career.

292
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,260
查到什么没
What do you got?

293
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,200
你们会给Martin军士
You may want to send

294
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,800
送个致谢花篮的 他手机上的照片
Gunnery Sergeant Martin an Edible Arrangement-- footage

295
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,140
传过来了
from his mobile device came through.

296
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,240
我可爱死这个了
I love those things.

297
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,680
奇异果是各种动物的形状
I get the kiwis in the shape of the animals,

298
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,560
我就装成狮子 扮成...
and I pretend I'm a lion, and I'm, like...

299
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,980
你才知道你话说多了点
You realize you're talking out loud, right?

300
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,720
是啊
Yeah.

301
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,640
好吧
Okay.

302
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,660
万花筒系统找到了枪手
Kaleidoscope got a hit on the shooters' plates.

303
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,840
- 在哪里  - 他人现在不在那里 可是...
- Where? - It's gone now, but...

304
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,340
一小时之前 那辆车就停在Echo公园的一个库房边上
an hour ago, the car was parked at a warehouse in Echo Park.

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,380
Callen和Sam已经在过去的路上了
Callen and Sam are already en route.

306
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,860
告诉他们我们也过去
Tell them we're on the way.

307
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,600
Kensi和Deeks
Kensi and Deeks

308
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,220
也在过来的路上了
are on their way.

309
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,880
锁上了 让我来
It's locked. I got it.

310
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,840
安全
Clear.

311
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,080
安全
Clear.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,560
啊哦
Well...

313
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,180
我就知道在古文字课上逃课迟早有报应
I knew skipping that hieroglyphics class goona come back to bite me

314
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,060
你觉得这些大头钉代表什么
What do you think the pins represent?

315
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,160
太多了 不像是MINDS的部署位置
There's too many to be MINDS locations.

316
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,940
这里一定有破解这些的东西
Has to be a key around here somewhere to decipher it.

317
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,440
哇哦 兄弟们 自己人
Whoa! Whoa, man. We're on your side.

318
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,060
我告诉我们进来的时候
I told you to send them an alert

319
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,840
- 跟他们说一声  - 我说了
- when we were coming in. - I did.

320
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,500
看 终于接到短信了
Oh! There it is.

321
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,320
不是我的错哦
It's not my fault

322
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,260
我们都到了 他们还没接到通知呢
we move faster than the speed of cellular.

323
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,820
我找到了点东西
I got something here.

324
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,680
是什么
What is it?

325
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,780
钴60的运输路线
It's routing information for cobalt 60.

326
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,280
- 这东西可是医学级同的同位素  - 医学级的
- That's medical- grade isotope. - Medical-grade?

327
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,240
那现在我们要解决的就不是核弹爆炸
That means we're not talking about a nuclear explosion.

328
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,000
当然不是 钴60是用来做脏弹的
No, cobalt 60's something you'd use to make a dirty bomb.

329
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,800
这东西炸响了
The blast waves from the explosion would be more lethal

330
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,060
可比辐射更要命
than a radioactive explosion.

331
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,040
他想吓唬人
He's trying to scare 'em.

332
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,500
心理上的恐吓
This is all about psychological harm.

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,710
想想看
Think about it.

334
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,200
大规模的骚乱...
Mass panic...

335
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,420
经济受损 恐慌
economic damage, terror.

336
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,900
这才不是大规模杀伤性武器
This isn't a weapon of mass destruction,

337
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,820
这会使国家分崩离析
it's a weapon of mass disruption.

338
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,700
这些标记都可能是钴60的位置
So these markers could all be cobalt 60 locations.

339
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,300
是啊 可这里看不出这些地方是哪里
Yeah, but there's no way to tell what these locations are.

340
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,080
Kensi 你和Deeks
Kensi, why don't you and Deeks focus

341
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,820
去查这个运输路线 看看这些大头针
on this routing information,see if you can pin point

342
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,300
指向能否指出钴60的来源
where this cobalt 60 came from.

343
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,020
这就去办
On it.

344
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,040
这东西没用
It's useless.

345
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,540
要是这家伙能搞到原料做脏弹
If this guy was able to secure materials

346
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,560
我们的时间就不够了
to make a dirty bomb, we may already be out of time.

347
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,860
想见我
You wanted to see me?

348
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,400
进度如何
How we doing?

349
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,660
嗯 仓库没人 不过拿到了不少情报
Well, nobody in the warehouse, but lots of intel.

350
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,440
我们正在尝试破译
We're trying to decipher it as we speak.

351
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,220
我正要过去看看能不能拿到第一手资料
I'm about to go on-site to get a firsthand look.

352
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,580
让Beale先生去吧
Send Mr. Beale.

353
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,660
好的
Okay.

354
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,560
我要知道这个人现在在哪里
I need to know where this man is.

355
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,620
Kelvin C. Griffin
Kelvin C. Griffin.

356
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,180
和这个案子有关
Is he involved in the case?

357
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,740
我希望不是
I hope not.

358
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
这件事情优先去做
This is priority one.

359
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,740
停下其它的事情 只要找到他
Drop everything. Find him.

360
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,620
我这就去做
I'll get right on it.

361
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,720
Nell
Nell?

362
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,100
结果只准我看
For my eyes only.

363
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,420
那是自然
Of course.

364
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
我们还是忘了什么
We're missing something.

365
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,900
除非奇迹出现 我们无计可施
It's impossible without the legend.

366
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,360
我来了 不过我可不是奇迹哦
I'm good, but I'm hardly a legend.

367
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,700
Nell呢
Where's Nell?

368
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,980
我还以为你会问"Eric 你怎么找到那个枪手的"
I think the question is, "Eric, how did you get an I.D.

369
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,820
答案是
on the shooter?" Answer:

370
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,380
我进入了CIA的数据库
I was granted access

371
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,680
作为交换
to the CIA database. In exchange

372
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,980
我以后要帮他们几个忙 别问是什么
for favors to be called in later. Don't ask.

373
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:46,960
就这个
Really?

374
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,600
是个...图像密码
Just a... picture password.

375
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,180
Ferat Hadad
Ferat Hadad.

376
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,160
他是叙利亚特种部队
He's a member

377
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,820
As-Sai'qa的成员
of As-Sai'qa.

378
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,920
叙利亚特种部队
Syrian special forces.

379
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,963
CIA那边可是什么都没说 不过我觉得
The CIA isn't talking, but you get the impression

380
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,500
他们可是很想抓住这家伙
that they want him real bad.

381
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,420
一个叙利亚的特种兵
So, a Syrian commando

382
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,240
手里拿着美国MINDS系统的部署图
has in his possession U.S. MINDS locations.

383
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,320
那他下一步要做什么
What's his next move?

384
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,720
不破解这个就没法知道
We may never know if we have to decipher all this first.

385
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
好吧 让我来
Well, allow me.

386
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,400
哦
Huh.

387
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,140
嗯 好吧 很有趣
Yeah. Okay, interesting.

388
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,020
非常有趣
Very interesting.

389
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,440
什么意思
What does it mean?

390
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,820
没有头绪
Not a clue.

391
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,450
我连进了
Oh, I'm patched in

392
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,040
能源部的安全系统
to the D.O.E. Security system.

393
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,100
- 他们收到了一个MINDS警报  - 在哪里
- They just got a MINDS alert. - Where?

394
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,440
呃 市中心的Grand Park
Uh, Grand Park. Downtown.

395
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
等一下
Hold on a second.

396
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
那他怎么办 我们不能把他丢在这里
What are we doing with him? We can't leave him here alone.

397
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,760
没事
He's not.

398
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,060
我来掩护
I'm the backup.

399
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,420
我们能问问题吗
Should we ask?

400
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,080
不行 赶紧出发吧
No. You should go, quickly.

401
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,220
嗨
Hi.

402
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,820
嗯 看起来挺平静的
Well, it looks pretty quiet.

403
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,160
我连卖培根包热狗的人
I don't even see the dude selling death by hot dog

404
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,020
- 都没见到  - 有可能是假警报吗
- wrapped in bacon. - Possible false alarm?

405
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,660
不对 是有什么东西引发了警报的
No, something set off that alarm.

406
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,320
这感觉就不对劲
This just doesn't feel right.

407
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,040
偷走了这技术的人肯定知道我们在看着警报的
Whoever stole that tech had to know we'd be on alert.

408
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,660
- 这可能是个陷进  - 没错 但不管
- This could be a setup. - That's true, but if there's

409
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,520
可能性有多小 我们都得查清楚
the slightest chance it's legit, we got to check it out.

410
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,180
好吧 我们分头行动
Right. Let's split up

411
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,100
清查这片区域
and sweep the area.

412
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,080
注意别人遗弃的物品 检查垃圾桶周围
Look for anything abandoned-- check the trash cans,

413
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,280
还有任何被人留下的东西
search for anything deserted.

414
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,980
明白了
Got it.

415
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,940
也有可能在某个人身上
Could be on someone's person.

416
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,160
你是说类似炸弹背心那样吗
You mean like a bomb vest?

417
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,340
那里 穿着米黄色外套的家伙
There. Guy in the beige jacket.

418
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,100
是Hadad
It's Hadad.

419
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
他在等人的样子
He's looking for somebody.

420
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,500
他开始移动了
He's on the move.

421
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,960
我从右边包抄
I'll take the right flank.

422
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,240
别动 我是联邦探员
Stop! Federal agents!

423
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,340
都结束了
It's over!

424
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,540
快放她走
Let her go.

425
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,080
马上放下武器
Drop your weapon! Now!

426
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,720
别开枪
Don't do it.

427
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,480
千万别开枪
Do not do it.

428
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,180
Hadad
Hadad!

429
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,150
跟我来吧
Come with me.

430
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,980
你还好吧
Are you okay?

431
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,350
嗯 我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

432
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,360
我们是联邦探员 你现在安全了
We're federal agents. You're safe.

433
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,200
噢 天啊
Oh, my God...

434
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,540
没找到炸弹
No bomb.

435
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Callen
Callen.

436
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,240
我猜你没想过要试着把他活捉吧
I don't suppose it occurred to you to try and take him alive?

437
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,620
他手上有人质
He had a hostage.

438
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,880
Hetty在哪里
Where's Hetty?

439
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,720
跟Beale呆在一起
With Beale.

440
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
怎么了 发生什么事了
Why? What's going on?

441
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
没有你想知道的事
Nothing you want to know about.

442
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,060
看这里
Check it out.

443
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,860
西门口 两点钟
West doors, 2:00,

444
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,280
穿着灰西服 觉得他们是要见面呢
gray suit. Think they're having a meeting,

445
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,200
还是他在跟踪他
or you think he was following him?

446
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,340
Hadad这样的人
Guy like Hadad?

447
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,700
是来这里干掉他的
He was here to take him out.

448
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,240
也许Nell可以
Maybe Nell can...

449
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
找出他的身份
tell us who he is.

450
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,560
Hadad没有穿炸弹背心 那是什么触发了MINDS警报
Hadad's not wearing a bomb vest, so what set off the MINDS alert?

451
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,160
不好意思
Excuse me.

452
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,360
- 能借来用一下吗  - 当然
- Can I borrow this? - Sure.

453
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,000
谢了
Thank you.

454
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,200
不好意思 伙计们
Excuse me, guys.

455
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,860
很微弱的剂量
It's weak,

456
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
不过还是有反应
but it's positive.

457
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
你找到什么了
Did you find something?

458
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,140
钴60 这家伙衣服上都沾满了
Cobalt 60. The guy's clothes are covered in it.

459
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,020
- 呃  - 放松
- Uh... - Relax.

460
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,440
这比我们每天接触到的剂量还要少
It's less than what we're exposed to on a daily basis,

461
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,280
不过也足够触发感测器了
but it was enough to set the sensors off.

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,080
我们还是赶紧洗个澡好吧
We should probably still take a shower.

463
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
我知道杂志上这家伙的身份了
I got a positive I.D. On our magazine guy.

464
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,710
Richard Towson
The guy's name is Richard Towson.

465
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,640
他是在俄亥俄州东克利夫兰的一名商人
He's a businessman in East Cleveland, Ohio.

466
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,850
俄亥俄 那他在洛杉矶干什么
Ohio? What's he doing in Los Angeles?

467
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,600
他不在这
He's not.

468
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,940
他还在俄亥俄
He's still in Ohio.

469
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,120
Hadad在这里追杀一个
Hadad was targeting a man

470
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,980
两千里之外的人 完全说不通啊
2,000 miles away-- it makes no sense.

471
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,480
假如Hadad是被设计来
It might if Hadad was set up

472
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,180
触发这些探测器的话 这也许就说通了 他们在测算我们的反应方案
to trigger the sensors-- they're gauging our protocol.

473
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,420
空旷的地方
Wide-open space...

474
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,650
可能有大量平民
possibility of large groups of people.

475
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
反应时间 联邦探员出动
Response times, agencies,

476
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,840
装置敏感度
device sensitivity.

477
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:18,920
这是一次测试
It's a test.

478
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
好吧 如果他愿意浪费
Well, so if he's willing to sacrifice

479
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,480
- 放射性材料来做一次测试  - 那么他就
- radioactive material on a test...  - It stands to reason

480
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,560
更有可能做了一个真正的脏弹了
he has more to make an actual dirty bomb.

481
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:25,960
没错
Right.

482
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,660
很好
Wonderful.

483
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,760
我去 这没道理
Damn, it makes no sense.

484
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,440
每次我以为快找到模式的时候 它就又改变了
Every time I think I'm close, the pattern changes.

485
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,840
这里实在有太多点了
There are just too many pins.

486
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,320
坚持下去 Beale先生
Persistence, Mr. Beale.

487
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,100
我已经试过所有已知的破解密码的方程了
I've tried every code-cracking formula known to man.

488
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,940
或许你该试一下女人知道的方法
Maybe it's time to try those known to women.

489
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,100
你是在暗示Nell
Are you suggesting that Nell

490
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,020
比我在这方面更厉害吗
is better at these sort of things?

491
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,540
她是吗
Is she?

492
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,960
我可以问个问题吗
Can I ask you a question,

493
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,240
Hetty
Hetty?

494
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,520
我还是宁愿
I'd probably prefer

495
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,760
你专注于眼前的任务吧
you focus on the task at hand.

496
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,860
你为什么会在这里
Why are you here?

497
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
发生什么事了
What's going on?

498
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,400
一切都好吗
Is everything okay?

499
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,520
其实 呃 有可能
It's, uh, possible...

500
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,620
在这事情的幕后黑手
that the man who's behind this

501
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,100
是一个曾经
is someone who once...

502
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,540
逃出我手掌心的人
slipped through my fingers.

503
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,120
那糟透了
That sucks.

504
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,140
没错
Indeed.

505
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,300
嗯 这看起来有点希望
Hmm, this looks promising.

506
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,580
你王八儿子的密码就在这
You sneaky son of a cipher.

507
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,980
这是什么
What are we looking at?

508
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,320
这是整个
It's a map...

509
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,560
- 西海岸的地图  - 那这个是干嘛的
- of the entire West Coast. - Let's see what this one does.

510
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,580

这是用颜色来区分
It's color-coded.

511
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,106
黄色棋子沿着黄色边界走
Yellow flags go with the yellow border.

512
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,040
还有这个
And this one.

513
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,200
我最靠谱的想法是 这些大头针指着
My best guess is, these pins represent

514
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,700
从圣地亚哥一路到西雅图
vulnerable targets from San Diego

515
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,900
所有守卫薄弱的目标
all the way up to Seattle.

516
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,770
那红色旗子呢
And the red flags?

517
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,520
这些沿着红色边界走
They go with the red border.

518
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,700
旗子代表的是他的目标
The flags must represent his targets.

519
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,220
这一次
Which, in this case,

520
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,220
则是洛杉矶市中心半径一英里的范围
is a one-mile radius of downtown Los Angeles.

521
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,440
我们在和FBI 洛杉矶警局
We're coordinating with FBI, LAPD

522
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,080
还有核紧急事态搜寻队协调当中了 部长先生
and the NEST teams, Mr. Secretary.

523
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,920
我们已经接近他们了
We're closing in on them.

524
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,640
一有消息就会通知你的 先生
The moment we do, sir.

525
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,940
告诉我我们有所进展吧
Tell me we got something.

526
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,940
确定了市中心半径一英里的范围
A one-mile radius around downtown

527
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,480
还是有几百个潜在目标可能受到袭击
still leaves hundreds of potential targets.

528
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:10,248
我们在确定袭击目标上跟
And we're no closer to finding the target

529
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,240
找到设计Hadad的人一样毫无进展
than we are to finding the guy who set up Hadad.

530
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,540
这说不通 原本这次就可以发动袭击了
Doesn't add up. This could've been the attack.

531
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,500
为什么还要等
Why wait?

532
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,020
可能是想转移视线
Could be a diversion.

533
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,960
那我们还应该注意找些什么
So what else in the area should we be looking at?

534
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,400
不是我们要找什么
It's not what we're looking at,

535
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,500
而是谁在注意我们
it's what's looking at us.

536
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,260
想一想
Think about it.

537
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,540
如果你来做这个测试
If this is your test,

538
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,680
你怎么知道有没有成功
how do you know if you're successful?

539
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,200
没错 慢慢散开
All right, fan out.

540
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,440
我们要找一个局外围观的人
We're looking for an outlier.

541
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,020
听起来就像个偷窥狂 从远处观察
Sounds like a voyeur-- they observe from a distance,

542
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,630
长焦镜头 双面镜
telephoto lens, two-way mirrors.

543
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,820
有什么想说的吗 Deeks
Something you want to tell me, Deeks?

544
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
不要理趴在你浴室窗台
Just ignore the garden gnome

545
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,840
- 的小地精好了  - 好了 现在
- outside your bedroom window.  - Okay. Now,

546
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,640
我们能连进应急部队的俯视镜头吗
can we get a bird's-eye view of the response teams?

547
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,500
我想我们要找的人可能就藏在最明显的地方
We're thinking our guy might be hiding in plain sight.

548
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,940
好了 我连进了周围的几个监控镜头
Okay, I've got eyes on the area from multiple feeds.

549
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,840
看一下
Let's see.

550
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,970
在Hill街的东南角
Southeast corner of Hill Street,

551
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,760
有一个穿着核紧急事态搜寻队外套的男人
there's a man in a NEST windbreaker.

552
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,860
他一直站在警戒范围以外
He's standing just outside the police perimeter.

553
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,510
Nell 我们没看到他
Nell, we don't see him.

554
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:14,980
找到了
Got him.

555
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,540
噢 靠
Oh, boy.

556
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,160
怎么啦 Nell
What is it, Nell?

557
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,640
额 没事
Uh, it's nothing.

558
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,343
他走进了地铁站
Uh, he is heading down into the metro station.

559
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,110
Kensi Deeks 去西边的入口
Kensi, Deeks, move to the west entrance.

560
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,200
我们夹击他
We'll flush him to you.

561
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,840
记住要活捉
Remember to take him alive.

562
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,320
快点让开
Move! Out of the way!

563
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:57,920
不好意思
Excuse me!

564
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
不好意思
Excuse me.

565
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,900
让开 让开
Move! Move!

566
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,140
找到他了
We got him.

567
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,040
- 联邦探员 停下来  - 嚓
- Federal agents! Stop! - Damn it!

568
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,640
快点 快点
Come on! Come on!

569
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,420
快上来 快点 快啊
Come on, come on, come on!

570
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
这就是我为啥讨厌坐地铁了
This is why I hate taking the subway.

571
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
还记得我吗
Remember me?

572
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,900
嗯
Yeah.

573
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,900
就是你这鸡婆毁了我的一生
You're the stump that ruined my life.

574
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,680
Hetty认识这家伙吗
Hetty knows this guy?

575
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,200
她放过他了一次
She let him go once.

576
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,410
有人告诉我她不会再犯
Something tells me she's not gonna make

577
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,460
同一个错误了
that mistake again.

578
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,420
你发誓说你是无辜的
You swore you were innocent.

579
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,940
你对我发誓的
You swore to me,

580
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,700
可是我们还是又在这里见面了
and yet here we are again.

581
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,560
你帮助研发
You helped develop the, uh,

582
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,280
这个监测项目来保卫这个国家
detection program to defend the country.

583
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,140
来保护
To protect...

584
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,160
人们
people...

585
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,000
例如你的孩子
like your own children.

586
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,780
你曾经是一名爱国者啊
You were a patriot.

587
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,940
但在某地方 你迷失了自我
Somewhere, you lost your way.

588
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,580
我们每个人都会或多或少遇到这种事情
It happens to all of us...at some point.

589
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,700
这不会为你所做的事情做出补偿
This won't make up for what you've done,

590
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,300
但这是必须要走的一步
but it's a step.

591
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,580
而你还是能拯救生命
And you can still...save lives.

592
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,940
目标是什么
What is the target?

593
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,860
我不知道
I don't know.

594
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,580
我觉得你还没明白
I don't think you understand.

595
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
一切都结束了
It's... over.

596
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,400
我只是测试场景
I was just running scenarios...

597
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,820
收集数据
collecting data.

598
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,300
我需要钱
I needed the money.

599
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,220
我不知道他们的目标是什么
I don't know their target.

600
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,020
- 他们的吗 - 是啊 在Hancock公园有个屋子
- "Their"?  - Yeah. There's a house in Hancock Park,

601
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,100
属于俄罗斯领事馆
and it belongs to the Russian Consulate.

602
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,820
那个数据 被加密了
The data, it's encrypted,

603
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,280
但它拖不了他们那么久的
but it won't take them that long.

604
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,860
你把我们的核侦测技术
You sold our nuclear detection technology

605
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,180
卖给俄罗斯了吗
to the Russians?

606
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,960
当你觉得冷战已经结束的时候
Just when you thought the Cold War was over.

607
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,120
还远着呢
Not even close.

608
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,460
所以 我们现在干嘛
So, what are we gonna do now?

609
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,600
为你的职业生涯没有结束高兴一下
Be happy your career's not over.

610
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,460
这不是Hetty的错
This is not Hetty's fault.

611
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,700
已经不重要了
Doesn't matter.

612
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,060
在这个游戏里 Blye探员
In this game, Agent Blye,

613
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,600
总要有人背黑锅的
somebody always takes the blame.

614
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,540
总要有些事是我们可以做的
There has got to be something that we can do.

615
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,980
现在这是白宫的噩梦了
This is an Oval Office nightmare now.

616
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,900
俄罗斯人想要从洛杉矶的核探测系统
What do the Russians want

617
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,520
中得到什么
with L.A.'s nuclear detection system?

618
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,880
冷战在发酵
The Cold War's heating up.

619
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,130
朋友或敌人 国家之间都相互收集信息
Friend or foe, nations collect intel on each other.

620
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,880
不知道什么时候他们会用上它
Never know when they'll need or use it.

621
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,040
- 或者分享  - 嘿 伙计们
- Or share it. - Hey, guys.

622
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,680
确定Griffin指认的那套房子属于
The house Griffin identified

623
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,840
俄罗斯领事馆
does indeed belong to the Russian Consulate.

624
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,180
这意味着它是外国领土
Which means it's considered foreign soil.

625
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,600
所以我们不能破门而入
So we can't just bang on the door

626
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,700
然后告诉他们交出来吗
and tell them to hand it over?

627
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,000
不造成国际事件下不行
Not without causing an international incident.

628
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,280
你被抓了才是国际事件
It's only an international incident if you get caught.

629
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,700
哇 不 剧透警报
Whoa. No. Spoiler alert.

630
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,980
我不想听到这个
I do not want to hear this.

631
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,860
捂上耳朵
Uh, cover your ears.

632
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,200
我们在一国的 Beale
We're all in this together, Beale.

633
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
想想这个 G
Think about this, G.

634
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,840
闯进外国领事馆
Breaking into a foreign consulate,

635
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,180
这个行动 一旦我们被抓到
an action which, if we're caught...

636
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,160
政府就会否认我们的存在
forces our government to disavow us.

637
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,360
如果你们不想被卷进来 我能理解
I understand if you don't want to be involved in this one.

638
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,200
你说什么呢 我加入
What are you talking about? I'm in.

639
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,680
我在讨论他们
I'm talking about them.

640
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,740
我们不那么做 我们就会失去Hetty
We don't do this, we lose Hetty.

641
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,800
我们加入
We are in.

642
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,100
是Hetty
Yeah, it's Hetty.

643
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,280
顺便说一句 如果Kensi去 我也去
Besides, if Kensi goes, I go.

644
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,140
这就是我们的相处之道
That's how we roll.

645
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,440
你知道我们这次行动不受保护吧
You realize we're off the reservation with this one.

646
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,245
我们都可能受到指控
We could all be subject to criminal charges.

647
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
俄罗斯会试图引渡我们
Russia may even try and extradite us.

648
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,360
还没去过俄罗斯
Never been to Russia.

649
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,560
我听说古拉格每年这个时候都风景不错
I hear the Gulags are lovely this time of year.

650
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
哈喽 我是南方天然气公司的
Hello. I'm with the South Hills Gas Company.

651
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,560
有事吗
Yes?

652
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,460
这里有一个地震三角带
There's a been a quake-- three-pointer.

653
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,860
我感觉不到任何事
I didn't feel anything.

654
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:28,134
哦 是的 说明你已经习惯了
Ooh, yeah, that means you're getting used to it.

655
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,760
你知道 就我个人而言 6级以下的小震
You know, personally, I don't get out of bed

656
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,980
我都懒得下床
for anything less than a six-banger.

657
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,260
知道我说什么呢吗
Know what I'm saying?

658
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,820
不 我不知道
No, I don't.

659
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,200
不管怎样 我们发现一个七级的煤气泄漏
Anyhoo, we have a class-seven gas main leak,.

660
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,260
作为安全防护措施 我们要疏散人群
We're evacuating people as a safety precaution.

661
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,260
- 我们不会的  - 好吧 额 Fern
- We will not. - Okay, uh, Fern,

662
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,800
我这里有超过五级的
I'm getting some serious class-five

663
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,460
氢的读数 所以我们应该
hydrogen readings here, so we should probably...

664
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,840
什么玩意 Fern
What the hell, Fern!

665
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,100
你们这些人怎么还在这里
What are these people still doing here?

666
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,320
这玩意儿分分钟有可能爆炸
This thing could blow up at any second.

667
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,500
你想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

668
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,020
他不想离开这里 这是个自由的国家
He won't leave. It's a free country.

669
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,740
他们不想离开这是因为 你从哪里来 先生
They won't leave 'cause it's... Where you from, sir?

670
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,380
Vladivostok
Vladivostok.

671
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,360
Vladi... vos.. 好吧 听着 我不知道那是哪里
Vladi... vos... Okay, listen, I don't know where that is,

672
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,220
但是这里是美国 这房子底下
but here in America, we have a hydrogen pipe

673
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,680
铺设了氢气管道
running right underneath this house,

674
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,940
除非你想在爆炸时
and unless you want to be inside of it

675
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,720
待在里面 否则我建议你离开
when it blows up, I suggest you vacate.

676
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,900
好吧 就这么着吧 如果他被炸上天了
Okay, you know what, if he blows up,

677
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,480
全都怪你 让他签免责协议
this is on you-- have him sign a waiver.

678
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,900
洛杉矶这座城市依旧在Hancock
The city of Los Angeles is still recovering

679
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,640
公园的强烈地震恢复的过程中
from an earthquake that struck the Hancock Park area...

680
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,620
给我们一点时间
Give us a few moments.

681
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,660
伙计们 五区停电了
Guys, we got a power outage in sector five.

682
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,940
等一下
Hold on.

683
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,580
收到 五区
Copy that, sector five.

684
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,060
伙计们 我们得走了 来吧

685
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,440
我们走 走啊
Let's go, let's go.

686
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,440
有人在屋里吗 先生
Is that everybody in the house, sir?

687
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,280
要多久才能好
How long this will take?

688
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,480
我希望不要太久
Hopefully, not long.

689
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,200
幽灵1和2号 可以起行
Phantom 1 and 2, you're a go.

690
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,440
目标朝你去了
Bogey headed your way.

691
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,040
我看到他了
I got him.

692
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,580
这得要多久才好

693
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,280
至少还有30分钟

694
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,460
不 我们现在得走了

695

我没完成呢

696
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,960
你可以在飞机上继续

697
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,020
你可以在飞机上继续

698
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,740
他们准备离开
They're moving the drives.

699
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,840
现在不动手就没机会了
It's now or never.

700
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,060
我会吸引他的注意力
I'll draw him to me.

701
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,640
低调点
Make it quiet.

702
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,000
速战速决
Make it fast.

703
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,000
真是太低调了
So much for quiet.

704
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,920
伙计们 我们这里有余震
Guys, we've got some aftershock activity going on here.

705
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,820
派些穿梭巴士来带走这些人
Let's get those shuttles in to clear these folks out.

sir, sorry, I can't let you back in there

707
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,340
我不能让你进去

708
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,460
滚开
Get out of my way.

709
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,520
这就是你低调的方式吗
That's your idea of quiet?

710
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,670
- 你有快的方法吗  - 但愿你能搞定这个橱柜
Was that your idea of fast?  - Hope you can fix that cabinet.

711
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,260
不 这需要一个专业的
No, that's definitely gonna take a professional.

712
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,500
伙计们 时间到了
Guys, time's up.

713
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,160
他们准备进来了
They're coming back in.

714
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,700
快点上楼

715
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,160
你叫了穿梭巴士吗
You call for a shuttle?

716
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,420
- 好了吗  - 还没
- We good? - Not yet.

717
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,100
车在这里
Ride's here!

718
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,320
我们上
Let's go!

719
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,280
好了 快 快 快
Well, go, go, go!

720
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,880
洛杉矶警局报告在俄罗斯领事馆
LAPD reported a gunfight

721
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,720
附近有枪战
in the vicinity of the Russian Consulate.

722
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,940
最好别让我发现你
I better not find out you had s...

723
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,840
天哪 不要
God, no.

724
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,500
告诉我你们没干
Tell me you didn't.

725
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,300
没干什么
Didn't what?

726
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,220
再耍花腔否认也救不了你
Plausible deniability won't save you.

727
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,780
你批准了吗
And you sanctioned this?

728
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,340
我一直在这里跟你在一起 Owen
I've been here with you, Owen.

729
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,600
你们知道你们干了什么吗
Do you have any idea what you've done?

730
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,980
拿回我们的科技
Retrieved our technology?

731
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,000
让世界更美好吗
Made the world a better place?

732
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,500
还要干得漂亮
And looked good while doing it.

733
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,080
这会毁了我们跟俄罗斯的关系
This is gonna destroy our relationship with the Russians.

734
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,160
他们不先承认偷窃
They can't make any accusations

735
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,800
就没办法做出任何指控
without admitting they stole it in the first place.

736
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,120
是的 部长先生
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

737
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,900
不 先生
No, sir.

738
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,020
不 先生 事情不完全是那样的
No, sir, that's not quite how it went down.

739
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,120
你还好吗 Hetty
You good, Hetty?

740
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,000
好极了
Just dandy.

741
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,380
我明白
I understand.

742
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,480
你觉得我们在做我们该做的事情的时候
How many lives do you think we've ruined

743
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,420
毁掉了多少生命
doing what we do?

744
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,320
谢谢你 部长先生
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

745
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,400
比不上我们救了的
Not nearly as many as we've saved.

746
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,620
你在这点上躲过去了
Well... you dodged the bullet on this one.

747
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,260
如果你再发生这种事情
But if any of you ever pull something like this again...

748
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,160
你们都会受应得惩罚的
You all deserve each other.

749
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,600
我也这样想的
I certainly like to think so.

750
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,060
有人要喝伏特加吗
Anyone for a vodka?

751
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:14,488
== Deeks你是妇唱夫随吗 ==
