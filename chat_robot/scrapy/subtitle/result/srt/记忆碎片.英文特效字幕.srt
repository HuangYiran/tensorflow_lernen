00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where are you?

4
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're in some motel room.

5
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:41,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just... You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.

6
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:42,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's the key.

7
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It feels like maybe it's the first time you've been there, but...

8
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}perhaps you've been there for a week, three months.

9
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kind of hard to say. I don't... I don't know.

10
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just an anonymous room.

11
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy.

12
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's here already.

13
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny!

14
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:06,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Leonard...

15
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like I told you before.

16
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you? I must have forgot.

17
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I've already told you about my condition.

18
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:17,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, only every time I see you.

19
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:28,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My car.

20
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your car.

21
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you're in a playful mood.

22
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not good for you to make fun of someone's handicap.

23
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just trying to have a little fun.

24
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roll up your window.

25
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:53,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's broken.

26
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can get that fixed for you.

27
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:57,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where to, Sherlock?

28
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a lead on a place.

29
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what the hell do you wanna go there for?

30
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:02,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know it?

31
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:05,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. Why do you wanna go there?

32
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:07,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't remember.

33
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like somebody's home.

34
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, that thing's been here for years.

35
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:37,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? These tracks are only a few days old.

36
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

37
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:43,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

38
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's take a look inside.

39
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Teddy."

40
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:16,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Don't believe his lies. He is the one. Kill him."

41
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I finally found him.

42
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have I been looking?

43
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:23,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find anything?

44
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:26,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't think so.

45
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, huh?

46
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck this.

47
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna pay for what you did.

48
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.

49
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a clue, you freak.

50
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:48,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out.

51
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

52
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:53,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You don't even know my name. -Teddy.

53
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:56,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's 'cause you read it off a fucking picture.

54
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know who you are.

55
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

56
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's who you were.

57
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:04,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not...

58
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:06,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what you've become.

59
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shut your mouth. -You want to know, Lenny?

60
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on, let's go down to the basement.

61
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go down, you and me, together.

62
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you'll know who you really are.

63
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just an anonymous room.

64
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway.

65
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing except the Gideon Bible,

66
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:34,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which I, of course, read religiously.

67
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you know who you are,

68
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you know kind of all about yourself.

69
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But just for day-to-day stuff,

70
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}notes are really useful.

71
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:51,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy Jankis had the same problem, but he really had no system.

72
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes, but he'd get them all mixed up.

73
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really do need a system if...

74
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you're gonna make it work.

75
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,787


76
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,763


77
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.

78
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do for you, Leonard?

79
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:02,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burt.

80
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:05,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.

81
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:06,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know?

82
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not too good on the phone.

83
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.

84
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:14,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember saying that?

85
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's the thing. I have this condition.

86
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:17,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Condition?

87
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:18,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my memory.

88
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amnesia?

89
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. It's different from that. I have no short-term memory.

90
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who I am. I know all about myself.

91
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since my injury, I can't make new memories.

92
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything fades.

93
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started.

94
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:35,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next time I see you, I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

95
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know if I've met you before.

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if I seem a little strange or rude or something, uh...

97
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've told you this before, haven't I?

98
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I mean, I don't mean to mess with you, but it's so weird.

99
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You don't remember me at all? -No.

100
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We've talked a bunch of times. -I'm sure we have.

101
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what's the last thing you remember?

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife.

103
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:02,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's it like?

104
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:11,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like waking. It's like you just woke up.

105
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must suck.

106
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:17,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all backwards, I mean.

107
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:20,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, maybe you get an idea about what you want to do next,

108
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you don't remember what you just did.

109
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm exactly the opposite...

110
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:27,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How long have I been staying here? -A couple of days.

111
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And you're holding my calls? -Like you said.

112
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:32,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, but this guy's an exception.

113
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know this guy?

114
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:37,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's your friend, right?

115
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes you think he's my friend?

116
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just saw you together, that's all.

117
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:42,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not my friend.

118
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he calls or if he shows up here,

119
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you give me a call in my room, okay?

120
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What, his name's Teddy? -Teddy, yeah.

121
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

122
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:54,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I hope my condition's not gonna be a problem for you.

123
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:57,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.

124
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Forty. -Forty.

125
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy...

126
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's here already.

127
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny!

128

129
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really need a system if you're gonna make it work.

130
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You kind of learn to trust your own handwriting.

131
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That becomes an important part of your life.

132
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You write yourself notes.

133
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And where you put your notes... That also becomes important.

134
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:28,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need a jacket that's got like six pockets in it.

135
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Particular pockets for particular things.

136
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.

137
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:37,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to be wary of other people writing stuff for you,

138
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it's gonna lead you astray.

139
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I don't know how these people try and take advantage of somebody

140
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with this condition. If you have a piece of information...

141
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:53,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is vital, writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.

142
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

143
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:04,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this?

00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:14,066

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, just go straight out on Sixth Street.

00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:55,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's easy. Just go...

215
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll end up eating your underwear.

216
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:14,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

217
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

218
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you. It's nothing personal.

219
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do have information for you.

220
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave me a license plate number.

221
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had my friend at D.M.V. Trace it.

222
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:36,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess what name came up.

223
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Edward Gammell. John G.

224
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:41,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know him?

225
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:45,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, But his face on his driver's license looked really familiar.

226
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

227
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.

228
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure you want this?

229
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have I told you what this man did? -Yeah.

230
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you shouldn't have to ask.

231
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But even if you get revenge, you're not gonna remember it.

232
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not even gonna know that it happened.

233
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:05,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife deserves vengeance.

234
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:07,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.

235
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because there are things I don't remember

236
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't make my actions meaningless.

237
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world doesn't just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?

238
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph to remind myself,

239
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get another freaky tattoo.

240
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about her again.

241
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

242
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you like to remember her.

243
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:36,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was beautiful.

244
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-To me, she was perfect. -No.

245
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't just recite the words.

246
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:48,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close your eyes... and remember her.

247
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can just feel the details.

248
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:07,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.

249
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:14,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can feel these extreme moments...

250
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even if you don't want to.

251
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You put these together, and you get the feel of a person.

252
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough to know how much you miss them...

253
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:36,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and how much you hate the person who took them away.

254
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, um... I added an address in here.

255
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:53,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might be useful. It's an abandoned place outside of town.

256
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

257
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's isolated.

258
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:01,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds perfect.

259
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:05,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I owe you any...

260
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't helping you for money.

261
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

262
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. See, you have this condition.

263
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:18,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304? You left it at my place.

264
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:29,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They treating you okay? -I don't remember.

265
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what we have in common?

266
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are both survivors.

267
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take care, Leonard.

268
00:22:12,537 --> 00:22:14,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Remember Sammy Jankis."

269
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:19,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator.

270
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:22,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.

271
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to see through people's bullshit.

272
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:26,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was useful experience, 'cause now it's my life.

273
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I meet someone, I don't know if I've met them before.

274
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.

275
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My job taught me the best way to find out...

276
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:36,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what someone knew was just to let them talk...

277
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and watch the eyes and the body language.

278
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If someone scratches their nose while they're talking,

279
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:44,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}experts tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous.

280
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context.

281
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:49,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I was good.

282
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:52,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy was my first real challenge.

283
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Lenny!

284
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:01,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you split for good.

285
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, things change. -So I see.

286
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:06,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's Teddy.

287
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I've told you about my condition.

288
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only every time I see you.

289
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:11,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

290
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have I told you about Sammy Jankis? -Mm. Yeah.

291
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

292
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about John G? you think he still here?

293
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:27,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who? -Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

294
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you haven't left town, am I right?

295
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

296
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:32,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard, look, you have to be very careful.

297
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:33,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

298
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:36,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other day you mentioned that maybe somebody was trying to set you up,

299
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get you to kill the wrong guy.

300
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.

301
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:45,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.

302
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:47,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why not? -Because your notes could be unreliable.

303
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Memory's unreliable. -Oh, please!

304
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good.

305
00:23:52,337 --> 00:23:53,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask the police.

306
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

307
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cops don't catch a killer by remembering stuff.

308
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:58,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right...

309
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.

310
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Facts, not memories.

311
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:06,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how you investigate. It's what I used to do.

312
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:09,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, memory can change the shape of a room. It can change the color of a car.

313
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:12,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And memories can be distorted.

314
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:14,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just an interpretation. They're not a record.

315
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

316
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really want to get this guy, don't you?

317
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He killed my wife. He took away my fucking memory.

318
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He destroyed my ability to live.

319
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:32,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're living.

320
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:35,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only for revenge.

321
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:37,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then we'll get the bastard.

322
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you staying?

323
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:43,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Discount Inn.

324
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:47,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what room. I haven't got my key.

325
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably left in in your room.

326
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm checked in here, but I think I've misplaced my key.

327
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:08,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing, Leonard?

328
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably in the room, right?

329
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't see my key anywhere. -This is the wrong room.

330
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're in 304 now. -I'm sorry. I fucked up.

331
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:36,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This is not my room? -No.

332
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's go.

333
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is this my handwriting?

334
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,198


335
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:47,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was your room, but now you're in 304.

336
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:49,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When was I in here? -Last week.

337
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then I rented you another room on top of it.

338
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:52,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

339
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:56,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Business is slow. I mean, I told my boss about the...

340
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your condition and stuff, and he said try and rent him another room.

341
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit-hole?

342
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just two, so far.

343
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:07,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least you're being honest about ripping me off.

344
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:09,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're not gonna remember anyway.

345
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

346
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard,

347
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:15,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}always get a receipt.

348
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

349
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,168


350
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, what time is it? -Quarter to one.

351
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:26,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

352
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:28,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your room's...

353
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Natalie? -You don't remember me.

354
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:46,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.

355
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:49,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

356
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the guy's a 58-year-old semiretired accountant.

357
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:55,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He and his wife had been in this car accident. Nothing too serious.

358
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's acting funny. He can't get a handle on what's going on.

359
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.

360
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:04,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing conclusive,

361
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:07,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.

362
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't work, can't do shit.

363
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The medical bills pile up. His wife calls the insurance company,

364
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I get sent in.

365
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:18,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.

366
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get you some coffee?

367
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy can think just fine,

368
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:21,857


369
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he can't make any new memories.

370
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:26,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He can only remember things for a couple of minutes. -This is Mr. Shelby.

371
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd watch TV, but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing.

372
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He couldn't remember how it began.

373
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He liked commercials. They were short.

374
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy. It's time for my shot.

375
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:37,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The crazy part was...

376
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this guy who couldn't even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore...

377
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:44,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could do the most complicated things...

378
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:45,853


379
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as long as he learned them before the accident...

380
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:51,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.

381
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:52,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be gentle.

382
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:57,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the doctors assure me there's a real condition called anterial-grade...

383
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:02,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}memory loss, or short-term memory loss. It's rare, but legit.

384
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every time I see him...

385
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I catch this look,

386
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this slight...

387
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}look of recognition.

388
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he says he can't remember me at all.

389
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy, it's okay.

390
00:28:16,702 --> 00:28:17,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it. I got it.

391
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mr. Shelby.

392
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

393
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:23,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Mr. Shelby, Sammy.

394
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:24,924


395
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

396
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awake.

397
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, where am I?

398
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody's bedroom.

399
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, it must be her room.

400
00:28:46,762 --> 00:28:48,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But who is she?

401
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:57,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only me.

402
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you sleep okay? -Yeah. You?

403
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. Shit! I got to be someplace.

404
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:15,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty weird.

405
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:19,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?

406
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:20,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, um...

407
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:23,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be able to talk to my friend today...

408
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about the license plate.

409
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:27,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the license plate.

410
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:29,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John G.'s license plate.

411
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:34,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have it tattooed on your thigh.

412
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:53,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Natalie."

413
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"She has also lost someone.

414
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She will help you out of pity."

415
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:07,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's registered in this state,

416
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it should only take a couple of seconds to pull up his license and registration.

417
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

418
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?

419
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not too good on the phone.

420
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:27,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's great that you...

421
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, that you're helping me like this.

422
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm helping you because you helped me.

423
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So next time you see me,

424
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will you remember me?

425
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you will.

426
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

427
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?

428
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:37,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Lenny!

429
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you split for good.

430
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:42,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

431
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:47,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I find something in my research: Conditioning.

432
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:50,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.

433
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.

434
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just get better through practice.

435
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory.

436
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:59,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I had the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning.

437
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just pick up any three objects.

438
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a test?

439
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:07,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, where were you guys when I did my C.P.A?

440
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:08,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

441
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Ow! What the fuck? -It's a test, Sammy.

442
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, test this, you fucking quack.

443
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of the objects were electrified.

444
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:22,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'd give him a small shock.

445
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:26,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified.

446
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point was...

447
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:30,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

448
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not by memory, but by instinct.

449
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:55,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

450
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,821


451
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:00,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.

452
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What the fuck have you got me into? -Shh. Come inside.

453
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who is he? -Calm down.

454
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:11,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my problem.

455
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has nothing to do with your investigation.

456
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:14,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you get me into this?

457
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:17,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.

458
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I know he did that?

459
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I came straight to you after he did it.

460
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:23,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.

461
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:24,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I just take your word?

462
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something doesn't feel right.

463
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think someone's fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

464
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you? -What?

465
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:35,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Kill him? -Of course not!

466
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what... Sit down, okay? Sit.

467
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:41,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has nothing to do with you.

468
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

469
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to burn them.

470
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard, you decided to help me.

471
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment.

472
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:57,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can question everything. You can never know anything for sure.

473
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:59,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are things you know for sure.

474
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:00,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such as?

475
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what that's gonna sound like when I knock on it.

476
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what that's gonna feel like when I pick it up.

477
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? Certainties.

478
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

479
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:13,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,

480
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:15,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can remember so much.

481
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The feel of the world...

482
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:20,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and her.

483
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's gone.

484
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!

485
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:35,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

486
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not easy for me to relax, you know? Shh.

487
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Take your jacket off.

488
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:43,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Come on.

489
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't think you were the type.

490
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:00,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's backwards.

491
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:03,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

492
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:04,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here!

493
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:27,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about here?

494
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's for when I find him.

495
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:36,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've lost somebody too.

496
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:40,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

497
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name was Jimmy.

498
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:44,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to him?

499
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:48,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He went to meet somebody. He never came back.

500
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:50,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who did he go to meet?

501
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:51,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy called Teddy.

502
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do the police think?

503
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

504
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:02,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you find this guy, This...

505
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:06,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John G., what are you gonna do?

506
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:09,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill him.

507
00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:14,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I can help you find him.

508
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:21,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know how long she's been gone.

509
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:29,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here...

510
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:34,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because she's gone to the bathroom or something.

511
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But somehow I just...

512
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

513
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:52,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I could just...

514
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:56,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}reach over and touch her side of the bed...

515
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would know that it was cold.

516
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:04,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't.

517
00:37:09,698 --> 00:37:11,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I can't have her back.

518
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:16,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't want to wake up in the morning thinking she's still here.

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lie here...

520
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not knowing how long I've been alone.

521
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how...

522
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:33,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I heal?

523
00:37:36,162 --> 00:37:39,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I supposed to heal if I can't...

524
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:41,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}feel time?

525
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:56,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"She has also lost someone.

526
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She will help you out of pity."

527
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They kept testing Sammy for months,

528
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:29,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}always with the same objects carrying an electrical charge.

529
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:31,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow! What the fuck?

530
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:32,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a test, Sammy.

531
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Test this, you quack!

532
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with total short-term memory loss,

533
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:38,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy should have learned to instinctively

534
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stop picking up the wrong objects.

535
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:42,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the previous cases responded to conditioning.

536
00:39:42,735 --> 00:39:44,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy didn't respond at all. It was enough to suggest...

537
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:46,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that his condition

538
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was psychological, not physical.

539
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

540
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:54,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.

541
00:39:57,141 --> 00:40:00,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.

542
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:01,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it works for me.

543
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I live the way Sammy couldn't.

544
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Habit and routine make my life possible.

545
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conditioning.

546
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Acting on instinct.

547
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:20,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awake.

548
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:23,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where am I?

549
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:26,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motel room.

550
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:35,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some anonymous motel room.

551
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing in the drawers,

552
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'll take a look anyway.

553
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:45,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing except the Gideon Bi...

554
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bible.

555
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, open up!

556
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:05,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a minute.

557
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door.

558
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:10,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny!

559
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,396


560
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:15,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door!

561
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

562
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:24,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Teddy.

563
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

564
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I get it. Amorous neighbors.

565
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:44,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

566
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You called me.

567
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said you needed my help.

568
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:51,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.

569
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.

570
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is that?

571
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who the fuck is that? -You don't know him?

572
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:06,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Should I?

573
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Is that John G?

574
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:11,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

575
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:13,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think so? You didn't write it down?

576
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I might've fallen asleep. -For Christ's sakes!

577
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask him.

578
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name? Your name!

579
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:29,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dodd. -And who did this to you?

580
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What? -Who did this to you?

581
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:32,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did.

582
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.

583
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, just let me think for a minute.

584
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,234


585
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:45,732


586
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, Natalie. -Who's Natalie?

587
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Natalie who? -Why?

588
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:50,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I know her.

589
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we gotta get him out of here.

590
00:42:56,631 --> 00:42:58,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gotta have a car, right?

591
00:42:58,499 --> 00:42:59,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we take him down to his car,

592
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:01,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we tell him to get out of town or we're gonna kill him.

593
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't just walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.

594
00:43:04,204 --> 00:43:06,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How the fuck did you get him up here? -I don't know!

595
00:43:06,242 --> 00:43:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know.

596
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:12,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do. This is not my room.

597
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

598
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't just leave him here.

599
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:16,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

600
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:20,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The maid's gonna walk in. She'll see him, call the cops. He can I.D. Us.

601
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:26,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. We untie him, we clean him up...

602
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.

603
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A gun. Why would I have a gun?

604
00:43:31,636 --> 00:43:34,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

605
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:37,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking hope not.

606
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:45,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which one?

607
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:52,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should probably steal his car. You know, teach him a lesson.

608
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up.

609
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right for you to say. You're the one with the Jag.

610
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:56,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, get in.

611
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

612
00:43:58,709 --> 00:43:59,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your keys.

613
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:01,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your own car.

614
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:31,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So was he scared?

615
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah. I think it was your sinister moustache. -Fuck you.

616
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have stolen his car.

617
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with this one?

618
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:39,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. You want to trade?

619
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:44,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what do you do now?

620
00:44:45,302 --> 00:44:47,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to find out what the fuck that was all about.

621
00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

622
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,588


623
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:02,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him...

624
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:05,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and fighting the company's decision.

625
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it wasn't the money that got to her.

626
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:11,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never said that Sammy was faking.

627
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:12,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen. I have an idea. Sammy,

628
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:14,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy, I have an idea I want you to do for me.

629
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just that his problem was mental, not physical.

630
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

631
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:20,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

632
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:21,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She couldn't understand.

633
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:22,765


634
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:23,504


635
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:24,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did something wrong.

636
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did something wrong!

637
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:26,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna deal with it.

638
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:32,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she looks into his eyes and sees the same person. If it's not a physical problem,

639
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:33,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he should just snap out of it.

640
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Ellen called! -Ellen called?

641
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:37,230


642
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!

643
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.

644
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:43,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try harder!

645
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So good old Leonard Shelby

646
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt...

647
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just like he gave it to the doctors.

648
00:45:54,973 --> 00:45:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I never said that he was faking. I never said that.

649
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:06,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm, I don't feel drunk.

650
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:19,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Housekeeping.

651
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:20,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

652
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:21,326


653
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:23,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Not right now. -Oh, I'm sorry.

654
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:56,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy or just get rid of him for Natalie."

655
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:04,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dodd.

656
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:10,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get rid of him.

657
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask Natalie.

658
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:16,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teddy, Teddy.

659
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, leave your number. You know what to do.

660
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:31,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

661
00:48:31,906 --> 00:48:33,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at the Mountcrest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.

662
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to come over as soon as you get this.

663
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:38,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's important. Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

664
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whew. Fuck.

665
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:56,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Jankis didn't understand

666
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you can't bully someone into remembering.

667
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:00,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.

668
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, well, then call me... call me back?

669
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, so what am I doing?

670
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm chasing this guy.

671
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He's chasing me.

672
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:01,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

673
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dodd. White guy. Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

674
00:50:11,236 --> 00:50:13,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

675
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:19,568


676
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$9995, $98 a month.

677
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A '97 Toyota RAV-4, $ 11,995, $ 110 a month.

678
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:54,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, fuck. -A '96 Dodge Caravan, $8995, $95 a month.

679
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sorry. -A '97...

680
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:30,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a weapon.

681
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:35,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will do.

682
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm, I don't feel drunk.

683
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:14,832


684
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:45,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I know this guy?

685
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He seems to know me.

686
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:54,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

687
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I like your car. -Thank you.

688
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:11,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get it?

689
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:12,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you interested in buying one?

690
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:15,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?

691
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:16,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

692
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:29,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, so what am I doing?

693
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,793


694
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:41,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this?

695
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:03,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch. Cut it out.

696
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:35,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you read that again?

697
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:37,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good.

698
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but you've read it, like, a thousand times.

699
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:41,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I enjoy it.

700
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always thought the pleasure of a book...

701
00:55:44,932 --> 00:55:46,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was in wanting to know what happens next.

702
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:47,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, don't be a prick.

703
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:50,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

704
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let me read, please.

705
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:06,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably tried this before.

706
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

707
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't remember to forget you.

708
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

709
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.

710
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:46,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle. Hang on a sec?

711
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:57,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the police report mentioned

712
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the drugs found in the car outside my house.

713
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The car was stolen. Bloody prints were all over it.

714
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got friends in the department. They gave me a copy of it.

715
00:57:04,113 --> 00:57:06,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.

716
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my condition, it's really tough. I can't...

717
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:10,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}keep it all in mind at once.

718
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:12,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to summarize the different sections.

719
00:57:13,144 --> 00:57:14,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there's pages missing.

720
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:16,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I've been trying to log them all.

721
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:18,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why these are crossed out.

722
00:57:18,608 --> 00:57:20,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they weren't even looking for John G.

723
00:57:20,616 --> 00:57:22,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened,

724
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:24,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so they didn't chase any of it up.

725
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey.

726
00:58:04,962 --> 00:58:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, it's late.

727
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:30,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything okay?

728
00:58:49,098 --> 00:58:50,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay in there?

729
00:58:53,893 --> 00:58:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it good for you?

730
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:59,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

731
00:59:01,425 --> 00:59:02,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

732
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:06,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like you to leave now.

733
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:30,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

734
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:31,885


735
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:33,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the police claim the guy was an addict,

736
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}needing money to score, which I think is bullshit,

737
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places

738
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while he's still got a stash that big.

739
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:41,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think John G. Left it there

740
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:42,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or planted it there.

741
00:59:44,233 --> 00:59:45,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know that?

742
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:49,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

743
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:51,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he's a dealer.

744
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:53,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on a sec.

745
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:04,153


746
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:06,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we're getting somewhere.

747
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Discount Inn."

748
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,594


749
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:00,616


750
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:04,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, OK. Blonde's fine.

751
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:08,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's what they say.

752
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:11,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Discount Inn. 304.

753
01:01:12,424 --> 01:01:13,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard.

754
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what then?

755
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just go to bed. You wait for me to fall asleep.

756
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

757
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:22,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slam it?

758
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:24,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

759
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And that's it? -That's it.

760
01:01:29,677 --> 01:01:32,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.

761
01:01:35,681 --> 01:01:38,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just pretend they're your things and that this is your bedroom.

762
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:51,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should I wear it?

763
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:55,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off or something.

764
01:01:58,808 --> 01:02:00,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

765
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:04,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... I just mean put them around the room, you know,

766
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as if they were your... your things.

767
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:12,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever gets you off.

768
01:02:38,308 --> 01:02:40,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.

769
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:42,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is difficult to understand.

770
01:02:42,714 --> 01:02:43,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, look at Sammy Jankis.

771
01:02:44,113 --> 01:02:45,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His own wife couldn't deal with it.

772
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:48,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out of it.

773
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eventually she came to see me at the office. I found out all kinds of shit.

774
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:54,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.

775
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for seeing me.

776
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It got to the point where she'd get Sammy

777
01:02:57,749 --> 01:02:59,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to hide food all around the house...

778
01:02:59,207 --> 01:03:00,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then she'd stop feeding him just to see if his hunger...

779
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would make him remember where he'd hidden the food.

780
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wasn't a cruel person. She just wanted old Sammy back.

781
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:11,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you've decided that he's faking.

782
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is faking anything.

783
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just that his condition can't be shown to be...

784
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

785
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:23,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shouldn't even be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.

786
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:24,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not appealing the decision.

787
01:03:25,541 --> 01:03:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why are you here?

788
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to understand. When I look at Sammy,

789
01:03:29,177 --> 01:03:32,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see some... vegetable.

790
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:34,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see my same old Sammy.

791
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think that's like for me...

792
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?

793
01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:43,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that if I just could say the right thing,

794
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal.

795
01:03:47,749 --> 01:03:49,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I...

796
01:03:51,845 --> 01:03:55,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone,

797
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:59,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I could say good-bye and start loving this new Sammy.

798
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:04,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as I have doubt, I can't say good-bye and move on.

799
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want from me?

800
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to forget the company you work for for 30 seconds...

801
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:13,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tell me if you really believe that Sammy's faking his condition.

802
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:15,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know...

803
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what you honestly believe.

804
01:04:23,813 --> 01:04:27,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.

805
01:04:39,377 --> 01:04:40,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I helped her.

806
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought she just needed some kind of answer.

807
01:04:42,514 --> 01:04:44,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't think it was important what the answer was,

808
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:45,811


809
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:47,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just that she had one to believe.

810
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:04,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A car this nice you should lock.

811
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who the fuck are you? -Teddy, your buddy.

812
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:07,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prove it.

813
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy. Remember Sammy? You told me about Sammy!

814
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you doing in my car?

815
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

816
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:20,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you even know why you're here?

817
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfinished business.

818
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:22,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny,

819
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished.

820
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're still here because of Natalie.

821
01:05:28,578 --> 01:05:29,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Natalie?

822
01:05:29,507 --> 01:05:32,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?

823
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's right. Take a look at your pictures.

824
01:05:37,049 --> 01:05:38,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you got one of her.

825
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:42,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz.

826
01:05:43,513 --> 01:05:44,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll wanna make a note.

827
01:05:45,511 --> 01:05:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't trust her.

828
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:47,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Why's that?

829
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:51,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because by now she's taken a look at this suit and the car...

830
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:55,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she's starting to figure out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.

831
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's already got you staying with her, for Christ's sakes.

832
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:00,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go back in there.

833
01:06:00,816 --> 01:06:02,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me give you the name of a motel.

834
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:05,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.

835
01:06:05,781 --> 01:06:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, "bad news"?

836
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:08,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's involved with drugs.

837
01:06:09,207 --> 01:06:10,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, look. These. You see these?

838
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:11,265


839
01:06:11,745 --> 01:06:13,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the bar where she works.

840
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:15,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

841
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:18,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

842
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He writes messages on the back of these.

843
01:06:21,515 --> 01:06:24,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.

844
01:06:24,512 --> 01:06:25,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why should I care?

845
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:27,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because when she gets jammed up,

846
01:06:28,378 --> 01:06:30,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she's gonna use you to protect herself.

847
01:06:30,646 --> 01:06:31,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From who?

848
01:06:31,745 --> 01:06:34,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.

849
01:06:34,612 --> 01:06:37,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys are gonna come after her. Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

850
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:39,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody always pays.

851
01:06:40,016 --> 01:06:41,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe she'll make it you.

852
01:06:41,615 --> 01:06:43,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, yeah? -Well, maybe she'll make it you.

853
01:06:44,012 --> 01:06:44,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that it?

854
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

855
01:06:47,109 --> 01:06:48,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No. -Why not?

856
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:51,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because she doesn't know who I am.

857
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why are you following me? -Maybe I wanna help.

858
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She doesn't know anything about your investigation,

859
01:06:59,347 --> 01:07:01,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}okay, Einstein? So write this down.

860
01:07:02,574 --> 01:07:07,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she offers to help, it'll be for her own reasons.

861
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:12,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not lying. Take my pen. Write this down.

862
01:07:12,514 --> 01:07:14,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not trust her.

863
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:23,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. You happy now?

864
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:25,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be happy until you leave town.

865
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

866
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:29,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever wonder how long you can hang around here

867
01:07:29,307 --> 01:07:31,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before people start asking questions?

868
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:32,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What sort of questions?

869
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:34,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same sort of questions you should be asking yourself.

870
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:35,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what?

871
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

872
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:38,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I have money. -From what?

873
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:39,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife's death.

874
01:07:40,276 --> 01:07:42,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to work in insurance. We were well covered.

875
01:07:44,282 --> 01:07:47,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership.

876
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:51,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a clue, do you?

877
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:54,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You don't even know who you are. -Yes, I do.

878
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have amnesia.

879
01:07:57,009 --> 01:07:58,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember everything right up until the incident.

880
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:00,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am Leonard Shelby. I am from San Francisco...

881
01:08:01,215 --> 01:08:02,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's who you were.

882
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:05,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do not know who you are,

883
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what you've become since...

884
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:08,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the incident.

885
01:08:09,677 --> 01:08:11,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wander around playing detective.

886
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:14,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't even know how long ago it was.

887
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me put it this way.

888
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:20,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?

889
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:22,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it. -Right.

890
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're an investigator.

891
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:27,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe you should start investigating yourself.

892
01:08:28,348 --> 01:08:29,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for the advice.

893
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, do me a favor. Don't go back in there.

894
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you take the motel out of town?

895
01:08:41,215 --> 01:08:42,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been fun, Lenny.

896
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:51,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Do not trust her."

897
01:08:52,074 --> 01:08:53,473


898
01:08:54,012 --> 01:08:55,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Don't believe his lies."

899
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:09,037


900
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:10,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

901
01:09:14,881 --> 01:09:16,240


902
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:21,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.

903
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:24,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

904
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. I guess.

905
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:30,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

906
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:34,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Legal responsibility, large financ...

907
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:37,229


908
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this?

909
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:53,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Write this down. Write down what happened.

910
01:09:54,012 --> 01:09:57,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Write it down. Write it down. Come on. Concentrate. Keep it in mind. Find a pen...

911
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:04,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

912
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:07,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

913
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:08,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

914
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:09,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

915
01:10:10,516 --> 01:10:12,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

916
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? -Why? Because of you.

917
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Because I did what you told me to do! -Calm down.

918
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:19,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!

919
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down. Take it easy.

920
01:10:21,615 --> 01:10:22,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're safe. It's okay.

921
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Just sit down.

922
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:27,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down.

923
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:30,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Sit down.

924
01:10:32,014 --> 01:10:33,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. You're okay.

925
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just get some ice for your face.

926
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did exactly what you told me to do.

927
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:56,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to Dodd...

928
01:10:58,148 --> 01:11:01,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I told him that I... I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

929
01:11:02,544 --> 01:11:04,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the drugs,

930
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:08,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that this Teddy must have taken everything.

931
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:10,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what did he say?

932
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:13,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't believe me.

933
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

934
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:21,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then he just... he just started hitting me.

935
01:11:25,011 --> 01:11:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he?

936
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:27,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

937
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:29,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go see him.

938
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:30,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

939
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:33,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

940
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, he'll kill you, Lenny.

941
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:41,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My wife used to call me Lenny. -Yeah?

942
01:11:43,213 --> 01:11:44,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I hated it.

943
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this guy... this guy is so dangerous.

944
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:50,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just think of something else, okay?

945
01:11:51,345 --> 01:11:54,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. You just tell me what he looks like...

946
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and where I can find him.

947
01:11:56,809 --> 01:11:57,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you got a pen?

948
01:11:58,577 --> 01:11:59,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my purse.

949
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:12,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll, um... He'll probably find you.

950
01:12:12,843 --> 01:12:13,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

951
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:15,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told him about your car.

952
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

953
01:12:19,646 --> 01:12:22,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was beating the shit out of me. I had to tell him something.

954
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:25,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just write it all down.

955
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:41,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful.

956
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:43,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be fine.

957
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:53,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A car this nice you should lock.

958
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:55,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the fuck are you?

959
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,709


960
01:13:11,514 --> 01:13:15,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Front desk? Burt. Right. This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

961
01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:17,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's it. I don't want any calls.

962
01:13:18,507 --> 01:13:19,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. None at all.

963
01:13:31,275 --> 01:13:32,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's wrong? -Somebody's come already.

964
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:35,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who? -He calls himself Dodd.

965
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:36,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does he want?

966
01:13:36,809 --> 01:13:38,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.

967
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:40,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.

968
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:40,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Well, did you?

969
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:42,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

970
01:13:47,608 --> 01:13:49,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's this all about? -Fuck!

971
01:13:50,046 --> 01:13:51,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

972
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just blissfully ignorant.

973
01:13:53,742 --> 01:13:54,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I have this condition.

974
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

975
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:58,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably know more about it than you do.

976
01:13:58,507 --> 01:14:00,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a clue about anything else.

977
01:14:01,015 --> 01:14:01,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

978
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:04,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.

979
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.

980
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:08,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jimmy's partners think I set him up.

981
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know if you know this, Teddy, or how well.

982
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:13,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Neither do I. -Don't protect him!

983
01:14:13,043 --> 01:14:13,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not.

984
01:14:13,812 --> 01:14:14,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Help me. -How?

985
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get rid of Dodd for me.

986
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

987
01:14:18,507 --> 01:14:19,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him. I'll pay you.

988
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:22,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think I am? I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

989
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:26,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What then? Love? What would you kill for?

990
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?

991
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's different.

992
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:31,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.

993
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:33,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, don't talk about my wife.

994
01:14:33,313 --> 01:14:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

995
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:38,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can say whatever I want and you won't remember.

996
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could call your wife a fucking whore.

997
01:14:40,346 --> 01:14:40,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down.

998
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:43,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy for you to say. You can't get scared. You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

999
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:45,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

1000
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:46,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it does.

1001
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:47,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How the fuck would you know?

1002
01:14:47,808 --> 01:14:49,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know a fucking thing!

1003
01:14:51,165 --> 01:14:53,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You can't get scared, but can you get angry? -Yes.

1004
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, you pathetic piece of shit.

1005
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can say whatever the fuck I want...

1006
01:14:58,547 --> 01:15:01,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you won't have a fucking clue, you fucking retard!

1007
01:15:01,644 --> 01:15:02,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shut your mouth. -You know what?

1008
01:15:03,043 --> 01:15:03,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna use you.

1009
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you now, because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

1010
01:15:06,539 --> 01:15:09,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak.

1011
01:15:10,246 --> 01:15:11,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you lose your pen?

1012
01:15:12,014 --> 01:15:13,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's too bad, freak.

1013
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:16,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note about how much Natalie...

1014
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:18,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hates your retarded guts and that I called your wife a whore.

1015
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:20,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't say another fuckin' word.

1016
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:21,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About your whore of a wife?

1017
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I read about your condition, Leonard.

1018
01:15:28,008 --> 01:15:31,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what one of the causes of short-term memory loss is?

1019
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:32,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Venereal disease.

1020
01:15:32,873 --> 01:15:35,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

1021
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:36,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sucked one too many diseased cocks

1022
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:39,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and turned you into a fucking retard!

1023
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:44,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sad, sad... freak.

1024
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:48,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can say whatever the fuck I want...

1025
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:50,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you won't remember.

1026
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll still be best friends...

1027
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or maybe even lovers.

1028
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:01,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1029
01:16:07,348 --> 01:16:08,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you soon.

1030
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:20,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay focused. Find a pen. Gotta write this down.

1031
01:16:20,945 --> 01:16:22,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta write it down.

1032
01:16:23,932 --> 01:16:26,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

1033
01:16:26,929 --> 01:16:29,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

1034
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:35,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Find a pen. I have to find a pen.

1035
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,639

1040
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:48,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep... Keep it in mind.

1041
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Find a pen. Write this note.

1044
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:04,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

1045
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:06,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it look like? He beat the shit out of me.

1046
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:08,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

1047
01:17:08,577 --> 01:17:09,646

1048
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:12,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck, Leonard. Dodd. Dodd beat the shit out of me.

1049
01:17:26,919 --> 01:17:28,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Burt, from the front desk.

1050
01:17:32,084 --> 01:17:33,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you said you didn't want any calls.

1051
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:36,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this guy called. He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

1052
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:37,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A cop? -Yeah.

1053
01:17:37,818 --> 01:17:41,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, uh, he says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say, so...

1054
01:17:41,914 --> 01:17:43,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not too good on the phone.

1055
01:17:43,612 --> 01:17:44,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.

1056
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what...

1057
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:53,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can, um... You can crash on the couch.

1058
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:54,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's comfortable.

1059
01:17:55,151 --> 01:17:56,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just have a seat.

1060
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how long do you think it's gonna take you?

1061
01:18:07,318 --> 01:18:09,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?

1062
01:18:11,314 --> 01:18:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, that depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on.

1063
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have my file here.

1064
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:21,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I ask you something?

1065
01:18:21,954 --> 01:18:23,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you have all of that information,

1066
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then why haven't the police found him for you?

1067
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:29,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, they're not looking for him. -Why not?

1068
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:31,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't think he exists.

1069
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I told them what I remembered.

1070
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was asleep.

1071
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:39,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something woke me up.

1072
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:48,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her side of the bed was cold. She'd obviously been out of bed for awhile.

1073
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:48,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There had to be a second man.

1074
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:50,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody hit me from behind.

1075
01:19:51,184 --> 01:19:53,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember. It's about the last thing that I do remember.

1076
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:56,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, the police did not believe me. If we check the police...

1077
01:19:56,819 --> 01:19:58,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do they explain what you do remember?

1078
01:19:59,186 --> 01:20:00,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The gun and stuff.

1079
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:04,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John G. Was clever.

1080
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:06,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was clever.

1081
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:09,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, he took the dead man's gun

1082
01:20:09,586 --> 01:20:11,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

1083
01:20:12,783 --> 01:20:14,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He left my gun and he left the getaway car.

1084
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave the police a complete package.

1085
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand.

1086
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:23,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they only found my gun.

1087
01:20:24,081 --> 01:20:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't need to look for anybody else.

1088
01:20:28,087 --> 01:20:31,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.

1089
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:34,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-See, the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition. -Leonard,

1090
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help you.

1091
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go back to work.

1092
01:20:44,081 --> 01:20:47,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, um, just make yourself at home. You can watch TV, or...

1093
01:20:47,918 --> 01:20:50,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can have some food, whatever you want, okay?

1094
01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:51,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make yourself at home.

1095
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:53,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One thing.

1096
01:20:56,179 --> 01:20:57,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something to remember you by.

1097
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Natalie.

1098

1100
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:38,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's wrong? -Somebody's come already.

1101
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:07,508


1102
01:22:27,618 --> 01:22:28,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the house.

1103
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My, you really do have a problem.

1104
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:39,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like that cop said.

1105
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:42,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your condition.

1106
01:22:43,482 --> 01:22:44,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, nobody's perfect.

1107
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:49,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the last thing that you do remember?

1108
01:22:53,112 --> 01:22:53,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife.

1109
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:54,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's sweet.

1110
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dying.

1111
01:22:57,718 --> 01:22:59,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember my wife dying.

1112
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:06,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me, um, get you another one.

1113
01:23:07,378 --> 01:23:08,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this one's dusty.

1114
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why are you calling me? -What do you want?

1115
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:17,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're a cop, but what do you want?

1116
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:19,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have I done something wrong?

1117
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:21,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

1118
01:23:24,111 --> 01:23:26,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you asking me? I can't remember what I've done.

1119
01:23:26,649 --> 01:23:27,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't believe me anyway.

1120
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:31,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of my condition. You don't believe someone with this condition.

1121
01:23:31,714 --> 01:23:34,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody believed Sammy! I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

1122

01:23:56,849 --> 01:23:57,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have a beer, please.

1125

01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:02,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.

1127
01:24:02,852 --> 01:24:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What, is there a dress code? -Why are you here?

01:24:08,487 --> 01:24:10,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. We met before, right?

1131
01:24:11,784 --> 01:24:12,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why am I here?

1132
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:13,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Tell me.

1133
01:24:14,181 --> 01:24:16,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't remember. I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

1134
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you're the memory guy.

1135
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:19,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know about me?

1136
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:21,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My boyfriend told me about you.

1137
01:24:22,113 --> 01:24:23,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?

1138
01:24:24,111 --> 01:24:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

1139
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:27,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1140
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:29,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he knows you.

1141
01:24:30,615 --> 01:24:33,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He told me about you. He said you were staying at the Discount.

1142
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, a cop came by here earlier looking for you.

1143
01:24:37,418 --> 01:24:39,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything,

1144
01:24:39,386 --> 01:24:41,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wouldn't know how he got here or what he'd done.

1145
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:43,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

1146
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:47,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, chronic alcoholism is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1147
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you Teddy?

1148
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:52,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. My name is Leonard.

1149
01:24:53,112 --> 01:24:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did Teddy send you? -I don't know.

1150
01:24:56,449 --> 01:24:57,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happened to Jimmy?

1151
01:24:58,217 --> 01:25:00,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know that either. Sorry.

1152
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:01,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember anything?

1153
01:25:01,883 --> 01:25:04,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember where you've been or what you've just done.

1154
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I can't make new memories.

1155
01:25:07,378 --> 01:25:08,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything just fades.

1156
01:25:09,116 --> 01:25:10,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why did you come here?

1157
01:25:10,615 --> 01:25:11,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found this in my pocket.

1158
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your pocket.

1159
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:44,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1160
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:45,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks.

1161
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:46,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for a lot of money.

1162
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:49,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Proceeds are going to charity. Help me out.

1163
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:21,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the house.

1164
01:26:27,977 --> 01:26:30,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.

1165
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.

1166
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:37,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess it's some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.

1167
01:26:37,977 --> 01:26:39,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the truth about my condition, officer?

1168
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:41,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know anything.

1169
01:26:42,712 --> 01:26:44,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You feel angry, you don't know why.

1170
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1171
01:26:48,846 --> 01:26:51,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1172
01:26:51,883 --> 01:26:53,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like Sammy. I could have done something like Sammy.

1173
01:26:54,451 --> 01:26:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't tell you...

1174
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:57,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what happened to Sammy and his wife?

1175
01:26:59,446 --> 01:27:01,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she came to see me at my office.

1176
01:27:01,344 --> 01:27:02,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought she was just trying to catch me off guard,

1177
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:05,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I didn't tell her what I really thought, but I never said that he was faking,

1178
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just that his condition was mental, not physical.

1179
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:10,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.

1180
01:27:12,483 --> 01:27:13,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy?

1181
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for my shot.

1182
01:27:31,384 --> 01:27:32,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.

1183
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:35,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she found a way to test him.

1184
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:49,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy.

1185
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:52,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for my shot.

1186
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She really thought she'd call his bluff.

1187
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:05,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

1188
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:10,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or she just didn't wanna live with the things she put him through.

1189
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:21,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy.

1190
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:25,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for my shot.

1191
01:28:31,983 --> 01:28:33,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It won't hurt.

1192
01:29:17,617 --> 01:29:19,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She went into a coma and never recovered.

1193
01:29:20,445 --> 01:29:23,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened.

1194
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:27,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been in a home ever since.

1195
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:29,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't even know that his wife's dead.

1196
01:29:30,445 --> 01:29:33,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.

1197
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:37,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wasn't interested in the money. She just needed to understand his problem.

1198
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His brain didn't respond to conditioning.

1199
01:29:40,415 --> 01:29:41,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he wasn't a con man.

1200
01:29:41,853 --> 01:29:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.

1201
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.

1202
01:29:48,117 --> 01:29:49,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I know. You fake it.

1203
01:29:49,945 --> 01:29:52,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1204
01:29:52,812 --> 01:29:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.

1205
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1206
01:30:01,983 --> 01:30:03,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What drug dealer?

1207
01:30:08,247 --> 01:30:11,474


1208
01:30:11,883 --> 01:30:13,511


1209
01:30:14,111 --> 01:30:16,948


1210
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:30,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Lenny, how you doing?

1211
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's private back here.

1212
01:30:32,183 --> 01:30:33,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?

1213
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know I was here?

1214
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the Jag is out front. You should have put it around back.

1215
01:30:37,717 --> 01:30:38,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you still doing here?

1216
01:30:39,186 --> 01:30:40,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1217
01:30:41,114 --> 01:30:42,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to get something down...

1218
01:30:42,682 --> 01:30:43,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before it slipped my mind.

1219
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then give me the keys. I'll move it for you.

1220
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It'll be all right for a minute. -Wait out there.

1221
01:30:47,617 --> 01:30:48,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, for Christ...

1222
01:30:48,746 --> 01:30:50,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, give me a minute. I gotta get something for you.

1223
01:30:54,650 --> 01:30:58,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fact six. Car license SG 137IU.

1224
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1225
01:31:10,644 --> 01:31:12,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, we gotta get you out of here.

1226
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:13,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? -Aw, man.

1227
01:31:13,611 --> 01:31:15,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Leonard. How many times I gotta tell you?

1228
01:31:16,019 --> 01:31:17,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.

1229
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:18,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

1230
01:31:18,546 --> 01:31:20,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that cop's looking for you.

1231
01:31:20,484 --> 01:31:25,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I gotta get you a new identity, some new clothes. A different car would do for now. So put these on.

1232
01:31:25,749 --> 01:31:27,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1233
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a bad cop. He's the one who checked you into the Discount Inn.

1234
01:31:31,883 --> 01:31:32,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been calling you for days,

1235
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}telling you shit, slipping envelopes under your door.

1236
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:36,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know this?

1237
01:31:36,379 --> 01:31:39,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He told me. He thinks it's funny. He's been laughing at you.

1238
01:31:39,645 --> 01:31:40,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're full of shit.

1239
01:31:40,414 --> 01:31:43,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he's been calling you up.

1240
01:31:43,451 --> 01:31:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes you don't answer the phone,

1241
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:47,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering the phone again,

1242
01:31:47,967 --> 01:31:50,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}giving you a line of crap about John G. Being some local drug dealer.

1243
01:31:51,114 --> 01:31:52,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jimmy Grants.

1244
01:31:53,282 --> 01:31:54,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Jimmy Grants?

1245
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1246
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

1247
01:31:58,916 --> 01:32:01,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got some score in mind. Somehow you're involved.

1248
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:02,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know him?

1249
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:06,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.

1250
01:32:06,418 --> 01:32:07,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The local boys put us together.

1251
01:32:08,217 --> 01:32:10,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he knew I was helping you, he'd fucking kill me.

1252
01:32:10,644 --> 01:32:13,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So take these clothes, put them on

1253
01:32:13,212 --> 01:32:14,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and get the fuck out of here.

1254
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1255
01:32:30,484 --> 01:32:32,872


1256
01:32:34,311 --> 01:32:36,538


1257
01:32:37,977 --> 01:32:38,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are full of shit.

1258
01:32:41,683 --> 01:32:43,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Come by after. Natalie."

1259
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Ferdy's Bar."

1260
01:33:18,986 --> 01:33:20,075


1261
01:33:28,247 --> 01:33:29,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jimmy.

1262
01:33:32,382 --> 01:33:36,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I, uh, thought you were somebody else. Sorry.

1263
01:33:38,117 --> 01:33:39,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay.

1264
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:49,565


1265
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:56,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1266
01:33:57,617 --> 01:33:59,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's not gonna bring her along. He'll come by himself, right?

1267
01:34:01,214 --> 01:34:03,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.

1268
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:08,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1269
01:34:09,245 --> 01:34:10,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're in the lobby?

1270
01:34:11,184 --> 01:34:11,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you look like?

1271
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:14,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right there.

1272
01:34:57,277 --> 01:34:58,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny.

1273
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:02,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officer Gammell.

1274
01:35:05,319 --> 01:35:07,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Come on.

1275
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, smile.

1276
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:26,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't... Not here.

1277
01:35:27,777 --> 01:35:28,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here.

1278
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1279
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:39,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1280
01:35:40,714 --> 01:35:41,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1281
01:35:41,513 --> 01:35:42,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm undercover.

1282
01:35:45,849 --> 01:35:47,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the directions where he's going.

1283
01:35:48,386 --> 01:35:49,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My number's on the bottom if you need me.

1284
01:35:50,115 --> 01:35:50,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not coming?

1285
01:35:51,483 --> 01:35:53,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1286
01:35:58,186 --> 01:36:00,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice picture. I look thin.

1287
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:05,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Lenny.

1288
01:36:06,818 --> 01:36:07,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make him beg.

1289
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:40,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teddy!

1290

1291
01:37:46,878 --> 01:37:47,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you doing here?

1292
01:37:48,246 --> 01:37:49,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You Jimmy Grants?

1293
01:37:49,485 --> 01:37:51,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Expecting any other Jimmys out here, Memory Man?

1294
01:37:51,953 --> 01:37:52,812

1297
01:37:58,446 --> 01:37:58,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well?

1298
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motherfuck... What the fuck are you doing?

1299

1300
01:38:09,915 --> 01:38:11,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1301
01:38:11,613 --> 01:38:12,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strip!

1302
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1303
01:38:17,347 --> 01:38:18,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't say anything else.

1304
01:38:18,816 --> 01:38:20,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I knew I couldn't trust that fuck! -Take it off.

1306
01:38:29,245 --> 01:38:29,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1307
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:31,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna get blood on them.

1308
01:38:32,382 --> 01:38:35,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1309
01:38:35,649 --> 01:38:36,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your fuckin' pants off!

1310
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:39,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got two hundred grand stashed in the car!

1311

1312
01:38:41,213 --> 01:38:42,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can bargain with me?

1313
01:38:42,282 --> 01:38:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Just take the money and walk away! -I don't want your money!

1314
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:46,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what?

1315
01:38:47,617 --> 01:38:48,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want from me?

1316
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:51,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want my fuckin' life back!

1317

1318
01:40:29,914 --> 01:40:31,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said "Sammy." How does he know about Sammy?

1319
01:40:32,182 --> 01:40:32,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck.

1320
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:55,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have I done?

1321
01:40:57,976 --> 01:40:59,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, mister, I need help.

1322
01:40:59,445 --> 01:41:01,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad. We gotta get him to a doctor.

1323
01:41:02,212 --> 01:41:02,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1324
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:07,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what happened. I've got this memory thing. Do I know you?

1325
01:41:07,876 --> 01:41:09,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1326
01:41:10,284 --> 01:41:10,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he still breathing?

1327
01:41:11,143 --> 01:41:12,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Maybe.

1328
01:41:13,381 --> 01:41:14,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell were you guys doing down here?

1329
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:18,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't remember. I have this condition.

1330
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:21,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1331
01:41:22,482 --> 01:41:23,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch! Lenny!

1332
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:26,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That shit kills! So you remember me now, huh?

1333
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:27,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a fuckin' cop.

1334
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:30,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

1335
01:41:31,243 --> 01:41:31,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up.

1336
01:41:32,212 --> 01:41:32,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up.

1337
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:35,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1338
01:41:38,186 --> 01:41:40,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that? He knew me.

01:41:40,414 --> 01:41:42,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course he did. He raped your wife. He fucked up your brain.

1340
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1341
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name is James F. Grants. John G.

1342
01:41:48,016 --> 01:41:49,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check your tattoos.

1343
01:41:49,415 --> 01:41:50,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was he bringing the two hundred grand for?

1344
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:51,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1345
01:41:53,611 --> 01:41:54,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was it for?

1346
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1347
01:41:56,448 --> 01:41:59,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is this a drug deal? -No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1348
01:41:59,844 --> 01:42:01,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.

1349
01:42:01,483 --> 01:42:03,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1350
01:42:03,551 --> 01:42:07,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How did he know me? -The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1351
01:42:07,217 --> 01:42:10,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.

1352
01:42:10,614 --> 01:42:11,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called Jimmy the minute he saw you...

1353
01:42:11,613 --> 01:42:12,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taking a picture of the dump.

1354
01:42:13,311 --> 01:42:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fucking using me.

1355
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! You get half!

1356
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knew about Sammy! Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1357
01:42:18,446 --> 01:42:21,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who'll listen.

1358
01:42:21,752 --> 01:42:23,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1359
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great story. It gets better every time you tell it.

1360
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:32,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you lie to yourself to be happy. There's nothing wrong with that. We all do it.

1361
01:42:32,352 --> 01:42:35,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1362
01:42:37,617 --> 01:42:39,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What the fuck are you talking about? -I don't know.

1363
01:42:40,714 --> 01:42:42,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wife's surviving the assault.

1364
01:42:43,281 --> 01:42:44,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her not believing your condition.

1365
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:49,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.

1366
01:42:49,984 --> 01:42:51,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The insulin.

1367
01:42:52,712 --> 01:42:55,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Sammy, not me. I told you about Sammy.

1368
01:42:55,649 --> 01:42:58,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1369
01:42:58,885 --> 01:43:00,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conditioning yourself to remember.

1370
01:43:00,743 --> 01:43:01,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Learning through repetition.

1371
01:43:02,212 --> 01:43:04,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy let his wife kill herself. Sammy ended up in an institution.

1372
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:07,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1373
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:10,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never said that Sammy was faking.

1374
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:12,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You exposed him for what he was...

1375
01:43:13,111 --> 01:43:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a fraud.

1376
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1377
01:43:17,147 --> 01:43:18,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, Sammy's wife came to me.

1378
01:43:18,686 --> 01:43:20,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sammy didn't have a wife.

1379
01:43:23,111 --> 01:43:25,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was your wife who had diabetes.

1380
01:43:35,619 --> 01:43:36,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife wasn't diabetic.

1381
01:43:37,846 --> 01:43:38,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

1382
01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:45,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut it out.

1383
01:43:46,018 --> 01:43:47,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wasn't diabetic.

1384
01:43:48,246 --> 01:43:49,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I don't know my own wife?

1385
01:43:50,614 --> 01:43:51,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is wrong with you?

1386
01:43:52,012 --> 01:43:55,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.

1387
01:43:55,778 --> 01:43:57,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Like old Jimmy down there. -He's not the right guy.

1388
01:43:58,246 --> 01:43:59,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was to you.

1389
01:44:00,614 --> 01:44:03,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. You got your revenge. Enjoy it while you still remember.

1390
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?

1391
01:44:06,847 --> 01:44:07,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes all the difference.

1392
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:09,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? You're never gonna know. -Yes, I will.

1393
01:44:09,644 --> 01:44:10,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, you won't. -I will.

1394
01:44:11,023 --> 01:44:12,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Somehow I'll know. -You won't remember!

1395
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1396
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:17,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I thought so too. In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1397
01:44:21,313 --> 01:44:22,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

1398
01:44:22,711 --> 01:44:26,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real John G. I helped you find him over a year ago.

1399
01:44:26,618 --> 01:44:27,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's already dead.

1400
01:44:28,216 --> 01:44:29,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't lie to me anymore.

1401
01:44:29,714 --> 01:44:30,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Lenny.

1402
01:44:31,613 --> 01:44:33,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was the cop assigned to your wife's case. I believed you.

1403
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:36,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1404
01:44:37,117 --> 01:44:40,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night,

1405
01:44:40,613 --> 01:44:43,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.

1406
01:44:43,281 --> 01:44:45,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found him. You killed him.

1407
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:48,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you didn't remember.

1408
01:44:49,714 --> 01:44:51,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I helped you...

1409
01:44:51,513 --> 01:44:52,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}start looking again,

1410
01:44:52,981 --> 01:44:54,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}looking for the guy you already killed.

1411
01:44:55,419 --> 01:44:57,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. So who was he?

1412
01:44:57,417 --> 01:44:59,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just some guy. I mean, does it even matter who?

1413
01:45:00,214 --> 01:45:04,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.

1414
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:08,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1415
01:45:10,214 --> 01:45:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1416
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it didn't stick.

1417
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.

1418
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took that picture...

1419
01:45:27,377 --> 01:45:28,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just when you did it.

1420
01:45:30,613 --> 01:45:32,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look how happy you are.

1421
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to see that face again.

1422
01:45:36,218 --> 01:45:37,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, gee, thanks.

1423
01:45:37,347 --> 01:45:38,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you.

1424
01:45:38,685 --> 01:45:42,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.

1425
01:45:42,881 --> 01:45:44,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want the truth...

1426
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:47,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make up your own truth. Like your police file.

1427
01:45:49,614 --> 01:45:52,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the 12 pages?

1428
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:55,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You, probably. -No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1429
01:45:55,548 --> 01:45:56,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I do that?

1430
01:45:56,418 --> 01:45:58,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1431
01:45:58,915 --> 01:46:00,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how many... how many towns?

1432
01:46:01,043 --> 01:46:05,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many John G's orJames G's? I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

1433
01:46:05,768 --> 01:46:08,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Your name is Teddy. -My mother calls me Teddy.

1434
01:46:08,945 --> 01:46:11,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's John Edward Gammell.

1435
01:46:11,882 --> 01:46:15,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheer up. There's plenty of John G's for us to find.

1436
01:46:19,285 --> 01:46:21,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All you do is moan.

1437
01:46:21,912 --> 01:46:24,070

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should kill you.

1445
01:46:41,183 --> 01:46:42,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1446

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a killer.

1447
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you're so good at it.

1448
01:46:49,185 --> 01:46:51,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. What are you doing? You know what time it is?

1459
01:47:58,615 --> 01:47:59,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another John G. To look for?

01:48:15,618 --> 01:48:17,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1466
01:48:18,885 --> 01:48:19,934

01:48:42,411 --> 01:48:44,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the guy you just killed owns it!

01:48:52,182 --> 01:48:53,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might hang on to this for a while.
