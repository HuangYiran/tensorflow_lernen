1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,520
我知道你在烦恼什么
I know what's bothering you.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,410
有人在你面前吃培根
Someone is eating bacon in front of you,

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,590
却一丢丢都不分给你吃
and not offering you any.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,830
不是  斯坦  我不烦恼这个
No, Stan, that's not it.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,110
那你是在烦恼你接受暗示的能力
Then are you, perhaps, bothered by your inability

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,730
太差了吗
to take a hint?

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
明天是新学期第一天  暑假放完了
Tomorrow's the first day of school. Summer's over.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,250
我再也不能学弹吉他
No more learning how to play guitar or,

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,010
或者种树  或者在社区中心做志愿者了
planting trees, or volunteering at the community center.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,510
你压根没做过这些事
You didn't do any of those things.

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,900
现在是永远做不了了
And now I never will.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,060
给你  斯坦  想到上学我就饱了
Here, Stan. School's made me not hungry.

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,800
耶
Yeah!

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,940
感谢上学  不让一块培根吃剩
Thanks, school! No bacon left behind.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,990
你知道那是火鸡熏肉的对吧
You do realize that it's turkey bacon?

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,200
又怎样  我吃过一只老鼠  我吐了  
So, I've eaten a mouse, thrown it up,

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,320
我又把吐出来的吃回去了
and eaten it again.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,400
我可不是那种娇生惯养的狗
I'm not what you would call fancy.

19
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,670
嘿  泰勒  你准备好了吗
Hey, Tyler. You ready to do it?

20
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,430
干嘛
Do what?

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,000
去年  我们商量过你全部科目要考到A和B
Last year, we agreed you could only keep your hair

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,880
你才能留这又傻又长的发型
this ridiculously long if you got all A's and B's.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,850
但  你拿了不少C啊  孩子
Well, you got a couple of C's, buddy.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,000
C就得剪  是时候剪你的头发了
And C is for cut. Time to cut your hair.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,280
我还拿了个D  啊  我说这个干嘛
I also got a D... oh, why did I say that?

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,650
这是我们协商好的  泰勒
We had a deal, Tyler.

27
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,220
如果我们连这都不遵守  
What kind of parents would we be

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,100
我们还算什么好父母呢
if we didn't follow through?

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,950
你们儿子都拿C和D了  
Your son is getting C's and D's,

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,650
你们还能当得再差点吗
could you do any worse?

31
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,230
别这样  泰勒  我从你小时候就开始剪你的头发了
Come on, Tyler. I've been cutting your hair since

32
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,020
你以前可喜欢了
you were little and you've always liked it.

33
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,410
你觉得怎么剪  亲爱的  不如在这儿剪一刀
What do you think, hun? Maybe take this off here.

34
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,500
- 没错  再剪一下这里  - 对了  我可以削薄这里
- Yeah, and feather this here. - Oh, I could taper it here.

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,850
我觉得我的手卡在这了
I think my hand's stuck under here.

36
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,030
没关系  我等下全剪掉
Oh, I'm going to cut that all off.

37
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,540
行了  你已经把话说明白了
Okay, you made your point.

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,280
我今年一定会更努力学习的
I'm definitely going to study harder this year.

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,350
你们不用再装作要剪我头发了
No need to keep pretending you're really going to do this.

40
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,550
你们真的要剪我头发啊
You're really going to do this?

41
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,450
泰勒  我的剪刀还没下去呢
Tyler, I haven't even done anything yet.

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,580
看起来好好玩  我也试试
That looks like fun. Let me try.

43
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,320
我就知道你会惨叫的
I thought that might happen.

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,530
克洛伊  我们不能把自己的快乐建立在别人的痛苦之上
Chloe, we're not doing this for our entertainment.

45
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,120
我错过了吗  我要做点爆米花吗  你做爆米花没
Did I miss it? Should I make popcorn? Did you make popcorn?

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,010
为什么没人做爆米花啊
Why has no one made popcorn?

47
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,420
艾芙莉  就像我刚刚对妹妹说的一样
Avery, as I just got done telling your sister,

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,370
我们不能把自己的快乐建立在别人的痛苦之上
we're not doing this for your entertainment.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,190
坐到我旁边来  这角度特好
Sit here next to me... it's the best view.

50
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,010
来点爆米花
Have some popcorn.

51
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,130
好了  泰勒  开剪了
Okay, Tyler, here we go.

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,350
我永远不会忘记你的
I'll never forget you.

53
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,900
噢  曼妙的身姿  如此多浪卷儿
Oh, so much body, so much wave.

54
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,110
噢  我最牵挂你了  乱卷卷
Oh, and I'll miss you most of all, frizzy cowlick.

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,800
嗯  起码这次我不是被剪的那个
Well, at least this time I wasn't the one being groomed.

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,470
啊  我这些年来也有过不少雷人的发型啊
And, man, I've had some pretty crazy haircuts over the years.

57
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,630
蜈蚣头
Cornrows.

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,210
束发
Pompadour.

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,240
蕾娅公主头
Princess Leia.

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,190
那么  你们觉得怎么样呢
So, what does everybody think?

61
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,860
呃  你确实能看到
Well, you can see his face which is...

62
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,960
他的脸
A fact.

63
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,490
看看我  我是头发天使
Look at me. I'm making Hair Angels.

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,070
我觉得还不错  泰勒
I think it looks great, Tyler.

65
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,190
你自己看着看着就习惯了
You're just going to have to get used to it.

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,140
把镜子给我
Hand me the mirror.

67
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,770
不
No!

68
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,470

狗狗博客  第二季第一集
Dog With a Blog  S02E01  Too Short

79
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,510
不
No!

80
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,310
不
No!

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
噢  托尔斯泰
Oh, Tolstoy.

82
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,690
咦  你开起来很开心嘛  艾芙莉
Well, you seem happy, Avery.

83
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,130
- 你怎么知道的  - 嗯  主要是这个
- What gave me away? - Well, mainly this.

84
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,160
我好激动啊  斯坦  
I'm just so excited, Stan,

85
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,450
因为今天是新学期第一天
because today's the first day of school.

86
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,710
我好爱上学  里面充满着读书和学习
I love school. All the reading and studying;

87
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,010
还有纠正老师时得到的那种快感
The rush you get when you correct a teacher.

88
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,670
就像骗一个骗子一样
It's like grifting a grifter.

89
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,780
我为什么要用摇滚兔子午餐盒
And why did I pick a Rock Star Rabbit lunchbox?

90
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,820
同学们肯定会叫我摇滚兔子的
Everyone's going to call me Rock Star Rabbit.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,610
克洛伊  不会有人因为你的午餐盒而叫你摇滚兔子的
Chloe, no one's going to call you that because of your lunchbox.

92
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,890
噢  娘你不懂
Oh, Mommy.

93
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,890
去年我用了个小红午餐盒
Last year I picked a little red

94
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,900
同学们喊了我一年的小红帽
lunchbox and everyone called me little red all year.

95
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,320
我觉得原因不在这儿
I'm not sure that's why.

96
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,380
难不成是我头发的原因吗
What else could it be?

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,480
你不可能一辈子藏着你的头发的
You're not going to be able to hide it forever.

98
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,540
起码也得试试  对吧
Well I have to try, don't I?

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,340
真谢谢你  现在我要兑现承诺了
Thanks to you, now I have to follow through on something.

100
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,930
熊孩子们  第一天上学  别迟到了
All right. First day of school. Don't wanna be late.

101
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,520
泰勒  确保克洛伊安全到她教室
Tyler, make sure Chloe gets safely to her class.

102
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,900
艾芙莉  确保泰勒安全到他教室
Avery, make sure Tyler gets safely to his class.

103
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,400
琳赛
Lindsay!

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
慢着  我们现在都上初二了
Wait, we're in eighth grade now.

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,070
我们应该要酷一点
We should probably be a little more cool.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,320
噢  你说的对  重来
Oh, you're right. Redo.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,140
- 哟  - 嘿  你们好
- S'up. - Hey, guys.

108
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,580
麦克斯
Max!

109
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,410
很欣慰我们的小团体回归了
I'm so glad our little group is back.

110
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,760
哇  你居然说好话  你通常都很消极的
Wow, that's so nice. Usually you're so negative.

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,030
你们都在这儿我就安心了  
I'm just relieved you're here.

112
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,040
我一直坚信这个暑假
I was certain that over the

113
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,080
我们其中一个会掉进一片流沙里
summer one of us would get sucked into a pit of quicksand.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,450
这才是麦克斯嘛  但我们是不会掉进流沙里的
There's our Max. We're not getting sucked in quicksand.

115
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,740
人们都说不会的  到了出事的时候就晚了
That's what people always say, until the day it happens.

116
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,620
记住  越挣扎就沉得越快
And remember, struggling only makes it worse.

117
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,480
不过  最重要的是
Well, the important thing is,

118
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,970
我们都返校了  什么都没变
we're all back and nothing has changed.

119
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,330
不过  安妮有变化  她摘掉了牙套还
Okay, Annie has changed. She lost her braces and got her...

120
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,610
对啊
Yeah.

121
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,440
哇  娜塔莉好像高了一英尺  金也高了
Wow, Natalie's, like, a foot taller. And so is Kim.

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,430
布莱恩也高了  阿曼达也高了
And Brian. And Amanda.

123
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,510
还有佩奇  本  瑞切尔  兴晓・鲁宾斯坦  都高了
And Paige and Ben and Rachel and Xing Xao Rubenstein.

124
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,050
我是唯一一个没长高的  
I'm the only one who didn't grow.

125
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,450
我感觉自己缩水了
I feel like I shrunk.

126
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,650
和同龄的孩子比的话
Well, only in comparison to all the other kids

127
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,490
你是挺矮的
who look their age.

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,140
噢  对不起  我好像帮倒忙了
Oh, sorry, I guess that's not helping.

129
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,280
我感觉每个人看着我在想
I feel like everyone's looking at me wondering...

130
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,390
看看艾芙莉  她为什么没长高
"Look at Avery! Why didn't she grow?"

131
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,270
我也不知道
I don't know why!

132
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,680
艾芙莉  你像疯子一样乱吼之前
Avery, no one was looking

133
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,750
根本没人在看你
at you until you shouted like a total loon.

134
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,730
大家都喜欢看疯子  这提醒了我
People look at total loons. Which reminds me,

135
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,980
我在超市看到你妈了
I saw your Mom at the supermarket.

136
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,960
艾芙莉  每个人长高的速度都不同  没什么大不了的
Avery, kids grow at different rates. It's not a big deal.

137
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,430
就是  我和你差不多高
Yeah, I'm about your height.

138
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,540
去年  你才到我温莎结这么高
Last year, you were up to my windsor knot.

139
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,740
- 你在长高  - 我知道  感觉身躯好庞大
- You're growing.   - I know. I feel huge.

140
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,900
长身体不完全像你想象中那么好
Growing's not all it's cracked up to be.

141
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,290
我这个暑假头大了一圈
I went up a hat size over the summer.

142
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,560
很多好看的软呢帽都戴不下了
Lost a lot of good fedoras.

143
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,860
所以  你就知足常乐吧你
So, count your blessings!

144
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,720
噢  我想孩子们了
Oh, I miss the kids.

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,130
真不敢相信他们要离开家一天
I can't believe they're going to be gone all day.

146
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,220
我真希望找到不想他们的办法
I wish there were some way I could miss them less.

147
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,310
嘿  我想到了
Hey! I've got it.

148
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,160
嗨  小艾芙莉  嗨  小泰勒  嗨  小克洛伊
Hi, little Avery. Hi, little Tyler. Hi, little Chloe.

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,000
你们会陪我的  对吧
You'll keep me company, won't you?

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,080
我为什么要用芝士来做啊
Why did I make them out of cheese?

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,420
不要  别弄了好吗  离我远点  丹尼
No, cut it out, okay? Leave me alone, Danny!

152
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,180
别这样  给我看看嘛
Come on! Let's see it.

153
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,020
能有多难看呢  一定很好笑
How bad can it be? I bet it's hilarious.

154
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,610
不行  头发太短了  我丑得跟怪兽似的
No! It's too short. It's hideous. I'm a monster.

155
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,050
你知道吗  我很尊重这一点
You know what? I respect that.

156
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,240
如果你不想给我看  
If you don't want to show me,

157
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,850
我也不会逼你去
I'm not gonna pressure you to...

158
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,650
哈
Ha!

159
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,820
你太易猜透了
You are so predictable.

160
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,290
你说的对  我也不知道我
You're right, I don't know what I was...

161
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,100
哈
Ha!

162
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,400
兄弟  你做一件事之前  我就知道你要做了
Dude, I always know what you're going to do before you do it.

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,280
- 是啊  我也这么想的  - 够了  我只穿了三件连帽衫
- Yeah, I guess so. Ha! - Okay, I only wore three hoods.

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,570
我真的没预计到你还要扒
I had no idea you were gonna do that.

165
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,400
我待会儿找你们
I'll catch you guys later.

166
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,480
斯坦  我在上学呢  
Stan, it's the middle of school.

167
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,440
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,100
没错  我不应该在这
Good point, shouldn't be here.

169
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,010
不过  我来都来了  我们做什么好呢
So, as long as I'm here, what do you want to do?

170
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,850
你想一起出去吗  聊聊金妮和乔的八卦
You wanna hang? Maybe talk trash about Ginny and Joe?

171
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,620
她看上他什么了
What does she see in him?

172
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,790
我们学校没有一对叫金妮和乔的情侣
There's no couple at the school named Ginny and Joe.

173
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,540
那么  你是说金妮现在单身吗
So, what you're saying is Ginny is available?

174
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,440
你在这里干什么  
What are you doing?

175
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,670
你是因为太想我们才过来的吗
Are you just here because you miss us?

176
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,830
啥  也不全是
What? Not "Just."

177
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,800
我一直想在绘画课上当一回活模特
I also was hoping to be a live model for the art class.

178
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,010
回家吧  我们放学了就回去
Go home, we'll be back after school.

179
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,440
好吧  不过他们会错过我的招牌“谁  我啊”姿势
Fine, but they'll be missing out on my "Who, me?" Pose...

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,720
谁  我啊
"Who, me?"

181
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,850
哇  那个新来的男孩是谁
Whoa, who's the new kid?

182
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,220
韦斯・曼宁  在网上查过他底细了
Wes Manning. Looked him up on the Internet.

183
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,430
他今年六十四岁  
He's a 64-year-old

184
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,290
是个从新泽西州特纳夫莱来的退休机械师
retired machinist from Tenafly, New Jersey.

185
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,030
感谢互联网
Thank you, Internet.

186
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,370
他好帅啊  你们留在这里  我去装路过
He's really cute. Wait here, I'm gonna do a walk-by.

187
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,060
你们可能觉得我的想法很奇怪  
You'll probably think I'm weird,

188
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,830
不过我挺激动的
but I'm kind of excited.

189
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,440
我很喜欢上学
I really like school.

190
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,070
喜欢上学
Likes school!

191
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,640
我喜欢聪明有趣的女孩
I like girls who are smart and funny.

192
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,360
喜欢聪明有趣的女孩
Likes smart, funny girls.

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
因为我们在读《动物农庄》
So, because we were reading Animal Farm,

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,560
（注：乔治・奥威尔政治讽喻小说）

195
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,980
他就带我们去一个动物园玩
he took us on a field trip to a petting zoo.

196
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,220
你让一个橄榄球教练
That's what happens when you

197
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,180
来上英语课  就会闹出这种笑话
let a football Coach teach an English class.

198
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,990
小伙伴们  他喜欢阅读和嘲笑橄榄球教练
Guys, he likes reading and making fun of football coaches.

199
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,510
他真完美
He's perfect!

200
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,580
- 那么  你应该去和他说话  - 不要  我不行的
- Well, you should go talk to him. - No. I can't.

201
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,560
我是说  他可能只喜欢
I mean, he probably only

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,450
暑假里长高了的女孩
likes the tall girls who grew over the summer.

203
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,150
噢  别傻了  你聪明有趣  长得还漂亮
Oh, that's crazy. You're smart and funny and really cute.

204
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,350
和他说话吧  最糟能糟到哪里去呢
Just talk to him. What's the worst that could happen?

205
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,610
你走到那里  然后被绊倒  又吐在了自己身上
You walk over there, you trip, you throw up on yourself.

206
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,190
这叫绊吐
It's called the trip-puke.

207
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,950
好  我就这么办吧
Okay. I'm gonna do it.

208
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,750
我的意思是  照琳赛说的做  不是去绊吐
I mean, what Lindsay said, not the trip-puke.

209
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,490
没人会故意绊吐的  它该发生时就发生
Nobody plans the trip-puke. It just happens.

210
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,410
看看那些六年级的小学生
Just look at the sixth graders.

211
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,030
还记得我们这么小的时候吗
Remember when we were that little?

212
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,600
好了  我没有  我不是  我才不是
Okay, I don't... I'm not... I don't even...

213
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,220
我只是  我只是
I'm just... I'm just...

214
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,030
太矮了
Too short.

215
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,530
太矮了  太矮了  太矮了
Too short! Too short! Too short!

216
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,320
我知道太短了  别再笑我了
I know it is! Stop mocking me!

217
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,420
你回来了  你回来了
You're home, you're home!

218
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,410
噢  我都不记得你离家多少个春秋了
Oh, I don't know if you've been gone months or years,

219
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,650
我更不确定你到底回不回来了
but I wasn't sure if you were ever coming back!

220
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,470
斯坦  我只是早上才出家门去上第一天学
Stan, I just left this morning for the first day of school.

221
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,930
但你连一张明信片都没寄过来
And you didn't send one postcard.

222
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,290
啊  你回家啦  你回家啦
Oh, you're home! You're home!

223
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,870
噢  我知道只过了一天  但我想死你了
Oh, I know it's only been a day, but I've missed you so much!

224
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,920
唉  感觉像过了一年
Ugh, it felt like a year.

225
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,340
说到我心坎里去了
That's what I was saying!

226
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,080
你知道应该要上下移动的吧
You know you're supposed to go up and down.

227
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,590
我是想长高点  不是想长壮点
I'm trying to get taller, not stronger.

228
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,090
你这样只会拉长你的手
You'll just make your arms longer.

229
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,470
等你的手长得耷拉在地上时  你就会像只小猩猩
They'll drag on the ground and you'll look like a chimp.

230
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,310
别光考虑你自己了
Now stop being so self-involved

231
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,170
快帮我想想我的头发怎么办
and help me figure out what to do about my hair!

232
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,900
你可以不要再纠结你的发型了吗
Will you stop obsessing over your stupid hair?!

233
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,660
- 我头发太短了  - 我整个身子都太短了
- My hair is too short! - My whole body is too short!

234
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,680
没错  所以基本上没人会看到你
Exactly, so you're practically invisible.

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,780
你的问题不是问题  
Your problem doesn't matter.

236
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,520
我这么高  别人能看到我
I'm up here, where people can see.

237
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,990
艾芙莉怎么了  
What's wrong with Avery?

238
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,780
她在烦恼她的身体
She's upset about her body.

239
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,750
好了  艾伦  你已经准备好面对这个时刻的到来
Okay, Ellen, you've been preparing for this moment.

240
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,750
你不会像你妈一样搞砸的
You're not gonna mess it up like your Mom did.

241
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,790
我必须先和自己来个小谈话
I had to have my little talk with myself.

242
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,590
我现在已经在谈了  聊得很愉快  艾伦
Which I'm doing right now. Good talk, Ellen.

243
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,500
小甜心
Sweetie...

244
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,800
我明白你有些身体上的困扰
I understand you are having issues with your body.

245
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
所以  我们来说点女生的悄悄话吧
So, let's have a little gal chat.

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,740
你只要告诉我你的问题和疑虑
You tell me what your questions or concerns are.

247
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,680
我就会用这么多年来
I'll offer you the wisdom I've

248
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,910
积累的女性经验来帮你解决
collected from my experiences as a lifelong woman.

249
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,240
现在  你说出身体的一个部位  我们来聊聊
Now, just point to a part of your body and we'll talk about it.

250
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,190
我和自己谈这事的时候  
That talk went so much better

251
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,570
效果比现在好多了
when I gave it to myself.

252
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,830
克洛伊  二年级的第一天怎么样
Chloe, how was the first day of second grade?

253
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,690
我学到了“大象”这词里面有个P
I learned that "Elephant" Has a P in it.

254
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,130
我不明白你们为什么没有告诉我
I don't know why no one here told me that.

255
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,440
午餐盒受欢迎吗  
How'd the lunchbox go over?

256
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
午餐盒已经不重要了
The lunchbox didn't matter.

257
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,270
在二年级  里面的东西才重要
In second grade, what matters is what's inside.

258
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,820
我告诉克洛伊这样真的挺好的
I told Chloe that's actually kind of nice.

259
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,280
就像一个人  外在的东西并不重要
Like with a person. What matters isn't what's on the...

260
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,110
在车上你没让我心情变好
Didn't make me feel better in the car.

261
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,550
现在你也没让我心情变好
Not making me feel better now.

262
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,450
我以为我给你做了一顿很丰盛的午餐呢
I thought I made you a very nice lunch.

263
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,660
很明显  亲爱的  午餐时间要交换食物
Well, apparently, hon, lunchtime is all about trading.

264
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,860
你做的午餐没有交换的价值
Your lunch had no trade value.

265
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,890
- 我只换到了这个  - 一只香蕉
- This was all I could get for it. - A banana?

266
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,640
不是  只有蕉皮
No. Just the peel.

267
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,060
但他们没有换走你的午餐  
But they didn't take your lunch.

268
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,900
这是块表示可怜的蕉皮
It was a pity peel.

269
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,670
我之前不知道午餐有这么重要
I didn't realize it was such a big deal.

270
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,420
我明天一定会用心做一顿丰盛的午餐给你的
I'll try and make you a really great lunch for tomorrow.

271
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,410
谢谢妈妈  我知道你会说到做到的  
Thanks, Mommy! I knew you'd come through.

272
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,900
我相信你
I believe in you!

273
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,700
噢  你真贴心啊小乖乖  你的鼓励对我意义重大
Aw, that's so sweet, honey. It means so much to me.

274
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,830
你是对的  爸爸  她喜欢听鼓励的话
You're right, Daddy, she responds to encouragement.

275
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,760
当然  我在车上教你的东西也不是一无是处啊
Well, not everything I taught you in the car was useless.

276
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,940
好了  我一直在思考我的身高问题
All right, I've been thinking about my problem, and I'm

277
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,160
我要行动起来  妈  你开车带我去商场
going to take action Mom, you're driving me to the Mall.

278
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
噢  太好了  小甜心  在去的路上
Oh, that's great sweetheart on the way there...

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,210
如果你敢和我说女生悄悄话
If you try to gal talk me on the drive...

280
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,600
我就在高速公路上跳出你的车
I will stunt roll out of the moving car onto the freeway.

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,790
呃  不是在车子开着的时候跳  我又不傻
Well, not out of the moving car. I'm not a stunt woman.

282
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,080
我的意思是  我会在完全没有危险的时候离开你的车
The point is, I'm out of there as soon as it's completely safe.

283
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,360
艾芙莉说她逛了商场之后就解决了她的问题
Avery said she went to the Mall and fixed her problem.

284
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,770
我想知道她做了什么
I wonder what she did.

285
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,290
我觉得是这个
I think that.

286
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,450
好看吗  这双高跟鞋增高了六英寸
So, these platforms add six inches...

287
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,890
头发增高了八英寸
The hair's another eight, and

288
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,350
衣服上的竖纹产生的错觉又增高了两英寸
the vertical stripes add the illusion of two more.

289
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,000
你们觉得怎么样
What do you think?

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
我们该怎么处理
How are we playing this?

291
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,930
是说她需要听的还是她想听的
What she needs to hear or what she wants to hear?

292
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,220
艾芙莉  你看起来很不错
Avery, you look great!

293
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,450
说她想听的  懂了
Wants to hear... got it.

294
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,020
你看起来很高
You look tall.

295
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,950
是啊  我要在我自信心摧毁之前去和韦斯说话
Well, I better go talk to Wes before I lose my confidence.

296
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,220
如果你不能书写自己的命运
What's the point of looking like

297
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,850
又何必装成一支铅笔呢
a giant pencil if you can't write your own destiny?

298
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,540
- 嗨  我叫艾芙莉  - 对不起  没空
- Hi, I'm Avery. - Sorry, not now.

299
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,850
斯坦  过来
Stan, come here!

300
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,580
我以为我说清楚了  你不准来学校看我们
I thought I told you, you can't come to see us at school.

301
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,890
我真的好担心
I was just so worried about

302
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,980
金妮和乔能不能熬过分手的伤痛
how Ginny and Joe were taking the break-up.

303
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,910
- 金妮和乔复合了  - 他们复合了
- Ginny and Joe are made up. - They made up?

304
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,140
太棒了
That's great.

305
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,590
那两个傻孩子的确值得拥有一个重新开始的机会
Those two crazy kids deserve a chance.

306
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,610
斯坦  你要学会接受
Stan, you've gotta accept

307
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,290
我们现在每天都得上学这个事实
that we're going to school every day now.

308
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,360
你不能经常没事就跑过来
You can't be hanging around here so much.

309
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,610
你怎么会觉得我经常没事就跑过来呢
What makes you think I'm hanging around so much?

310
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,430
雕像虽然没穿衣服  但它们味道真不错
They're nudes, but they're tasteful.

311
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,410
艾芙莉吗  这张被子下面盖的是你吗
Avery? Is that lump under the covers you?

312
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,870
你觉得呢  斯坦
What do you think, Stan?

313
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,130
尺寸和形状都和你很相似
Well, the lump is about your size and shape.

314
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,090
声音听起来挺像你  闻起来也像
And has your voice, and smells like you.

315
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,930
所以不是你就是只鸭子
So, it's either you or a duck.

316
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,490
我以后都不想再上学了
I don't ever want to go back to school again.

317
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,660
但是艾芙莉很喜欢上学  
But Avery loves school.

318
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,690
你对艾芙莉做了些什么  臭鸭子
What did you do with Avery, duck?

319
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,050
我是全年级最矮的  斯坦
I'm the smallest kid in my grade, Stan.

320
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,170
我不合群了
I just don't fit in.

321
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,900
艾芙莉  你的身高和你的自身价值没有关系
Avery, your size has nothing to do with your worth.

322
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,090
我是不是比那些蹲在女人手袋里
Am I worth more than one of

323
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,340
的小狗狗更有价值呢
those little dogs that women carry in their purses?

324
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,940
当然是了
Yes, I am.

325
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,060
举错例子了
That's a bad example.

326
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,760
我就是那种小狗狗  斯坦  
I am the purse dog, Stan.

327
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,380
那个叫韦斯的男孩不肯跟我说话
I mean, this boy Wes won't even talk to me.

328
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,140
因为你的身高吗
Because of your height?

329
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,140
他喊我“六年级小学生”
He called me a "Little sixth grader"

330
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,450
而且今天他完全无视我
and then today he totally blew me off.

331
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,020
如果不是因为我矮  他为什么要这样对我
Why would he do that if it wasn't because I'm short?

332
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,150
太悲催了  不过你现在有个选择
That's terrible. But now you have a choice.

333
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,400
蹲手袋小狗狗也分两种  发抖型和凶猛型
There are two kinds of purse dogs; Shivering or vicious.

334
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,250
你是哪一种  艾芙莉
Which one are you, Avery?

335
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,600
我有点神经紧张  
I am a little high-strung.

336
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,400
还有点爱冷酷待人
I have a tendency to get cold.

337
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,810
- 我少食多餐  - 你是凶猛型
- I eat small, but frequent, meals. - Say "Vicious."

338
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,290
- 凶猛型  - 没错  你就是
- Vicious! - Yeah, you are.

339
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,920
对耶  我很凶猛  并且我还要骂他一顿
Yeah, I am. And I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.

340
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,480
明天  我要在学校里告诉他  他有多混蛋
Tomorrow at school, I'm going to tell him what a jerk he is.

341
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,910
他才是应该对自己的行为感到羞愧的人  而不是我
He's the one who should feel bad about this, not me.

342
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,460
这才是你嘛  或者是手袋小狗狗  或者是鸭子
Thatagirl! Or purse dog. Or duck.

343
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,460
随便你是什么
Or whatever you are.

344
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,180
嘿  艾芙莉  你妈妈告诉我
Hey, Avery. Your Mother tells

345
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,200
你对自己的身体有些困扰
me you've been having some issues with your body.

346
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,080
咳  我知道她的方法有点烦人
Well... I know her approach may have been a little off-putting.

347
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,880
但你走运了  因为我有小河马哈蕾
But lucky for you, I have Harriet the hippo.

348
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,080
哈蕾也对她现在的身体变化
Now, Harriet's has her insecurities

349
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,150
感到很害怕
about her changing body, too.

350
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,290
我想知道她们怎么
I wonder what they...

351
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,260
哈蕾  你吓着人了
Harriet, you scare people.

352
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,460
妈妈  亏我相信过你  
Mommy, I believed in you.

353
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,230
这对我意义重大
And that means a lot to me.

354
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,390
相  信  过
Believed.

355
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,460
别告诉我今天的午餐又不行
Don't tell me today's lunch was no good, either.

356
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,970
我用昨晚剩的鸡肉给你做了个很好吃的三明治
I made you a very nice sandwich with leftover chicken.

357
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,280
你叫我怎么交换食物  
How can I trade this?

358
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,870
你看看它拿起来长什么样
Look what happens when you pick it up.

359
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,510
所以小朋友都管它叫“掉馅灾难烂三明治”
All the kids called it the "Fall apart disaster stink sandwich."

360
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,130
听起来真傻
That's not even clever.

361
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,850
你还想咋地  我们才二年级
What do you want? We're in second grade.

362
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,190
我不明白这怎么又成问题了
I don't understand why this is a problem now.

363
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,890
你在一年级是没有这个问题啊
This wasn't a problem in first grade.

364
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,510
一年级的时候  我们浆糊泥土什么的都吃
In first grade, we'd eat anything. Paste, mud...

365
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,640
托尼吃过他的鞋带
Tony ate his shoelaces.

366
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,320
因为这事儿学校还开过大会呢
We had to have an assembly about it.

367
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,930
但是我们现在都二年级了
But now we're in second grade...

368
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,630
除了托尼留级
Except for Tony.

369
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,780
我们想吃点正常的  
We want something good.

370
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,950
我要带一些能交换的食物
I need something I can trade.

371
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,710
艾芙莉二年级时的午餐是怎样的
What did Avery do in second grade?

372
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,120
她自己做的
She made her own lunch.

373
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,840
哦  反正我是不会自己做的
Yeah, I am not gonna do that.

374
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,740
好吧  那你明天午餐想要什么
Fine, so what do you want in your lunch tomorrow?

375
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,240
- 要十块钱  - 哦  反正我是不会给的
- Ten dollars. - Yeah, I am not gonna do that.

376
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,720
嘿  艾芙莉  我想过你的问题了
Oh, hey, Avery. I've been thinking about your problem,

377
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,550
你要不要考虑一下戴个帽子
and have you considered wearing a hat?

378
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,850
看起来会高很多
It can make you look taller.

379
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,360
不必了  琳赛  帽子是你的风格
No, Lindsay, hats are your thing.

380
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,760
噢  谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

381
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,830
幸亏说出这句话的人不必是我
I didn't want to have to be the one to say that.

382
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,340
而且我发现  这不是我的问题  是韦斯的问题
And I realized, it's not my problem. It's Wes's.

383
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,060
如果他因为我矮就不喜欢我  
And if he doesn't like me because I'm short,

384
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,190
那他就是个坏蛋
then he's a jerk...

385
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,780
一个有着淡褐色眼睛的梦幻般的坏蛋
A dreamy, hazel-eyed jerk.

386
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,350
我才不会告诉他这个呢
And I'm going to tell him that.

387
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,270
你说的时候
And while you're at it,

388
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,950
顺便提一下他那轮廓分明的下巴和飘逸的头发
mention his chiseled jaw and perfect hair.

389
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,250
他会伤心死的
That'll get him.

390
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,750
你确定不是因为你想多了
Are you sure this isn't just all in your head?

391
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,380
也许他不在意你矮不矮的问题
Maybe he doesn't care that you're short.

392
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,060
那他为什么昨天完全无视掉我呢
Then why else would he have blown me off like that yesterday?

393
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,130
啊  这颗恶心的痘痘就是弄不掉
Ugh. This gross pimple will not go away.

394
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,550
它消失之前  我不想让任何女生看到我
I don't want any girls looking at me until it's gone.

395
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,400
呃  对不起  没空
Uh, sorry, not now.

396
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,480
臭痘痘
Stupid pimple.

397
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,950
嘿  韦斯  我知道你为什么不想看我
Hey, Wes. I know why you won't look at me,

398
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,020
原因很让人恶心
and it's disgusting!

399
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,140
你非常讨人厌  而且你恶心到我了
You are a repulsive person and you make me sick.

400
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,410
只是颗痘痘而已  它会消掉的
It's just a pimple. It'll go away!

401
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,750
等一下  痘痘  什么痘痘  我不知道原来你长了痘痘
Wait! Pimple? What pimple? I didn't know about your pimple!

402
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,540
对不起  我一直在说痘痘
Sorry! I keep saying pimple.

403
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,030
他怎么了
What's up with him?

404
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,070
长痘了
Pimple.

405
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,190
我和他彻底没戏了
I really blew it with him.

406
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,690
我以为每个人都因为我矮
I thought everyone was looking

407
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,730
而用异样的眼光看我
at me differently because of my size but,

408
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,720
可能真的只是我想多了
maybe it really was all in my head.

409
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,870
就像根本没人注意到韦斯的痘痘一样
Just like probably no one even noticed Wes's pimple.

410
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,650
嘿  也许别人一样没有发现你的头发短了  
Hey, maybe it's the same with your hair.

411
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,030
我头发怎么了
What about my hair?

412
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,360
我是说  可能别人不觉得你的头发有你想象那么糟
I mean, maybe no one else will think it's as bad as you do.

413
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,310
不是的  真的很难看
Oh, no. It's bad.

414
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,040
但是别人总会看到的
But everyone's going to see it at some point,

415
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,730
所以我不如用这个来做件好事吧
so I might as well use that to do some good.

416
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,430
喂  长痘的
Hey, pimple boy.

417
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,600
嘿  小伙子  不要为我妹妹说的话难过
Hey, man. Don't feel bad about what my sister said.

418
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,350
我们每个人都会有难堪的缺点
We all have our hideous flaws.

419
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,470
起码你看上去不是这样的
At least yours doesn't look like this...

420
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,450
你们全家都这么坏
Your whole family is so mean!

421
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,080
我觉得我们都学到了些东西
Well, I think we all learned something here.

422
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,850
我头发的迷人之处不在于长短
The amazingness of my hair was never in its length.

423
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,450
是啊  我们就学到了这个
Yes. That's what we learned.

424
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,870
艾芙莉明白了
Avery figured out that just

425
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,290
只因为她自己对一些事难为情
because she was self-conscious about something

426
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,500
并不代表每个人都是这样看的
didn't mean that everyone else was looking at it the same way.

427
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,100
而我也悟出了一个道理
And I figured something out, too,

428
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,380
多亏泰勒帮了我一个小忙
 thanks to a little help from Tyler.

429
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,160
给你  斯坦  
Here, Stan.

430
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,820
你想我们的时候  就和它们玩吧
Whenever you miss us, you just play with these.

431
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,270
谢谢  泰勒
Thanks, Tyler.

432
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,580
对了  还有个好消息
Oh, and the good news is

433
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,300
它们不是芝士做的  所以你不会吃掉它们
they're not made of cheese, so you won't eat them.

434
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,680
永远不要断定一条狗一定不会吃掉什么东西
Never assume a dog won't eat something.

435
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,050
真不敢相信我吃了个弹簧  
I can't believe I ate a spring.

436
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,880
我希望我拉出来时
When I poop that out,

437
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,150
它不会蹦回我屁眼里
I hope it doesn't bounce back in.

438
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,910
猜猜同学们今天给我的午餐取了个什么名字
Guess what they called my lunch today?

439
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,620
叫鲁本三明治
A Reuben sandwich.

440
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,520
是以一个叫鲁本的孩子命名的
Named after a really smelly kid named Reuben,

441
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,790
他又难闻又喜欢把他内裤穿在裤子外面
who wears his underwear on the outside of his pants.

442
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,390
克洛伊  我真的很用心地给你做了顿很美味的午餐
Chloe, I really upped my game and made you an amazing lunch.

443
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,600
如果你能吃掉这个  我就不埋怨你
If you can eat this, I'll stop complaining.

444
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,110
班尼特  过来这里
Bennett, come here.

445
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,120
让我们告诉克洛伊这个三明治有多好吃
Let's show Chloe what a great sandwich this is.

446
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,920
我
Me?

447
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,950
你吃一半  我吃一半  支持我一下
You eat half, I'll eat half. Support me on this.

448
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,500
呃  我也想支持你
Well, I want to support you,

449
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,870
但我刚好有异常强烈的反胃现象
but I have an abnormally strong gag reflex.

450
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,130
- 你也太假了吧  - 我不想吐出来
- You're being dramatic... - I don't want to throw up...

451
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,070
- 吃了它  - 好吧
- Eat it! - Okay!

452
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,990
吃就吃
Okay.

453
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,870
我能咽下去的
I can do this.

454
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,150
别这样  不是很
Come on, it is not so...

455
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,420
继续啊  难吃的还在后头
Keep going. It gets worse.

456
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,950
这是软骨
That's cartilage.

457
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,830
吃完了
There.

458
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,870
- 好吃  - 唔  真好吃
- Good. - Mm mm. Good.

459
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,550
现在吃土豆沙拉
Now the potato salad.

460
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,350
明天我给你十块钱买午餐
Tomorrow I'll put ten dollars in your lunch.

461
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,590
我别无他求
That's all I'm asking.

462
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,480
噢  难道是弹簧  我特别害怕
Oh, not the spring! I was afraid of that.
