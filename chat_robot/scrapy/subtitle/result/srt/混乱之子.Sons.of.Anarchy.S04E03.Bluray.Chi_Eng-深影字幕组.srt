- 信? - 莫林・阿什比
Letters? Maureen Ashby.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,111
你觉得贾克斯读了? 
And you think Jax read them? 

6
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:14,044
肯定是贾克斯或者塔拉找到的

That's 700 for your current stock.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,270

我准备好毒品等你回去时带走

You forgot to mention we'd be running coke for the Galindo Cartel?

13
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,117
我们投票是决定卖枪给他们
We voted in selling them guns.

14
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,697
我们会再投一次票的

我要你支持我 这样才能通过

如果我帮你 那你移交帮派时
If I do this, when you hand over the club

17

你得尽量让奥佩当主席 就这个条件
you push for president's patch to go to Opie. That's the deal.

18
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,189
我退出换你的毒品
My out for your drugs.

19
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,905
你们闻到烟味了?

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,441
你逼我的 我强烈建议你别再这么做
You pushed me to this, and I strongly suggest you don't do it again.

21
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,962
我有些好消息
I have some good news.

22
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,472
我们订婚了

现在鲍比 派尼 祖斯反对

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,979
其他人怎么说?
Where we at with the rest?

25
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,171
奇博斯知道我们需要这个
Chibs knows we need this 

26
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,737
来达成对爱尔兰共和军的承诺
to fill our Irish commitment.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,990
他会支持我们
He'll go our way.

28
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,526
蒂格和爽哥也是
Tig and Happy too.

29
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,909
还得要一票
Still need one more.

30

柯茨克? 戒过毒 我估计他会反对
Kozik? Ex-junkie. I'm thinking he's a no.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,583
- 我们能争取到奥佩? - 有可能
- We any closer with Ope? - A little.

32
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,402
他明白集团这单快递送货的好处 
He saw the benefit of having the cartel on speed-dial, 

33
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:27,795
但他还没完全同意
but he's not there yet.

34
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,174
那你就得推他一把
Well, you need to get him there now.

35
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,413
奥佩能为我们争取到迈尔斯
Ope gives us Miles,

36
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:33,542
那样就是多数票了
 that gets us the majority.

37
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,171
你还得去做做鲍比工作
And you need to work on Bobby.

38
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,764
太难了 别想阻止他散播负面情绪了
Very least, stop him from spreading woe.

39
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,992
- 你用那个? - 是啊
- You using that? - Yeah.

40
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,351
那是亚伯用旧的
It's Abel's old one.

41
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,748
那个不行了 买个新的
It's a piece of shit. Buy a new one.

42
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:46,397
- 你确定? - 是啊
- You sure? - Yeah.

43
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,058
我们应该把它存放好防止其中一个小子用的上
We should put it in storage just in case one of the guys needs it.

44
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,321

你在适当的时候分享了好消息

那绝对是经典一招
 That was a class act.

50
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,759
- 那确实帮了忙 - 没什么
- It really helped. - Of course.

就像我爱他的老爸
as much as I loved his old man.

58

- I think he might need a change. - Oh.

60
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,406
是吗? 你知道吗 这些其实是一次性的
You think? You know, these are actually disposable.

61
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,420
只要脱下来 换个新的
You just take them off, put a new one on.

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,034
真的? 
Really? 

63
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:05,265
现在我真觉得带孩子这个事对你真不容易
And here I thought this whole raising-kids thing was so hard on you.

64
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,027
哦 嚯 嚯
Oh, ho, ho.

65
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,481
你再不走就得在孩子的尿里洗澡了
You should just get out of here before you're swimming in baby piss.

66

跟你一起被绑架的朋友玛格丽特呢?

慢慢了解一些情况 
Learned to navigate around the subject. 

77
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:54,025
啊 你就是这么处理的?
Ah, is that how you deal with it?

78
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,752
假装它不存在? 围着它打转?
Pretend it doesn't exist? Move around it?

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,358
我真没时间回答一个接一个的
I don't have time for 20

00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,715
消极且带攻击性的问题伽玛 直奔主题吧

我问过了
I did.

82
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,537
我没有欺骗别人我是谁或者跟谁在一起
I don't lie about who I am or who I'm with

83
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,774
但我也不想把它当成很光荣的事 
but I don't wear it like a badge of honor. 

84
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,833
你应该的
Well, you should.

85

哼嗯 我完全不知道那是什么意思 
Hmm. I have no idea what that means. 

89
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:23,179
意思是我们想法不一样
It means we think differently.

90
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,307

- A little herbal fusion. - Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

132
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,470
在我们了解所有人的选择之前 
Before we clear anybody's passage, 

133
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,001
先把这些木板箱做好
let's just get these crates built.

134
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,469
鲍比 你跟我一起 去瓦汉瓦
Bobby, you're with me. Wahewa.

135
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,679
要我做什么?
Why you need me?

136
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,933
- 因为我想你 - 要我一起吗?
- Because I miss you. - You want me with?

137
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,000
不不 我们没事 在这儿帮忙
No, no, we're good. Stay available.

138
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,478
也许还需要人装些弹药
May need somebody to haul some ammo.

139
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
装吧 婊子
D up, bitch.

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,031
别让他这么玩弄 拦住他
Don't give him that lane. Stop that.

141
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,158
哦! 哦 老天!
Oh! Oh, God!

142
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:34,000
# 回到头罩里变得很忙 说真的 #
Back in the 'hood Getting busy, for sheezy

143
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,914
你要让他继续侮辱你吗? 加油 伙计
You gonna let him shoot that shit over you? Come on, man.

144
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,707
18比12
Eighteen-12.

145
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,959
该死 布鲁 这沙滩白大战黑人的状况 
Damn, Brew, this beach-white nigga 

146
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,170
让你看起来像个傻逼
got you looking like Cleveland.

147
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,089
- 哈 哈 哈 - 确实
- Ha-ha-ha. - For real.

148
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,717
胡闹 伙计
That's bullshit, man.

149
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:52,555
- 抢钥匙! - 快!
- Get the keys! - Hurry up!

150
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,223
快跑! 走 走!
Get the hell out of here! Go, go!

151
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,375
# 我要让你知道我的力量 #
I'm gonna show you I got the power

152
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,227
你知道怎么开卡车吗?
Do you even know how to drive a truck?

153
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,604
把你的屁股挪过围墙
Get your ass over the fence.

154
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,441
# 我要让你看看谁是老大 #
I'm gonna show you who's the boss

155
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,902
# 你会付出代价的 #
You're gonna have to pay the cost

156
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,404
# 抓我的现行啊 #
Catch me on the run

157
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,655
哦 见鬼
Oh, shit.

158
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,907
# 戴上头罩什么都不容易 那是真的 #
Ain't nothing come easy in the 'hood That's for sheezy

159
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,368
# 为了我的工作 #
For my business

160
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,954
真操蛋!
You got to be shitting me!

161
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:23,294
# 在这世间 独自穿行 #
Riding through this world All alone

162
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:28,841
# 上帝带走你的灵魂 你独自一人 #
God takes your soul You're on your own

163
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:34,763
# 乌鸦径直飞过 划出完美的线条 #
The crow flies straight A perfect line

164
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:40,603
# 在恶魔的床上 奄奄一息 #
On the devil's bed Until you die

165
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,990
# 此生如是 你必须直视 #
Gotta look this life In the eye

166
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,200
混乱之子 第四季 第3集

167
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:59,246
罗密罗 "罗密欧" 帕拉达
Romero "Romeo" Parada.

168
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,000
前墨西哥军队指挥官
Ex-Mexican military commando

169
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:04,001
由乔斯・盖林度征募 
enlisted by Jose Galindo 

170
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,003
掌管他的集团战略执行单位
to head up his cartel's strategic enforcement unit.

171
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,406
集团还有战略执行单位?
The cartel has a strategic enforcement unit?

172
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,637
索诺拉的集团有两个 
There are two Sonora-based cartels: 

173
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,346
盖林度和罗布・索诺拉
Galindo's and Lobo Sonora.

174
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,109
六个月前整个地区开始血拼
Blood feud over the whole territory began about six months ago.

175
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:20,643
看不出停手的迹象
Shows no sign of stopping.

176
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,010
所以罗密欧需要枪支
And Romeo needs guns.

177
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,953
是的 我猜为了拿到酬劳 
Yes, I'm guessing the Sons will be 

178
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,814
混乱之子会给他们运毒
expediting the coke that pays for them.

179
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,724
- 贩毒? - 不是在他们的仓库里
- Dealing? - Not in their wheelhouse.

180
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,020
也许用摩托运回北加州
Probably muling blow back to Northern Cali.

181
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,386
- 见鬼 - 我们过去几年
- Shit. - We've been watching Galindo

182
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:35,826
一直监视盖林度 他有点精神变态
for the last couple years. He's a spunky little psychopath.

183
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:39,100
自从他招募了罗密欧 他们就为TJ和其他人
Since he hired Romeo, they've been giving TJ and others

184
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,646
努力提供钱和毒品
a hard run for money and drugs.

185
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,541
我们听说罗密欧在斯托克顿跟混乱之子会面了
We'd heard Romeo had reached out to the Sons in Stockton

186
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,370
但是不能确定他们怎么解决俄罗斯人的
but weren't sure how they'd fit with the Russians.

187
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,921
我猜他们最后达成了一致
Guess they figured that out.

188
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,632
这个是从一个加油站的监控镜头提取的
This was lifted from a gas station security cam

189
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,000
就在我美丽的出生地 
outside of my beautiful birthplace, 

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,650
莫得斯托的附近 两天前
Modesto, two days ago.

191
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,511
所以帕拉达回到镇子里来了 哼?
So Parada's back in town, hm?

192
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,859
是的 不过又消失了 
He was. Off the grid again. 

193
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,872
那现在怎么办?
So now what?

194
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:02,551
没人打入内部记载枪支运送记录
Without someone inside to document the gunrunning

195
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,222
我们要将混乱之子作为RICO法案的主要目标
...we need to make the Sons the primary RICO target.

196
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,681
所以现在 我的当地执法朋友 
So now, my locally enforced friend, 

197
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,346
我们开始执行B计划
we move on to plan B.

198
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,656
请这位乌鸦先生做线人
Engage Mr. Crow to create the ties that bind.

199
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,032
胡汉・卡洛斯・奥提茨
Juan Carlos Ortiz.

200
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,826
我需要你把他抓起来
I need you to pick him up.

201
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,794
那有什么用?
How does that help?

202
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,620
我们需要建立一个新的组织犯罪史 
We need to create a history of organized crime, 

203
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,867
过去和现在的
past and present.

204
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,378
祖斯是我们的联结点
Juice is our "now" connection.

205
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,328
我可以以违反释放协定为名逮捕他
I can pick him up on a release violation.

206
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:34,992
他是一家草药店的合伙拥有者
He's a part owner of a weed shop.

207
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,120
很好
Good.

208
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:40,150
但是你不能让他察觉到这么多 
But you can't tip him off to any of this. 

209
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:41,593
只能以本地事务威胁他
The threat must remain local.

210
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:43,300
你们想要我对他做什么?
What do you want me to do with him?

211
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,893
就让他知道你察觉到他的家庭关系了
Just let him know that you're aware of his family tree

212
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,482
而且你会再找到他
and that you'll be in touch.

213
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,615
好的 我马上过来
All right, I'm coming.

214
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,700
- 怎么了? - 是迈尔斯
- What's going on? - That was Miles.

215
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,664
- 貌似枪支有点麻烦 - 要我叫克雷吗?
- Some kind of hiccup with the guns. - Should I call Clay?

216
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,955
不 他跟鲍比需要好好谈谈
No, him and Bobby need some quality time.

217
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,503
呆在这儿 叫其他的菜鸟帮着搞定这些
Stay here, get the other prospects to help finish these up.

218
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,780
- 照顾好他 - 没问题
- Take care of him. - Absolutely.

219
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,460
你跟我们走 跟着小货车 我们走
You're with us. Follow in the van. Let's go.

220
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,000
我跟 克雷要你呆在这儿
I'm going with. Clay wanted you to stay here.

221
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:22,000
我不想做他的小弹药婊子 我不干
I'm not gonna be his little ammo bitch. I'm not gonna do it.

222
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,767
要是枪有问题 我得去
If there's a problem with those guns, I should be there.

223
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,978
好吧 蒂格
All right, Tiggy.

224
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:39,198
我知道你带我出来不会是因为我懂子弹
I know you didn't bring me out here for my vast knowledge of projectiles.

225
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,742
我想跟你单独谈谈
I wanted to talk to you alone.

226
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,661
想说什么就说吧 老大
Say what you gotta say, pres.

227
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,309
过去几年我们后受到的打击 
The beating we took over these last few years, 

228
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,451
你知道 让我们损失了很多
you know has set us way back.

229
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,371
生活的一部分 我加入帮派不是为了变得富有
Part of the life. I didn't join this club to get rich.

230
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,000
无关富有 但关乎生存
It ain't about getting rich, it's about getting whole.

231
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,382
帮派需要动力
This club needs an infusion.

232
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,430
你怎么让你儿子同意这些的?
How'd you get the boy to sign off on this?

233
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,894
毒品几乎杀了他的第一个孩子
Drugs nearly killed his firstborn.

234
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,605
他改变了
He's changed.

235
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,608
他陷的太深了 我
He's gone way inside. I

236
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,530
我不知道是什么推动了他 也许是时间
I don't know what pushed him. Maybe it was the time.

237
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,781
- 也许是我? - 我不知道
- Maybe it was me? - I don't know.

238
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,242
他不再是原来那个他
He's not the same guy.

239
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,000
好吧 他当然知道对帮派什么最重要
Well, he sure knows what's best for this club.

240
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:29,080
省省吧 我们不是在投票桌前
Kill the bullshit, we're not sitting around the table.

241
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,680
你是在向着门口猛冲 
You're sprinting for the door, 

242
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:33,126
趁它还开着赶紧塞满自己的口袋
stuffing your pockets before it slams shut.

243
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,586
我明白的
I get that.

244
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,169
但是贾克斯得到了什么好处? 
But what does Jax get out of it? 

245
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:36,922
知道吗?
You know what?

246
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,301
你要怎么想我无所谓 因为我不在乎
You think whatever the hell you want to about me, because I don't give a shit.

247
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,052
我唯一关心的是这个帮派的未来
My main concern is the future of this MC.

248
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,198
我告诉你贾克斯得到了什么 
I'll tell you what Jax gets out of it. 

249
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,302
我就是带你来谈这个
That's what I brought you to talk about.

250
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,340
不过 我希望这只是你跟我之间的事 
Only thing is, I need for this to stay between you and me, 

251
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,575
你明白吗?
you understand?

252
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,568
因为贾克斯不想任何人知道这个
Because Jax doesn't want anybody to know about this.

253
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,277
我要你保证
I need your word.

254
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,950
贾克斯想要退出
Jax wants out.

255
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,034
他有两个孩子 他有个爱着的妻子
He's got two sons, he's got an old lady he loves.

256
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,582
他不干了
He's done.

257
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,674
他支持运毒 你让他净身出户
He backs the drugs, you let him out clean.

258
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,507
是的
Yep.

259
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,846
那跟我有什么关系?
What's that got to do with me?

260
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,644
我想支持你取代我
You're the guy I endorse to replace me.

261
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,510
是啊 如果我投票支持毒品 你就... 
Yeah, if I vote for the drugs, you'll... 

262
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,181
无关投票
It's not about any vote.

263
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,900
我是在传位于你
I'm handing you the gavel

264
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,323
因为你是做这个工作的最合适人选
because you're the best guy for the job.

265
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,160
如果你想的话
If you want it.

266
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,998
我是在向你做出承诺
I'm giving you my word.

267
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,419
你想找查理 Horse?
You looking for Charlie Horse?

268
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,003
- 呃 是的 - 他出去了 在南边屋子
- Uh, yeah. - He's out in the south res.

269
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,301
上车跟着我
Get in your truck and follow me.

270
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,609
- 嘿 - 嗯
- Hey. - Mm.

271
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,571
我就想记住该怎么做
Just trying to remember how to do this.

272
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,116
把火点着香
You put the flame to the wick.

273
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,285
谢谢
Thanks.

274
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,606
你不去你的教堂了?
You stop going to your church?

275
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,168
当你被你自己的罪行埋葬时 
When you're buried in your own shit, 

276
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,421
那神圣之心似乎有点遥不可及
the Sacred Heart seems a little out of reach.

277
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,801
你总得相信些什么 韦恩
You gotta believe in something, Wayne.

278
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,513
你自己有多信?
Where you at with that?

279
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,068
保持不变的信仰
Same place I'm always at.

280
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,893
不 你不是 亲爱的
No, you're not, sweetheart.

281
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,669
我们想做到不变 但我们做不到
We wanna stay the same, but we can't.

282
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,856
我们越老
Older we get

283
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,402
就越变得不像我们希望自己变成的那样
the further away we get from who we think we are.

284
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,950
说够了吗 孔夫子?
Are we done here, Confucius?

285
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,995
- 是的 - 我们走
- Yeah. - Let's go.

286
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,754
在这儿等着 你看见塔拉过来 就敲一下门
Wait here. You see Tara coming, knock on the door.

287
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,710
哇哦 不是把? 你带我来是给你望风的?
Whoa. Really? You brought me here to be your goddamn spotter?

288
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,844
我得做完我自己开始做的事情
I'm finishing what I started.

289
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,229
见鬼
Shit.

290
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,259
好吧 你个聪明的小婊子 
All right, you clever, little bitch, 

291
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,233
你把钥匙藏哪儿了?
where'd you hide that key?

292
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,039
我很难过 宝贝 我们会没事的
I'm sorry, baby. We're gonna be okay.

293
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,086
我们走
Let's go.

293
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,086
海特・威尔默特 医学博士
试管婴儿专家

294
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,066
哦 见鬼
Oh, shit.

295
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,527
哦
Oh.

296
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,071
抱歉
Sorry.

297
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,820
塔拉要跟你见面吗? 
Is Tara expecting you? 

298
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,908
不 我 嗯...
No. I, um...

299
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,327
我只是在做些研究
I was just doing some research.

300
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,623
超音波解剖学与可行性的超声指导
"Sonoanatomy and Feasibility of Ultrasonographic Guidance...

301
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,833
相关术语以及在早产儿的应用
...in Term and Preterm Neonates."

302
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,081
是三部曲
It's a trilogy.

303
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,253
- 嘿 在这儿啊 - 嘿 韦恩
- Hey there. - Hey, Wayne.

304
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,643
- 昂瑟警长 - 呃 不再是了
- Chief Unser. - Uh, not anymore.

305
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,048
当然
Of course.

306
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,175
能够你谈一会儿吗?
Can I talk to you for a second?

307
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,551
- 我? - 好啊
- Me? - Yeah.

308
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,201
关于我的医疗保险
I got some questions about my HMO 

309
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:55,800
以及新的治疗方法我有些问题
and these new treatments.

310
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,474
当然
Sure.

311
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,476
我会告诉塔拉你进来了 
I'll tell Tara you're in here, 

312
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,960
专注于你的新生儿三部曲吧
engrossed in the Neonatas Trilogy.

313
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,291
先生们 这边请
Gentlemen. This way, please.

314
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,968
我们到这儿来到底干什么? 
What the hell we doing out here? 

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,246
部族事务
Tribal matters.

316
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:30,173
而且 让我们有机会私下谈谈需求的增长
Also, it gives us a chance to talk privately about this increase in demand.

317
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,167
有问题吗? 
Is that a problem? 

318
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,761
人手不是问题 而是补偿
Labor, no. Compensation, yes.

319
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,721
我知道你们现在在把我们的弹药卖给墨西哥人
I know you're selling our ammo to the Mexicans now.

320
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,626
我们跟瓦汉瓦的交易是定好的 
Our deal with the Wahewa is set, 

321
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,000
跟我们卖给谁没关系
doesn't matter who we're selling to.

322
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,308
我没那么老土 克雷
I'm not living in a teepee, Clay.

323
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,070
集团对你来说风险很大 
The cartel is a risk for you. 

324
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,982
我知道你肯定拿我们的子弹卖了更高价
I know you gotta be charging more for our bullets.

325
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,194
我只想确保瓦汉瓦得到应得的利益
I just wanna make sure that the Wahewa get their piece.

326
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,240
老天
Jesus Christ.

327
00:17:55,408 --> 00:18:00,081
温图语中有一个词 意思是 哀悼战争
There's a word in the Wintu language, means "mourning war."

328
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:05,040
我们死去的孩子们的家人向神寻求复仇的方式
Families of our dead sons ask the gods to choose their revenge.

329
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,421
他们选择了食人蚁这种缓慢的死法
They chose slow death by flesh-eating ants.

330
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,756
那真的是牛仔和印第安的做法 酋长
That's some real cowboy and Indian shit, chief.

331
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,873
这个一种终结的方式 
It's about closure. 

332
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:19,416
你在他步入到精神领域的过程中起到了作用
You play a part in his passing over into the spirit realm.

333
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,986
我等会儿回来
I'll be right back.

334
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,955
他们要把他留在这儿多久?
How long they gonna leave him out here?

335
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,918
我猜直到野餐结束吧
I guess till the picnic's over.

336
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,288
你准备让查理得到更多分成?
Are you gonna give Charlie his bump?

337
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,230
我是说 我们同样的子弹
I mean, we are charging the Mexicans 

338
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,580
卖给墨西哥人贵了至少一半
50 percent more for the same ammo.

339
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,505
我给查理个鸟 因为就他能知道的
I'm gonna give Charlie dick. Because as far as he knows

340
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:01,091
我们卖个墨西哥人跟卖给其他人一个价钱
we're charging the Mexicans the same as we charge anybody else.

341
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,183
求你了
Please.

342
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,101
帮帮我
Help.

343
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,647
嘿你能听到我们说话?
Hey. Are you listening to us?

344
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,273
不
No.

345
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,068
不不 你一定听到了 是不是?
Well, you heard that, didn't you?

346
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,428
这里的神灵会被你气疯的
You're gonna piss off the gods.

347
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,913
我才懒得鸟他们
I don't give a shit about the gods.

348
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,308
我们的枪被一些小P孩偷了? 
Someone is Stealing our guns is a hiccup? 

349
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,247
你胡说什么?
You shitting me?

350
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,989
他们以为这皮卡里装满了酒 
They thought the truck was full of booze. 

351
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,800
里面还有一箱AR-15s
It had one case of AR-15s.

352
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,552
这些枪已经卖出去了的 混蛋
Those guns are already sold, asshole.

353
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,011
集团要在2天内拿到所有的货
The cartel is expecting all of them in two days.

354
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,007
- 这个我知道! - 你知道个屁
- I get it! - No, what you get...

355
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,601
你只会让一群贫民区的小屁孩玩弄 混蛋
...is jacked by a bunch of ghetto babies, asshole.

356
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,470
好了贾克斯! 先别计较这个!
All right, Jax! Let him go!

357
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,555
冷静点! 看上帝的份上!
Hang on! Save it for church!

358
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,148
让我们一起把枪支找回来
Let's just get the guns back.

359
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,249
他们不会公然在大街上使用那些武器
They're not gonna hit the streets with that.

360
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,826
他们肯定会找个地方想法卖了 
They're gonna try and sell them. 

361
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,486
你他妈闭嘴
Shut up.

362
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,316
在这块地方? 只有一个地方做那总生意
This 'hood? Only one place to do that.

363
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,490
- 法人区的维维卡 - 东西最好在那
- Vivica. French fence. - They better be there.

364
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,331
皮卡在几个小时前被偷了
Truck got jacked a couple hours ago.

365
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,407
我们估计你这应该是他们停留的第一站
We think you may be their first stop.

366
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,772
我看起来是做枪支买卖的? 
Do I look like I buy guns? 

367
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,327
不 但也许你认识那些孩子?
Well, maybe you know the kids.

368
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,370
布鲁斯特 他管他的伙计们叫变态
Brewster. He called his buddy "Frecks."

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,674
我的孩子够多了 没心情去认识更多的
I got enough kids. Don't need to know anyone else's.

370
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,757
听着 如果你们要iPad
Look, if you want iPads, 

371
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,550
还是微波炉或是有机蔬菜
microwaves, or organic vegetables...

372
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,217
我将是你们的幸运女神
...I'm your Nubian goddess.

373
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,429
但枪支 那是肮脏的生意
But guns, that's dirty business.

374
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,731
不在我的经营范围 这附近的所有人都知道
Not my flow. Everybody around here knows that.

375
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,008
路德 范爵斯 送客 
Luther, Vandross. Show them out.

376
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,391
如果它们确实涉足了你的经营范围 
Well, if for some reason they do flow your way, 

377
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:40,864
我们需要弄清楚
we need to know.

378
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,296
你唯一要弄清楚的是
The only thing you need to know is that 

379
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:47,829
我的庄园被你们搞的透不过气
my soil is in desperate need of aeration.

380
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,112
那我们不影响这里了
Wouldn't wanna get between you and your dirt.

381
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,564
非常感谢
I appreciate that.

382
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,673
- 我可不相信她 - 暂时没有别的办法
- I don't believe her, man. - Got no choice.

383
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,345
会打草惊蛇的
Rock that boat, blow back on the whole neighborhood.

384
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,179
我老妈还有姨妈她们都有份
My aunt and mom included.

385
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,140
我靠 是他们!
Shit, that's them!

386
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,187
你守在着 看皮卡车会不会出现 
Yo, stay here in case the truck shows up. 

387
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:09,851
走走走!
Go, go, go!

388
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,902
# 当我还是个孩子时 #
# When I was a boy 

389
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:24,622
# 我就憧憬我长大后的情景 #
I thought about the times I'd be a man #

390
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,085
# 我坐在瓶子里面 #
# I'd sit inside a bottle 

391
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,321
# 幻想着我四处拥挤不堪 #
And pretend that I was in a jam #

392
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,073
# 在这个狭小的空间里 #
# In my lonely room 

393
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:37,170
# 我可以专心幻想着那可爱的甜筒 #
I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone #

394
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,068
# 你可以把我扔掉 因为我是如此渺小 #
# You can throw me if you wanna 'Cause I'm a bone #

395
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:41,250
# 我被丢掉时 #
# And I go 

396
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,552
# 还会发出"噗噗噗"的声音#
"oop-ip-ip, oop-ip-ip," yeah #

397
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,409
# 如果我没有哭泣 #
# If I don't start cryin' 

398
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,191
# 那是因为我根本就没有双眼 #
It's because that I have got no eyes #

399
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
- 小心! - 哦我靠!
- Look out! - Oh, Shit!

400
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,531
# 我的小狗已经被任由摆布 #
# And my dog lies hypnotized #

401
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,867
# 被一种我从未知道的光束 #
# Through a crack of light I was unable #

402
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,077
我们上
Let's go.

403
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,912
# 去寻找我的生活 #
# To find my way #

404
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,464
# 虽然被困其中 但我很快乐 #
# Trapped inside a night, but I'm a day 

405
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:17,234
# 还能"噗噗噗"的响 #
And I go "oop-ip-ip" #

406
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,775
该死 如果条子发现了那些枪 
Shit. Cops find our guns 

407
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:20,928
他们肯定会追踪爽哥姨妈家里
they'll lead them right back to Happy's aunt's house.

408
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,716
嘿让我来对付
Hey, I got this.

409
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,392
靠边停下!
Pull over!

410
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,942
手举到我看的见的地方
Keep your hands where we can see them.

411
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,743
我们追!
Let's go!

412
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,460
呼
Whew.

413
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,928
请出示驾驶执照 谢谢
License and registration, please.

414
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,810
他死了
He's dead.

415
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,104
- 怎么回事? - 不清楚
- What happened? - Not sure.

416
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:22,113
他一直那样 喘了几口气就呜呼了
He came to, gasped a little bit, and just went out.

417
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:24,778
是啊 发生的很快
Yeah. It was quick.

418
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,990
家族会很失望的
Family's gonna be disappointed.

419
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,655
他应该至少再受两天的苦
He should've suffered at least another two days.

420
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:35,413
或许... 那些蚂蚁比你想象的要饿的多
Well, maybe the ants were a little hungrier than you thought.

421
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,165
或许吧
Yes.

422
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,172
就像我们所有人一样
Like all of us.

423
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,544
听着查理 我不知道你听到过什么
Look, uh, Charlie, I don't know what you heard...

424
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,632
或者你是怎么认为的  但...
...or what you think you might know, but, uh...

425
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,487
但我们和集团的生意 
...we got the same deal going with the cartel 

426
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:50,672
一点都不比和俄国佬做的多
as we had with the Russians.

427
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,432
我们不会让你蒙受一个子的损失
We're not making a dime more off your ammo.

428
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,353

我们会尽快把订单完成
We'll push through with the order then.

431
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,916
我们的皮卡还有那些枪在哪? 
Where's that truck and our guns? 

432
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,731
什么皮卡?
What truck?

433
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:51,005
该死的 我可没拿你们那该死的枪
Damn, man. I ain't got your goddamn guns.

你们这些基佬想杀了我们吗?
You cracker-ass bitches trying to kill us?

440
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,399
有这打算 除非你们老老实实说出来
That's the plan, unless you start talking.

441
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,718
我都不知道你在说什么!
I don't know what you're talking about!

442
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,460
哦完了
Oh, shit.

443
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,315
- 不 不要! - 狗娘养的骗子!
- No, no! - Lying bitch!

444
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:50,798
嘿兄弟 你怎么回事? 听我说听我说!
Hey, man, what's wrong with you? Listen, listen, listen!

445

Yo, what are you doing? Yo, man, what are you...?

00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,802
- 放我走吧 老兄! - 听着 听好了
- Let me go, man! - Listen to me. Listen to me.

447
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,476
这个家伙曾经抱了我一下就抱断我三根肋骨
Now, this guy here, he's cracked three of my ribs giving me a hug.

448
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,285
他会把你们的脸给撕碎的 
He's gonna shatter your boy's face. 

449
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:02,947
除非你们老实交代

00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,482
马上过来!
I said now!

534
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:04,113
你看那老妈 伽玛和她比简直就是一淑女
That one there, she makes Gemma look like Donna Reed.

535
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,865
我瞬间对女人一点想法都没了
I'm suddenly feeling a little less dysfunctional.

536
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,021
- 是你 - 抱歉没和你打招呼
- Hi. - Sorry to barge in.

537
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:42,024
- 手头有事在忙? - 没有 
- In the middle of something? - No. Just, um...

538
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,568
刚做好手术 只是些文件 
...finished surgery. Just paperwork.

539
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,946
我刚才来过
I came by earlier.

540
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,362
是的 玛格丽特告诉我了 
Yeah, Margaret mentioned that. 

541
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:51,450
是啊 我知道她会告诉你
Yeah, I'm sure she did.

542
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,867
这个夹在亚伯的填色本里
This fell out of one of Abel's coloring books.

543
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,880
你知不知道他在哪找到的?
You have any idea where he might've found it?

544
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,549
那是什么?
What is it?

545
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,176
一个目录
A note.

546
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,513
关于一些信件的
Talks about some letters.

547
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,787
谁的信件?
Letters to whom?

548
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,227
你是不是藏了我的一些东西?
You hiding something from me?

549
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,772
我为什么要那么做?
Why would I do that?

550
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,693
这个原因你自己很清楚
Same reason you keep answering my questions with questions.

551
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,811
听起来你已经知道原因了
Sounds like you already know the answers.

552
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,364
不
No.

553
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,616
我不知道
I don't.

554
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,662
我知道的是...
What I do know...

555
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,873
那些信是约翰 特勒写的
...is that letters from John Teller...

556
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,305
如果我儿子读到那些信 他将会痛苦不堪
...would be very painful for my son to read.

557
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,544
为什么?
Why?

558
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,220
约翰当时爱上了莫林・阿什比
John was in love with Maureen Ashby.

559
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,976
那次我们去比尔法斯特的时候
When we were in Belfast...

560
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,748
我发现了他们之间有个孩子
...found out she had a kid with him.

561
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,231
于是那些陈年往事被激起千层浪
Stirred up all that old shit.

562
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,986
当时我也已经爱上了克雷
I had already fallen in love with Clay.

563
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,700
所以在托马斯死后
When Thomas died, uh...

564
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,605
我就再也不去忌讳这个
...I didn't care anymore.

565
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,874
我当时甚至都不隐藏点什么
I didn't even try to hide it.

566
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,795
那是个错误 把克雷推到了风口浪尖上
That was a mistake. Put Clay at risk.

567
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,839
对约翰来说 这是多么耻辱的事
It was humiliating for JT.

568
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,735
杰克斯对这些事毫无所知
Jax doesn't know any of that.

569
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:38,682
但如果他知道了 他肯定会和克雷隔阂很大
Him finding out could set things off with Clay again.

570
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,568
约翰当时伤透了我的心
John ripped me apart.

571
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:56,777
他在贝尔法斯特一直待了数月
Spent months at a time in Belfast...

572
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,327
就为了和她在一起
...with her.

573
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,123
丢下了我
Left me here.

574
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,791
一个人在这
Alone.

575
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,621
照顾他的孩子
With his sons.

576
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,840
抱歉
Sorry.

577
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,136
我爱他
I loved him.

578
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,661
像你爱贾克斯那样
Like you and Jax.

579
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,148
我才十九岁
I was 19.

580
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,653
那时他就是我的一切
He was my goddamn world.

581
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,828
这事对任何人都没好处
This ain't good for anybody.

582
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,714
你明白我的意思吗?
You understand me?

583
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,794
任它传播 对我们家庭最终都没好处
Wherever this leads, this is bad for our family.

584
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,907
噢噢 那太疯狂了
Oh, ho. That was crazy.

585
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:22,117
我看到自己拉出了我七岁时吞下的东西
I just saw some stuff in there I ate when I was 7 years old.

586
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,581
现在一身轻松 焕然一新啊
I'm like 100 pounds lighter. I'm a brand-new man.

587
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,751
嘿 你肠道彻底清洗过了
Hey, just got a full cleanse.

588
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:34,166
等等 什么? 好 回聊
Hang on. You know what? Sure, I'll call you back.

589
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,735
如果你们要光顾 我推荐绿茶哦
If you guys are heading in, I recommend the green tea.

590
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,428
双手扶墙 过去
Hands on the wall. Let's go.

591
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,314
有带卡
Got a card for that.

592
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,000
联邦政府才不鸟这个
The federal government doesn't give a shit.

593
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,194
你他妈逗我?
Is this some kind of joke?

594
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,613
你说呢?
Does that feel like a joke?

595
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,406
走
Let's go.

596
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,713
你们两个还好吧?
You boys still love each other?

597
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,051
嗯 没问题
Yeah. Cool.

598
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,595
这才是大团圆结局
It's all about the happy ending.

599
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,639
耶耶耶 走吧 来
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. Come on.

600
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,517
要投票
Got a vote to get to.

601
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,938
好的 来
All right, here you go.

602
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,732
什么回事?
So, what's going on?

603
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,611
嘿 我只是想和你聊会 就这样
Hey, I just wanna have a conversation, that's all.

604
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,120
你跟我律师聊去 
You can do that with my lawyer. 

605
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:39,780
噢 用不着你的律师
Oh, you don't need your lawyer.

606
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,132
我才不鸟你的草药店 伙计
I don't give a shit about the weed, man.

607
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,867
请坐
Please, sit down.

608
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,502
那你抓我干嘛?
So why'd you pick me up?

609
00:36:55,922 --> 00:37:01,110
这是我和我爸在洛科威沙滩钓鱼拍的
This is me and my father fishing at Rockaway Beach.

610
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,845
啊 所以 
Huh? Heh.

611
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,265
- 你是在昆士长大的对吧? - 嗯哼
Now, you grew up in Queens, right? Heh, heh.

612
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,710
没人会在洛科威钓鱼
Nobody fished at Rockaway.

613
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,477
除非你是想去烧瓶子针筒
Not unless you wanted to fry up bottles and syringes.

614
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:14,315
- 你不是昆士长大的 - 你想玩什么?
That ain't Queens. What's the game here, man?

615
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
- 你见过你爸爸吗? - 没
Do you ever see your father? No.

616
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,157
我可以给你安排
I can arrange that.

617
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,626
迈克尔・霍华德・科尔
Michael Howard Cole.

618
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,339
他是你爸
It's your daddy...

619
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,299
胡汉・卡洛斯
...Juan Carlos.

620
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,260
哼?
Huh?

621
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,349
从你的沉默中 我可以知道
By your silence, I'm assuming that...

622
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,808
你已经知道了
...you already knew.

623
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,354
我知道他是谁 我没见过他
I knew who he was. I never met him.

624
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,359
我不知道你能不能在照片上看出来 但是 呃
Now, I don't know if you can tell by this picture, but, um...

625
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,739
他是黑人
...he's black.

626
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,030
纯黑那种
Like, African black.

627
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,365
嗯
Yeah.

628
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,367
我受遗传了
I picked that up.

629
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,285
对
Yeah.

630
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,790
我不知道 你说如果帮派知道了
I don't know, you tell me. What would the club do if they found out that...

631
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,558
你是黑人会怎样?
...you were black?

632
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,337
嗯?你不知道?
Hm? You don't know?

633
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,381
我来给你描述一下
Let me break it down for you.

634
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,051
他们先把你赶出去 然后让你剥掉纹身
Well, first they'll pull your patch, then they make you scrape the ink.

635
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,888
如果运气好 你还能活着出去
Then if you're lucky enough, you'll walk out alive.

636
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,142
但对于萨门克罗来说 就当从来没你这个人了
As far as Samcro is concerned, you never even existed.

637
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,833
这些都是肯定的
So much for affirmative action.

638
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,148
- 你知道我帮派个屁 - 对 没错
You don't know dick about my club. Yeah, you right.

639
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,820
帮派我知道个屁
About dick, nothing.

640
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,604
但是你呢 惨了 啥都知道
But Leroy? Shit, everything.

641
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,412
祝你愉快
Enjoy your day.

642
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,546
那现在怎样?
So, what happens now?

643
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,507
我们都回家去
We go back home to our families.

644
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,885
我会保持联系的 兄弟
I'll stay in touch, brother.

645
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,078
墨西哥酒当午餐?
Mexican for lunch?

646
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,206
是啊 差不多
Yeah, something like that.

647
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,294
什么事?
What's going on?

648
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,424
我倒希望你告诉我呢 他会听你说的
I was hoping you could tell me. He listens to you.

649
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,050
谁?
Who?

650
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,927
克雷?
Clay?

651
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,271
他正带着我们走向深渊
You know, he is getting us involved in some very deep shit.

652
00:39:54,277 --> 00:39:56,268
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

653
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,621
你男人想让我们给集团运毒
Your old man wants us running drugs for the cartel.

654
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,068
帮里全部人都跟着他
And all those other drones at the table...

655
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,822
大家都会消亡殆尽的
...they're gonna follow him right down to that last little crumb.

656
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,250
跟他讲讲道理 伽玛
Talk some sense into him, Gemma.

657
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,605
怎样? 发生什么事了
So? What happened?

658
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:45,541
鸟事 他们头摆摆架势
It's nothing. Method Man just slapping his dick around.

659
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,362
- 真的? - 是啊
Yeah? Yeah.

660
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,617
你们给墨西哥人运毒?
You guys are running coke for the Mexicans?

661
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,286
什么?
What?

662
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,649
谁告诉你的?
Who told you that?

663
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,748
反正不是你
Not you.

664
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,088
你不需要知道
You don't need to know.

665
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,299
我们不该干这个
Drugs are not what we do.

666
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,263
你别跟我说要干什么
You don't tell me what we do.

667
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,737
还好吗?
Everything okay?

668
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,781
恩 我们来把事情解决了吧
Yeah. Let's just get this done.

669
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,834
我知道怎么解决你的问题
I had a cure for your disease

670
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,879
但你不听
But you threw it away

671
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,799
而且你说得很清楚 不让我插手
And you made it clear I was not welcome

672
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,343
嘿
Hey.
