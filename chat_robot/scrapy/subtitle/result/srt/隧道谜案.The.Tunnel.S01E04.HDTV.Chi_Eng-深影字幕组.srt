00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
法律面前并非人人平等
There is no equality before the law.

2
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:04,574
{\an8}前情提要

3
00:00:02,644 --> 00:00:04,424
那是我的第一条真理
That is my first truth.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
- 结束了 夏洛特 - 你是我的全部

5
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:09,121
- 我不能回家 - 如果愿意就留下来
- I cant go home. - Stay here if you want.

6
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:11,482
你说过你的第二条真理已经开始了
You said that your second truth has begun.

7
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,637
让・克劳德・戴尔普兰克 退伍军人
Jean-Claude Delplanque. Retired soldier.

8
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,705
- 老人有什么用 - 离开那里
- What good are old people? - Get out of there.

9
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:19,426
他们只会消耗我们的纳税
They consume nothing, except our taxes.

10
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,117
冬天老人们会怎样
What happens to old people in winter?

11
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:22,287
马上就能看到
Soon we will see

12
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:24,944
那些老英雄们在法国是多么受照顾
how much old heroes are cared for in France.

13
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,221
我们认为他是在某个工业冷库里
We think hes in some kind of industrial cold store

14
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:02,351
而且知道他位于
and we know he has to be

15
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,617
离加莱市中心两小时车程范围之内
within two hours of central Calais.

16
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:07,018
所以 打电话给所有
So, ring round all the companies

17
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,418
提供工业冷库的公司
that supply these cold stores.

18
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,337
获取冷库的平均使用寿命
Get the average life span of them

19
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,077
得到所有在这个时间段
and then get the details of all units

20
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:15,751
和这个范围之内
installed within this time frame

21
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,338
提供冷库的单位的详细信息 好吗
and within this radius. Yeah?

22
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,677
我们知道那时他即将被驱逐...
We know he was about to be evicted...

23
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,118
是因为这个原因
so was it about that,

24
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:32,158
还是因为更私人的原因
or was it something more personal,

25
00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:33,437
关于他过去的一些事...
something in his past...?

26
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,617
我们能联系到一个人 曾与他是一个团的战友
We have a contact to talk to now at his old regiment.

27
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:38,698
我们在等一位少校的答复
We are waiting to hear back from a Major.

28
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:41,678
他和死去的十四个退休人员有什么关系
And how is he connected to our 14 dead pensioners?

29
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,877
还有那四个商人
How to the four businesspeople?

30
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:44,478
我们找到答案也就找到了真理杀手
We find the answers, we find TT.

31
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,478
我们要记住
We must remember,

32
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,319
他为了证明法律不公平
he murdered a prostitute

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,497
而杀了一个妓女
to highlight the inequality of the law.

34
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,257
他声称是自己干的
Well, he said he did.

35
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:59,338
但他是真理杀手
But hes the Truth Terrorist.

36
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:02,718
有趣
Funny.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,800
警方认为人质让・克劳德・戴尔普兰克

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,520
被关在加莱方圆一百六十公里内的一个冷库里

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
还不确定他身在法国还是英国

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,840
但调查正围绕着法国展开

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,961
戴尔普兰克 一个退伍军人

42
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:24,320
正面临被冻死的危险

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,040
意想不到的是 真理杀手在其网站上

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,560
指出四个商界和金融界的名人

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,120
他说他们可以救让・克劳德・戴尔普兰克

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,800
下面是一则喜讯 里尔动物园欢庆

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
刚刚出生的...

48
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:42,077
- 所以要看情况 - 什么
- So it depends. - On?

49
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,177
年龄 体型 性别
Age, body type, sex.

50
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:46,878
我女朋友七月还开着暖气呢
My girlfriend still has the heating on in July.

51
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:49,577
实际上 女人比男人更耐严寒
Actually, women bear extreme cold better than men.

52
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:51,678
因为脂肪 她们脂肪更多
Its the fat - they have more of it.

53
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,937
我们倒回去看 他二十分钟前开始发抖
So we re-wound, he started shivering 20 minutes ago.

54
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:59,518
这就意味着他的体核温度下降了
Which would mean his core temperature has dropped

55
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,257
一到两度 鉴于他年事已高 假设是两度
between one and two degrees - hes old so lets say two.

56
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:04,157
下降两至四度 他会更加剧烈地颤抖
Between two and four hell start shivering more violently,

57
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,918
然后停止颤抖 这样消耗能量
then the shivering stops - its wasted energy -

58
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,818
随即进入低温状态
and the hypothermia sets in.

59
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,917
低于二十五度半他就会死
Below 25.5 he dies.

60
00:03:09,918 --> 00:03:12,777
所以如果我们记下剧烈颤抖开始的时间
So if we mark when the violent shivering starts,

61
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,370
可以大致知道
we can get a rough idea

62
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,278
温度降低的速率
of the rate the temperature is decreasing.

63
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,018
并算出我们还剩下多少时间
And figure out how long we have.

64
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,479
# 到我怀里来 #
Venez dans mes bras

65
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,830
# 靠近我 亲爱的 #
Closer to me, dear

66
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,773
# 让我自己 #
Donnez-vous moi 

67
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,597
# 抛开所有恐惧 #
Set aside all fear

68
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:42,573
# 一根红线 缠绕永远 #
Restons enlaces pour lternit

69
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,062
# 是的 你是我的 #
Yes, you shall be mine 

70
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,440
# 直到地老天荒 #
Till the end of time 

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,040
隧道谜案 第一季第四集

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
{\an8}掏钱吧 金融巨鳄们

73
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:57,568
这真的是我们想说的吗
Is that really what we want to be saying? 

74
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,628
它有什么问题
Whats wrong with it?

75
00:03:58,668 --> 00:03:59,938
你不觉得这上面
Well, dont you think

76
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,208
写的有点简单吗
its a little more complicated than that?

77
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:02,464
...不觉得
Er... no.

78
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:05,024
还有这里 你应该看看竞争者的报道
And here, you should see the competition.

79
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:08,383
我写的和马修・帕里斯有得一拼
Mine is positively Matthew Parris in comparison.

80
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:08,383
{\an8}英国作家

81
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,477
我开始觉得这一切
I guess Im just beginning to find it

82
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:11,263
有一点无聊了
all a little bit dull,

83
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,123
因为我们讨厌看到别人有哪怕一点儿收获
always implying that we hate anyone whos earned a bit.

84
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,843
这或许是因为你已经有了一点收获
That might be because youve earned a bit?

85
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,604
要记住的是 头儿
Its always worth remembering, boss,

86
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,594
我们的读者几乎全靠着
that our readers subsist almost entirely on

87
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,448
垃圾食品和嫉妒心来维持生存
a diet of saturated fat and envy.

88
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,228
- 还有偶尔开开车 - 好吧...
- And the occasional Wagon Wheel. - Fine...

89
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,769
那我们来挑战他们 让他们思考一下...
So lets challenge them, make em think a little bit...

90
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,156
如果他们愿意被挑战
If they wanted to be challenged

91
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,308
这会儿就不会看我们的文章了 不是吗
they really wouldnt be reading us now, would they?

92
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,229
他们只想看到他们自己的观点
What they want is to read their opinions,

93
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:33,989
- 是被打出来的 而不是涂鸦 - 好吧
but typed, not just in crayon. - Fine.

94
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,269
但是别变得无聊 丹尼
But dont get boring, Danny,

95
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,789
你可以恣意挑衅
you can be as gratuitously offensive as you like,

96
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,869
但我这儿可不养笨蛋
but I really dont pay you to be a dullard.

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,680
军队司令部 加莱市

98
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,509
情况更糟了 对吗
Thats worse than before, isnt it?

99
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,588
从他开始发抖 已经过去了两小时二十分钟
Two hours, 20 minutes since he started shivering

100
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,528
体温下降两度
to go down two degrees.

101
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,268
我们还剩...八九个小时
Gives us... eight, maybe nine hours?

102
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,869
是的...天啊
Yeah... Jesus.

103
00:05:13,143 --> 00:05:13,763
怎么了
What?

104
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,102
瓦塞尔曼队长
Capitaine Wassermann.

105
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,703
你好
Bonjour.

00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,362
英国探长卡尔・罗巴克
DCI Karl Roebuck from the UK.

107
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:24,823
你好
How do you do?

108
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,363
要不要来点儿咖啡
Can I get you some coffee?

109
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:31,523
戴尔普兰克于1956年18岁时加入帕拉斯
Delplanque joined the Paras in 1956 aged 18

110
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:35,543
一直在这个团服役
and stayed with the regiment all of his military career.

111
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:37,150
- 作为 - 一名二等兵
- As? - A Soldat de Deuxieme Class.

112
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,071
然后在部队里稳步晋升
Rose steadily through the ranks,

113
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:44,211
以军士长退役于...1997年

114
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,331
有着出色的服役记录

115
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:52,142
新闻里报道过三次

116
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,591
去过乍得 苏伊士 阿尔及利亚

117
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:58,410

00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:01,290

119
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,850
什么时候授予的
When were the medals awarded?

120
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:07,051
十字奖章是表彰他在乍得的表现

121
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:09,471
另一枚是在阿尔及利亚

122
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,470
有说明具体原因吗
Does it say what for, specifically?

123
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:16,190
我们这儿只有基础资料
Well, we only keep very basic files here,

124
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,371
- 剩下的都在仓库里 - 你能找出来吗
- the rest would all be in storage. - Could you find out?

125
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,491
你怎么在这儿
Why are you here?

126
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,471
什么
What?

127
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,631
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

128
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,091
你同意我在这儿过夜的
You said I could sleep over.

129
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,371
你忘了吗
Dont you remember?

130
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,490
当时下着雨
It was raining.

131
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:21,612
你给了我一杯茶
You offered me a cup of tea.

132
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,156
我去做点早餐
Ill make some breakfast.

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,180
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

134
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,940
我要你的泰迪熊
I want your teddy!

135
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,299
- 那我要你的剑 拿过来吧 - 亚当 
- And I want your sword so give it to me. - Adam.

136
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,759
把你的泰迪熊给我
Give me your teddy!

137
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,520
- 别烦我 - 亚当
- Just leave me alone! - Adam!

138
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,959
把你的泰迪熊给我
Give me your teddy.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,140
- 不 - 好吧 哈哈 我自己也有
- No! - Fine! Ha-ha, Ive got mine!

140
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,280
怎么了
What?

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,359
你能照看他们二十分钟吗 拜托了
Can you just watch them for 20 minutes please,

142
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,620
我感觉不舒服
Im not feeling too good.

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,240
你需要一个女佣
You need an au pair.

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,320
不 我只是需要睡半小时
No. I just need half an hour to put my head down.

145
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,220
感激不尽
Id appreciate it.

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,480
好了 闭嘴...
Right, fucktards...

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,420
好吧 有人想喝热可可吗
Right, who wants hot chocolate?

148
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,660
我
Me!

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,760
- 马蒂厄 - 什么事

150
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
看到了吗

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
看到他头部的动作了吗

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
是 我看到了

153
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,880
他以前也这么做过 像是在暗示什么

154
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,880
稍等 我看一下

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,960
看那里

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,640
是我的错觉

157
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,000
还是这东西在震动

158
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,120
- 我能拉开... - 关着吧
- Shall I open the...? - Leave them.

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,700
我们不知道谁在监视着
We dont know whos watching.

160
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,220
吃点早餐吧
Have some breakfast.

161
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,040
有吃的东西吗
Do you have anything to eat?

162
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,920
有谷物或者吐司之类的吗
Any cereal or toast or something?

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,280
武士总在决战的前一天绝食
A samurai always fasts the day before he goes into battle.

164
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,440
我们想把震动转化成某种声音

165
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
能做到吗

166
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,600
声音就是震动 至少一部分是

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,240
想要复制他听到的声音

168
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,120
我们需要知道频率 振幅和波长

169
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,920
好 你能大致猜出是多少吗

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,840
如果时间充裕 我们能提供一些选项

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,200
多长时间

172
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
一到两天

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,320
一到两小时 可以吗

174
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,985
最后一个是舒斯特・里特的首席执行官
And finally the CEO of Schuster Ritter.

175
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,985
{\an8}他们能救他

176
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,994
他们去年都赚了十亿美元
They all made billion dollar profits last year

177
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:28,874
尽管被指控有各类不法行为
despite various accusations of malpractice.

178
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:29,914
是...
Yeah...

179
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,225
所以在鲁伯特的案子中
So they all have some connection - or had,

180
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:32,775
他们都有着些联系 或者有过
in Jouberts case -

181
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:35,654
在关爱老年人这方面的联系
some connection with care for the elderly.

182
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,594
一些负面的联系
Some sort of negative connection.

183
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,815
他们马上就到
Theyve started to arrive.

184
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,075
好 有两个孩子的消息吗
Right. Anything on the kids?

185
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,150
我们正在询问他们的朋友
Were talking to their friends,

186
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:46,374
学校 任何认识他们的人
their schools, anyone who knew them,

187
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,245
到目前为止都没有人知道
so far no-one even knew

188
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:49,435
他们曾计划逃跑...
they were planning to run away...

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
更别说他们的去向了

190
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:00,570
我们知道他让那些孩子干了什么
We know what hes asked them to do,

191
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,296
但问题是...
but the question is...

192
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,035
他究竟想让他们做什么
what does he want them to do?

193
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,834
当我们把这问题解决了 我们就领先一步了
When we work that out, we get ahead of him.

194
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,854
通常来说 你们也知道现在的情况
Traditionally, as you know in this situation,

195
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:13,754
我们想问...
wed be asking you, you know...

196
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,814
有什么人怨恨你们吗
does anyone have a grudge against you?

197
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,555
但由于这可能包括西方世界的一半
But as that might include half of the western world,

198
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,475
我们直接说正题
well cut to the chase.

199
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,050
我们想让你们做的
What we want you to do is

200
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,095
和真理杀手要求的一样
exactly as the Truth Terrorist has requested.

201
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,197
一位警官建议我们
A police officer is suggesting

202
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,774
该尽快交赎金
we effectively pay a ransom?

203
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,654
你的惊讶正是我们这样建议的原因
Your surprise is exactly why were suggesting it.

204
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,435
这是他最不期望你做
Its the last thing he will expect you to do,

205
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,975
也是最不希望我们建议的事
the last thing he would expect us to advise.

206
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,894
这会迫使他改变
It will force him to adapt

207
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:44,155
他不得不回到戴尔普兰克先生身边
he will have to return to Monsieur Delplanque.

208
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,754
或者他也会坚持让他死去
Or maybe hed still let him die.

209
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,475
这是个游戏 有规则 他也必须遵守
This is a game, there are rules, he has to obey them too.

210
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,554
他会身不由己回到戴尔普兰克先生身边
He will have to return to Monsieur Delplanque

211
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,155
去关闭制冷系统
to turn off the refrigeration system.

212
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:56,955
到时如果我们知道了地点... 就能抓住他
And if we know where that is by then... well have him.

213
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,715
鲁伯特的遗孀在哪儿
Wheres Jouberts widow,

214
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,635
她作为其丈夫的受益人
doesnt she need to be involved in this

215
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,375
难道不需要参与到这里吗
as the beneficiary of his interests?

216
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,913
真理杀手在网上说
It said on TTs website

217
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,395
任何决定都由我们共同来做
any decision had to come from us all.

218
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,094
我们正在联系鲁伯特夫人
Were trying to contact Madame Joubert.

219
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,455
那么 我觉得我们应该谈谈
Well, then, I think maybe we need to talk.

220
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,335
就我们自己
On our own.

221
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,434
你认为他们会同意吗
Do you think theyll go for it?

222
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:18,855
如果我是他们的话 我不会同意
I wouldnt, if I were them.

223
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:22,355
怎么了
Whats going on?

224
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:27,654
他们是谁
Who are they?

225
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,255
上面写的什么
What does that say?

226
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,835
"拯救让・克劳德 杀掉有钱人"
"Save Jean-Claude, kill the fat cats."

227
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:35,995
他们怎么知道他们来了
How did they know theyre here?

228
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,294
操
Fuck.

229
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:45,895
我们当然不该付钱
Of course we shouldnt pay.

230
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:48,775
一分都不该给 那个男的明显就是个疯子
Not a fucking cent, the mans obviously a lunatic,

231
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,568
他谋杀了十四个无辜的退休老人
he murdered 14 innocent pensioners,

232
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:51,515
我们还要给他付钱
we pay him,

233
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:52,495
那么每个在欧洲的疯子
wed have every nutcase

234
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,296
都会绑架我们的商业同仁
in Europe kidnapping our business colleagues,

235
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:56,634
家人 还有我们 这个主意太荒谬了
our families, us - the ideas absurd.

236
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:59,264
但是我们真的能帮忙抓住
Except we could actually help catch

237
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:01,415
一个残忍的连环杀手
a brutal serial killer.

238
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:02,764
确实 你们想想 
Exactly. How do you think

239
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,635
如果我们拒绝的话 公众会怎么想
itll play with the public if we say no?

240
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,555
迈克 你在养老院
Did you miss the six months of tabloid headlines

241
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,774
没看这六个月的小报头条吗
on your care homes, Michael?

242
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:11,035
如果你在达赖喇嘛嘴里拉屎
If you shat in the Dalai Llamas mouth,

243
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,935
你的公众形象就再坏不过了
your public image couldnt be any worse.

244
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,335
格鲁伯 你知道什么是格拉斯哥之吻吗
Do you know what a Glasgow kiss is, Gruber?

245
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:20,614
公众会一直恨我们 我们很成功
The public are always going to hate us, we are successful,

246
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:22,214
比他们生活得好
we have nicer lives than them,

247
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,055
我们做什么都不会改变这一点
nothing we ever do will change that.

248
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,000
你好 鲁伯特夫人 我是加莱警察局的塞西尔

249
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
你能尽快回复吗 谢谢

250
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
你来我的公寓做什么

251
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,520
你想要什么

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,320
出去 否则我报警了

253
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,960
你在和我丈夫胡搞吗

254
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,320
他这么跟你说的吗

255
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,520
好了 我们试试三千赫

256
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
猎鹰一号 呼叫指挥部

257
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,200
已到达老港口上方 现正开往布伦市

258
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,520
目前尚无可疑情况 完毕

259
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
八个未接电话

260
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,920
{\an8}无号码

261
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
这些引人注目的名字里有夏洛特・鲁伯特

262
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,400
金融家阿兰・鲁伯特的遗孀 前者三天前自杀

263
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,960
有消息称其中三人现已到达加莱市警局总部

264
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
商讨解决方案

265
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,875
劳拉 已经十一点了
Laura? Its gone 11.

266
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,574
天啊 抱歉 亚当
Oh, God. Sorry, Adam.

267
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:04,775
就... 等我两分钟
Yeah, just... give me two minutes.

268
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:03,195
我还得去取药 省得医生找麻烦
I still pick them up so the doctors dont get cross.

269
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,695
但我已经不需要吃药了
But I dont need them any more.

270
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,135
他说
He said.

271
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,374
医生吗
The doctor?

272
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,795
"没人"
No-one.

273
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,235
医生已经不来了
The doctors dont come any more.

274
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,435
"没人"说我已经好了
No-one said Im better.

275
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,475
"没人"是他的名字
Thats his name.

276
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:20,795
好吧
Right.

277
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:28,935
是治什么的
So what were they for?

278
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,235
我以前只是有点困惑...
I just used to get a bit confused...

279
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,615
... 心烦意乱
... a bit distracted.

280
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:41,754
- 但现在不了 - 现在不了
- But not any more. - Not any more.

281
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:42,601
事实上
In fact,

282
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:44,295
现在我感觉前所未有的好
things feel better than they have in a long time.

283
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,895
你介意我去商店
do you mind if I went to the shops,

284
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,735
买点吃的东西吗
got something proper to eat?

285
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:57,755
我为什么要介意
Why would I mind?

286
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:02,395
来 我给你开门
Here. Ill let you out.

287
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:08,315
拯救戴尔普兰克 拯救戴尔普兰克
Delplanque liberer! Delplanque liberer!

288
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,400
我们已经试了各个频率和音高

289
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,120
没有可辨识出的声音

290
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,920
除了一个 播放

291
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:23,654
是火车
Thats a train.

292
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,895
没错 这是唯一有用的声音
Yes, its the only thing that makes sense.

293
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:28,935
所以我们知道他挨着一条铁路线
So, we know hes next to a train line.

294
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,755
如果我们从视频开始处
If we go back to the beginning of the feed,

295
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,465
记录下他所有的动作
mark all his movements,

296
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,115
就能整理出一个...
we can start compiling some kind of...

297
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,815
时间表 再让人通过这个声音
Timetable? And therell be someone who can identify

298
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:42,394
辨别出具体是哪种火车
the exact sort of train, just from that sound...

299
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:44,635
如果能查出火车的型号和发车时间表
And if we identify the type of train and frequency,

300
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:48,315
把它跟冷库的地点和时间表作比对
compare it to the cold store locations and timetables,

301
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,113
也许会有所发现
we may have something.

302
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,669
戴尔普兰克在1959年被授予奖章
Delplanque was awarded the medal in 1959,

303
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,569
表彰他救了一名
for saving the life of a fellow soldier

304
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,290
被阿尔及利亚战俘袭击的战友
who was being attacked by a prisoner - an Algerian.

305
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,926
战俘的儿子在战后
The prisoners son tried

306
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,450
对我们提起诉讼
to bring a case against us after the war.

307
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,539
艾哈迈德・阿巴斯... 是战俘还是他儿子
Ahmed Abbas... is that the prisoner or the son?

308
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,698
儿子 他现在六十出头
The boy, hes in his early 60s now.

309
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:13,459
是什么诉讼
And what was the case?

310
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,210
听着 所有这些都未被证实
Look, none of this was ever proved.

311
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,579
案件在1967年被驳回了
The case was thrown out in 1967.

312
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,095
是什么诉讼
What was the case?

313
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:27,475
阿巴斯声称戴尔普兰克杀了他父亲
Abbas claimed that Delplanque murdered his father

314
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:29,555
并且试图杀他
and tried to murder him.

315
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:32,275
在1958年2月 他和他父亲
Then, in February 1958, he and his father were abducted

316
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,712
被伞兵团成员绑架
by members of the Parachute Regiment,

317
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,712
{\an8}"红魔鬼"伞兵团 英国特种部队之一

318
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,755
押进一架直升飞机
put into a helicopter

319
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,474
飞到五英里外的海上
and flown five miles out to sea.

320
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,395
戴尔普兰克和他的指挥官
Where Delplanque and his commanding officer

321
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:43,314
威胁要把儿子扔下去
threatened to throw the boy out.

322
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:45,341
他们把他拽到舱口时
As they held him over the edge,

323
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:46,354
父亲挣脱了
his father managed to break free

324
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:47,794
袭击了钳制他儿子的士兵
and attack the soldier holding him

325
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,694
戴尔普兰克把父亲拽开
and Delplanque pulled the father away

326
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,795
扔出了直升机
before throwing him out of the helicopter.

327
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,935
接着他自己也被戴尔普兰克扔了出去
He was then himself thrown out, also by Delplanque.

328
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:13,515
总之 要多少钱才足以表明我们在乎呢
How much is enough anyway, to show we care?

329
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:14,994
今早我给了一个乞丐
I gave a beggar a euro

330
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:17,554
一欧元去买咖啡... 这样够了吗
for a coffee this morning... was that enough?

331
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,774
你给了乞丐一欧元
You gave a beggar a euro?

332
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,834
没夸张... 我在表明立场
Not literally... Im making a point.

333
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:25,234
还是要一百欧 或一百万呢
Or is it 100 euros? Or a million?

334
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,593
听着 今天过后 有个人就会死
Look, end of the day, there is a man dying,

335
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:29,074
我们也许能救他的命
and we could save his life.

336
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,148
说得真冠冕堂皇 麦克博诺
Beautiful cliches, McBono.

337
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,255
好了 别吵了
All right, children.

338
00:22:47,775 --> 00:22:49,374
我以为你不会回来了
I thought you werent coming back.

339
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,915
我买了些东西 还给你带了些绿茶
I did some shopping, got you some more green tea.

340
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,855
有人来过吗
Have you had a visitor?

341
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:07,795
"没人"
No-one.

342
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,114
那么他是... 来帮你的吗
So does he sort of... come in to help you, then?

343
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:14,015
是的
Oh, yes.

344
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:17,395
他让我看事情更清晰
He helps me see things more clearly.

345
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,515
他买给你的
And he bought you that?

346
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:21,074
是的
Yes.

347
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:23,135
礼物吗
A present?

348
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,715
- 我想是的 - 你不打开它吗
- I guess so. - Well, arent you going to open it?

349
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,935
我不能打开
Im not allowed to.

350
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,195
时机未到
Not yet.

351
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,914
好吧
Right.

352
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:33,795
什么特别的日子要到了吗
Special day coming up?

353
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:37,875
非常特别
Very.

354
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,295
我跟他说起了你
I told him all about you.

355
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:46,835
他非常感兴趣
He was very interested.

356
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:09,075
阿巴斯还在阿尔及利亚生活 他和家人
Abbas still lives in Algeria, and his family are about to

357
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:13,214
要上新闻声称戴尔普兰克活该被杀
go on the news to say Delplanque should be allowed to die.

358
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:14,308
不是很明智的做法
Not the smartest idea,

359
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:16,595
如果他们真跟他的绑架案有关联的话
if they had anything to do with his abduction.

360
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,075
看来不太可能
It seems pretty unlikely.

361
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,513
所以这显然是要
So this is obviously intended to

362
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:23,295
耍得所有人团团转
fuck with everyones head,

363
00:24:23,455 --> 00:24:27,155
他设计给我们一个布局巧妙的道德谜题
some kind of exquisite moral conundrum hes set us.

364
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:30,175
会议室那边有消息吗
Any news from the conference room?

365
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:33,235
没有
No.

366
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,779
再等他们十分钟
Lets give them ten minutes,

367
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,795
然后我们就得推他们一把了
then put a rocket up their arse.

368
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:44,415
别担心 我们会抓住他的 相信我
Hey, dont worry, weve got him on the run, trust me.

369
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,255
为什么打我
Why did you hit me?

370
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,875
如果 他按规则出牌
IF he plays by the rules,

371
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:56,575
如果 警察能找到这个人被囚禁的地点
IF the police can find out where this man is being held,

372
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:59,295
如果 真理杀手认为我们捐赠的数目合理
IF the Truth Terrorist deems any donation enough.

373
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:04,595
太多假设因素了 抱歉 我退出
Too many fundamentals missing. Sorry, but Im out.

374
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:08,914
好吧 最终 虽然不情愿 但我确实觉得
Well, in the end, and very reluctantly, I actually think

375
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:12,095
我们再做什么都是不负责任的
it would be irresponsible for us to do anything else.

376
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:17,075
所以纯粹为我的家庭考虑 我也拒绝捐赠
So purely for the sake of my family, I say no too.

377
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,560
你什么都没说 鲁伯特女士

378
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,040
你怎么想

379
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:29,375
我想跟罗巴克探长谈谈
I think I want to speak to DCI Roebuck.

380
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:34,814
报告通过了
So, a report came through.

381
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:36,872
一位妇女发现了一对贫困母子
A woman found a distressed mother and child,

382
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,195
可能是非法移民来的
probably illegals,

383
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:40,094
在离这里十英里的一座小屋
in a cottage about ten miles from here.

384
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:42,034
当然 哪里都没有找到他们
No sign of them anywhere, of course.

385
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:44,094
猜猜谁是屋子的主人
And guess who the owner is?

386
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:46,015
或者你告诉我屋子的主人是谁
Or you tell me who the owner is.

387
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:49,074
是我们的老朋友 斯蒂芬・博蒙特先生
Its our old friend Mr Stephen Beaumont.

388
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:50,597
原来他中了奖
Turns out hes caked

389
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:52,555
他妈妈几年前去世后
and its one of a few places he inherited

390
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,155
屋子是他继承的一部分财产
when his mum died a few years back.

391
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,695
还有一处房产在锡利群岛和诺曼底
Theres also a place on the Scilly Isles and Normandy,

392
00:25:57,715 --> 00:25:59,955
- 地理上讲... - 我知道诺曼底在哪
- which geographically is... - I know where Normandy is.

393
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,935
我刚刚想说 在加莱附近
Near Calais, I was going to say.

394
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:03,135
没那么近
Not that near.

395
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:04,415
挺近的
Near enough.

396
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,855
得看是诺曼底的哪个部分
Depends which part of Normandy.

397
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,595
反追踪 不管怎样 取证由我来负责
Back-tracking. Anyway, I took it upon myself to get

398
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,295
毕竟失踪者里
forensics in, considering the possible mispers

399
00:26:10,296 --> 00:26:11,855
还有一个孩子
including a kid.

400
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,495
血液追踪 头发纤维和动机
So blood traces, hair fibres and spunk

401
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,575
都在进行化验和调查
all under the microscope now.

402
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,875
有新发现要打电话给我
Ring me if we get anything.

403
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,635
话说 诺曼底的大部分地区到加莱的距离
Most of Normandy is further away from Calais

404
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,375
比到伦敦的距离要更远一些
than it is from London, by the way.

405
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,675
非常抱歉你今天必须呆在这里
Im so sorry you had to be here today.

406
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
在过去几分钟 谣言已经出现

407
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,120
由真理杀手指定的几个大亨

408
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,760
没准备好付钱 救出让・克劳德・戴尔普兰克

409
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,040
他们的不情愿可能来源于不确切的报道

410
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,040
报道称戴尔普兰克可能与

411
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
五十年多前的谋杀和谋杀未遂案有关

412
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:01,715
喂
Yeah.

413
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:03,634
英国领退休金的人
UK pensioners

414
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:06,355
大概有一千万人 丹尼
comprise over ten million people, Daniel.

415
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:08,435
百分之二十的人过着贫穷的生活
20% of those live in poverty.

416
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:12,915
在法国 三分之一的自杀者出自领退休金的人
In France, pensioners make up a third of all suicides.

417
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,935
四分之一的人长期遭受虐待
One quarter experience regular abuse.

418
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:17,535
我真该感到幸运
Yeah, I should be so lucky.

419
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,715
这些富人们确实应该做些事情
Surely these very wealthy individuals could do something

420
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:25,054
来帮助他们 然而让・克劳德
to help them. And, Jean-Claude,

421
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:27,284
他拿着所有的钱
with all that money

422
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,235
无视他们的痛苦
they make off the back of their misery.

423
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,814
戴尔普兰克试图杀死一名儿童
Delplanque tried to kill a kid,

424
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,915
他们可以将他运到海中的冰山上
so they can ship him off to sea on an iceberg,

425
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:35,314
我的读者们可能会想
as far as my readers are concerned.

426
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:37,395
或许我们应该问问他 为什么会做出
Well, maybe we should ask why he might have done

427
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,155
如此残忍的事情
such a terrible thing.

428
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,815
他到底经历过怎样的痛苦
What pain he must have suffered himself

429
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:43,634
才会变得这么冷血
to become so unfeeling.

430
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:44,915
抱歉 我有些困惑
Sorry, Im confused.

431
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:46,835
我们仍在谈论戴尔普兰克 对吧
We are still talking about Delplanque, right?

432
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:50,174
最重要的是大家在谈论事情
That were talking at all is really whats important.

433
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:54,194
我们引发一场争论 大家交换意见
That we provoke a debate, that ideas are exchanged.

434
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,915
当然 帮个忙 好吗
Yeah, definitely. Help me out here, right?

435
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,314
帮我更了解你的立场
Help me understand your position a bit better

436
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:01,715
这样我可以向无知的人们解释
so I can explain it to the ignorant masses.

437
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,486
杀死十四个无辜领退休金的人
How exactly does killing 14 innocent pensioners

438
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,495
怎么能帮助他们的事业
help their cause?

439
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:09,215
丹尼 我们是一条绳上的蚂蚱
Were all in this together, Danny.

440
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:10,520
如果想创造一个更好的世界
We all have to make

441
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:13,234
必须要做出牺牲
sacrifices if were to create a better world.

442
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:14,908
但是这很复杂 不是吗
But it is complicated, isnt it?

443
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,434
太棒了... 更好的世界...
Thats great... better world...

444
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,355
期待能看到你的文章
Looking forward to reading you.

445
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:23,155
丹尼 我也是
Yeah, me too, Daniel.

446
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,275
我也是
Me too.

447
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
{\an8}四分之一的老人遭受歧视

448
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,400
{\an8}英国23%的老人遭受年龄歧视

449
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,380
{\an8}7%的房屋中住有年逾85岁的老人

450
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,880
{\an8}无法享受银行服务

451
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,380
{\an8}年龄歧视是英国最常见的歧视形式

452
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:37,880
{\an8}每年大约四万人卖房支付保障金

453
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,380
{\an8}通常每周平均开销为七百欧元

454
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,880
{\an8}法国85岁以上的人口

455
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,380
{\an8}在2010至2020年将翻倍

456
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,880
{\an8}被称为经济负担

457
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,380
{\an8}提高税收 弥补老年护理的支出

458
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,040
我们联系了法国国营铁路公司

459
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,680
但是卢梭队长的儿子星期六在弗雷桑站工作

460
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,000
没有报酬

461
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,560
PBKA高速列车

462
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,560
{\an8}巴黎-布鲁塞尔-科隆-阿姆斯特丹

463
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,280
你需要再听一遍吗

464
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
是PBKA

465
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
二万五千伏的电压 最高时速达三百公里

466
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,600
有两个引擎 提供八千八百千瓦的功率

467
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,040
就是PBKA

468
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,160
当在一万五千伏下操作时

469
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
输出功率会降至三千一百八十千瓦

470
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,480
会减小动力

471
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,280
你可以在火车的轨道上听出来

472
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,680
我们来听下一个吧

473
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
法国高速铁路

474
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
{\an8}巴黎-法国东-德国南

475
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,280
我们只有86间冷藏库在铁路线附近

476
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,336
法国高速铁路和PBKA高速列车

477
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,360
只在这个区域的五个轨道行驶

478
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,360
其中肯定有一条经过冷藏库

479
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,280
那就有三十六种可能

480
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,480
我们要仔细检查时间表

481
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,480
将皮埃尔辨别出的火车

482
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
与让・克劳德听到的时间对比

483
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,840
- 多长时间 - 半个小时

484
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:50,194
也许那是她和别人生的孩子
Maybe it was her child with someone else.

485
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:54,015
不 他像是握新生儿一样握她的手
No. He was holding her as a newborn.

486
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,395
她的眼睛很像他 就是他的孩子
And I could see him in her eyes. It was his.

487
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,235
你知道...
And, you know...

488
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:06,015
...我可以原谅他的虚荣
...I could forgive him his vanity.

489
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:12,115
我可以原谅他无休止的欲望 追求更多的权利
I could forgive his need always for more - more power,

490
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,994
更多的钱 更多的尊重
more money, more respect.

491
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:19,295
甚至原谅他跟那个妓女鬼混 但和她生孩子
And even him fucking that tart, but giving her a child?

492
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:25,075
为了那个机会我已经乞求他二十年
When I had begged him for 20 years for that chance?

493
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:28,895
我永远都不会原谅他
I will never, ever forgive him that.

494
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,595
我想抹除他在我生命里的所有痕迹
And I want to wipe every trace of him from my life.

495
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,475
所有痕迹
Every trace.

496
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,648
这是一笔大数目
This is a very significant amount of money,

497
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:49,694
鲁伯特夫人
Madame Joubert,

498
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:50,975
你能百分之百确定吗
are you absolutely sure?

499
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,235
我确定
I'm sure.

500
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,360
你的丈夫深深地伤害了你 我很抱歉

501
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:02,015
现在她爱上我了
Now she loves me.

502
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:13,235
鲁伯特夫人决定作出捐赠
So Madame Joubert has decided to make a donation.

503
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:18,014
她知道并不是每个人都愿意捐赠
She understands not all of you feel the same way,

504
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:21,235
但是她愿意说这些钱都来自你们每个人
but she is willing to say that it comes from you all.

505
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,575
为了让真理杀手相信并释放戴尔普兰克
For TT to believe this and release Delplanque,

506
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:28,415
显然我们需要你们公开同意
obviously we need you to agree this publicly.

507
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,115
捐多少
How much?

508
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:34,835
大约两千七百万 
27 million, give or take.

509
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:39,135
你为什么要这么做
Why would you do that?

510
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,534
重要的是
Look. The important thing is, notwithstanding

511
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:43,934
尽管你们对于同意他的要求保留意见
your principled reservations about acceding to his demands,

512
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,695
但现在只能赞同
that you just go along with this.

513
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,504
戴尔普兰克只有不到一个小时了
Delplanque has less than an hour.

514
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,234
我们正在接近他
Were closing in on his location.

515
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,324
我们找到他 抓住真理杀手 游戏就结束了
We find him, we get TT. Then the game is over.

516
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,915
到时你想说什么就说什么
Then you can say whatever you want.

517
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,755
我加入 没问题
Im in, no problem.

518
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,234
- 我也是 - 那么 让我们想想
- Me too. - Well, lets think about this,

519
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:03,955
我们都同意这将是不负责任的 对于...
we all agreed it would be irresponsible to...

520
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,694
安德森先生
You know, Mr Anderson,

521
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:06,538
底线是
the bottom line is,

522
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,435
如果你不能同意这些
if youre not able to go along with this,

523
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:09,829
我们可以让这幢楼以外的人都知道
we can let it be known outside

524
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,794
你不愿意合作
this building you were unwilling to co-operate.

525
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:15,955
- ... 我同意 - 谢谢
- Hey... Im in. - Thank you.

526
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:26,194
我的律师正在给慈善基金转账
My lawyers are transferring the money to the charity now.

527
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,074
很好 没时间了 已经告诉记者了 所以
Good, we couldnt wait. Weve told the press already, so...

528
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:32,015
他随时都能知道他的要求是否被满足了
hes gonna know any second now his demands have been met.

529
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,495
你还好吧
Are you all right?

530
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,312
是的 实际上很长一段时间
Yeah, actually I feel much better than I have

531
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:43,615
我没感觉这么好过了
for quite a while.

532
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,875
不管怎样 很高兴再见到你 
Well, its been nice seeing you again, despite the circumstances.

533
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:52,755
再见
Bye.

534
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:00,683
他们已经把范围缩小为一两个位置了
They've narrowed it down to one of two places,

535
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:02,685
一个在桑加特外面
one just outside Sangatte

536
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:04,544
另一个在莱迪的工业园区
and one in an industrial park in Rety.

537
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,298
没有时间了 这两个地方我们都要去
Theres no time. Weve got to cover both.

538
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,663
你去这边 我们去这边
You take that one, well take that one.

539
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:09,873
- 你需要支援 - 是的
- You need back-up. - Yes.

540
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,488
- 支援到之前不要进去 - 好的!
- Do not go in until the back-up arrives. - OK!

541
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,608
- 爱丽丝... - 放心吧
- Elise... - I won't.

542
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,622
- 卡尔... - 知道了!
- Karl... - Yeah!

543
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,000
好的

544
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:23,113
支援十分钟内到
Back-up will be there in ten minutes.

545
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,129
走到头然后右转
Up the end, turn right.

546
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,492
就在那
That's it.

547
00:33:43,612 --> 00:33:46,031
- 喂 查克斯 - 他刚刚下线 起作用了
- Yes, Chuks? - Hes just gone off line. It worked.

548
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:46,972
好的
All right.

549
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:02,512
十分钟可真漫长
Ten minutes is a long time.

550
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:03,452
现在还剩九分钟了
It's only nine now.

551
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:50,172
- 你要干什么 - 就下去看看
- What are you doing? - Just going to take a look.

552
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:24,251
我认为一个警察的主要职责就是
Its my opinion that the primary duty of a police officer

553
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,552
掩护好他的搭档
is to cover his colleague.

554
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,592
对吗?
Right?

555
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,472
- 只是说清楚 我是你的搭档 - 是的
- Just to be clear, I'm your colleague. - Yeah.

556
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,512
好了
Right.

557
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,512
爱丽丝
Elise.

558
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:06,352
没有电
No power.

559
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:10,352
塞西尔...
Cecile...

560
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
我们上

561
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,520
警察

562
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,680
该死

563
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:53,212
该死 爱丽丝 你没事吧 爱丽丝...
Oh fuck! Elise, are you all right? Elise...

564

他是故意打在你那个地方的吗

就像他知道那是你最脆弱的地方
