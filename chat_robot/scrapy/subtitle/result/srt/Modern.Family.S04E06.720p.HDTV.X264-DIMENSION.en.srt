1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,750
<i>****</i>

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,320
Jay,should I get rid of this?

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,460
The hat,the jacket,or the
cane? Actually,yes. Just yes.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,150
We're having a yard sale for our social
studies class to raise money for unicef.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,470
The point is for us to
learn about global altruism.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,100
No,the point is for us to raise
more money than miss cooper's class

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,470
so we get a pizza and a pool party.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,700
Your cynicism makes
me sad for our world.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,800
Ease up,delgado. I've
seen you with a pizza.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,790
I hate garage sales. Bunch of shady
characters going through my stuff.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,430
Why can't I just write a check?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,280
Ay,relax,jay. It's just a
couple of people in the driveway.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah,yeah,yeah. That's where it starts.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,730
Then it's,"it's just a local call. "

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,210
"can I use your bathroom? "
"my mother needs to lie down. "

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,950
No,it just stinks.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,450
He did write a check.

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,680
The less he knows,the better.

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,330
You're not even here anymore.

20
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,070
But it's my stuff. Where's
mom? Luke,take me to mom.

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,290
And move slow. I'm still drunk

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,330
- ing my coffee. Mom!

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,220
what's the problem?

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,370
Uh,tell luke not to sell my stuff?

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,900
honey,come on. Give it up.

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,870
Even john mayer doesn't have
a john mayer poster anymore.

27
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,070
It's signed by him.

28
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,130
It's time you knew
- They come that way.

29
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,020
But it's "to haley. "

30
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,470
in a different color.
Your dad wrote that.

31
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,090
He wrote my "body is a wonderland. "

32
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,900
I didn't catch that till after.

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,240
Mom,is it okay if michael
comes to the yard sale?

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,480
Well,honey,didn't you
see him last night?

35
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,010
So? Why don't you like my boyfriend?

36
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,820
I do like him.

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,210
I'm just 90% sure he's 100% gay.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,550
Yes,when michael took me to
prom, I questioned his sexuality.

39
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,240
But then... We made out.

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,030
A couple times.

41
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,820
There was even a little...
Under-the-shirt action.

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,770
His chest is very smooth.

43
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,210
Heads up! Coming through!

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,450
I am glad you're finally
getting rid of that thing.

45
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,260
What? I'm not selling this bad boy.

46
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,880
I was gonna meet you at your dad's
and get a little exercise on the way.

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,130
What's,uh,what's your
beef with my streetstrider?

48
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,320
Even I think it's nerdy,and
I'm fluent in elvish.

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,200
It's not nerdy. Luke,back me up.

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,020
I hope you mean into the garage,
because I have friends on this street.

51
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,750
Honey,you finally found something less cool
than those pants that zip off into shorts.

52
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,020
My shants,which you have been
gunning for since day one.

53
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,320
Does it matter to any of you that

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,160
this is actually an extremely efficient
cardiovascular workout that could prolong my life?

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,740
Mm,yeah,but what kind
of life? And with whom?

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,510

Remember,everyone,this is for charity.

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,910
Every dollar we earn
helps a diseased child,

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,920
a starving child,an abused child.

62
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,560
Now have fun!

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,050
Speaking of starving
children,here's my contribution.

64
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,450
Six pair of jeans that don't fit me
anymore because I've lost 25 pounds.

65
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,270
That's like... One,two,three
children's bowling balls.

66
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,580
Mm,bravo!

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
C- cam,are-are you really
getting rid of all of these?

68
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,770
I mean,they're almost new. It's...

69
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,510
Well,what if you,um-

70
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,900
What if I what,mitchell?
Put the weight back on?

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,950
No! No.

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,410
No,what if you
- You think of some creative art project that requires denim?

73
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,670
You know,something farm or
kelly clarkson-themed? Or...

74
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,250
I've already down so
much with that motif.

75
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,100
Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,270
You know what? No,sell
'em! I wanna purge,

77
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,160
which,for the record,is
not how I lost this weight.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,990
Oh,every time. Every time he loses
weight, he gets rid of his big pants.

79
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,530
And then when he puts the weight back
on, he has to buy them all new again.

80
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,570
It's-it's a nightmare.

81
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,530
Just put the jeans in the
car while he's in the house.

82
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,040
No,dad! That's incredibly dis-

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm gonna do that. Yeah.

84
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,700
Where you think you're going with those?

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,630
Oh,these aren't for sale.

86
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,270
Hey,this is for charity.

87
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,780
You know you're taking those jeans out
of the hands of some needy,giant children.

88
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,260
You know they're not getting
the actual jeans,right,luke?

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,640
Right. Well,then how about a donation?

90
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,790
- 20 bucks?
- 100.

91
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,470
- $20?
- Sure.

92
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,660
What's it to you if some kid gets
sick bathing in poo river,africa?

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,870
How much for the ashtray?

94
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,390
I don't know. What's the tag say?

95
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,340
50 cents. But there's a chip in it.

96
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,450
Well,that's why it's lying
on a blanket on my lawn,

97
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,660
next to some old corn
on the cob handles.

98
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,770
I'll give you 35.

99
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,740
You're wearing a $10,000 watch.
You're haggling over 15 cents?

100
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,330
You live in this place,and
you can't let that 15 cents go?

101
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,530
Fine. 35.

102
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,760
- Can you break a 50?
- Get out.

103
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,120
Manny.

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
What is this case doing here?

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,300
I found it in the
attic. Why? What is it?

106
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,900
Nothing that concerns
you. It's from colombia.

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,780
But I thought you said
- You thought nothing.

108
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,330
It's going back in the attic,and
I want no more questions.

109
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,750
- why?
- That's a question.

110
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,800
- That was weird.
- Too weird.

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,220
I wonder what's in there.

112
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,240
Wake up,delgado. Locked box,from
colombia,"no more questions"?

113
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,180
It's obviously a human head.

114
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,750
Why is that always your first guess?

115
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,880
One of these days,i'm gonna be right.

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,010
No way! You're selling the harley?

117
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,740
No,I'm just trying to
move it out of the way.

118
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,450
Some asshat offered me 100 bucks for it.

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,230
But with the baby coming,I
guess I am gonna sell it.

120
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,170
Oh,she's a beaut.

121
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,270
What,you wouldn't be
interested in it,would you?

122
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,350
Why wouldn't I be?

123
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,430
Well,I just never thought of
you as a motorcycle kinda guy.

124
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,780
I would be if claire
would ever let me have one.

125
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,620
You can have a motorcycle if you want.

126
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,590
Can I also have an affair
with my super hot receptionist?

127
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,040
What super hot receptionist?

128
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,310
Don't change the subject! Now what
would everybody like for lunch?

129
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,690
You don't have to buy a
motorcycle if you don't want one.

130
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,140
But don't blame it on
me. I'm fine with it.

131
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,270
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

132
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,230
Yeah,look,I know it's not
the safest thing in the world,

133
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,390
but it is sexy.

134
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,600
Yes. I lot more sexy than that
crazy machine you rode up on.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,330
Is that something that
your doctor make you use?

136
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,540
All right,I'm gonna
take this around back,

137
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,160
unless you'd like to
go for a test-drive.

138
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,240
Sure. Let's go. Not too fast.

139
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,160
Precious cargo.

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,860
- I'm not taking you,sweetheart.
- I'm driving?

141
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,910
Awesome!

142
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,850
I'm terrified of motorcycles,

143
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,480
but sometimes you have to do things
to show the world you're still a man.

144
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,860
Same reason I got that henna tattoo.

145
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,930
Japanese symbol for "courage. "

146
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,040
Oh,michael's here!

147
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,880
Hi,michael!

148
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,460
Well,well,well. What is this all about?

149
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,130
Is there a-a new man in alex's life?

150
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,950
Well,she certainly thinks so.

151
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,780
Is there any way that boy is straight?

152
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,390
Ooh,what's going on?
Who are we looking at?

153
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,210
Uh,it's alex's new "boyfriend" michael.

154
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,360
- What's up with the air quotes?
- She thinks he's gay.

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,600
I "think" he's gay the same way
I "think" that lamp is hideous.

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,390
Okay,brought it,made it art class.

157
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,040
Look,I like michael. I really do.

158
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,220
I just-I don't want her
to get her heart broken.

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,280
When it comes to boys, her
self-esteem is low enough as it is.

160
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't know. Alex
seems pretty darn tough.

161
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,020
Oh,she's just sarcastic on the outside.

162
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,470
Inside,she's just a fragile little girl.

163
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,410
By all means,look right
at me when you say that.

164
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,860
If she wants to get her
heart broken by a gay guy,

165
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,510
she can do so when she's 18 or 19
and can drink her way through it.

166
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,110
You're a "good mother. "

167
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,340
I don't know,claire. You could be wrong.

168
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,160
Boys aren't as concerned about
traditional masculinity anymore.

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
You know,they're not butching it up.

170
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,270
They're not pushing down their feelings.

171
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,730
Yeah,they care about their clothes.

172
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,830
They-they-they groom.
Everybody's hairless.

173
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,750
Yeah,you can't tell anything anymore.

174
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,030
Uncle mitch,uncle cam,this is michael.

175
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,650
Hello.

176
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,470
Okay,come on.

177
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,550
- Yep,he's gay.
- We stand corrected.

178
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,470
Okay.

179
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,700
Now be careful. I
don't want you to crash.

180
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,040
I don't want the bike all scratched up.

181
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,270
And don't be nervous. People make
mistakes when they're nervous.

182
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,850
I'm not nervous.

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,180
I've had bigger hogs
than this between my legs.

184
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,880
He really oughta run things
through his head first.

185
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,380
Yeah.

186
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,330
I know I looked super
cool on the outside,

187
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,520
but on the inside,I was terrified.

188
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,920
And then I remembered that fonzie once put
together a whole motorcycle while blind.

189
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,660
And I thought, that was a great show,

190
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,740
and I got really distracted
and-and I forgot I was scared.

191
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,400
So I headed up the canyon
and I left the city behind.

192
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,050
I'd never felt so exhilarated.

193
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,170
I don't know exactly when it happened,
but somewhere on that lonely road...

194
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,230
The bike and I became one.

195
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh,no. No. Oh,you're heavy! No!

196
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,830
Lock the door.

197
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,470
Okay,let's do this.

198
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,080
No matter what we find in here,I
will always love my mother.

199
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,630
- Even if it's a head?
- It's not a head.

200
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,820
Oh,my god! It's a head!

201
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,350
Finally!

202
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,210
Mitchell! I was just in the car,and
I found my fat pants in there.

203
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,360
Do you know anything about that?

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,230
What? No! No.

205
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,590
Did you forget to put 'em out?

206
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,790
No. Remember? I posed,people
clapped. I had my moment.

207
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,340
I do remember that. That
- Oh,that was a great moment.

208
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,710
I am so proud of you.

209
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,520
What's going on? You're being weird.

210
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,700
What? First,i'm a pants thief and-and
now I can't pay you a compliment?

211
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,360
You know who's being weird? you.

212
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,300
Here comes claire! Hey,girl!

213
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,660
I don't know what that was.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,470
Okay,I just saw alex and
michael sittin' in a tree.

215
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,870
Don't make me spell this out for you.

216
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,310
Well,what can you do?

217
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,470
I can't do anything,but
you two could talk to her.

218
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,650
And tell her what?

219
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,780
Michael's playing for the pink team.

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,260
Okay,we get to say
that. You don't really.

221
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,830
I know,because you have credibility,

222
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,970
and I have the opposite of credibility.

223
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,440
I have... I am a mother.

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,790
Okay,we're not doing this.

225
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,330
No. Well,now hold on. Just a minute.

226
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,870
You know,when I was...
Young and straight,

227
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,240
I left a trail of broken
hearts like a rock star.

228
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
- I'm not proud of it.
- Ah,you're kinda proud of it.

229
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
You work it into a lot of conversations.

230
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,700
He brought it up yesterday.

231
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,440
Okay,how am I supposed
to walk into a dry cleaner

232
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
and not mention my girlfriend
wendy jo martinizer?

233
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,450
Can we get back to my problem?

234
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,890
You don't have a
problem,okay? They're kids.

235
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,590
They're gonna work it out.

236
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,830
- Can you talk to her?
- Not when she's like this.

237
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,270
Oh,you mean alex.

238
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,230
- Yeah. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

239
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,370
Claire,kids, if you're seeing
this,then they found my body.

240
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,210
Or I finally got a signal and
I sent it to you in an e-mail.

241
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,130
Although in that case,i'd just call.

242
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,950
But sometimes you can actually get a
pretty decent data signal and no voice.

243
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,300
I know I'm not making any sense.

244
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,020
I've been trapped out
here now for... 27 minutes.

245
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,260
I'm such an idiot.

246
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,380
Why did I bring this stupid motorcycle
out here? To prove I'm a man?

247
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,990
I am a man.

248
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,430
mom.

249
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,620
Manny,what is this doing here?

250
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,230
If you don't mind,we'll be
asking the questions now.

251
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,200
- I do mind.
- I apologize.

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,790
We couldn't help ourselves.
But I've gotta know.

253
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,720
Why were you hiding this?

254
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,210
love this! Sold!

255
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,190
What's the story here?

256
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,050
I don't want to talk about it!

257
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,730
- Cute!
- Oh,where'd that come from?

258
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,900
It's my mom's. She's being very cagey.

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,010
We think something's
stashed in the head.

260
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,750
It's from colombia.

261
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,930
Mom,what's the big deal?

262
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,560
Okay,fine.

263
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,870
When I was young,I was
in a beauty pageant.

264
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,960
All the other girls,for their talent,
were juggling knives,as they always do.

265
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,380
But I wanted to stand out,

266
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,920
so I came up with... Uncle grumpy.

267
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,010
Okay. Never been so happy. Not
leaving till I see it. Hit it,gloria.

268
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,180
- Excuse me,how much is this vase?
- It's yours. Take it.

269
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,120
So what do you need here?
A stool? Glass of water?

270
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,920
How do we make this happen?
Let's go. I need to see this.

271
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,500
You see nothing.

272
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,430
That pageant was one of
the worst nights of my life.

273
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,620
After weeks of rehearsing,

274
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,360
I froze,and we were speechless.

275
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,890
Aw,and you lost.

276
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,910
No. I won. Imagine this when I was 18.

277
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,340
But it was very humiliating.

278
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,140
I don't want to do it ever again.

279
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,440
And yet,you kept him all these years.

280
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,650
Maybe there's a part of you that wants
to work through this, get some closure.

281
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,520
You're wrong,whoever you are.

282
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,030
It's going on 31 minutes.

283
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,780
I feel so alone.

284
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,960
I gotta get my leg free.

285
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,180
Why didn't I wear my shants? !

286
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,150
Hey,guys. Check it out.
You like my new bracelet?

287
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,020
Ooh,cute.

288
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,870
It's an old curtain ring
michael saw over there.

289
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,820
He braided three leather
shoelaces around it and voila.

290
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,800
You know,alex,you and michael remind me so much
of me and my first girlfriend annabelle pickett.

291
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,250
You had a girlfriend?

292
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,180
Yeah. Cutest girl in sunday school,too.

293
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,850
So one year,I asked her to go to the
church bazaar lip sync contest with me,

294
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,180
and we did our version
of "endless love"...

295
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,580
Which was ironic
because two weeks later,

296
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,170
I fell head over heels for a young
square-jawed rodeo ticket taker named woody ray.

297
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,140
- Oh,no.
- Of course,she was devastated,

298
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,150
just destroyed her.

299
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,070
And then she spray-painted something unrepeatable
on my daddy's barn and never spoke to me again.

300
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,990
Wow,and all because she wanted you
to be something you just weren't.

301
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,940
Stop. I get it. I know what
you think about michael,mom.

302
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,770
You didn't have to bring in
your big gay guns to back you up.

303
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
- No offense.
- None taken.

304
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,490
- I kinda like it.
- Okay.

305
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,520
Honey,I am worried about you.
I don't want you to get hurt.

306
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,890
I told them that this
was a bad idea,all right?

307
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,750
You know,maybe michael's
gay. Maybe he's not.

308
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,350
He is.

309
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,090
Your mother just wants you to have all the
information so that-that you can go slow.

310
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,000
Uncle mitchell,he's straight.

311
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
We kissed.

312
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,860
Oh,honey,I... I kissed a lot of
girls when I wanted to be straight.

313
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,110
And your uncle cam
kissed some,too,he says.

314
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,800
But that's neither here nor there.

315
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,020
What's important is that
you make your own-where-

316
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,600
Wait,where are you going?

317
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,840
It's not the olden days anymore,you
guys. I can just ask him.

318
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,130
- Hope you're happy.
- I'm not.

319
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,150
That "olden days" comment
was like a punch to the gut.

320
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,620
She may as well have spray-painted
it on my daddy's barn.

321
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah,I'm done with this.

322
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,490
Where's he going?

323
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,540
Hey,you got any bread? I wanna
make sure this thing still works.

324
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah,that's not gonna happen.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,850
Oh,it doesn't have to be bread.

326
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,960
I mean,I can get the information I need
from,like,a bagel or a frozen waffle.

327
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,750
Look,kid, you're just gonna have
to roll the dice on this one.

328
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't know. What's your return policy?

329
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,610
You return,I call the police.

330
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
- Where'd you get that?
- From the kitchen.

331
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,550
Give me that!

332
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,430
- You selling the pot-bellied
pig? - Get out of my driveway.

333
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,550
You're not a pig. You're
daddy's little girl.

334
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,750
There you are.

335
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,420
Sorry. I got lost in this "elle decor. "

336
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,110
Justin timberlake is
designing his own home line,

337
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,720
and I'm trying to reserve judgment.

338
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,070
Michael I have to ask you something.

339
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,250
I want you to know it's
okay either way, but...

340
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,950
Are you gay?

341
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,800
What? no! I'm not!

342
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,600
I
- I took you to prom. I kissed you.

343
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,060
Unless you're a boy,i'm
pretty sure I'm straight.

344
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
- Are-are you
a boy? - no.

345
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,800
Right. So then I'm straight.

346
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,380
- I didn't mean to make you mad.
- I'm not mad.

347
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm just... Angry.

348
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm sorry. And those are synonyms.

349
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
You just know everything today.

350
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,450
Can you just give me a minute?

351
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,220
Can I help you?

352
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,020
Yeah. Why does everybody think i'm gay?

353
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,750
God,I hate yard sales.

354
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,740
Thank you.

355
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,160
Sorry for snooping around
and finding your old man doll.

356
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,840
In colombia,if you snoop
around the wrong box,

357
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
you might end up inside that box.

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,380
I shouldn't have done it.

359
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,080
Now I feel bad for manny.

360
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,700
What do you mean?

361
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,650
Well,I don't know. He's always
talking about how brave you are,

362
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,590
how you're not afraid of anything.

363
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,800
Now... He just seems a little sad.

364
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,660
How sad?

365
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,540
Don't worry. It's a good thing.
He needs a little dose of reality.

366
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,830
You walk around school telling everyone
how great your mommy is all the time,

367
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,320
you find yourself on the
business end of a wedgie.

368
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,310
I know how to push
buttons to get what I want,

369
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,570
and what I want is to see a puppet show.

370
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,660
J'accuse!

371
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,740
i'm sorry. One more time?

372
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,470
It's just a dramatic
way of accusing you...

373
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,910
Of stashing my fat pants in a bush!

374
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,890
- Saboteur!
- That's a second way.

375
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,750
How... Could... You?

376
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,910
And a third.

377
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,150
Why,mitchell? Why?

378
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,840
Cam... Oh,come on.

379
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,130
All right,the... This is
a little hard to say,but...

380
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,890
Every time you get rid of these pants,
you have to buy them all over again,

381
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,410
and you get depressed,all right?

382
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,880
This is just a way to have a safety net.

383
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,570
I can't have a safety net,mitchell.

384
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,200
Otherwise,I won't be successful
and keep the weight off.

385
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,750
Have you ever thought of that?

386
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,620
No. No,I didn't.

387
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,080
You know,you're not the only one
who remembers all the times I failed.

388
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,740
You're right. I
- I should support you more.

389
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,780
- I'm-i'm sorry. - I'm
happy to hear you say that.

390
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,020
Well,i'm happy you're happy.

391
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,630
Well,I hope you both are happy.

392
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,420
Michael's not gay. Now
he hates me. Thanks a lot.

393
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,370
You see? This is exactly why
I didn't want to get involved.

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,900
Now I feel terrible.

395
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,170
These feelings would go good with pie.

396
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,540
There he is!

397
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,590
Sweetheart,do you love it?

398
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,080
No,claire,I do not love it.

399
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,790
Oh,that's too bad 'cause
you look so cool on that.

400
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,470
Do i,claire? Do I really?

401
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,310
- What happened? - It's a
long story. Check your in-box.

402
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,720
But suffice it to say,i'm
not buying that motorcycle.

403
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,480
I know what I am,claire. I'm
not a rider. I'm a strider.

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,020
I hope that's sexy enough for you.

405
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,880
Well,I can see stuff.

406
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,940
Yeah,I know. I can feel air on it.

407
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,520
It's not like I have
another pair of pants.

408
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,700
Oh,uh,today is your lucky day.

409
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,600
It's for a good cause.

410
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,090
You might need a belt.

411
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,020
Oh,I doubt it. I bet
we wear the same size.

412
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,510
- Don't do that.
- Copy.

413
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,700
Well,we ruined alex's life,by the way.

414
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't know. She looks okay.

415
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,360
Oh,looks like they made up.

416
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,210
If she would just listen to me,I
could her avoid so much pain.

417
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,480
Give it a rest. She's 14,all right?

418
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,860
No matter who that boy
is,he's not gonna last.

419
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,470
Mm,you're right.

420
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,880
Well,at least with a gay kid, you know
she's gonna get a great flower arrangement.

421
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,260
Should've seen the one I made annabelle.

422
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,530
Arranged it myself. It was gorgeous...

423
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,460
Till she pulled it apart and
spelled "homo" on my porch.

424
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,370
This doesn't make me feel any better.

425
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,350
Gather around,everybody.

426
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
I want you to meet somebody.

427
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,800
- Oh,but that might.
- Uncle grumpy.

428
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,640
Luke's wise words got to me.

429
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
I needed my son to respect me again.

430
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,980
More than that,I needed
to respect myself.

431
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,010
Holy maracas!

432
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,270
I think I sat on the right lap!

433
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,190
Uncle grumpy,we're in public.

434
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,420
Ay,look at all those white faces!

435
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,760
I see we made it over the wall.

436
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,930
Uncle grumpy,are you in a bad mood?

437
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,890
Damn right I am!

438
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,910
I just came from the movies.

439
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,500
A whole day's pay to
see "basic instinct.

440
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,140
And what did you think?

441
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,670
Basically,it stinked.

442
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,450
You're so grumpy.

443
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,070
Damn right I am!

444
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,230
I just met the girl of my dreams.

445
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,130
Ay,that's such great news.

446
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,600
no. She gave me the termites.

447
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,840
Gloria,I'm just gonna-

448
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,900
Oh,jeez. I don't even wanna know
what this is. I'm outta here.

449
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,850
- You're leaving?
- Damn right.

450
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,750
The only difference between
this and a home invasion

451
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,180
is I get to shoot people
at a home invasion.

452
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,270
Oh,my god. She married her puppet.

453
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,970
Uncle grumpy!

454
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,100
Can anyone hear me? !

455
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,410
Please help me!

456
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,340
I don't wanna die!

457
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,090
If I had to make a playlist for
being trapped under a motorcycle,

458
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,190
it'd be,um...

459
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,120
"stuck in the middle,"
