1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,881
感谢上帝 你们终于来了
Praise the gods, you've finally arrived

2
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:10,885
你比我想象中的要漂亮得多
and you are far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,303
什么?
Excuse me?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,223
你不是来这里订婚的吧?
You have not come for the arranged marriage?

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:16,349
不是
No.

6
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:19,769
- 那是不是来找心上人呢?
- 不是
- Would you perhaps be seeking a husband?
- No.

7
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,856
那是什么风把你们吹到这里来了
Then what brings you to our town?

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,442
我们听说这里来了几个陌生人
We've heard of strangers who recently arrived

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,445
看起来很强悍 吹嘘杀死了很多幽灵
a rough-looking group, boasting of many Wraith kills?

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,322
我们觉得可能是Sateda人
Yeah, we think they might be Satedan.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,618
噢 你是说那三个整日在酒馆
寻欢作乐的大嘴酒鬼?
Ah, yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards who spend their days carousing at the tavern?

12
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,620
听上去像是我的人
Sounds like my people.

13
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,789
他们在旅店开了几间房
They've taken rooms in the local inn.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,458
- 谢谢
- 不用客气
- Thank you.
- You are most welcome

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,128
你真的没有考虑去找一个心上人么...
and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband...

16
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,591
好吧 分头去找
我去旅店 你去酒馆
All right, I'll check the inn, you check the tavern

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,968
好主意
Sounds good.

18
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,610
你好
Hello?

19
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,531
我在找最近来这里的三个人
I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived.

20
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:17,535
听说他们都很能吃喝
I've heard they are voracious eaters and drinkers, and

21
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:21,706
而且经常吹嘘自己曾打败过幽灵
apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the Wraith.

22
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,457
你要找的那些人...
These people you're looking for...

23
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,880
他们要么是非常勇敢 要么是非常愚蠢
they're either very brave, or very stupid.

24
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,423
怎么说?
How so?

25
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:32,258
好吧
Well,

26
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,510
如果他们吹的牛皮传到幽灵的耳中
if word of their bragging got back to the Wraith

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,429
那对他们来说可就不妙了
it could be very bad for them.

28
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,266
我想他们不怕幽灵知道
I doubt they need to fear a Wraith overhearing their conversation.

29
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,559
当然不怕
Of course not,

30
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:44,729
可幽灵并不需要亲自听到
but the Wraith don't always need their own ears to hear.

31
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,816
你认识我要找的那几个人?
Do you know the people whom I seek?

32
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,151
抱歉
Sorry.

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,736
我从不多管闲事
I mind my own business,

34
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:55,448
也许你应该学着点
which is something you might want to consider.

35
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,576
还是把你的忠告
And you might want to consider offering

36
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:03,831
说给那些真正愿意接受的人听吧
your unsolicited advice to someone who actually cares to receive it,

37
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,295
你这种态度很容易招惹麻烦
An attitude like that could get you hurt,

38
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,755
或者更糟
or worse.

39
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,186
先割哪个?
What's the first to go?

40
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,481
耳朵? 还是那双漂亮的大眼睛?
The ears, or those pretty eyes?

41
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,358
你的脑袋怎么样?
How about your head?

42
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,072
Ronon!
Ronon!

43
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,198
Ara, Rakai!
Ara, Rakai!

44
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,127
听到传言没有?
Hmm, heard the rumor?

45
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:50,962
没有 什么传言?
No, what rumor?

46
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,296
算了 当我没说
Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

47
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,923
等等 到底是什么?
Wait. What is this about?

48
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,425
不行 如果我现在说出来
就有点不负责任了
No, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything.

49
00:02:56,592 --> 00:03:00,054
好吧 如果你非要我说
IOA已经做出决定了
All right, look, if you're going to twist my arm,
the I.O.A. have made their final decision.

50
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,473
他们已经选定Atlantis的新领导了
They've chosen the new leader of Atlantis.

51
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:03,808
是谁?
Well, who is it?

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,768
虽然还没有正式公告
Well, there's been no formal announcement, but

53
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,729
不过传言说那个人非常了解古人的科技
word is, they're going with their foremost expert in ancient technology

54
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,273
以及复制者
and Replicator activity.

55
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,691
你觉得这个人会是谁?
Who does that sound like to you?

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,611
- 你?
- 是啊 还能是谁?
- You?
- Yes. Who else?

57
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,114
我听说他们决定选一个
有科学研究背景的人...
Well, I heard they were leaning toward someone with a science background--

58
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,284
为什么不呢? 是时候让我们中的一员
来执掌真正的权力了
and why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.

59
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,203
噢 噢 你说的"我们" 指的就是"你"吧
Oh, oh, and by "us," you mean "you."

60
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,621
很对
Exactly.

61
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,290
还真有点紧张
It's kind of scary, though.

62
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,584
我将来所作的决定
不仅将会影响到这个城市
You know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city,

63
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,918
还会影响到整个星系
but the entire galaxy.

64
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,044
是啊 紧张
Yes, scary.

65
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,713
- 非常紧张
- 不过换句话说
- Very scary
- On the other hand,

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,590
一名领导者从来不会预测自己的前途
a leader never second-guesses himself.

67
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,216
我要接受挑战
I'm up for the challenge.

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,301
我知道自己是谁
I know I am.

69
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,510
我会让他们自豪的
I'm going to make them proud.

70
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,512
Radek 我会让你感到自豪的
Radek, I'm going to make you proud.

71
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,851
幽灵和复制者正打得不可开交
The Wraith-Replicator war is in full swing.

72
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,479
从目前的情况来看
复制者正在攻击它们的最后一道防线
From what I hear, the Replicators are kicking some serious ass in their last offensive.

73
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,273
真是好消息 John
干得好
That's good news, John. Well done.

74
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,359
- 嗨!
- 我稍候把报告提交给你
- Hey!
- I'll have the reports ready for you.

75
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,277
Sam!
Sam!

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,863
啊... 有什么新消息?
Uh... what's new?

77
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,574
为这里的权力交接做准备
Just making preparations for the change in command here.

78
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,909
不用你说 我已经知道了
You don't have to tell me. I already know.

79
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:03,701
真的?
Really?

80
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:07,830
我要说的是 IOA做了一个
再正确不过的决定
I just want to say that I think the I.O.A. could not have made a better choice.

81
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,248
谢谢 Rodney
Thanks, Rodney.

82
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,375
不不不 你太客气了
No, no, no, no, you are too kind.

83
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,710
什么?
What?

84
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,838
啊... "谢谢 Rodney"
Uh... "thank you, Rodney?"

85
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,423
等等 你是说...
No, no, wait a minute. You mean the...

86
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:21,010
是的 她是我们的新头
Yeah. She's our new boss.

87
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:47,995
星际之门 亚特兰提斯
第4季 第3集


Stargate Atlantis
Season 04 Episode 03

88
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,836
我还以为你们都死了
I thought you guys were dead.

89
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,254
信不信由你 我们也这样想过
Believe me, so did we.

90
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:41,257
在幽灵袭击Sateda的时候
你们是怎么幸存下来的?
How did you manage to survive the Wraith attack on Sateda?

91
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,383
我们不在那里
We weren't there.

92
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,093
我不明白
I don't understand.

93
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,596
我们最开始决定反击幽灵的时候
When we first made the decision to fight back against the Wraith,

94
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,806
没有等他们过来找我们
we didn't just wait for them to come to us.

95
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,559
而是率先对他们的几个据点发起了进攻
We started running ops against some of their known strongholds.

96
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,810
都是一些快战
They were quick strikes.

97
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,312
冲进去 痛宰他们 然后撤退
Get in, hit 'em hard, get out.

98
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,481
只有在那次 我们在撤退的过程中
出了点麻烦
Only on this particular occasion, we kind of messed up the getting out part.

99
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,775
我看到Dart飞船攻击了你们所在的位置
I saw the darts hit your position.

100
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,404
你没有看到的是我们在山中
找到了一个洞窟群落
What you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside.

101
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,655
幽灵攻击的时候
When the Wraith attacked

102
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,616
洞口塌了 我们被困在了里面
the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in.

103
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,076
我们花了三天才挖开
It took us three days to dig our way out.

104
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,120
可那个时候 周围已经到处都是他们
And by then, the place was crawling with them.

105
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,623
很明显他们正在集结 准备下一波进攻
It was obvious they were gearing up for an attack.

106
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,043
我们又花了两周的时间才找到路
赶到星门那里 可那时...
Took another two weeks before we could find our way through the gate, and by then...

107
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,336
已经太迟了
it was too late.

108
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,255
等我们赶回Sateda的时候
已经什么都没有了
When we got back to Sateda, there was nothing left.

109
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,757
对不起
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,634
我不该丢下你们的
I should have never left you behind.

111
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,011
别傻了Ronon
Don't be an idiot, Ronon.

112
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,804
你带领第二小队回到星门那里的时候
When you took second squad back to the gate,

113
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,973
根本就不知道那些Dart飞船会来
you had no way of knowing those darts were going to come through

114
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,099
如果我们跟你回去
And if we'd have gone back with you

115
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,728
那也会跟其他人一样
在幽灵的袭击中死去
then we would have died in the attack on Sateda along with everybody else.

116
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,689
你能够生存下来的原因
The only reason why you survived

117
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,650
是因为他们让你成为一名Runner
was because they made you a runner.

118
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,111
你们已经听说了?
You heard about that?

119
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,364
回来后不久 我们就听到了一些传言
A while back, we started hearing stories.

120
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,951
他们说你有7尺高 力气赶得上5个人
They said you were seven feet tall and had the strength of five men.

121
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,536
人们都喜欢吹
People like to exaggerate.

122
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,080
他们还是你杀了一百个幽灵
They also said you killed a hundred Wraith.

123
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,456
这倒比较接近事实
That part sounds about right.

124
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,002
好吧...
Well, then...

125
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,879
为敌人的悲惨遭遇
to the misery of our enemies

126
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,965
为我们朋友的重聚
and the reunion of friends

127
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,049
为九死一生 干杯
come back from the dead.

128
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,092
好
Oh, yeah.

129
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,433
我离开Chulak的那天
On the day I left Chulak

130
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,352
Bratac跟我说
master Bratac said to me

131
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,396
"丢掉过去"
"draw from your past

132
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,648
"但不要让过去丢下你"
but do not let your past draw from you."

133
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,900
很好的忠告
That's good advice.

134
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,695
不过我还是很怀念这个地方
Still, I know I'm going to miss this place,

135
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,071
还有你们
and all of you.

136
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,575
虽然会引起你的不快 可我不得不说
I would have been offended had you felt otherwise.

137
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,494
十年可不短啊
10 years is a long time.

138
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,330
已经足足过了十年了
It has been 10 years well spent.

139
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,667
我们已经打败了不计其数的敌人
克服了无数险阻
We have defeated numerous enemies and overcome many threats.

140
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,544
一切都记忆犹新
It was never dull.

141
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,588
我们在这里获得了很多
We have accomplished much here,

142
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,507
可现在Atlantis需要你
but now it is Atlantis that is in need of you.

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,301
是啊...
Yeah...

144
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,803
一方面 我非常想去那里...
Part of me is looking forward to going, but...

145
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,264
可另一方面 又觉得这是不是太快了
you know, there's a part of me that thinks maybe it's too soon,

146
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,892
我这里的工作还没有完成
that I'm leaving my work here unfinished.

147
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,727
你的工作会继续完成的
Your work will continue

148
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,854
只是换一个地方而已
only in a different place.

149
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,524
你已经被赋予了无与伦比的荣誉
Carter上校
You have been bestowed an incredible honor, Colonel Carter,

150
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,402
我相信你会接受它的
and I believe you should embrace it.

151
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,946
记住...
And know this...

152
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,449
虽然我们不能跟你一起行动了
though we may not be leaving with you,

153
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,785
可SG-1就在你身边
SG-1 will never be far away.

154
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,706
这么说你们随时可以来做客了?
So I can expect you guys to come and visit sometime?

155
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,751
没有什么困难可以吓倒我
Undomesticated equines could not keep me away.

156
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,798
说得好
Nice call-back.

157
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,219
当然
Indeed

158
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,685
好了
All right.

159
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
该走了
Time to go.

160
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,701
这是什么?
What's that?

161
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,079
跟我们做交易的不同星球出产的水果
It's a selection of fruits from the various worlds we trade with.

162
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,830
我觉得这应该很有意义
I thought it'd be thoughtful.

163
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,040
真没劲
Try lame.

164
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,584
是么? 那你有什么建议?
Really, and what would you suggest?

165
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,044
也许该送些花
You know, maybe some flowers.

166
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,712
这样可以给她的房间增光不少
You could brighten up her quarters.

167
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,422
哦 送花
Oh, flowers.

168
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,801
给 拿着 走吧
Here, take this, and go.

169
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,068
Carter上校
Colonel Carter

170
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,361
欢迎来到Atlantis
welcome to Atlantis.

171
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,112
谢谢
Thank you.

172
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,281
很高兴到这里
It's nice to be here.

173
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:40,037
我想告诉你们 接到这个认命
我感到非常荣幸
I want you all to know how honored I am to accept this appointment.

174
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,207
我会尽全力领导好这支探险队
I've come here fully committed to this expedition,

175
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,211
为了Atlantis 更重要的是
为了你们每一个人
to Atlantis, and most importantly, to each and every one of you.

176
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,755
期望能跟你们一起工作
I look forward to working with all of you.

177
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,841
谢谢
Thank you.

178
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,759
说得好
Nice speech.

179
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,219
谢谢
Thank you.

180
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,972
我还主持过婚礼和颁奖典礼
I also do weddings and award shows.

181
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,683
事先拟好讲稿 才不至于让大家失望
Book early to avoid disappointment.

182
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,894
要不要去看看你的新住处?
Should we go check out your new digs?

183
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,270
好的
Yeah

184
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,813
Rodney...
Rodney...

185
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,606
Sam...
sam...

186
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,622
不痛么 轻点?
Stings, doesn't it?

187
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,083
你们三个这些年是怎么过的?
What the hell have the three of you been doing all these years?

188
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:26,792
噢
Oh

189
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,837
吃饭 喝酒
eating, drinking

190
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,422
杀幽灵
killing Wraith

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
我都记不清杀采取了多少次行动
We've hit 'em more times than I can count.

192
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,052
杀死的幽灵就更不用说了
Racked up a pretty nice body count.

193
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,221
更别提我们还干掉了12艘Dart飞船
Not to mention the 12 darts we've downed.

194
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,682
我们灵活 激动 而且有时
还可以收到很好的情报
we're armed, mobile, and, occasionally, get good intel.

195
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,809
听起来不错
Well, sounds like a pretty nice run.

196
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,354
不过还是有牺牲
But there have been a few sacrifices.

197
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,730
什么意思?
Yeah? What do you mean?

198
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,735
有五个人活着从山洞中走了出来
There were five of us who came out of that cave alive...

199
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,489
可在第一次袭击幽灵的时候
我们失去了Marika
but we lost marika on the first assault against the Wraith

200
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,282
然后去年我们又失去了Hemi
and then hemi last year.

201
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,826
一直都很艰难
It hasn't been easy.

202
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,873
我们的条件有限 可一直在坚持
We don't have much to work with, but we make do.

203
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,251
只是有些时候 只有这些还不够
Sometimes, it's not enough.

204
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,045
好吧 我也许可以帮忙
Yeah, well, I might be able to help.

205
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,047
我这里有人 装备
We've got the manpower, the equipment.

206
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,590
我和我的朋友们可以...
My friends and I, we can...

207
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,431
不管怎样...
anyway, um...

208
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,767
敬Marika和Hemi
to marika and hemi.

209
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,103
敬Marika和Hemi
To marika and hemi.

210
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,729
敬Marika和Hemi
To marika and hemi.

211
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
谢谢
Thank you

212
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,950
嘿 Rodney 进来
Hey, Rodney. Come on in.

213
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,161
我给你带了样可以装饰房间的东西
I brought you a little something to spruce up the place.

214
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,080
谢谢 很温馨
Well, thank you. That's very sweet.

215
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,374
那里有一个花瓶
There's a vase right there.

216
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,675
噢 那是Sheppard中校送来的
Oh, Colonel sheppard dropped that off.

217
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,680
看上去是跟我们有贸易关系的星球
上出产的各种水果
Apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the home worlds of our various trading partners.

218
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,017
我觉得它们很有意义
I thought it was a really thoughtful gesture.

219
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,895
狗娘养...
son of A...

220
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,188
好吧
anyway

221
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,399
我来... 是为了欢迎你来到Atlatnis
look, I just... I just came by to welcome you to Atlantis,

222
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,234
看看你是不是都安排好了
see how you're settling in, and

223
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,946
还有看你是不是需要些什么
另外 我有没有提过跟某人谈过恋爱?
you know, if you needed anything, and did I mention I was seeing someone?

224
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,406
抱歉 什么?
I'm sorry, what?

225
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,116
我 跟某人谈过恋爱
I'm, uh, seeing someone.

226
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,660
我提起这个是因为你来了
Yes, I only bring it up now because you're here

227
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,954
我们会经常在一起工作
now and we'll be working together a lot more, and

228
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,290
我只是想起我们的过去...
you know, I just thought with our past...

229
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,666
我们的过去?
our past?

230
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,046
你知道 以前热恋的那种感觉
萦绕让在脑海中 一直无法忘怀
Well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.

231
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,172
Rodney--
Rodney--

232
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,675
我只是不希望我们之间有什么难堪
I just don't want things to be awkward between the two of us, you know?

233
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,514
比如说现在...
kind of like they are now.

234
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,101
Rodney...
Rodney...

235
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,271
我可以保证 我们会好好相处的
I'm sure we'll be fine.

236
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,565
哦 当然 我是说 我会没事的
Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just...

237
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,943
- 只是跟你在一起...
- 听说现在你是头
- with you...
- I hear you're in charge.

238
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,863
Ronon 这位是Carter上校
Sam 这位是Ronon 他是...
Ronon, this is Colonel Carter. Sam, this is Ronon. He's--

239
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:01,948
Sateda人
Satedan

240
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,950
同时也是你们小队的一员 我知道
and a member of your team. Of course.

241
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,868
有什么事么?
What can I do for you?

242
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,956
我想带一些朋友来Atlantis 当然
先要征求一下你的同意
I want to bring some friends to Atlantis, and, apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.

243
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,416
太不巧了 新的安全条例
Unfortunately, some new security procedures

244
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,837
不允许我在这个时候允许
外星访客来到Atlantis
prevent me from allowing any off-world visits to Atlantis for the time being.

245
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,338
是谁的命令?
On whose authority?

246
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,507
IOA的指示
It was a directive from the I.O.A.

247
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,925
那不告诉他们就行了
Well, they don't need to know.

248
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,510
Ronon 她是...
Ronon, she's--

249
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,472
我相信你很清楚我们现在的处境
I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.

250
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,851
不让基地的位置外泄是非常必要的
It is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.

251
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,977
当然不会
And it will.

252
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,020
他们都是我的人 我可以为他们保证
They're my people. I'll vouch for them.

253
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,647
我知道你可以
I'm sure you can,

254
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,067
可现在 我们处于一个新的星球
就必须遵守新的条例
but for now, we're on a new planet with a new set of rules.

255
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,653
还有这里的新头
And a new person in charge.

256
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,409
Weir绝对不会怀疑我
Weir never would've doubted me.

257
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,495
OK 第一 Ronon
Okay, first of all, Ronon,

258
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,997
我不是在怀疑你
I'm not doubting you.

259
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,542
这个新条例适用于基地中的每个人
These new regulations apply to everyone on this base,

260
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,294
第二...
and secondly...

261
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
我不是Weir博士
I'm not dr. Weir.

262
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,434
他一直是这样么?
Is he always like that?

263
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,436
不...
No, no...

264
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,397
只是今天碰巧被你遇上了
no, actually, you caught him on a good day.

265
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,774
OK
Okay.

266
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,569
握在一起 转!
Try it together, and turn!

267
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,405
坚持住
Work on it.

268
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,489
速度很快啊
well, that was fast.

269
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,408
我说过会很快的
Yeah, I said it would be.

270
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,160
你不用这么赶忙的
You could have taken your time.

271
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,494
我们很喜欢这里
We like it here.

272
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,330
还想再多呆几天呢
We're thinking of staying on a few more days.

273
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,290
然后呢 去哪?
Then where will you go?

274
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,918
谁知道
Wherever

275
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,670
我们现在的好处就是无拘无束
That's one of the nice things about not being tied down.

276
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,672
可以去任何想去的地方
You go where you want,

277
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,008
呆厌了 就可以走
and you leave when you're not wanted.

278
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,845
我本希望我的人可以收留你们
可是...
Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would show a little bit more hospitality, but...

279
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,804
算了
don't worry about it.

280
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,264
我能理解
I understand.

281
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,101
不是所有人都可以去Atlantis
Not everybody gets an invitation to Atlantis.

282
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,481
不要感到奇怪
Don't look so surprised.

283
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,859
你跟我们一样 也在这个星系里
到处游历
You travel as much around this galaxy as we do

284
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,780
迟早你会听到传言 关于那些
住在古人以前城市中的人
and sooner or later, you'll start hearing rumors about new people in the city of the ancients

285
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,907
以及加入他们的那个Runner
and the runner who joined 'em.

286
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,493
抱歉
Man, I'm sorry.

287
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,703
我一开始就该跟你说实话的
I wish I could've been straight with you from the start.

288
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,956
他们信任你
They placed their trust in you,

289
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,749
而你也向他们证明 这种信任是值得的
and you proved them worthy.

290
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,334
这已经很不错了
I wouldn't have expected any less.

291
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
- 是啊 可是...
- 可是什么
- Yeah, but still--
- what

292
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,672
你指望因为是你在请求
他们就可以破一次例么?
you thought they'd make an exception because it was you asking?

293
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,799
- 我应该是他们的朋友才对...
- 不
- I'm supposed to be their friend--
- no.

294
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,134
你只是他们的同盟
You're their ally.

295
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,469
他们的客人
Their guest.

296
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,138
Rakai Ara 还有我 才是你的朋友
Me, rakai, and ara, we're your friends.

297
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,267
我一点也不怀疑 他们都是好人
I don't doubt they're good people.

298
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,852
他们在你需要的时候救你
They helped you out when you needed it

299
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,396
而且据我所知 他们比任何人
杀的幽灵都多
and from what I hear, they've done more to hurt the Wraith than anyone.

300
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,147
这一点你必须承认
You've got to respect that

301
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,067
可这并不意味着你要听从他们的指挥
but it doesn't mean you've got to commit to them.

302
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,487
就我来看
The way I see it,

303
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,031
现在我们又重新聚在一起了...
now that we're back together...

304
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,034
你应该属于我们
you belong with us.

305
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
很壮观 是吧?
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

306
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,212
老实说 有一点压抑
To be honest, it's a little overwhelming.

307
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,632
是不是因为有人向你说了什么
Coming from somebody with your record, that says something.

308
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,053
知道吗 John 你的名字
曾经出现在裁人名单上
You know, john, your name was on the short list.

309
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,055
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

310
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,099
我已经看到了他们对Elizabeth所做的一切
I saw what they did to Elizabeth,

311
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,643
那些政客 还有冠冕堂皇的说辞...
我并不嫉妒她
the politics and the red tape. I didn't envy her.

312
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,687
我也不嫉妒你
I don't envy you.

313
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,439
谢谢
Thanks.

314
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,109
在我们大多数人心中
You know, for most of us,

315
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,279
Elizateth的事情还没有完
this thing with Elizabeth isn't over yet.

316
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,115
她还在世上
She's still out there.

317
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,868
你真的认为她还会活着么?
You really believe there's a chance she's still alive?

318
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,995
只有一种办法可以肯定
There's only one way to know for sure.

319
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,872
你是说我们回去?
You're suggesting we go back?

320
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,666
我们本可以快点的
We should have done it sooner

321
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,127
可IOA总是阻止我
but the I.O.A.'S been stonewalling me.

322
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,047
现在是你说了算 也许你可以
给我开下绿灯
Now that you're in charge, maybe you can give me the green light.

323
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,549
抱歉 这太危险了
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.

324
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,593
可这不会比我们上一次更危险
It's no more dangerous than the last time we went in.

325
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,930
情况已经发生了变化 另外 上一次你们
具有一定的优势 可这次就不会有了
Circumstances were different. Plus, you had an advantage then that you don't have now.

326
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,182
上次的优势正是她给的
Well, she's the one who gave us that advantage.

327
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,351
没有她 我们也不会在这里
The only reason we're here is because of what she did.

328
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,852
相信我 这我都知道
Believe me, I know

329
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,314
而且跟你一样 我也绝对不会丢下
某个人不管
and I don't like the idea of leaving someone behind any more than you do

330
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,943
可我不会派你或者其他人去执行一个
自杀任务
but I'm not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission.

331
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,530
如果你能向我提交一个
有一丝成功希望的方案
Now, you come to me with a plan that has an even an outside chance of succeeding

332
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,031
我会重新考虑的
and I'll consider it.

333
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,450
一句话 John 我很抱歉
Short of that, john, I'm sorry.

334
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,452
我不能帮这个忙
There's nothing I can do.

335
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,580
好吧
Fair enough.

336
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,272
今天你分心了
You seem distracted today.

337
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,107
噢 不 我没事
Oh, no, I'm fine.

338
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,151
- 怎么了?
- 没什么 跟你说了 我没事
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.

339
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,447
好吧 那我们就继续训练吧
Very well. I suppose we should just continue training.

340
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,951
真的没什么
There's nothing!

341
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,288
OK 别打我了
Okay, stop hitting me!

342
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,207
老天啊... 我说
God... I'll talk.

343
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,548
我打算离开Atlantis
I'm thinking of leaving Atlantis.

344
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,845
准备去哪儿?
Where would you go?

345
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:21,100
Atlantis和你的Sateda朋友之间
必须作出一个选择么?
Must it come down to a choice between Atlantis and your Satedan friends?

346
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,187
他们不仅仅是我的朋友 Teyla
他们是我的家人
They're more than my friends, Teyla. They're my family.

347
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,981
我们以前一直在一起的
We've always been there for each other.

348
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,399
你不会理解的
You wouldn't understand.

349
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,151
我不同意
I disagree.

350
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,071
我离开了我的Athosia族人 留在Atlantis
Leaving my fellow athosians for a home here on Atlantis

351
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,574
也是一个非常艰难的决定
was a very difficult decision.

352
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,910
我可是他们的头人
I was their leader.

353
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,077
对某些人来说
For some

354
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,871
是他们所知的唯一领袖
the only leader they'd ever known

355
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:45,291
即使我距离他们很近 穿过星门
就可以看到他们
and despite the fact that I was as close as a trip through the stargate

356
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,754
有些时候 我就感觉自己是背叛了他们
there were moments when I felt I'd betrayed them.

357
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,216
- 然后呢? 你适应了?
- 不
- So what? You got over it?
- No.

358
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,303
有些时候我认真考虑过这个决定
I sometimes still second-guess my decision

359
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,891
觉得我在这里可以为我的人民
以及这个星系中的其他人
then I remember that I can do more here to help my people

360
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,809
提供更多的帮助
and the rest of humans in this galaxy

361
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,687
而在我的母星则做不到
than I ever could on my home world.

362
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,995
Teyla已经跟你谈过了 是吧?
Teyla's already spoken to you, hasn't she?

363
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,622
是啊 我们小谈了一下
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.

364
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,040
说出来听听
So let's hear it.

365
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,291
说什么?
Hear what?

366
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,960
你想说的
Whatever you've got to say.

367
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,586
- 什么也不想说
- 是么?
- Not going to say anything.
- Really?

368
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,382
我没必要说 因为你已经知道了
我要说什么
I don't have to, because you already know what I'm going to tell you.

369
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,050
你是我小队中不可或缺的一员
That you're a valuable member of my team

370
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,928
很难找到其他人接替你的位置
and that it would be difficult to find somebody to take your place.

371
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,473
还有你认为可以回去找回曾经失去的东西
And that you may think you're going back to find something you've lost,

372
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,934
可没有什么能够找回的了
but there's nothing to go back to.

373
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,312
Sateda已经没有了 跟你那伙人一起流浪
也不会让它恢复
Sateda is gone, and living on the run with your buddies isn't going to bring that back.

374
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,939
你真的不愿意说出来?
You're not going to say any of that?

375
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,399
我没必要说
I don't have to.

376
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,693
听着 我这么做并不是想找回过去
Look, this isn't about me trying to bring back the past.

377
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,777
那到底是为什么?
Well, then what is it?

378
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,195
他们需要我
They need me.

379
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,114
一直都是
They always have.

380
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,615
我应该去照料他们
I'm the one that took care of them,

381
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,951
带领他们在战斗中生还
got them home alive whenever we went into battle.

382
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,081
你只有一个人 Ronon
You're one man, Ronon.

383
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,084
不能指望可以永远保护他们
You can't expect to protect them forever.

384
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,295
也许是不行
Probably not...

385
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,714
可你们追求的不也是这个么
but that's where you guys come in.

386
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,426
我们收到一条关于幽灵目标的情报
We got some intel on a Wraith target.

387
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,472
幽灵和复制者正打得不可开交
The Wraith and the Replicators are kind of beating the crap out of each other right now.

388
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,434
我想现在出击是很不明智的
I think it's counter-productive to run an op against them.

389
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,188
你听到情报的详细内容
就会改变主意的
I have a feeling you'll change your mind once you hear the details.

390
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,524
说说看
Let's hear it.

391
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,859
现在不行
Not yet.

392
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,945
我要Tyre Ara和Rakai都加入进来
I want tyre, ara, and rakai in on this.

393
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,534
你们准备袭击幽灵的实验室?
You want to hit a Wraith lab?

394
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,997
恕我冒犯 可现在谈论这个
No offense, but that's awfully close to

395
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,874
是不是有点疯狂
crazy talk territory

396
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,168
那是个武器研究机构
It's a weapons research facility.

397
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,795
据我们所知 那里人员配备
严重不足
From what we've heard, the place is undermanned

398
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,715
我们知道幽灵正在好
几条战线遭受攻击
We know the Wraith are being attacked on several fronts.

399
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,801
他们没有足够的资源来守卫
They don't have the resources anymore to properly guard all their facilities.

400
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,846
不过 她说的是"严重不足"
而不是"没有人"
Still, she did say, "undermanned" rather than "unmanned."

401
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,389
这两者区别很大
There is a big difference.

402
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,391
这不要紧 我们可以对付
It won't matter. We can handle it.

403
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,560
那为什么还需要我们帮忙?
Then why do you need our help to pull it off?

404
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,604
不需要
We don'T.

405
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,149
只需要在我们完事之后
把我们接出来
But we will need your help to get away once we're done.

406
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,108
明白了
I see.

407
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,195
我们成了你们的专职司机了
We're your designated drivers.

408
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,619
这就是我们的目标
This is our target.

409
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,705
距离星门有大半天的步行距离
It's located a good half day's journey from the gate on foot.

410
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,627
如果有飞船接应 就可以
赶到增援到来之前撤离那里
Having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.

411
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,129
别担心 你们只需要开好飞船就行了
Don't worry. All you got to do is fly.

412
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,589
其他事情交给我们来办
We'll do the legwork.

413
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,260
你们可真懂得体谅人啊
可如果我们同意
Well, that's very considerate of you, but if we commit,

414
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,886
就要参加整个行动
we're all in.

415
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,847
我真的不明白为什么要这么干
And I really don't see why we would.

416
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,517
当然 也许可以接触到一些幽灵的新科技
不过...
I mean, sure it would be great to get our hands on some new Wraith tech, but

417
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,895
也许我们可以偶然发现个存贮罐
或者买通ebay 不过...
maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile, or maybe bought some off of ebay, but--

418
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,981
他想要说的意思是
I think what he's trying to say is,

419
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,234
我们值不值得冒着生命危险
进行这次行动
we're not really sure if we want to risk our lives for something like this.

420
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,486
也许等一两个月
Maybe wait a month or two

421
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,698
复制者和幽灵之间打得差不多了
let the Replicators and the Wraith soften each other up

422
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,950
我们可以在午饭的时候再来谈这个
then we do lunch, we talk about it again.

423
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,204
他们在那个实验室所做的研究之一
就是如何关闭复制者的攻击指令
One of the things they're working on right now in the lab is a way to switch off the Replicator attack code.

424
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,877
这有可能么?
Is such a thing even possible?

425
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,628
那段指令以前也被关闭过
The code's been deactivated once before.

426
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,547
也许就是幽灵干的
The Wraith may have done it the first time.

427
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,840
那我们不能让这成为可能
Well, we can't let it happen.

428
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,841
不能
No.

429
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,634
如果和复制者之间的战斗结束了
If the war with the Replicators ends,

430
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:28,139
幽灵又会把注意力集中到
星系的其他星球上
then the Wraith will once again be able to direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy.

431
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
这么说...
So...

432
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,437
你们加入了?
are you in?

433
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,651
你的人看起来很精明能干
Your buddies seem like a perfectly capable enough bunch

434
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,403
可如果让我参加 最不愿意看到的就是
but if I do this, the last thing I need is

435
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,530
有人拖后腿 威胁到这次行动
someone going off half-cocked and risking this op

436
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,574
还有 我们自己的安全
and, well, oh, yeah, our asses.

437
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,451
这已经不是第一次了 John
This isn't their first time doing this, john.

438
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,453
不过这是第一次跟他们合作
May be the first time doing it with company

439
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,955
我不希望他们一上场就吓得尿湿裤子
though, and I don't want it turning into a big pissing match

440
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,916
好吧 那我来带我的人
你带你的人
Yeah, well, I'll keep my group in line. Do the same for yours.

441
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,959
我查过了 他们以前就是你的人
Last time I checked, it was your group, too.

442
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,506
是啊...
Yeah...

443
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,550
听着 我想跟你说的是
look, I was going to wait to tell you this,

444
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,303
我已经作出决定
but I've made my decision.

445
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,305
完成这次任务之后
Once we finish this op

446
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,724
我就要离开Atlantis
I'm going to be leaving Atlantis.

447
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,910
进来吧
Come on in.

448
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,583
收拾东西?
Packing?

449
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,294
是啊
Yeah

450
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:45,258
既然你把这些东西都带到这里来了
说明你已经把Atlantis当成自己的家了
You know, the fact that you brought all this stuff here tells me that you considered Atlantis home

451
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,509
你在这里很快乐
that you were happy here

452
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,261
是啊 曾经是
Yeah, well, I was.

453
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,512
现在也是
I am.

454
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,640
你的朋友们很担心你
Your friends are worried about you.

455
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,893
不需要 我会照顾好我自己的
Well, they shouldn't be. I can take care of myself.

456
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,854
我指的不是这个
That's not the point.

457
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,732
当你接受邀请加入Atlantis时
那已经是我们当中的一员了
When you accepted the offer to join Atlantis, you became a part of something

458
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,402
不管你愿不愿意 你的根已经扎到这里了
and, like it or not, you have roots here now

459
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,196
这里有关注你的人 有依靠你的人
people who care about you, who depend on you

460
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,449
就这么走开 可能比你所想象的要难
Walking away may be a lot harder than you think.

461
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,535
我不是想走开
Oh, I'm not walking away.

462
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,579
不是Sheppard小队中的一员
并不就意味着
Just because I'm not a part of sheppard's team does not mean

463
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,832
我不愿意帮助Atlantis 或者舍身帮助你们
I'm any less willing to help out Atlantis, or put my life on the line for any of you.

464
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,209
我并不是在怀疑你的衷心 Ronon
I'm not questioning your loyalty, Ronon,

465
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:24,755
只是觉得你这样走并不明智 正如你所说
你不想和Atlantis作对
only the wisdom in leaving, if, as you say, you don't want to turn your back on Atlantis.

466
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,426
同时照顾你和你的朋友们
可能不是那么容易
Coordinating our efforts with you and your friends may not be so easy.

467
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,179
那我们就慢慢来 不是么?
We're about to find out, aren't we?

468
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,850
希望你可以重新考虑离开的打算
I need you to reconsider your decision to leave.

469
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,477
如果我不呢
And if I don't,

470
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,105
说出我所知的关于Atlantis的一切
given everything that I know about Atlantis,

471
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,816
你会阻止我么?
you will try and stop me.

472
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,030
希望不要发展到那一步
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

473
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,373
把我们放到南边
Put us down near the south end.

474
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,168
从那里上去遇到的抵抗最小
We'll meet less resistance if we access this place through the back.

475
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,336
知道了
Got it.

476
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,713
进去之后 我们带路
Once we head in, we'll take the lead.

477
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,465
你们断后
You watch our backs.

478
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,008
你知道要去哪里么?
Do you know where you're going?

479
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,637
我们的目标在第二层的某处
Our target is located somewhere on the second level.

480
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,556
也许你可以说得更具体一点?
Uh, maybe you could be a little more specific?

481
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,935
如果你要问的话 那我得说
我们没有那么详细的计划
We don't have an exact floor plan, if that's what you're asking.

482
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,230
整个第二层都是高度保密的
The whole second level is a high-security sector.

483
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,567
如果你们不是很确定的话 让我们跟着
效率不是有点低么?
If you are unsure, would it not be counter-productive for us to follow you?

484
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,818
最好这样
It's better this way.

485
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,196
幽灵的建筑都非常复杂
These Wraith facilities are very confusing.

486
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,989
我们知道要找什么
We know what we're looking for.

487
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,157
我们就不知道?
Oh, and we don't?

488
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,909
这又不是我们的第一次行动
This isn't exactly our first op, you know.

489
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,077
是么?
Really.

490
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:39,121
在面对面的交战中 你干掉过
多少个幽灵?
How many Wraith have you killed in hand-to-hand combat?

491
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,831
我看不出这有什么关系
I hardly think that's what this is about.

492
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,501
- 我就知道你会这么说
- 知道么 我们干掉过整艘的幽灵母舰
- That's what I thought.
- You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay?

493
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,169
跟我们相比 你们都是业余的
Compared to us, you are amateurs.

494
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,796
别紧张
Easy.

495
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,798
如果我们不能很好合作的话
If we can't play nice together,

496
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,132
那就不要合作了
then let's not.

497
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,803
我们短时间内要搜索很大一片区域
We got a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time, so

498
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,263
我们会先跟在你们后面
we will follow your lead.

499
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:59,360
到达第二层后分开行动
Then we'll split up into two teams once we reach the second level.

500
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,459
你们可以接受吗?
Are you cool with that?

501
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:05,779
是的
Yes

502
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,421
好
Good

503
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,940
接近目标
Approaching target location.

504
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:55,205
就是这里
This is it.

505
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:57,474
快点!
Hurry up!

506
00:26:57,923 --> 00:26:59,319
我来
I got it.

507
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,055
都进去
Everybody in.

508
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,931
我们走这边
你们走那边
We'll go this way. You go that way.

509
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,526
如果你们找到什么就联系我们
Contact us if you find anything.

510
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,793
行
Yeah

511
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:37,772
祝好运
Good luck.

512
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,347
Ronon...
Ronon...

513
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,543
我们走
let's go.

514
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,033
你怎么想?
What do you think?

515
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:10,476
他们是试验对象还是幽灵版的
"自动贩卖机"里的货物?
Test subjects? Or the Wraith version of a vending machine.

516
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:13,397
我很不愿意这么说
但是我们不能帮助他们
I hate to be the guy to say it, but we can't really help these people.

517
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:15,133
我们得继续走
We got to keep moving.

518
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,957
对
Right

519
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:25,101
这太安静 太容易了
This thing's been way too quiet and way too easy.

520
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,587
我喜欢这样简单安静的行动
偶尔换换口味也不错
I kind of like quiet and easy. Makes for a nice change.

521
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,740
幽灵!
Wraith!

522
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:41,511
Ronon 等一下!
Ronon, wait!

523
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:07,124
Rodney 把那扇门弄开!
Rodney, get that door open!

524
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,006
该死的门
the hell with it.

525
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,467
拜托 怎么他这样干就可以!
Aw, come on, it worked for him!

526
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,000
哈 我成功了!
Hah! I did it!

527
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,142
哦 谢天谢地 是你们
Oh, thank god, it's you three.

528
00:30:33,143 --> 00:30:34,714
他们抓住了Teyla和Sheppard 而且...
They got Teyla and sheppard, and--

529
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,585
带他来
bring him.

530
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:47,864
现在谁是门外汉?
Who's the amateur now?

531
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:00,380
Ronon 发生了什么?
Ronon, what happened?

532
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,113
我要马上见Carter上校
I need to talk to Colonel Carter right away

533
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:13,624
John 你没事吧?
John, are you all right?

534
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:15,982
还有点后遗症
Bit of a hangover.

535
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,730
Ronon和他的朋友不在这是个好预兆
The fact that Ronon and his buddies aren't here is a good sign.

536
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:23,026
那不一定
Not really.

537
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:27,231
是Ronon的朋友引我们来的
他们设计了我们
Ronon's buddies are the reason we're here. They set us up.

538
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,695
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

539
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:30,771
我撞见他们的时候我正要逃...
I ran into them while I was trying to esc--

540
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:33,533
我正要进行战略性撤退
while I was effecting a strategic retreat.

541
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:34,859
他们把我击昏了
They stunned me.

542
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:36,067
你确定?
Are you sure?

543
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:38,750
这种事要理解很困难
It's pretty hard to misinterpret something like that.

544
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:40,287
Ronon和他们在一起吗?
Was Ronon with them?

545
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:41,965
我没看见他
I didn't see him.

546
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:45,513
那一个
That one.

547
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,818
等一会 伙计们
Hold on, here, guys.

548
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,211
Rodney...
Rodney...

549
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,554
坚持住 Rodney!
stay strong, Rodney!

550
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:57,267
我会试试
I'll try.

551
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,645
我说过我没事
I said, I'm fine.

552
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:06,821
我试过无线电联系Sheppard
但是他们没有一个响应
I tried to radio sheppard, but got no response from him, Teyla, or mckay.

553
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,343
那么那些Sateda人呢?
And what about the Satedans?

554
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:09,627
我们分开了
We got separated.

555
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,551
我想幽灵把他们也抓住了
I'm guessing the Wraith got to them, too.

556
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:14,141
看来这次行动没那么简单
So much for this op being a cake-walk.

557
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,970
那么...
Okay

558
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:17,457
我们由后备支持变成了救援队
we've gone from support to rescue and recovery.

559
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:19,064
Zelenka博士 准备一艘Jumper
Dr. Zelenka, ready a jumper

560
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:19,706
是的 上校
Yes, Colonel.

561
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:21,557
他们知道我们要来
They'll be expecting us.

562
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:23,375
准备两艘吧
Make that two jumpers.

563
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,572
你们能告诉我这是去哪吗?
Would you guys mind telling me where we're going?

564
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,680
老实说 我不是很喜欢惊喜
Seriously, I'm not big on surprises.

565
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:35,492
即使是小的时候 我都得偷偷看看
圣诞礼物因为我受不了那个惊喜
Even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my christmas presents because I couldn't stand the suspense.

566
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,352
- 我记得有一次...
- 我们需要你的说明
- I remember this one time--
- we require your assistance.

567
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:39,184
帮什么?
With what?

568
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:41,973
你修改了复制者的底层代码
You tampered with the Replicator base code.

569
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,765
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

570
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:46,097
好吧 我是做了几个小调整
那又怎么了?
Okay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?

571
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:49,123
这已经不是他们第一次攻击我们了
This is not the first time they have challenged us.

572
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,498
就是说是幽灵解除了那段指令
So it was the Wraith that deactivated the attack code.

573
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,572
几千年以前...
Many thousands of years ago.

574
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:58,123
我们击败了古人
成了这个宇宙的霸主
We had defeated the ancients. The galaxy was ours, and then these...

575
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,645
然后这些"东西"出现了
things appeared.

576
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,733
- 我猜你们的关系不太好...
- 他们是令我们极其厌恶的东西!
- I take it you're not a big fan--
- they are an abomination!

577
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,536
他们甚至都不是生命
They're not even alive.

578
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:06,046
也就是说你们不能以他们为食
所以他们对你们不是什么好东西
In other words, you can't eat them, so they're no good to you.

579
00:33:06,078 --> 00:33:07,415
他们是机器
They are machines.

580
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,257
机器可以被重新程序设计
Machines can be reprogrammed.

581
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,163
好吧 那...
你要我干什么?
Okay, fine, so, what do you want from me?

582
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:16,046
我们尝试过再次上传解除程序
We have attempted to upload the deactivation virus once again.

583
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,679
但是我们失败了
Our attempts have been unsuccessful.

584
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:25,500
我们需要你撤销你做的更改
以使我们的程序再次产生效果
We need you to undo the changes you made so as to render the virus once more effective against them.

585
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:28,172
当然 我理解
Of course. I see.

586
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:30,793
但是 这可能会很困难
Things is, that could be kind of tricky.

587
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:34,615
这个试验对象会让事情简单一点
The test subject will make things easier for you.

588
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,139
试验物件?
Test subject?

589
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,796
一个复制者
A Replicator.

590
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,717
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

591
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:52,113
我已经考虑过了
我想告诉你当时机成熟的时候
I've thought about it, and I want you to know that when the time comes,

592
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,274
我会尊重你对你们的未来
做的一切决定
I'll respect whatever decision you make regarding your future with us.

593
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,571
这应该是我们第一次 也是最后一次
一起行动的机会了
This could be the one and only op we go on together.

594
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:04,700
那么我们最好让这次行动更有意义
Then we'd better make the most of it.

595
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:09,796
Mckay博士...
Dr. Mckay...

596
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:11,846
工作进度如何?
how is your work progressing?

597
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:13,254
有点慢
It's been kind of slow.

598
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:17,720
将底层代码还原到原始的设置
并不是很快就能完成的
I mean, re-establishing the base code's original setting isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.

599
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,703
Sheppard和Teyla听到这个消息
一定会很沮丧
Colonel sheppard and Teyla will be most disappointed to hear this.

600
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,225
我保证
I'll see to it.

601
00:34:23,318 --> 00:34:25,406
我想我可能能快点搞好
I think I might be able to get it finished much sooner.

602
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:31,597
我理解你在拖延 以给你的朋友
准备救援的时间
I understand your desire to delay in the hope that it will give your people time to mount a rescue.

603
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,005
事实上 我刚刚收到消息
他们就在路上
In fact, I've just received word they're on their way,

604
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:38,392
但是我们已经准备好了
but we are ready for them.

605
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,427
好的 他们已经离开了
Okay, they're moving away.

606
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,128
谢谢 二号Jumper
Thank you, jumper two.

607
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,826
我们进去吧 上尉
Take us in, lieutenant.

608
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:14,691
是 上校
Yes, Colonel.

609
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:30,099
快 快!
Let's go, let's go!

610
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:38,856
这堵墙后面有一个能量中继器
There's a power relay behind this wall here.

611
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,339
- 你们都没事吧?
- 时间正好
- You all right?
- Well, it's about time.

612
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,627
要是再迟一点 我们就要自救了
Any longer, we would've had to save ourselves.

613
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:02,700
Ronon有回到Atlantis吗?
Did Ronon manage to make it back to Atlantis?

614
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,269
- 是的
- 他在哪?
- He did.
- Where is he?

615
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,087
我们分开行动了
We split up to cover more ground.

616
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,773
守住门口 我们走
Secure the entrance. Let's go.

617
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,337
快点 我们离开这
All right, come on, let's get out of here.

618
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,812
你把他们关在哪了?
Where are you holding them?

619
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:27,225
为什么不问你的朋友?
Why don't you ask your friends?

620
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,372
安全了
All clear.

621
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,213
安全了? 你差点打到我!
All clear? You could've shot me!

622
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:56,888
哦 不
Oh, no.

623
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,847
哦 不要...
Oh, no...

624
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:28,515
我们去找Ronon
Let's go find Ronon.

625
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,334
你们来处理
Deal with him.

626
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:36,861
你们是幽灵的崇拜者?
You're Wraith-worshipers?

627
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,967
- Ronon 请你理解...
- 他们毁了整个Sateda!
- Ronon, you need to understand that--
- after what they did to Sateda!

628
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,720
Sateda已经没有了
我们所认识的人也一起没有了
Sateda is gone and so are the lives we knew.

629
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,097
我们别无选择
We had a choice

630
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,435
要么同过去一起死去 要么为了未来
而活着
to die with the past, or live for the future.

631
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:52,772
他们给了你们什么?
What did they do to you?

632
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,816
他们给我们的报酬就是来世的生命
They rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.

633
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,737
你也可以得到这种恩赐
只要你愿意
The same gift can be yours, if you're willing to accept it.

634
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,741
开头我们也顽固不化
We resisted at first, we were stubborn,

635
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,536
可是幽灵已经下定决心
but the Wraith were determined.

636
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,251
他们向我们展示自己的未来
They showed us our futures.

637
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:16,128
让我们经历生命的终点
将我们推向边缘
They allowed us to experience  our life's end,  pushing us to the brink

638
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,840
让我们看清真相
so that we could see the truth,

639
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,466
然后将我们拉回来
and brought us back

640
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:29,058
然后又一次 再一次...
They showed us again,  and again, and again...

641
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,560
直到攻破你们的防线
until they broke you.

642
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,312
直到我们最终接受了事实
Until we finally accepted the truth

643
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,314
接受他们的恩赐
and their gift

644
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:37,108
Ronon...
Ronon...

645
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,151
加入我们吧
join us.

646
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:40,945
你们都疯了
You're insane

647
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,364
抛弃那无用的尊荣吧
Don't let your pride get in the way.

648
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,702
不要像Marika和Hemi那样
Like marika and hemi.

649
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,206
他们不是在行动中阵亡的 是不是?
They didn't die on any run, did they?

650
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,667
他们不愿意接受转变所以才被杀害了
They were murdered because they wouldn't turn.

651
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,586
他们被杀完全是因为自己的固执
They were killed by their own stubbornness.

652
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:58,671
不要犯同样的错误
Don't make the same mistake.

653
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,506
- 加入我们!
- 不
- Join us!
- No.

654
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,508
不可能
Never.

655
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,386
滚 你们滚吧
Run. You run.

656
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:09,265
滚得越远越好 因为我们再见面时
就不再是朋友了
Run, and get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.

657
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,475
不会有下一次了
There won't be a next time.

658
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:15,104
我们要用Sateda人的方式
来结束这一切
We'll finish this like true Satedans.

659
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,148
你们不配做Sateda人
You are not Satedans!

660
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,578
Rakai 不!
Rakai, no!

661
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:14,872
这就是你们的尊荣?
So much for honor.

662
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,832
不要用武器
No weapons.

663
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,340
我们的杀戮还少么?
Hasn't there been enough killing?

664
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:10,261
啊?
Huh? 

665
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,913
Ronon 你的朋友们呢?
Ronon, where are your friends?

666
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,916
他们就在这里
They're right here.

667
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,629
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

668
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,279
那是我的画么?
Is that my painting?

669
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,614
是的
Yes.

670
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,242
Rodney觉得应该还给你
Rodney felt that you should have it back.

671
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,118
我又没有送给他
I didn't give it to him.

672
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,580
他是自己拿走的 以为是你不要的
