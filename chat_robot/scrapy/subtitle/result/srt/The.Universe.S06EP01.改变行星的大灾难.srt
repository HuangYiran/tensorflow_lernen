00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,650
史之最初  这里只有黑暗  
In the beginning, there was darkness,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,720
大爆炸后  产生了时间
and then, bang, giving birth to

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
空间  物质
an endless, expanding existence

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,640
成为一种无止境  不断扩张的存在
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,420
这里充斥着惊人而极其难解的秘密
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,850
每天  人类都有新发现
the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,820
揭开这些谜团
of a place we call...

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,130
这便是宇宙
The universe.

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,310
纵贯它45亿年的历史
Throughout its 4.5 billion-year history,

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,250
我们的太阳系目睹了一场大规模屠杀
our Solar System has witnessed carnage on a colossal scale.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,600
时不时地
Time and again,

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,170
大灾难就会粉碎行星的平静
catastrophes have shattered the planetary peace.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,430
在正确位置的巨大撞击
A large impact striking at the right location

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,700
能够使这整个星球完全消失
could have caused the whole planet to go off kilter.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,070
世界将被撞毁
Worlds have collided

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,020
或者变成遍布火山
or been paved over by runaway volcanism...

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,160
甚至会被撞出太阳系的范围
or even ejected from the Sun's grasp.

18
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,040
在太阳系这种恐怖活动的笼罩下
No planet has provided sanctuary

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,170
没有行星能够提供避难所
from the Solar System's reign of terror.

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,570
如果小行星处于高速状态下
If you have an asteroid slam in at high speed,

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,140
小块的水银将会从表面飞离出来
then little bits of Mercury will go flying off the surface,

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,450
有一些水银块不可避免会撞向地球
and inevitably, some of those chunks will hit Earth.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,820
如果你认为地球是一个安全的避难所  
So, if you think Earth is a safe haven,

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,000
那么  再想想吧
think again.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
从最初的剧变  让行星成形
From the oldest cataclysm that rocked the planets,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,470
到最终的大灾难
to the ultimate disaster

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,940
让一切灰飞烟灭
that will one day blow them to oblivion,

28
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,010
系好安全带  我们即将倒数回顾

火山大喷发

以及物种大灭绝
and mass extinctions.

与太阳系其他兄弟姐妹行星
But most Earthly disasters pale in comparison

00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,870
所发生的毁灭性灾难相比
with the apocalyptic traumas

地球遭受的大部分灾难显得微不足道

太阳系诞生于大漩涡之中
The Solar System was born in a maelstrom,

46
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,570
数之不清的巨大石块相互撞击
as billions of rocky boulders collided

47
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,320
形成了我们今日所知的众多行星
to form the planets we know today.

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,570
暴力造就了太阳系
The birth of the Solar System was full of violence.

49
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,420
各种小行星体以及原行星
There were all sorts of planetesimals and protoplanets

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,740
相互撞击
colliding with one another

and ejecting each other,

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,940
而把彼此推向太阳
or sending each other down toward the Sun,

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,020
所以  只有一些行星幸存下来
so, you know, only a few planets survived.

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,300
太阳系之初  非常像
The early Solar System was very much

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,380
一场宇宙弹球比赛
like a cosmic pinball machine

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,660
这场比赛之中充斥着相互作用
where you had lots of impacts

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,380
以及相互撞击
and lots of collisions taking place,

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,120
毁灭行星  形成行星

创造出了我们今日所见到的一切
creating everything that we see today.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,180
但在很久以前  太阳系并不是
But long ago, it would not be the type of place

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,410
适合我们生存的地方
that we'd want to live.

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,510
当幸存下来的行星成型
As the surviving planets took shape,

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,980
这种暴力现象却更厉害了

水星地幔危机
the Mercury Mantle Disaster

72
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,130
水星  是最接近太阳的行星
Mercury, the closest planet to our Sun,

73
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,130
也是太阳系中最小的行星
is also the runt of the Solar System.

74
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,000
科学家们认为这颗弱小的行星
Now scientists think the puniest planet

75
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,550
却承受着宇宙最强大的冲击
was dealt one of nature's mightiest blows.

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,190
对科学家来说  水星一直是个迷
Mercury's a mystery to scientists.

77
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,230
水星的内核是铁
The iron core inside Mercury

78
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,940
大约占到了水星体积的40%
is about 40% of the volume of the planet,

79
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,470
比如说  在地球上
whereas on Earth, for example,

80
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,260
地核仅占到其体积的20%
the core is only about 20% of the Earth's total volume,

81
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,930
哪怕地球比水星大了三倍
even though Earth is about three times larger than Mercury.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,100
在行星领域中  水星是一道难题
Mercury is a bit of a conundrum in planetary science.

83
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,040
水星就像是太阳系中的大钢球

It's almost like a pure piece of steel.

86
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,190
这么小的行星  密度怎么会如此高
How did that little planet get so dense?

87
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,270
有一个理论称
One theory holds

88
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,950
行星之间的碰撞就是罪魁祸首
that a planetary collision was the culprit.

89
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,610
但撞击为何能增加行星的密度呢
But how could an impact make a planet dense?

90
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,400
想象一下  撞上水星的是个大炮弹
By envisioning Mercury's cosmic attacker as a cannonball,

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,420
有助于我们理解当时发生了什么
we can help re-imagine what happened.

92
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,220
我们点燃美国革命中使用过的大炮
Let's fire cannonballs from this American revolution cannon

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,760
攻击40码外裹了石膏的保龄球
at a bowling ball covered with plaster 40 yards away.

94
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,540
现在  就把这个裹了石膏的保龄球
Now, that bowling ball covered with plaster

95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,750
当做最初的水星
represents the early Mercury,

96
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,630
石膏就是当初水星的地幔和地壳
where the plaster is the mantle and crust.

97
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,220
这位是加里·哈珀  是武器专家
Now, Gary Harper, our weapons expert,

98
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,360
他将为我们点燃大炮
is gonna fire this cannon for us.

99
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,740
加里  我们该怎么做
Gary, how do we do this?

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,300
非常简单
Well, fairly simple.

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,420
我们用适量的火药来点火
We use the appropriate powder charge,

102
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,660
把它塞入到炮道中
insert it into the bore,

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
-塞进去  -好
- seat it. - Yeah.

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,360
我们把炮弹也塞进去
We take our cannonball and set that in, start it,

105
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,840
把炮弹塞到火药上
set that on top of the powder.

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,530
弹速会达到多少
How fast is this thing gonna go?

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,440
应该有每秒300英尺
Should be going about 300 feet per second.

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,370
那就大约有每小时20英里了
Wow. That's about 200 miles an hour--

109
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,730
应该有一定程度的破坏力了
Should do some real damage.

110
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,970
亚历克斯  现在戴上听力保护怎么样
Now, how about some hearing protection, Alex?

111
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,190
好的  也戴上我的墨镜  是吧
Right. And my glasses here, right?

112
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,690
-戴上你的墨镜  -没问题
- And your glasses. - Okay.

113
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,710
现在要做的就是最重要的一件事了
Now, all we have left to do is prime it,

114
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,420
-准备点火  -好
- and we're ready to fire. - All right.

115
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,050
-给大炮点火吧  -好
- Let's fire this cannon. - Okay.

116
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,400
-要点火了  -好
- Fire in the hole! - All right.

117
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,140
-打中了  -你看到了吗
- It hit! - Did you see that?

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,350
-你炸掉了  跟我击个掌  -我们做到了
- You blasted it! High five! - We did it.

119
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,100
我们该去看一看
We got to go take a look at that.

120
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
-对  我们一起去看看  -走
- Yeah, let's go take a look. - Okay.

121
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,220
到处都是石膏块
Wow, there's stuff all over the place here.

122
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,380
是啊  石膏层被击落
Oh, yeah, the plaster has been knocked off.

123
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,520
看啊
Look at that.

124
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,120
科学家们
This is exactly

125
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,570
认为水星外层就是这么剥落的
how scientists think Mercury's crust was blown away,

126
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,900
留下了这个铁心行星
leaving the remaining planet an iron core.

127
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,560
这完美地解释了水星密度怎么会如此之高
So this nicely explains how dense Mercury is.

128
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,290
因为大冲撞导致外壳剥落
It has this big iron core 'cause the rest of this stuff

129
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,550
所以就剩下了铁心
was largely stripped away by the collision.

130
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,560
干得真好  大炮一下就击中了保龄球
So. Good job aiming the cannon at this bowling ball.

131
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,990
宇宙空间中的冲撞
The celestial crack-up

132
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,860
使得喷射出来的水星地幔飞向太阳
would've ejected Mercury's mantle into the Sun

133
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,450
也飞向木星
and flung it as far as Jupiter.

134
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,180
这些残片漂浮了长达四百万年
The wreckage rained down for up to four million years.

135
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,110
这些残片散落到了整个太阳系
The debris went throughout the Solar System

136
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,200
有些甚至掉到了各大行星上
and could even have landed on planets.

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,940
事实上  有一些猜测
In fact, there are some estimates

138
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,630
多达16万亿吨的水星地幔物质
that up to 16 million billion tons

139
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,530
掉落到地球表面
of material from Mercury landed on Earth.

140
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,900
但是这种论调的支持者
But proponents of the cosmic hit-and-run theory

141
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,520
面临着一个两难局面
face a forensic dilemma.

142
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,220
如果大冲撞的确发生了
If the collision happened,

143
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,290
水星表面为什么没有留下创伤痕迹
why didn't it leave a visible scar on the surface?

144
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,170
其他关于水星铁心形成的猜想
Other ideas for the formation of Mercury's large core

145
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,560
考虑水星所处位置  那特有的高温环境
involve the local environment of Mercury being so hot,

146
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,400
由于太阳能输出量的变化
due to fluctuations in the solar output,

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
整个行星一直在蒸发
that the entire planet actually vaporized,

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,990
岩石构成的地幔就被汽化了
the rocky mantle actually became rock vapor,

149
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,400
而太阳风又将这些岩石蒸汽吹向宇宙
and the solar wind blew that rock vapor away out into space.

150
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
这又是一种解释
So that's another possible explanation

151
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,240
地核保留了下来  因为是由金属构成的
for why the core survived, because it was made of metal

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,300
外层岩架所经受的汽化现象
and didn't suffer quite the same vaporization

153
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,930
不会发生在金属身上
as the outer rocky shell did.

154
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,090
宇航局的信使号太空船
NASA's Messenger spacecraft is

155
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,000
目前正在绕水星飞行
currently orbiting Mercury,

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,240
希冀解开水星动荡过去之谜
hoping to unlock the mysteries of its turbulent past.

157
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,120
但遭受重创的并不仅仅是
But it wasn't just the innermost planet

158
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,710
这颗最靠近太阳的行星
that took a beating.

159
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,670
今天  土星壮丽的光环
Today Saturn's spectacular rings

160
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,080
安详地绕其旋转着
rotate in calm serenity,

161
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,510
但是它们的美丽
but they owe their beauty

162
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,340
源自于四十亿年前
to a makeover of the most violent kind

163
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,250
一次无比暴力的"化妆"
over four billion years ago.

164
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,470
行星灾难排名第九位
Number nine on our countdown of planetary catastrophes...

165
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,760
被粉碎的土星卫星
Saturn's shattered moon.

166
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,940
虽然土星的光环
Although Saturn's rings

167
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,770
是太阳系中最引人注目的奇观
are one of the most noticeable things  in the Solar System,

168

{\an8}劳拉·丹利
格里菲斯天文台

169
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,290
也是太阳系中的几大谜团之一
they've also been one of the big mysteries of the Solar System.

170
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,080
它们是在多久以前形成的
How long ago did they form?

171
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,540
又是如何形成的
How did they form?

172
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,260
还有最让人疑惑的是
And perhaps most puzzling of all,

173
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,130
为什么土星标志性光环的主要成分是冰
why are Saturn's iconic rings mostly made of ice...

174
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,020
且重量高达33千万亿吨
33 million billion tons of it?

175
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,180
雕刻家罗兰·赫尔南德斯重现了
Sculptor Roland Hernandez has re-created Saturn

176
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,890
土星及它的一颗冰制卫星
and one of its icy moons

177
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,840
来帮我们展现一个新理论
to help us visualize a new theory...

178
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,070
一场卫星灾难
How a lunar catastrophe

179
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,070
如何孕育了土星光环
could've given birth to Saturn's rings.

180
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,770
这里是直径约60厘米的土星模型
We have a beautiful two-foot version of Saturn,

181
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,060
还有冰构成的卫星
and we also have its wonderful moon made out of ice.

182
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,560
真是太美了
It's just beautiful.

183
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,000
不过看上去有些奇怪
It looks a little strange, though,

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
这并不像我们今天熟知的土星
it doesn't look like the Saturn that we know,

185
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
因为它没有光环
because it doesn't have the rings,

186
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,500
但这是我们此行的目的
but that's why we're here,

187
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,660
因为我们想将卫星表面的冰移除
because we want to take ice off the surface of this moon

188
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,180
从而造出围绕土星的光环
and create rings around Saturn.

189
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,540
现在  很多科学家相信
Many scientists now believe

190
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,900
很久以前  一颗冰雪覆盖的卫星
an ancient, ice-covered moon

191
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,480
陷入了土星的引力束缚
fell into Saturn.

192
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,860
土星强大的引力
As it did, Saturn's powerful gravity

193
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,220
将卫星表面的冰层剥去  环绕自己旋转
pulled off the moon's ice, and swept it into orbit.

194
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,180
这台磨砂机充当了土星的潮汐力
This sander acts like the tidal force of Saturn,

195
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,100
剥掉卫星由冰层形成的地幔  形成土星环
pulling the icy mantle of this moon off and in orbit.

196
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,320
卫星本身冲向土星
The moon itself fell into Saturn,

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,570
无迹可寻
leaving no trace behind,

198
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,730
但它留下了今天我们看到的土星环
but it left the glorious rings that we see in Saturn today,

199
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,630
光环大多是由冰组成
which are made mostly of ice.

200
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,070
在土星剩余的60颗卫星当中
Of Saturn's 60 remaining moons,

201
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,360
泰坦星是最大的一颗
Titan is the largest.

202
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,750
它是月球的1.5倍大
It's 1 1/2 times bigger than the Earth's moon.

203
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,260
但最新的模拟模型显示
But new simulations show

204
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,990
土星起初有若干颗
that Saturn could have begun

205
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,050
更大的卫星
with several larger moons

206
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,110
它们都无法挣脱引力  而撞向土星
that were all lost as they helplessly plunged into the planet,

207
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,050
其中最后一颗形成了土星的光环
with the last moon creating the bands of rings.

208
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,390
这个模型第一次解释了
The model really, for the first time,

209
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
光环中冰的由来
explains the ice-rich nature of those rings.

210
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,020
如果单单是一颗卫星爆裂
You know, you'd expect kind of an equal mix

211
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,310
那么环中岩石和冰
of rock and ice and stuff

212
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,050
将会是一样多的
if they were just a battered, broken-apart moon,

213
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,210
但根据这种理论  卫星在公转中
but this whole idea that you had a moon spiral in

214
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,170
由冰层组成的地幔被剥离
and had its outer, icy mantle stripped off

215
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,260
而剩余的核心继续向土星靠近
as the rest of the core continues inward

216
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,150
最终形成冰制的光环
to make the rings out of the icy mantle...

217
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,050
土星环的起源说明
The origin of Saturn's rings illustrates

218
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,480
即便是最美丽的事物
that even its most beautiful features

219
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,120
也是从暴力中产生的
were born in violence.

220
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,490
上述两次灾难
But while the disasters

221
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,720
都仅对土星和水星带来影响
that shaped Saturn and Mercury were localized,

222
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,170
另一场惊天灾难将整个太阳系搞得七零八乱
one catastrophe ripped the entire Solar System apart.

223
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,200
不仅影响了今天我们看到的所有行星
It not only affected every planet we see today

224
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,160
还将很多行星抛出了太阳的引力圈之外
it even hurled planets right out of the Sun's grasp

225
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,370
进入了黑暗的
and into the dark exile

226
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,630
星际空间
of interstellar space.

227
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,310
巨大的宇宙灾难
Cosmic catastrophes,

228
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,710
如前所示  能破坏水星地幔
like the early disasters that destroyed Mercury's mantle

229
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,510
形成土星光环
and formed Saturn's rings,

230
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,950
也能塑造太阳系的方方面面
have shaped almost every aspect of the Solar System.

231
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,740
但现在  随着时间流逝
But now, as we move forward in time,

232
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,520
灾难甚至决定了
disasters even determined

233
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,130
行星的排列顺序
the order in which the planets line up.

234
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,900
今天  远离太阳
Today, traveling out from the Sun,

235
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,230
外部气态巨星的排列顺序是
the order of the outer gas giants

236
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,830
木星  土星  天王星和海王星
is Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,760
但曾经  情况大不相同
but once, things were very different.

238
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,790
在太阳系历史早期
Early in the history of the Solar System,

239
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,120
土星和木星围绕太阳公转的
Jupiter and Saturn kind of wandered around

240
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,110
轨道半径不太稳定
at different distances from the Sun,

241
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,970
因为它们不断地
and that's because they were continually interacting

与剩余的小行星体相互作用
with the leftover planetesimals in the Solar System.

244
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,930
进而影响到它们的轨道
That affected their orbits.

245
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,330
木星土星公转轨道的波动
As the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn fluctuated,

246
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,940
引发了一些列的连锁反应
they set off a cosmic chain reaction

247
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,500
使太阳系大乱
that tore the Solar System apart.

248
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,120
终极行星灾难
Number eight in our countdown

249
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,090
排行榜第八位
to the ultimate planetary catastrophe...

轨道漩涡
The Orbital Maelstrom.

251
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,570
在木星形成的五百万年后
500 million years after the planets formed,

252
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,950
它距离太阳越来越近
Jupiter elbowed inwards toward the Sun,

253
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,590
而土星  天王星和海王星则渐渐远离
while Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune drifted outwards.

254
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,640
最终  木星的公转周期
Jupiter eventually orbited around the Sun

255
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,700
正好是土星公转周期的一半
exactly twice for every one time that Saturn did.

256
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,250
这一关键时刻被称为"二比一轨道共振"
This pivotal moment is known as "The two-to-one resonance."

257
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,800
二比一轨道共振
Two-to-one resonance

258
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,520
是一种强烈的引力作用
is a very strong gravitational interaction,

259
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,660
主宰太阳系达几百万年

木星和土星的二比一轨道共振
and having Jupiter and Saturn in a two-to-one resonance

262
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,160
对整个太阳系造成了深远的影响
leads to profound consequences throughout the Solar System.

263
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,050
它扰乱了其他星球的轨道
It shakes the orbits of the other objects up.

264
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,720
导致了轨道交叉  可以引发大碰撞
It leads to crossing orbits, and it can lead to giant impacts.

土星和木星的引力共振
Saturn and Jupiter's resonant gravity

266
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,420
使天王星和海王星的轨道失去平衡
destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,240
这一出行星抢椅游戏
The resulting game of planetary musical chairs

268
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,150
引发了太阳系规模最大

269
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,790
持续时间最长的灾难

When Jupiter and Saturn reached that two-one resonance,

271
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,430

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,990
从本质上搅乱了外太阳系
that essentially stirred up the outer Solar System.

274
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,150
海王星和天王星被抛向更远的轨道
Neptune and Uranus were thrown into much higher orbits,

275
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,010
它们甚至交换了位置
and they even switched places.

276
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,350
现在二者的顺序是天王星  海王星
So now the order is Uranus, Neptune.

277
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,320
起初  顺序是海王星  天王星
In the beginning, it used to be Neptune followed by Uranus.

278
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,490
海王星和天王星可能不止一次
Neptune and Uranus may have switched orbits,

279
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,120
而是好几次交换了轨道
not once, but several times.

280
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,470
但它们算幸运的
But they were the lucky ones.

281
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,190
很多行星很可能被迫
Several planets were most likely

282
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,670
集体离开了太阳系
hurled out of the Solar System altogether,

283
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,270
注定在黑暗的
doomed to wander forever

284
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,380
星际空间徘徊一生
in the blackness of interstellar space.

285
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,320
几乎可以确定
It's almost a certainty

286
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,050
太阳系在这一过程中损失了很多行星
that our Solar System has lost planets along the way,

287
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,990
在这种天体桌球游戏中
during this sort of, uh, celestial billiards

288
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,410
行星交替互换位置
that's played and planets swapping places.

289
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
甚至有证据证明
There's even some evidence, perhaps,

00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,420
{\an8}丹·督答
西南研究所

291
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,430
木星和土星可能进入过
that Jupiter and Saturn may have wandered

292
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,860
内太阳系
into the inner Solar System,

293
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,070
在退回到它们当如今的轨道前
to near the position where the Earth is today,

294
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,070
曾经到达过今天地球的位置
before wandering back out to their present locations.

295
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,650
但二比一轨道共振只是一个开始
But the two-to-one resonance was just the beginning.

296
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,360
41亿年前  气体巨星 
As the gas giants searched for stable orbits

297
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,510
在寻找稳定轨道时
4.1 billion years ago,

298
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,580
引发了一场
they ignited the most wide-ranging cataclysm

299
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,340
波及整个太阳系的灾难
ever to engulf the Solar System...

300
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,360
目前为止  依然如此
So far, anyway.

301
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,510
行星灾难第七位
Number seven in our countdown...

302
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,780
晚期大撞击事件
The late heavy bombardment.

303
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,290
土星和木星的轨道之舞
The orbital dance of Saturn and Jupiter

304
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,580
不仅搅乱了外太阳系的行星运行
didn't just throw the outer gas giants into turmoil,

305
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,410
还形成了影响整个太阳系的大漩涡
it also ignited a system-wide maelstrom.

306
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,930
土木两星外围的岩屑
The wandering around of Jupiter and Saturn

307
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,350
会因为引力发生聚集  形成原行星
would have created gravitational tugs on the protoplanets

308
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,190
这就是小行星带的起源
that were forming in the region of the asteroid belt.

309
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,900
互相碰撞产生的碎屑
That would have caused them to smash together,

310
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,590
形成了更多的小行星
shattering them into a bunch of asteroids,

311
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,970
这大约发生在距今41亿年前
probably before 4.1 billion years ago.

312
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,050
土星和木星
And then the two-to-one resonance

313
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,950
所产生的共振
of Jupiter and Saturn

314
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,740
引导着这些小行星
channeled some of those asteroids

315
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,390
进入太阳系内部
into the inner Solar System,

316
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,200
拉开了剧烈撞击期的序幕
creating the era of heavy bombardment.

317
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,720
每当我们仰望皓月当空
We can see the dramatic results

318
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,360
就能看到那次撞击造成的巨大后果
every time we gaze up at the moon.

319
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,790
月表大部分坑坑洼洼的环形山
Most of the scars on its pockmarked face

320
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,270
就是晚期撞击导致的
are the result of this bombardment,

321
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,750
也被称为"月球灾难"
also known as "the lunar cataclysm."

322
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,840
1969年  隶属美国宇航局的
Proof of this disaster was discovered in 1969,

323
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,990
阿波罗11号飞船首次成功载人登月
when NASA's Apollo 11 mission

324
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,180
揭示了这次灾难的证据
put the first man on the moon.

325
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,420
这是一个非常有趣的推理故事
It's a really fun detective story

326
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
我们发现的地质学证据
connecting the dynamical models

327
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,720
说明40亿年前
that are giving us an explanation

328
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,170
在内太阳系
for the geologic evidence

329
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,330
有一次晚期大型撞击
that we see for a late heavy bombardment

330
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,710
而现在可建立起动态模型  解释一切
about four billion years ago here in the inner Solar System.

331
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,040
我们拥有的地质学证据来源于阿波罗号
We had the geologic evidence ever since Apollo

332
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,700
对月球上的岩石做年代测定
and the dating of the rocks from the moon

333
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,340
证明了大撞击的时间
that showed this period of dates at that time.

334
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,100
这些坑洼痕迹告诉我们  
The cratering record tells us that in various spots

335
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,260
在太阳系各个地方  尤其是在月球
in the Solar System, especially, for instance, on the moon,

336
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,670
突然间  全都遭受到
that there was a sudden increase in the number

337
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,350
大量天体的撞击
of really large objects slamming into the planets.

338
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,340
月球仅是留下了这些坑洼创伤
But while the moon merely suffered cosmetic scars,

339
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,740
有一个行星却遭受到了毁灭性的一击
one planet received such a cataclysmic blow,

340
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,480
也许使其失去了孕育生命的能力
it may have lost its ability to harbor life.

341
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,950
太阳系最大的灾难
Number six on our countdown

342
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,030
排名榜的第六位
to the Solar System's greatest catastrophe...

343
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
巨型陨石撞击火星
The mars mega-meteorite impact.

344
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,200
这场剧烈并遍及整个太阳系的
The tumultuous late heavy bombardment

345
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,780
晚期大撞击
that pounded the Solar System

346
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,420
发生在41亿到38亿年之前
between 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago

347
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,310
它不仅仅毁灭了彗星和小行星
disrupted more than just comets and asteroids.

348
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,190
甚至改变了某些行星的轨道
Entire planets were thrown off course,

349
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,930
一架美国宇航局的空间探测器
and a NASA Space Orbiter

350
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,890
最近发现的证据表示
recently uncovered evidence

351
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,180
这些行星中的一个  大约有冥王星大小
that one of them-- a world the size of Pluto--

352
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,220
撞上了火星
plunged into Mars,

353
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,040
彻底重塑了这颗红色行星
drastically reshaping the red planet.

354
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,800
这确实是一次非常大的撞击
It was a very large impact that struck the planet

355
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,370
以一个非常低
at a very low angle,

356
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,180
非常斜的角度撞上火星  基本是从
a very oblique angle, and essentially skimmed off

火星北半球表面一擦而过
the surface of the northern hemisphere of Mars.

359
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,110
可以想象成
Think of it almost as if

360
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,040
一把刀从一个瓜表面削过
a knife were slicing through a melon, for example.

361
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,320
这场撞击形成了一个洼地
The impact carved out the borealis basin,

362
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,260
占了火星表面超过四成的面积
which covers over 40% of Mars' surface.

363
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,260
这是太阳系最大的撞击坑
It's the largest impact crater in the Solar System,

364
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,800
其大小程度相当于整个亚洲
large enough to hold the continents of Asia,

365
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,130
欧洲以及澳洲总面积之和
Europe, and Australia.

366
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,720
在其他行星能找到撞击证据
We see evidence for impacts on other planets

367
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,010
因为都形成了凹地
because they form craters

368
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,110
几乎都是一种模式
that will follow the same sort of pattern--

369
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,620
完好的撞击坑  通常边缘形成圆形
nice excavated pit, usually a rim around the edge,

370
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,340
有时也会飞溅出一些物质
sometimes a spray of material coming out.

371
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,530
但这种证据在火星上并不明显
But those kinds of evidence were not clear on Mars.

372
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,110
这些线索不得不结合
The lines of evidence have to do

373
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,650
火星内部的地心引力
with both the gravity the interior of Mars

374
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,500
以及火星表面的地形
and the topography of the surface of Mars.

375
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,000
综合考虑这些因素
Those, taken together,

376
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,550
才发现这里曾有撞击坑
show that there was a crater,

377
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,560
只是坑洞边缘并不那么明显
it was just sort of sunken down on the edges.

378
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,350
在晚期大撞击时期
At least five huge impacts pummeled Mars

379
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,630
火星至少遭受到了5次巨大的撞击
during the late heavy bombardment,

380
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,500
但是  有一件更糟的事情
but a far worse fate was

381
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,140
即将发生在这颗红色行星上
in store for the red planet.

382
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,670
下一次大灾难
And our next catastrophe may have done more

383
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,800
也许就不止是削掉一大块表面
than gouge out a hefty chunk of the martian surface.

384
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
可能会改变这个行星的命运
It may have changed the planet's destiny.

385
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,360
排行榜第五位
Number five on our countdown...

386
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,290
火星磁暴危机
The Mars magnetic disaster.

387
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,030
探测器绕火星飞行  
Spacecraft orbiting Mars reveal that the planet

388
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,280
发现这颗行星
carries only the faint remains

389
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,990
自身的保护性磁场  消失殆尽
of its once-protective magnetic field.

390
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,040
科学家推测
Scientists speculate that

391
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,600
原因在于另一次大撞击
the culprit was yet another impact,

392
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,940
这次使其命运发生了改变
this one with life-altering implications.

393
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,940
我们不是很确定
We're not exactly sure

394
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,960
为什么火星只有一个薄弱的磁场
why Mars has only a weak magnetic field.

395
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,940
一种想法是  火星曾遭受巨物撞击
One idea is that Mars was hit by a gigantic object,

396
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,400
使其地壳和地幔温度增高
and that heated the crust and mantle,

397
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,020
这就使火星内部和地幔之间的
and that decreased the temperature difference

398
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,370
温差变化变小
between the core and the mantle.

399
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,540
没有了巨大的温差变化
Without there being a big temperature difference,

400
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
就没有了对流运动
there wouldn't be convective motions,

401
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,480
即火星内部的翻腾运动
the churning motion in the interior of Mars.

402
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,400
这些一旦消失  就不可能有磁场
Without them, you don't get a magnetic field.

403
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,640
在地球  我们的全球磁场
On Earth, our global magnetic field

404
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
使危险的太阳粒子
deflects dangerous solar particles

405
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,100
偏离我们的大气层
away from our atmosphere.

406
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,260
但在火星  磁场非常弱
But on Mars, its very weak magnetic field

407
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,210
仅仅只覆盖了火星的某些地方
covers only a few regions of the planet.

408
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,240
致命性的太阳粒子可能将
So, deadly solar particles could have eroded away

409
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,040
火星的大气层破坏
much of its atmosphere.

410
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,330
几十亿年后
And over billions of years,

411
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,520
这就能侵蚀掉
you can tend to erode

412
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,410
大气层的主体部分
a large fraction of the atmosphere,

413
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,850
这就包括水蒸气  二氧化碳
and that includes things like water vapor, carbon dioxide,

414
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,650
甚至是温室气体
things that are excellent greenhouse gases,

415
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,020
这些使得火星温度变得极低
which have caused the planet to become very cold,

416
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,220
因此  变成了我们今日所见的火星
and hence the planet that we see today

417
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,450
一个又冷又干的沙漠
is a very cold, dry desert.

418
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,010
火星磁力消失  也许就使得
The loss of magnetism on Mars may have made it impossible

419
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,350
生命演化和生存的可能
for life to evolve and survive

420
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,830
消失在这颗寒冷贫瘠的行星上
on the frigid, arid planet.

421
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,130
但是有些科学家怀疑
But some scientists are skeptical

422
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,850
磁场的消失是由于一次巨大的撞击
that its magnetism died with a colossal bang.

423
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,720
可能是火星仅仅是一颗小行星
It could be that Mars is simply a small planet,

424
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,490
相对于地球  其内部温度降得更快
and so it lost its internal heat relatively quickly

425
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,960
而没有热量
compared to the Earth, and without the heat,

426
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,640
就只剩下一个实心的铁核
it would have a solid iron core,

427
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,590
就不能产生磁场
and it wouldn't create a magnetic field.

428
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,720
无论如何
In any case,

429
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,990
一旦火星失去了大气层
once Mars lost its atmosphere,

430
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,630
就不可能在表面产生液体水
it was unable to support liquid water on the surface

431
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,250
因为压力太低了
because the pressure was too low.

432
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,680
表面没有液体水
Without liquid water on the surface,

433
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,280
地表生命就无生存的可能
surface life would have perished.

434
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,530
38亿年前  晚期大撞击
By the time the late heavy bombardment

435
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,390
终于慢慢停了下来
slowly came to an end 3.8 billion years ago,

436
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,020
太阳系的每颗行星
every planet in the Solar System

437
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,710
都受到了各种各样的重塑
had received some kind of makeover.

438
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,260
显然的是  所有的大行星
It's very clear that all the giant planets

439
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,640
离最初形成的地方  都有大幅度的位移
have moved substantially from where they originally formed.

440
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,620
海王星明显地向外移动了
We see that Neptune clearly migrated outward,

441
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,140
因为它把那些更小的行星
because it picked up the smaller bodies,

442
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,180
拉入它的引力束缚之下
like Pluto and the other Kuiper Belt objects

443
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,620
{\an8}柯伊伯带位于太阳系的边界
是大多数彗星的来源地

444
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,620
例如冥王星和柯伊伯带的星体
in its gravitational sway,

445
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,220
并迫使它们与自己一起公转
and pushed them out along with it.

446
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,530
最终  这些行星进入稳定的轨道
The planets eventually settled into stable orbits,

447
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,730
但现今  随着它们达到成熟期
but now, as they matured,

448
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,400
新一轮灾难开始从内部爆发
new catastrophes began erupting from within,

449
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,960
而在某些情况下
and in some cases,

450
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,610
这些自身喷涌出的火山
these volcanic, homegrown disasters

451
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,690
会来自比外太空的威胁更严峻
would exceed anything from outer space.

452
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,870
在太阳系形成的早期
Our Solar System was profoundly shaped

453
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,620
各种混乱的碰撞
by the chaotic collisions and bombardments

454
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,690
产生了深远的影响
that marked its earliest days,

455
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,610
但是  38亿年前  
but as the planets finally eased into

456
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,730
各行星缓缓进入稳定轨道
stable orbits 3.8 billion years ago,

457
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,240
新的威胁出现了
new threats arose.

458
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,460
有时候  它们与外太空
And in some cases, they were as bad

459
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,260
坠落的星体一样  带来厄运
as anything bearing down from outer space.

460
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,340
太阳系晚期大撞击
Catastrophes in the Solar System didn't end

461
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,800
并不是一切灾难的终结
with the era of Late Heavy Bombardment.

462
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,550
{\an8}亚历克斯·菲利潘科
加州大学伯克利分校

463
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,940
这之后灾难频发
There have been catastrophes since that time.

464
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,250
小行星和彗星撞击行星
Asteroids and comets can pummel into planets.

465
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,300
火山活动猖獗
Rampant volcanism can occur on planets.

466
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,670
行星上灾难
There are all sorts of ways

467
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,010
形式是多种多样
in which catastrophes can occur on planets.

468
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,250
下一场灾难给一颗行星
The next disaster gave one of the planets

469
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,280
做了一场不幸的整形术
an ill-fated face-lift that left it

470
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,320
为其留下了太阳系中最壮丽的斑点
with the most towering blemish in the Solar System.

471
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,940
太阳系行星灾难
Number four on our countdown

472
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,410
排名第四位
to the Solar System's worst disaster...

473
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,510
火星超级喷发
the Mars super eruptions.

474
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,530
火星快车号探测器
The Mars Express spacecraft

475
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,840
最近揭露  这颗红色行星
recently revealed that the red planet

476
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,180
被灾难性的火山运动
has been ravaged at least five times

477
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,220
摧残了至少五次以上
by episodes of catastrophic volcanism,

478
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,120
使得火星的地表颜色
giving Mars a unique complexion,

479
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,030
与太阳系其他行星不同  独一无二
unlike anything else in the Solar System.

480
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,030
在某些方面  火星上的盾状火山
In some respects, the shield volcanoes on Mars

481
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,190
与地球上的某些火山十分相似
are similar to some volcanoes here on Earth,

482
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,380
比如夏威夷火山
such as at Hawaii.

483
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,700
地表下都有一座巨型岩浆库
You've got a large magma chamber beneath the surface

484
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,220
向地表喷发出大量的岩浆
that's erupting lots of lava onto the surface,

485
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,600
形成火山
creating the volcano.

486
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,770
然而在火星上  这种类型的火山
However, on Mars, these types of volcanoes

487
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,390
比地球上的火山大10到100倍
are 10 to 100 times larger than they are on Earth.

488
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,010
在整个行星表面  喷发的巨型火山
So, all across the planet, you've got these eruption events

489
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,840
{\an8}迈克尔·密西纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验室

490
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,980
遍布星球表面
that are occurring here and then here and then here,

491
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,900
随着时间的流逝  整个行星表面
and over time, sort of the whole surface

492
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,300
都被岩浆占据了
gets filled in with this lava.

493
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,500
火星上遍布着20座主火山
Mars is home to about 20 major volcanoes,

494
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,510
包括太阳系最大的火山
including Olympus Mons,

495
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,020
奥林匹斯山
the largest in the Solar System.

496
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,870
通过这座高耸的古火山
This towering relic provides

497
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,050
我们可洞察这颗行星火热的过去
an eerie glimpse into the planet's fiery past.

498
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,980
当我们翻阅火星的地质史
When we look at Mars' geologic record,

499
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,000
可以通过表面火山坑的数量
we can tell how old things are

500
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,000
{\an8}格雷格·劳克林
加州大学圣克鲁兹分校

501
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,800
辨别其年代的久远
by looking at how many craters are on the surface.

502
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,980
如果表面相对年轻
If the surface is relatively young,

503
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,530
那火山坑的形成时间
then there has been relatively little time

504
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,350
相对较短
for craters to build up,

505
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,570
表面就呈现出平坦  无坑洼的地形
and so we see a surface that's largely flat and unmarred.

506
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,390
如果表面年代久远
If the surface is very old,

507
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,290
那我们就会看到不计其数的火山坑
then we see large numbers of craters.

508
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,130
因此  通过火山坑的年代
And so, through crater dating

509
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,780
以及火星表面的精密绘图
and through careful mapping of the Martian surface,

510
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,390
我们得到火星上的火山活跃期
it looks like there were perhaps five very major episodes

511
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,930
大约分为五个阶段
of volcanic activity on Mars.

512
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,260
与地球上的盾状火山一样
Just as with shield volcanoes on Earth,

513
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,440
火星上的岩浆库饱和
magma chambers rose to the surface of Mars,

514
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,770
岩浆冲至火星表面  一直喷发
broke through, and spewed basaltic lava

515
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,390
长达几个世纪
in centuries-long eruptions.

516
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,180
但是地球的盾状火山和火星的
But there was a key difference between Earth's shield volcanoes

517
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,180
巨型火山有本质区别
and the behemoths on Mars.

518
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,850
在火星上  从没有地球上那种
On Mars, there was never large-scale plate tectonics--

519
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,270
大规模的板块构造之说
the type that we have on Earth.

520
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,020
所以火星上的火山爆发时
So, on Mars, when a volcano gets going,

521
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,520
是非常安静的  岩浆不断从火山口涌出
it just sits there and keeps piling lava out and out and out,

522
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,790
形成了巨型盾状火山
and it builds up enormous shield volcanoes,

523
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,320
就像奥林匹斯山
like Olympus Mons.

524
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,200
在地球上  有板块构造
On Earth, there's plate tectonics.

525
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,210
比如  夏威夷的火山岛
So, for example, the volcanic islands of Hawaii

526
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,790
就呈现带状
are in a chain.

527
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,870
因为板块向北漂移
Because the plate is moving north,

528
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,990
而热点则相对固定
the hot spot is relatively fixed,

529
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,410
新的岛屿也如雨后春笋般出现
and new islands keep on popping up.

530
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,470
但在火星上  岛是一成不变的
But on Mars, it's the same island all the time,

531
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,590
只不过是面积越来越大
and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

532
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,740
大规模的火山活动一次又一次
Massive volcanism radically changed

533
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,090
给火星的外貌带来巨大改变
the surface of Mars time and time again.

534
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,410
但它不是唯一一颗
But it wasn't the only terrestrial planet

535
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,470
收受到内部剧烈活动影响的类地行星
that fell victim to episodes of extreme home-grown violence.

536
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,180
行星灾难排行榜  下一位
Next on our countdown of planetary disasters...

537
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,060
金星危机
The great Venus meltdown.

538
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,920
离地球最近的行星  金星
Our closest planetary neighbor, Venus,

539
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,650
在形成初期可能和地球极为相似
may have begun quite Earthlike.

540
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,400
两者差不多同时形成
It was born at roughly the same time

541
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,580
而且由相同的宇宙物质组成
and made with the same cosmic materials,

542
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,510
但某场灾难将金星变成了
but something transformed Venus

543
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,680
地球的恶魔双子星
into Earth's evil twin.

544
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,640
如果穿透金星厚厚的大气层
If you could penetrate through its thick atmosphere,

545
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,850
就会发现90%的金星表面
you'd see that about 90% of the surface of Venus

546
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,440
都被早起火山活动产生的固态熔岩覆盖
is covered by solidified lava from previous volcanism.

547
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
而厚重而有害的大气
And the thick, noxious atmosphere

548
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,280
主要由二氧化碳组成
consists mostly of carbon dioxide,

549
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,300
而金星的大气压
and it has an atmospheric pressure

550
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,860
大约是地球表面大气压的90倍
about 90 times that on Earth's surface.

551
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,750
这就与水面下九百多米
That's like being 3,000 feet

552
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,860
受到的压力差不多
below the surface of the ocean.

553
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,060
两者感觉是相同的
That's what you'd feel.

554
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,130
此外  金星的温度
Moreover, the temperature on Venus

555
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,780
接近五百摄氏度
is nearly 900 degrees fahrenheit.

556
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,150
这种极端的高温足以使铅融化
That's huge. It's enough to melt lead.

557
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,740
所以  如果人类突然出现在金星表面
So, if a human were suddenly placed on the surface of Venus,

558
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,450
会被瞬间烤熟
he would be baked

559
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,950
然后被压成碎片
and very quickly totally crushed.

560
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,140
金星表面地狱般的环境
The hellish conditions on Venus could have been caused

561
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,780
可能是由于30亿年前
by an extreme runaway greenhouse effect

562
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,130
失控的温室气体效应造成的
over three billion years ago.

563
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,470
如果金星起初有海洋的话
So what happened to the oceans of Venus,

564
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,240
那海洋到底怎么了
if they were there to begin with?

565
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,700
当太阳逐渐放亮
Well, the Sun gradually grew brighter,

566
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,560
造成海洋水大量蒸发
and that led to more evaporation of the oceans,

567
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,040
致使大气中水蒸气含量增加
increasing the water vapor content of the atmosphere.

568
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,390
而水蒸气是温室气体
Well, water is a greenhouse gas,

569
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,750
这个过程也就使得气温剧增
so that led to a greater increase in temperature,

570
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,510
从而导致更多水分蒸发  更多温室气体形成
which led to more evaporation, more greenhouse gases,

571
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,280
失控的温室效应
a runaway greenhouse effect

572
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,750
最终蒸发掉了金星海洋里所有的水分
that eventually evaporated away the oceans of Venus.

573
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,090
海洋消失的证据
Evidence of these lost oceans

574
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,330
也许隐藏于金星的云盖上方
may exist above the cloud decks of Venus.

575
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,780
从金星大气样品的分析得知
We know from sampling Venus' atmosphere

576
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,210
一种叫做氘的重氢
that there is a high concentration of the form of

577
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,060
其浓度极高
heavy hydrogen called deuterium.

578
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,570
大多氢逃逸到宇宙中
Most of the hydrogen escaped to space,

579
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,220
只有少量重氢留在大气层中
and the small dregs of hydrogen that did remain

580
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,860
也就是氘
are this special heavy form called deuterium.

581
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,910
气候巨变会对行星产生重大影响
Venus provides a great example of what can happen to a planet

582
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,920
{\an8}劳拉·丹利
格里菲斯天文台

583
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,310
而金星就是很好的例子
when the climate changes dramatically.

584
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,930
如果我们能弄清楚金星上发生的一切
If we are able to understand what happened on Venus,

585
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,240
就可以之为鉴  防患于未然
we can apply those lessons learned here on Earth.

586
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,810
若一场生态灾害
If an eco-disaster

587
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,740
将金星表面的液态水全部汽化
evaporated the liquid surface water on Venus,

588
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,080
那么生命体是否也全部罹难了呢
were there living creatures that also perished?

589
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,760
一位观众向节目组提出了此疑问
That's what one viewer wanted to ask the universe.

590
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,200
{\an8}观众提问

591
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,980
来自德克萨斯州沃思堡的杰克·科肖
So Jack Kershaw from Fort Worth, Texas,

592
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,270
发信来问
emailed us...

593
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,100
金星上真的曾有生命存在吗
Did life once thrive on Venus?

594
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,840
杰克  这问题真问的不错
Jack, that's a really fascinating question.

595
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,000
在金星生命的首个十亿年中
It turns out that Venus may have had oceans

596
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,070
海洋很可能覆盖了金星的部分表面
for the first half billion or billion years of its existence.

597
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,200
如果真是这样
If so, primitive life,

598
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,290
也许在这些海洋中  曾形成过
by which I mean microbes and bacteria,

599
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,410
低等生命形式  即微生物和细菌
may have formed in those oceans.

600
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,680
只是我们未可知
We just don't know.

601
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,900
而在地球上  低等生命形式
But on Earth, primitive life formed

602
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,060
在晚期大撞击后不久  就出现了
shortly after the end of the late heavy bombardment.

603
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,860
如果金星也是如此
If the same thing happened on Venus,

604
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,620
那必定孕育过生命
then Venus once had life.

605
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,070
{\an8}观众提问

606
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,540
根据温室效应理论
According to the greenhouse theory,

607
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,910
经过数百万年的逐渐演变
the surface of Venus became bone-dry gradually

608
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,790
金星表面变得极干燥
over millions of years,

609
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,710
但并非所有人都认同此观点
but not everyone agrees.

610
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,160
一些科学家驳斥道  金星上的水
Some scientists argue that the water on Venus

611
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,840
事实上并不是一点点蒸发的
actually disappeared not slowly,

612
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,770
而是消失于一场灾难中
but in one disastrous day.

613
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,860
在所有袭击太阳系的灾难中
Of all the catastrophes that have swept the Solar System...

614
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,620
金星的遭遇也许是最令人不解的
perhaps the most puzzling is what happened to Venus.

615
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,550
她原本是一个气候温和的类地行星
A planet originally so warm and Earthlike,

616
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,500
也许还曾孕育过生命
it might have harbored life.

617
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,710
几十年来  科学家们认为
For decades, scientists theorized

618
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,730
一种失控的温室效应
that a runaway greenhouse effect

619
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,130
使金星表层平均温度缓慢上升
slowly raised the planet's average temperature

620
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,860
至灼热的460摄氏度
to a scorching 860 degrees fahrenheit--

621
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,110
几乎是水星表层温度的两倍
almost double that of Mercury.

622
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,100
但地球的这颗邻居
But Earth's next-door neighbor

623
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,730
其毁灭之路也许另有一条
may have taken a different road to ruin.

624
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,860
一种能让金星
One way that Venus may have lost

625
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,400
一下子失去大量水分的方式是
a substantial chunk of its water all at once

626
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,230
遭受巨大的冲撞
is through a giant impact.

627
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,350
庞大的天体撞击金星
A giant impact will hit the planet,

628
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,720
导致大面积的金星表层脱离
basically strip off a huge amount of the outer layer.

629
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,950
并且产生了巨大的能量
That provides an incredible amount of energy,

630
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,470
{\an8}格雷格·劳克林
加州大学圣克鲁兹分校

631
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,350
巨大的热量
an incredible amount of heat,

632
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,030
因而易挥发的元素  如水  氨或甲烷
and so volatile elements, like water or ammonia or methane,

633
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,260
极易流失到星际空间
are simply lost to interplanetary space.

634
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,360
当发生巨大的行星冲撞
And after the giant impact has occurred,

635
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,390
万物消逝之后  只剩下
after everything has died down, you're left with a planet

636
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,700
一颗干燥的
that's much drier and made of material

637
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,110
由气化温度较高的物质组成的星球
that has a much higher vaporization temperature.

638
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,110
该理论的拥护者们声称
Proponents of the theory

639
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,040
冲撞的力量是如此巨大
claim the cosmic punch was so powerful,

640
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,680
甚至将行星的自转轴撞歪了
it actually spun the planet off its axis.

641
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,070
金星的自转方向
Venus spins in the direction

642
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,030
与大多数行星相反
opposite that of most of the planets,

643
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,210
对此我们并不知其原因
and we don't know quite why that is,

644

{\an8}亚历克斯·菲利潘科
加州大学伯克利分校

645
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,320
但已知的是  在太阳系形成早期
but one idea is that it was hit by a gigantic object

646
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,180
金星曾受到一颗巨大物体的撞击
early in the history of the Solar System,

647
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,350
根据撞击方式的不同
and that effectively either flipped it

648
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,720
金星被撞得改变自转方式
or just reversed the sense of rotation,

649
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,030
或者直接被撞翻过去
depending on exactly how the object hit Venus.

650
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,160
金星的命运告诫着人们
The fate of Venus is a telling reminder

651
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,460
地球温和的气候环境
that even temperate conditions, like those on Earth,

652
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,480
是来之不易的
can never be taken for granted.

653
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,560
若你还不认同这一点
If we didn't know that already,

654
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,470
本次行星灾难排行榜的第二名
number two in our countdown of planetary catastrophes

655
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,880
是最有力的证据
drove the point home.

656
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,600
这次灾难  全世界都目睹了
And this time, the whole world was watching.

657
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,440
苏梅克-列维九号彗星撞击事件
The Shoemaker Levy 9 impacts.

658
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,950
我们以前总认为
We used to think that

659
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,830
外太阳系的行星都很稳定
the outer planets were pretty stable.

{\an8}劳拉·丹利

661
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,590
它们不会遭受什么事情
There wasn't a lot happening to them.

662
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,710
但事实上  如今我们总会看到这些行星
But in fact, now we see impacts hitting the outer planets

663
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,810
遭受撞击
all the time.

664
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,360
最大的气星  木星
Jupiter, the largest gas giant,

665
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,270
已然成为公认的太阳系活靶子
has been our Solar System's planetary punching bag.

666
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,670
它强大的引力场足以吸引彗星
It's gravitational force deflects renegade comets

667
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:31,000
{\an8}奥尔特云是一个假设的包围者太阳系的球体云团
布满着不活跃的彗星

668
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,000
使脱离它们位于奥尔特云
that break loose from their orbital prisons

669
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,380
与柯伊伯带的运行轨道
in the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt.

670
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,130
木星受到撞击的几率比其他任何行星
The rate of impacts on Jupiter is greater than that

671
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,040
都要大的多  原因有两点
of any other planet, for two reasons--

672
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,900
第一  木星是最大的行星
first, Jupiter is the biggest planet,

673
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,910
因而它的横截面最大
so it presents the biggest cross section.

674
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,710
更容易被撞到
Things are more likely to hit it.

675
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,300
第二  木星质量非常大
Second, Jupiter has a huge mass,

676
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,530
因而它会吸引天体靠近
so it pulls objects in toward it.

677
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,250
从某种意义上来说  木星是自找麻烦
In a sense, Jupiter is asking for trouble.

678
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,480
木星承受过许多次严重的撞击
Jupiter has taken a lot of nasty hits,

679
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,830
包括人类观察到的最剧烈的
including one of the most violent celestial catastrophes

680
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,660
一次天体撞击
ever witnessed by mankind.

681
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,820
1994年7月
In July, 1994,

682
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,840
全世界都目睹了21枚彗星碎片
the world watched as a chain of 21 comet fragments

683
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,180
以毁天灭地之势
raced towards the giant planet

684
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,000
对木星发动了连环撞击
and struck it with colossal force.

685
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,690
苏梅克-列维九号彗星以其发现者命名
Shoemaker-Levy 9, named after its discoverers,

686
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,900
它的这次撞击
delivered the energy

687
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,500
与六万亿TNT爆炸相当
of six million mega tons of TNT.

688
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,970
苏梅克-列维九号撞上木星时
During the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter,

689
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,530
彗星碎片以每秒数十公里的速度
you had this ripped-up comet coming in

690
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,770
一个接一个撞上木星
at tens of kilometers per second

691
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,850
并在木星大气层发生爆炸
and impacting Jupiter in one airburst after another,

692
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,000
与此同时  木星还在自转中
as Jupiter spun underneath the comet.

693
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,790
因此  彗星碎片所造成的撞击
And so that led to a series of impacts being spread

694
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,440
沿着某一纬度分布
along a particular latitude of Jupiter's surface

695
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,340
所造成的痕迹
and leaving these scars,

696
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,460
完全可以使用地面望远镜进行观测
which were visible in telescopes from the Earth.

697
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,380
由于木星表面是气态的
The fragments didn't produce craters,

698
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,860
所以这次撞击并没有产生环形山
because Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface.

699
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,180
相反  它们对木星致密的大气产生撞击
Instead, they struck the gas giant's dense atmosphere,

700
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,690
使得大气内部的物质喷发出来
dredging up material that erupted

701
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,900
留下了一串喷发口
in a trail of venting scars.

702
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:17,050
撞击的痕迹  就像乌云一般
The impact scars, the dark cloud features,

703
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,700
与地球的尺寸相差不大
were about the size of our planet Earth,

704
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,290
这一事实验证了一个说法
and that tells an important tale,

705
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,290
{\an8}丹·督答
西南研究院

706
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
那就是  如果有一枚
that if you have an object that's, you know,

707
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,330
直径八百米左右的星体撞击地球
a half a mile across striking an object the size of the Earth,

708
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,300
那么由撞击所产生的尘埃
the dust pall from that impact

709
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,860
将会覆盖整个星球
will encompass our entire planet.

710
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,550
我们从木星的撞击上学到的是
So that's the lesson we learned from the Jupiter impacts,

711
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,690
地球历史上的一些撞击
is it really brought home the story of impacts

712
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,650
是如何发生的
right here on Earth.

713
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,250
在木星表面的深色印记的观测期
The dark imprints left on the cloud decks of Jupiter

714
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,310
仅仅为几个月
were only visible for several months,

715
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,230
随后它们就消逝在木星湍急混乱的大气中
before being mixed into its turbulent atmosphere.

716
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,150
木星的大气活动
Jupiter has very vigorous

717
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,510
异常的活跃  常会出现极端气候
and, oftentimes, very violent weather patterns.

718
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,780
因此  虽然彗星爆炸的威力巨大
So, no matter how destructive that airburst might be,

719
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,080
在几周到几个月之间
over a period of weeks to months,

720
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,340
气流  也就是木星的气旋
the currents, the airflow in Jupiter's atmosphere

721
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,790
逐渐控制住外来物
takes the pollutants

722
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,040
并使其扩散到整个大气表面
and disperses them through the planet.

723
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,550
这次灾难性撞击的证据
And the evidence for the catastrophic impact

724
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,750
也随之消散不见
dissipates and disappears.

725
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,230
苏梅克-列维九号撞击提醒着我们
Shoemaker-Levy 9 is a scary reminder

726
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,140
太阳系中仍流窜着彗星
of the cosmic unrest in our Solar System,

727
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,810
但科学家称最终极的灾难
but scientists warn that the ultimate catastrophe

728
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,620
还没有到来
still looms in the future.

729
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,640
至于地球
And for Earth,

730
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,550
将在劫难逃
there can be no escape.

731
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,590
我们的太阳系
Our Solar System has weathered

732
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,910
已在改变行星命运的灾难中
over four billion years of

733
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,690
挣扎了超过四十亿年
planet-altering catastrophes.

734
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,890
有些时候  影响甚为明显
In some cases, the effects are obvious,

735
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,550
如晚期大撞击
like the craters

736
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,910
所留下的环形山
of the late heavy bombardment that

737
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,230
使月球凌乱不堪
still litter the moon.

738
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,980
而在其他行星上  这些证据早已毫无踪迹
In others, the evidence has long since disappeared.

739
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,020
不过科学家们最近发现了
But scientists recently discovered

740
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,070
灾难排行榜上的第二名
that number two on our countdown of catastrophes

741
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,760
引起了让他们从未想象过的连锁反应
has created a ripple effect they never imagined.

742
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,410
美国宇航局最近对比了  从卡西尼号
NASA has recently compared images of Jupiter

743
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,410
{\an8}卡西尼号是土星探测器

744
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,210
和新视野号上拍下的木星图像
from the Cassini and New Horizons missions

745
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,210
{\an8}新视野号是木星探测器

746
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,770
其发现令人大吃一惊
and made a stunning discovery.

747
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,520
和土星一样  木星也有光环
Like Saturn, Jupiter also has rings,

748
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,340
尽管看起来微弱多了
though much fainter.

749
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,360
可是有些事让他们很不安
But something has disrupted them.

750
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,790
当你仔细看木星的光环
If you look at the rings of Jupiter,

751
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,210
会发现实际上是有褶皱的
they actually have little corrugations,

752
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,660
呈现出起伏
little ripples in them,

753
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,030
这些起伏是光环的某部分
and those ripples are formed

754
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:37,400
{\an8}丹·督答
西南研究所

755
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,750
发生倾斜而产生的
when a portion of the ring is tilted

756
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,510
然后随着它继续不断旋转和形成
and then as it continues to spin and evolve over time,

757
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,840
这些起伏向外扩张
those ripples wander out,

758
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,050
沿着光环传播开来
propagate out through the ring system.

759
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,190
如果分析这个光环
If you unwind that system

760
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,370
并倒推这些起伏的产生时间
and work back out the ripples,

761
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,380
你会知道
you can find out

762
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,620
整个光环的平面是什么时候
the point in time when that ring plane

763
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,220
开始倾斜的
had gotten tilted over.

764
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,490
光环开始倾斜的时间
That point when that ring got tilted

765
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,580
正好是在1994年7月份
was right around July of 1994.

766
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,320
1994年7月份是
July, 1994 marks the date

767
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,510
苏梅克-列维九号彗星撞击事件的时间
of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact event.

768
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,950
科学家们有了一项重大发现
The scientific sleuths had made a key discovery.

769
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,250
彗星碎片撞击木星主体时
As the cometary fragments struck Jupiter itself,

770
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,500
细小的碎片穿过了它的光环
much smaller debris passed through its rings,

771
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,210
使它们发生倾斜与扭曲
tilting and twisting them

772
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,050
从而变成了我们今天看到的起伏
into ripples that we still see today.

773
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
像苏梅克-列维九号彗星
In the case of a disrupted comet

774
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,060
这种分崩离析的彗星
like Shoemaker-Levy 9,

775
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,380
你看到的是一整团尘埃
you've got an entire pall of dust,

776
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,190
一团巨大的物质
a large mass of material

777
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,340
在整个光环的平面上分散开来
distributed across the disk of the rings,

778
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,380
落于各个角落
raining through that system.

779
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,030
因此  不单是一两个光环组成体被换掉
And so, rather than displacing only one or two ring particles,

780
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,820
而是一整片都被换点  使光环倾斜
you can do the entire cloud at once, tipping on the side.

781
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,480
苏梅克-列维九号彗星并非是
Shoemaker-Levy 9 wasn't the only comet

782
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,310
近期唯一在木星上留下痕迹的
to leave its calling-card mark on Jupiter in recent times.

783
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,730
2009年7月  另一颗小行星
In July, 2009, another asteroid

784
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,690
猛撞在巨型气体行星的南极附近
smashed into the gas giant near its south pole.

785
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,370
当它冲击木星后  溅出了大气深处的
When it impacted Jupiter, it brought up a lot of material

786
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,110
大量物质
from deep within the atmosphere

787
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,780
并在行星表面留下了一个巨大的伤疤
and created a huge scar on the surface of the planet

788
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:16,540
{\an8}迈克尔·密西纳
美国宇航局  喷气推进实验室

789
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,560
几个星期都不会消退
that was visible for many weeks.

790
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,690
这个黑灰云团的规模
The size of this black ash cloud

791
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,420
可能等同于地球上的太平洋
was perhaps the size of the pacific ocean on the Earth.

792
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,620
相当庞大
It was quite large.

793
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,260
人们预测  每隔十到十五年
It's now estimated that an asteroid or comet

794
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,770
木星会被小行星或彗星撞击一次
hits Jupiter every 10 to 15 years,

795
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,960
是地球被撞击几率的五千倍
which is 5,000 times higher than the rate of impacts on Earth.

796
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,450
我们观测到了好多次
The fact that we've seen several of these

797
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,030
这暗示撞击一直存在着
suggests that it's happening all the time,

798
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,470
{\an8}劳拉·丹利
格里菲斯天文台

799
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,740
因为我们并不能观察到所有的
because there are all the ones we don't see.

800
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,810
在外太阳系的气体巨行星上
So there's a lot more impact activity

801
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,150
发生的撞击活动  比想象中的多
on the outer gas giants than we ever thought.

802
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,750
如果木星不在我们的太阳系中
If Jupiter was not in our Solar System,

803
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,680
那么地球将变成
the Earth would be essentially a sitting duck

804
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,120
向太阳前进的所有碎片  彗星
for all the debris, the comets and the asteroids

805
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,920
以及小行星的撞击目标
that were falling in towards the Sun,

806
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,960
而地球所遭受到的无尽灾难
creating vastly larger numbers of catastrophes on Earth

807
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,680
将绝不止现在这么多
than we've experienced through our history.

808
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,680
随着太阳系逐渐成熟
But as our Solar System ages,

809
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,360
新的威胁似乎也出现了
new threats will likely arise,

810
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,060
地球也将面对一场宇宙终极审判
and Earth itself will face a cosmic day of reckoning

811
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,310
就连木星也无法阻止
that nothing, not even Jupiter, can prevent.

812
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,520
也就是灾难排行榜上
Which brings us to number one

813
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,960
位列第一的那一场...
on our countdown of catastrophes...

814
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,000
行星末日
Planetary armageddon.

815
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,880
许多科学家相信
In several billion years,

816
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,100
在数十亿年内  最大的行星木星
many scientists believe Jupiter, the largest planet,

817
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,000
和最小的水星
and Mercury, the smallest,

818
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,520
将会在轨道争夺上对抗
will face off in an orbital duel,

819
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,300
而一位无辜的旁观者  地球
and an innocent bystander, Earth,

820
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,260
却正好位于集火的中心
just might find itself in the line of fire.

821
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,150
现在的太阳系可以说是
Right now our Solar System

822
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,600
非常按部就班地在运行着
is kind of the paradigm of clockwork regularity,

823
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,670
{\an8}格雷格·劳克林
加州大学圣克鲁兹分校

824
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,050
可事实证明
but it turns out that, you know,

825
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,670
行星之间的万有引力会相互影响
the planets do affect each other gravitationally.

826
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,310
长时间看来  行星的轨道
The planetary orbits are, over very long periods of time,

827
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,670
会来来回回地摇摆和旋转
vibrating in and out and turning.

828
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,360
木星和水星的公转步伐将被协调至
Jupiter and Mercury will begin to turn their orbits

829
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,710
相同的比率
at the same rate,

830
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,970
一旦事成定局
and if that happens,

831
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,470
水星的轨道将会日益愈发偏离日心
Mercury's orbit becomes progressively more eccentric.

832
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,560
会日益变得狭长起来
It becomes progressively more elongated

833
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,300
直到最终  轨道的远日点
until the point where, at its far point from the Sun,

834
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,700
与金星轨道交叉
it's actually crossing Venus' orbit.

835
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,760
一旦水星的的轨道
If Mercury's orbit ever gets to the situation

836
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,380
与金星的轨道相交
where it's crossing Venus' orbit,

837
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,910
那么后果不堪设想
then basically all hell can break loose.

838
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,620
科学家们已经计算出
Scientists have calculated

839
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,230
四种灾难后果中的每一种
one of four disastrous consequences.

840
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,440
水星可能与太阳碰撞
Mercury might collide with the Sun,

841
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,170
可能被驱逐出太阳系
might be ejected from the Solar System,

842
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,510
可能猛撞金星
might smash into Venus...

843
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,040
或者最坏的情形是
or in a worst-case scenario,

844
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,630
水星可能会和地球相撞
Mercury might collide with the Earth,

845
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,540
炸毁我们的地幔和大气
blasting away our mantle and atmosphere

846
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,660
使地球变成不毛之地
and sterilizing our planet.

847
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,750
目前我们从电脑模拟中得知
As far as we can tell from computer simulations,

848
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,670
水星成为脱缰之马的几率
there's about a 1% chance

849
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,990
大约是百分之一
that Mercury's orbit will go haywire.

850
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,390
而在这百分之一的几率中
And within that 1% chance,

851
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,700
就有地球遭水星撞击
there's a small probability that things will unfold

852
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,620
这样的小概率事件
in such a way that the Earth itself is impacted by Mercury.

853
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,150
水星绝不是我们在太阳系里
Mercury is hardly the only threat we face

854
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,780
面对的唯一威胁
from within the Solar System.

855
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,280
根据一些场景模拟
According to some scenarios,

856
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,310
火星同样面临轨道混乱的未来
Mars also faces orbital chaos in the future.

857
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,780
而它  同样也可能撞向地球
And it, too, may slam into the Earth,

858
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,370
重演月球经历过的浩劫
repeating the disaster that gave rise to the moon,

859
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,240
而不仅行星会如此
and it's not just planets.

860
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,460
周期性靠近的天体  会影响到
Nearby stars periodically disrupt comets

861
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,990
奥尔特云中的彗星  从而使它们
in the Oort cloud, which could send them

862
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,220
成为太阳系中自杀式行动的一份子
on a kamikaze mission through the Solar System

863
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,330
并引发一场新的太阳系晚期大撞击
and set off a new late heavy bombardment.

864
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,220
而若像众人预料的那样
And if, as most expect,

865
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,560
仙女座星系最终与银河系相撞
the Andromeda galaxy ultimately collides with the Milky Way,

866
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,250
银河的连环撞击
the galactic pileup could

867
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,760
会粉碎太阳系伪装下的平静
shatter our Solar System's deceptive calm.

868
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,600
最终的行星之灾
The ultimate planetary catastrophe,

869
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,330
我认为还没有发生
I think, is still in our future.

870
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,040
灾难  在太阳系的历史中
Catastrophes have always played

871
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,000
一直扮演着一个暴力而重要的角色
a violent, yet vital, role in our Solar System's history.

872
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,320
没有它们  我们的邻居将会是另一番天地
Without them, our neighborhood would be a very different place.

873
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,190
通过研究这些反复无常的活动
By learning about these volatile events,

874
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,850
我们能更好的理解  它们是如何
we can better understand how they helped

875
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,040
形成我们赖以栖息的星球
form the planet that gave us life

876
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,180
以及怎样才能保护地球与人类
and how we might protect it and us

877
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,980
免遭未来的灭顶之灾
from the catastrophes of the future.
