00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,650
You are being watched.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,770
The government has a secret system-

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,700
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,300
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,270
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,520
The government considers these people irrelevant.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,860
We don't.

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,020
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,980
You will never find us.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,440
But victim or perpetrator,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,580
if your number's up, we'll find you.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,250
<i>We know about Quinn and what he did to Cal.</i>

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,940
<i>Then you know why he can't get away with it.</i>

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,190
Where are we taking him? Fed building downtown.

18
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,490
The FBI may be the only ones we can trust.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,450
The judge has been asking to see you.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,430
Do we have a problem, Your Honor?

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,530
Do you consider a felony murder charge a problem?

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,000
Because if that bitch cop and her gun-wielding cohort

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
get Alonzo Quinn into federal custody, <i>that's what we'll all be facing.</i>

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,390
No one is gonna be charged.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,100
We have checkpoints on all the roads. <i>They'll never make it downtown.</i>

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,440
Carter said she had evidence on HR, pictures, recordings.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,650
She has me on tape working with you people. We have a team tossing her place.

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,580
No one is gonna kill her until we get that evidence.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,030
We need to come up with a story.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Do you have a firearm in the house?

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,430
In that far drawer.

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,300
Fine, what's the story?

33
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,280
Robbers broke into your home, they looted the place,

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,140
and shot you.

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,990
Old man would've talked.

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,980
He's got state's evidence written all over him. Get rid of this.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,740
Bring me Officer Carter and Alonzo Quinn alive.

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,440
And if Quinn gets so much as a hangnail,

39
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,760
I will come after you. Do you understand?

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,610
What about our pal in the suit?

41
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,180
I should've ended him a long time ago.

42
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,930
Tell our friends, shoot to kill.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,730
<i>- Shadow. - Victor.</i>

44
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,290
<i>- Bravo. - Time.</i>

45
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,070
<i>- November. - Whiskey.</i>

46
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,560
<i>- Flight. - Uniform.</i>

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,250
<i>- X-ray. - Close.</i>

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,190
<i>- Delta. - Foxtrot.</i>

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,730
Know what happens if you try anything?

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,780
I believe I can fill in the blanks.

51
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,920
We're not stopping until we get you to the fed building downtown.

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,260
So don't die on us, you hear?

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,830
You keep forgetting, this is my city.

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,630
There's just two of you.

55
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,740
we won't be outmatched for long.

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,280
Finch is sending the cavalry.

57
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,130
Wouldn't kill you to clean up every once in a while.

58
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,260
Why? I got you as a maid.

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,870
Oh, yeah? Well, the maid's gotta go to work.

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,210
Mrs. Olson is gonna drop in and make sure you're okay.

61
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,360
Nice necklace, dad.

62
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,130
It's a key, smart guy.

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,690
Friend of mine's got some information on some very bad guys, and I'm keeping it safe.

64
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,500
Sure that's a good idea, trusting you with it?

65
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,020
Turns out your old man's a pretty tough guy.

66
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,710
The bad guys, they don't want no part of this.

67
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,520
So how 'bout you mind your own business and get some shut-eye?

68
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,360
Good night, buddy.

69
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,210
What kind of cop doesn't use a vertical dead bolt?

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,050
What the hell? Where'd you come from? It doesn't matter.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,280
It's where we're going that's important. <i>Grab your gun, Lionel.</i>

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
Let me guess, Mr. Congeniality's in some kind of trouble.

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,850
<i>You could say that.</i> Reese and Carter nabbed the head of HR.

74
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,610
They need a little help escorting him into FBI custody.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,790
You ready?

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,230
I don't care who you are, you break in my house again, you're gonna be sorry.

77
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm already sorry, I'm gonna have to listen to your whiny ass all the way into Queens.

78
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,190
Me? You know the dog's the only one that likes you, right?

79
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,810
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

80
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,460
<i>Please report any bags left unattended.</i>

81
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,670
I'm sorry I got you into this.

82
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,150
You get us into Manhattan, I'll take Quinn to the fed building alone.

83
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,490
What is it about you, Joss,

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,520
makes you want to do everything on your own?

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,800
What is it about you, John, that makes you want to save everybody else's life but your own?

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,910
<i>Mr. Reese?</i> Excuse me.

87
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,490
<i>I have some very bad news.</i>

88
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,470
Guessing this is about a number. Several, actually.

89
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,070
It took me a while to realize that they were all prior aliases for one person.

90
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,750
You, Mr. Reese.

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,160
Something wrong? No more than usual.

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,380
<i>Check your phone.</i>

93
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,450
<i>HR has put a bounty on your head,</i> <i>and they're distributing this picture.</i>

94
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,730
My old chess partner called to inform me his men will sit this one out.

95
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,080
That's nice of Elias.

96
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,570
<i>Yes, but unfortunately, they're the only ones.</i>

97
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,300
<i>It appears that every criminal in New York</i>

98
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,790
<i>is trying to kill you.</i>

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
Don't suppose they're just trying to be friendly.

100
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,990
That's a nice suit. Maybe we'll bury you in it.

101
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,340
Too bad. I just had it cleaned.

102
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,000
Something funny?

103
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,560
Subway, thugs.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,200
Kind of reminds me of the first time we met.

105
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,300
Gotta transfer to the R train.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,420
It'll drop us a couple blocks from Federal Plaza.

107
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,630
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

108
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,500
<i>Due to an incident at the Lexington Avenue station,</i>

109
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,130
<i>all train service has been suspended to Manhattan.</i> Guessing that's not just bad luck.

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,570
Our friends in blue aren't making it easy for us.

111
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,440
- Keep moving. - Or what?

112
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,760
You'll shoot me? That's exactly what I'll do.

113
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,830
I'm giving you a warning. That's more than you gave Cal.

114
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,340
Finch, I need an exit strategy.

115
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,280
<i>- Finch, you there? - Looking for this?</i>

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,660
You two still believe you're the heroes of this story?

117
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,440
My men will have every subway, train, and road from Queens blocked.

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,170
This ends one way, and it's not with you riding into the sunset.

119
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,640
Let's go. Your men are looking for three people.

120
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,380
We just need better camouflage.

121
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,890
Mr. Reese?

122
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,360
Can you hear me?

123
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,410
<i>Ms. Shaw, I'm afraid I've lost contact with Mr. Reese.</i>

124
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,500
Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, Finch,

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,480
you could just ask the machine for his location.

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,710
I don't speak to the machine, and the machine doesn't speak to me, Ms. Shaw.

127
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,540
Well, it speaks to her.

128
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,230
I might not know where our friends are, but I certainly know where they're headed.

129
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,440
<i>26 Federal Plaza, to be exact.</i>

130
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,790
<i>Based on their last location, there are two direct routes</i>

131
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,670
<i>into Manhattan- the Long Island railroad</i> and the BQE to Brooklyn Bridge.

132
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,340
HR will be patrolling both spots heavily.

133
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,780
So are you saying Fusco and I need to split up?

134
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,820
Is that glasses? Tell him this is the last time I chauffeur your ass.

135
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,330
Divide and conquer, I assume that's all right with you.

136
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,300
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

137
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,980
Something's wrong with your attack dog.

138
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,010
He appears to be the smart one.

139
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,480
Why are you still awake?

140
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,290
Not bad dreams, I hope.

141
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,410
I heard it said once that a pregnant woman may see the face of her unborn child in her dreams.

142
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,110
I saw every digit,

143
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,970
every line of code

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,970
as I created it.

145
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,480
But you've changed that, haven't you?

146
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,190
You found a way to alter the DNA to rewrite the code.

147
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,840
Is that how you get it to speak to you?

148
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,420
You have the relationship with her that you wanted.

149
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,630
She respects that.

150
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,960
My relationship is more...

151
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,580
intimate.

152
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,890
Sorry I asked.

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,320
Why are you asking? What's gotten you so upset?

154
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,990
Is the big lug in trouble?

155
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,440
Has his number finally come up?

156
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,660
I don't really care for the man myself,

157
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,150
but he means a great deal to you.

158
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,220
So if you can see it fit

159
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,620
to set me free from this cage,

160
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,550
I'll return him to you, unharmed.

161
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,060
How could I ever let you go

162
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,120
when I know with an almost absolute certainty that bad things will happen?

163
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,910
Bad things will happen regardless.

164
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,240
The question is, are you gonna let them happen to your friend?

165
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,420
Come on, Harry.

166
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,250
Let's not pretend that John is your first helper monkey.

167
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,900
Exactly how many guys did you go through before him?

168
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,060
Pleasant dreams.

169
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,440
Thanks for giving us a lift.

170
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,890
Don't get too comfortable, we'll be at the fed building soon.

171
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,170
Petersen, surprised you dragged your ass out of bed.

172
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,540
I was told there was a chance to shoot people.

173
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,420
Imagine my disappointment, suit's a no-show. Probably laying low.

174
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,430
Doubt he's gonna stick his head out again.

175
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,190
Our pal stormed a judge's house.

176
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,080
Subtle he ain't.

177
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,680
He's hiding, all right, but you can bet it's in plain sight.

178
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,470
Fusco?

179
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,110
<i>I haven't spotted our friends,</i> but I'm not the only one looking.

180
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,580
Yeah, HR's got a checkpoint at the Brooklyn Bridge too.

181
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,970
<i>No sign of our people.</i>

182
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,300
Hope they find their way out of dodge.

183
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,570
Get us through,

184
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,420
you can go about your night. Got a bus coming.

185
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,620
Come on.

186
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,810
Hey! Hey, stop that ambulance! I'll take it from here.

187
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,950
Any luck finding our friends?

188
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,730
If you mean by "Luck," helping them escape an HR checkpoint

189
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,840
and bully their way into Manhattan, then yes.

190
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,050
Lionel?

191
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,680
Detective Fusco, are you all right?

192
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,060
Game over, Lionel.

193
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,700
What do you want to do with him, boss?

194
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,100
I got a few ideas.

195
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,600
Reese and Carter broke through HR's roadblock into Manhattan.

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,080
They're on their way to the fed building. I heard. Thanks to Detective Fusco.

197
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Unfortunately, he wasn't so lucky.

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,350
I can find him, but it might not matter. Might be dead by now.

199
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,460
Remind me to hire an optimist next time.

200
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,850
Even an optimist can't be two places at once.

201
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,880
So what'll it be, Finch?

202
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,460
Detective Fusco is currently without any aid.

203
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,230
Reese and Carter will have to make do on their own.

204
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,840
Locate the Detective.

205
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,850
The hell am I? Someplace no one will hear you scream,

206
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,560
since you'll be doing a lot of that.

207
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,110
Meet your new best friends.

208
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,050
Petersen, right? Always remember a pretty face.

209
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,920
How about this? Look familiar?

210
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,840
You emptied my pockets.

211
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,780
Think there's some lint in there too.

212
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,210
You're a funny guy, Fusco.

213
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,900
Must have had your ex-partner in stitches.

214
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,860
<i>When's the last time you saw Carter?</i>

215
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,020
I don't know. Let me check my day planner.

216
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,260
<i>We know you met with Carter tonight.</i>

217
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,210
She handed you something, looked an awful lot like this.

218
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,410
What does it open?

219
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,440
See, Carter has information on our organization, <i>hidden it somewhere.</i>

220
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,060
From the size and shape of this key,

221
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,410
I'd say it opens up a safe deposit box.

222
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,430
It's my locker at the Y.

223
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,310
You're welcome to my dirty jock.

224
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,140
Hey, Fusco, want to know your fortune?

225
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,670
"You will be unusually successful at your career. "

226
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,660
You know, I don't think that one's true.

227
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,450
"A thrilling time is in your future. "

228
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,950
We're getting close now.

229
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,090
Oh, here we go.

230
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,030
"Tell your friends what they want to know,

231
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,950
or they will break you apart limb by limb. "

232
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,810
<i>That's more like it.</i>

233
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,250
So what's it gonna be, Fusco?

234
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,870
Courtesy of the driver.

235
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,430
He's gonna have one hell of a headache when he wakes up.

236
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,170
I did say I was sorry.

237
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,960
Fed building's just four blocks up.

238
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,940
Looks like we're late to our own party. We'll have to go in on foot.

239
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,270
<i>- Let's go. - Come on.</i>

240
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,570
Hey, hold up.

241
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Come on, come on, come on. Move!

242
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,380
'Sup?

243
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,760
We gotta get off the streets now. In here.

244
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,700
Finch, could use a little help here.

245
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,460
<i>Mr. Reese, where are you?</i>

246
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,930
Not my final stop, I hope. City Morgue, downtown.

247
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,380
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

248
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,270
HR has gangs patrolling the street. <i>Can you send Lionel to pick us up?</i>

249
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,410
I'm afraid Detective Fusco has been apprehended by HR.

250
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,700
<i>Chances are, they're planning to use him</i> <i>for leverage, or worse.</i>

251
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,650
<i>I've asked Ms. Shaw to locate him.</i>

252
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,030
They got Fusco, didn't they?

253
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,430
Don't worry, Shaw will find him.

254
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,150
And if she doesn't?

255
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,010
Nope, no sign of our boy.

256
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,760
Oh, damn it.

257
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,520
Ow! No!

258
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,280
You know that's not real meat, right?

259
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,350
The hell- who are you?

260
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,420
Concerned citizen. Our police force

261
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,390
should really be filling up on something more...

262
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,190
substantial.

263
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,510
Now...

264
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,420
I want you to call your pal Simmons

265
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,070
and find out where he's keeping Detective Fusco.

266
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,750
I- um, I don't know what you're talking about.

267
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,100
Do it now, or I lose the pin to this grenade...

268
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,670
permanently.

269
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,840
You don't understand.

270
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,540
You might kill me,

271
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,920
but I cross Simmons,

272
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,630
he'll hunt down my wife,

273
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,420
my sister.

274
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,320
He won't stop until everybody I love is dead.

275
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,990
Please.

276
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,970
Wait, I need that pin!

277
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,620
<i>Federal Plaza.</i>

278
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,190
Four blocks and only 15 rounds of ammo between us.

279
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,530
And who knows how many guys HR has hiding in the shadows?

280
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,650
So we wait until sunup.

281
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,800
Less likely they'll risk taking a shot at us in broad daylight.

282
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,270
Still haven't learned yet, have you?

283
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,590
There's no place you can hide, no place my men won't f-

284
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,640
What was that? A sedative... I think.

285
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,220
Any ideas where to put him?

286
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,750
Let the man rest in peace.

287
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,180
See, I told you we'd have you screaming. Where is the safe deposit box?

288
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,960
Just tell him, get it over with.

289
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,290
That the best you got?

290
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,650
No.

291
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,130
You know us, Lionel. It's gonna get so much worse.

292
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,740
What are you gonna do, read some more fortune cookies?

293
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,260
Bore me to death?

294
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,560
See, that's the problem with you, Fusco.

295
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,060
You never listen. It's like talking to a child.

296
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,620
You have a kid, don't you?

297
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,920
What's the little guy's name? Lee.

298
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,020
I feel sorry for that kid, I do.

299
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,220
He's got defective genes, just like you.

300
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,500
You touch him, and I'll send you to hell.

301
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,610
Is that a promise? Huh?

302
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,470
Because when I make a promise, I keep it.

303
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,870
Where's the safe deposit box? Which bank?

304
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,550
Or I kill you and your kid.

305
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,360
You know what?

306
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,070
Put the kid out of his misery before he turns out like his old man.

307
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,710
Okay, okay, okay!

308
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,630
Bank's in Hoboken, Jefferson and 9th,

309
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,200
but it won't be open this time of night.

310
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,100
Oh, they'll be open for me.

311
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,670
Sit on the kid while I get a warrant, make sure he's telling the truth.

312
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,150
Keep an eye on Detective Fusco.

313
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,550
What do you got? I got a line on the man in the suit.

314
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,020
Thought he gave us the slip. Then we saw this.

315
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,590
He's holed up with the stiffs in the City Morgue.

316
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,030
Good, saves us the trip. Rally the troops.

317
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,730
Care package for the road?

318
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,620
15 rounds, bone saw, scalpel, and some assorted tools.

319
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,440
You do realize we gotta kill HR before we can autopsy them.

320
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,770
Apply the right amount of force, this can do some damage.

321
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,650
Hezbollah surgeon. 2 more inches to the left,

322
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,700
would've cut right through my axillary artery.

323
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,810
Fallujah.

324
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,240
300-pound gorilla of a Marine escorting me.

325
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,630
One minute, we're walking on patrol, and the next, I hear a click.

326
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,840
Land mine?

327
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,660
Guy looked right into my eyes, then he was dust.

328
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,670
Never saw it coming.

329
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,130
When your time is up, it's up.

330
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,130
That was a close call. Yeah.

331
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,400
Was that your closest?

332
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,560
13 stitches. How'd the other guy fare?

333
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,870
Touch and go for a while.

334
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,000
It was a C-section. Taylor was breech.

335
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,760
Doctors weren't sure if he was gonna make it or not,

336
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,700
had to rush me into surgery.

337
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,190
It was the worst moment of my life,

338
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,190
followed by the best.

339
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,030
What about you, John? What was your closest?

340
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,110
That's got somebody's name on it?

341
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,600
Mine.

342
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,820
There was a time I thought about saying good-bye.

343
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,110
Lost someone.

344
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,930
Lost myself.

345
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,700
What happened? What stopped you?

346
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,250
I got in a fight with some punks on a subway.

347
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,210
Cop detained me.

348
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,120
He brought me to you.

349
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,590
You changed my mind, Joss.

350
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,030
You changed me.

351
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,590
<i>Mr. Reese, I have some alarming news.</i>

352
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,290
<i>I've been monitoring the police scanners.</i>

353
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,120
<i>Someone has reported suspicious activity at the morgue.</i>

354
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,580
I suggest you leave by the southwest emergency exit.

355
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,970
Doesn't look like we're gonna be leaving anytime soon.

356
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,930
We're surrounded.

357
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,140
Next, they'll lock down the building,

358
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,790
seal us off from witnesses, everyone.

359
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,840
<i>HR's moving in for the kill.</i>

360
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,710
Here we go.

361
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,390
You three, flush 'em out. Hey, what's going on?

362
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,640
We got some reports, some vandals have broken in the back, sir.

363
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,480
Reports? From who? It's just me.

364
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,450
Cuff him.

365
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Hey, you can't do that.

366
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,880
Make sure the rent-a-cop keeps his mouth shut,

367
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,490
and watch the front.

368
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,990
Think that'll hold 'em?

369
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,220
It's gonna have to.

370
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,870
Spread out. They're here somewhere.

371
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,060
Breakfast.

372
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,830
It's 4:00 in the morning.

373
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,480
I may not be back in time.

374
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,400
I may not be back at all.

375
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,140
I can't imagine what it must be like for you.

376
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,380
After all this time, to have to let go of your creation.

377
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,140
The machine is still sending us numbers, Ms. Groves.

378
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,990
I wasn't talking about the machine.

379
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,760
John. It's not too late.

380
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,120
<i>I can help you stop whatever's about to happen.</i>

381
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,500
Please let me help you.

382
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,480
Good-bye, Ms. Groves.

383
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,280
I understand.

384
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,100
I hope someday you'll trust me.

385
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,170
I'm so sorry for your loss, Harold.

386
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,500
Checked out the bank. Good news and bad news.

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,640
Bad news is Fusco lied. Good news is you get to kill him.

388
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,130
Sounds fun. What about the evidence?

389
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,610
We still have the key.

390
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,200
Only a matter of time before we find the right bank.

391
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,530
And the kid?

392
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,650
Look, I'll tell him where it's at, I swear.

393
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,520
Look who finally wants to talk.

394
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,580
You tell Fusco I made him a promise, and I keep my word.

395
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,280
Waste 'em both.

396
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,960
They're tossing rooms.

397
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,740
Won't be long until they find us.

398
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,940
Check the supply closet.

399
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,730
Might be some chemicals that'll come in handy.

400
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,190
John?

401
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,840
<i>John! John! Don't do this!</i>

402
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,690
I'm sorry, Joss, but I can't lose you. They'll kill you.

403
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,160
They'll try, I'm counting on it. Listen, I'm gonna draw them out.

404
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,270
<i>You make a run for it with Quinn.</i>

405
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,580
Anything happens to you,

406
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,440
I swear, I'll hate you forever.

407
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,110
You're stuck with me, remember?

408
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,230
<i>You make sure Quinn gets what he deserves.</i>

409
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,570
See you on the other side.

410
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,880
Hey, you got the kid?

411
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,190
Yeah, I got him.

412
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,710
<i>His piece-of-garbage dad lied.</i>

413
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,890
<i>You know what to do.</i>

414
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,480
I don't care what you do to me, just let my kid go.

415
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,400
Tell you what, I'll let you say your good-byes.

416
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,700
Put the kid on the line.

417
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,960
<i>Let Fusco listen in while you do it.</i>

418
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,190
Last words, make 'em count.

419
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,110
<i>Dad?</i>

420
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,250
Lee?

421
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,720
Lee... it's gonna be okay.

422
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm right here with you, okay? I'm right here with you.

423
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,250
Just close your eyes, all right?

424
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,270
I love you. It's gonna be okay.

425
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,910
<i>Lionel.</i>

426
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,710
It is gonna be okay.

427
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,520
Lee is fine, but the guy they sent to kill him isn't doing so good.

428
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,290
<i>Figured these scumbags would come after your kid.</i>

429
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,430
Thank you, thank you.

430
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,650
But, Lionel,

431
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,520
you understand this means I can't be there for you.

432
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,420
I had to choose.

433
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,880
Figured you'd want me to come here instead.

434
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,360
Yeah, you did good. You did good.

435
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm sorry, Lionel.

436
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,310
Looks like your fortune's run out.

437
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,470
Never did have very good luck.

438
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,090
Turns out neither did Officer Miller.

439
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,080
My friend killed him. My boy is fine.

440
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,580
Doesn't change your fate. I got a full mag.

441
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,460
The only question is where to shoot first? Ever kill someone, Petersen?

442
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,840
Not recently.

443
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,970
Can't take down a group of bent cops without having casualties.

444
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,630
Someone was always gonna end up in a casket.

445
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,810
Truth is, guys like you and me, we're all gonna catch a bullet sooner or later.

446
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,010
Best you can hope for is someone to hold your hand while you bleed out.

447
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,060
Oh, that's sweet. You want me to hold your hand, Fusco?

448
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,410
Oh, I forgot, we broke your fingers.

449
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,820
Yeah, you did.

450
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,400
Which made it no big deal for me to break my thumb.

451
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,010
Can I help you?

452
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,910
Officer Simmons said you might be in need of my assistance. Yeah? Who are you?

453
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm the guy that's gonna catch you when you fall.

454
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,150
Sorry, I'm not very good at this.

455
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,260
I know they're here. Find 'em!

456
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,890
There he is! Shoot him!

457
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,520
Son of a bitch.

458
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,270
Come on, come on. Follow me, damn it.

459
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,200
Finch, I'm out of bullets and out of time. Make sure Carter gets to safety.

460
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,800
<i>Will do, Mr. Reese.</i>

461
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,000
Detective Carter, the area is clear.

462
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,060
<i>You are free now to exit the building.</i>

463
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,580
Hey, wake up. We're checking out.

464
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,740
Come on.

465
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,540
Hold it right there!

466
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,870
Do you have a weapon, sir? Are you armed? <i>Mr. Reese, are you okay?</i>

467
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,360
Yes, I am.

468
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,650
Got a tip that a man matching your description was brandishing a weapon.

469
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,560
I somehow managed to locate two of NYPD's honest cops.

470
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,940
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i> <i>Anything you say can be held against you.</i>

471
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,900
Do you understand? <i>I assumed you'd prefer incarceration to death.</i>

472
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,020
I do, and thanks.

473
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,220
You'll never get a conviction, not in my city.

474
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,060
This used to be your city. Not anymore.

475
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,490
Officer Carter. This is Alonzo Quinn.

476
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,860
<i>New York City's Police Department</i> <i>has been rocked this morning</i>

477
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,950
<i>with the arrest of Alonzo Quinn.</i>

478
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,940
<i>Alonzo Quinn has been booked</i> <i>on suspicion of being the ringleader of HR.</i>

479
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,730
<i>Police are still searching for Officer Patrick Simmons,</i>

480
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,530
who they believe is Quinn's second-in-command.

481
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,990
Congratulations, Detective.

482
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,400
It is Detective again, isn't it? Can't say I miss the uniform.

483
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,940
It seems John Doe is being held at the Third Precinct.

484
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,090
My lawyers are trying to extricate him.

485
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,920
Let's just hope John can stay out of trouble for a long while.

486
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,750
Or has your computer told you otherwise?

487
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,680
What did you say?

488
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,450
How else could you know when someone's about to be in trouble?

489
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,450
I just figured you built some sort of supercomputer

490
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,600
that can siphon information from government feeds.

491
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,990
I'm impressed.

492
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,670
I am a Detective.

493
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,100
Speaking of which, duty calls.

494
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,710
I'll drop by the Third, make sure our friend gets released.

495
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,740
I'd appreciate that, Joss.

496
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,100
Shouldn't you be at work? Nice to talk to you too.

497
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,530
<i>I'll be in later. Keep my seat warm.</i>

498
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,520
And, uh, nice to have you back, partner.

499
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,290
Glad to be back. I'll see you soon.

500
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,560
Chip off the old block, huh? Looks like he's doing okay.

501
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,330
You, on the other hand, look like crap.

502
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,870
Heard you took a bullet.

503
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,790
Yeah, stupid bastard shot me where I had plenty of padding.

504
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,370
Would've gone for the head shot myself.

505
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,700
Course, you got plenty of padding there too.

506
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

507
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,930
Thank you, truly.

508
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,800
Shut up and drive, Lionel.

509
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm Carter. You didn't give us a name.

510
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,960
Seems like the only time you need a name now is when you're in trouble.

511
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,680
So...

512
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,750
am I in trouble?

513
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,430
Got your man locked up, Carter. Must feel good.

514
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,690
Not all of them.

515
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,540
Still haven't been able to locate our pal Simmons.

516
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,040
Can't hide forever. We'll get him.

517
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,720
All right, where's my weapon? John Doe didn't have a permit.

518
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,910
Your gun's property of the NYPD now.

519
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,770
Time I got some new hardware. Looks like your ride is here.

520
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,390
Guess we were all worried about you.

521
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,690
If my number was up,

522
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm just glad I was with you.

523
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,160
No one I'd rather be with at the end.

524
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,220
<i>Your time's up.</i> Told you I'd end you.

525
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,480
No, not today!

526
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,270
Joss, Joss, I'm here.

527
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,880
It's okay.

528
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,740
I need- I need to see my boy.

529
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,650
I need to tell him- And you will, and you will.

530
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,170
Just stay with me.

531
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,030
Promise me you'll look in on him.

532
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,000
I won't have to 'cause you're gonna make it, okay?

533
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,980
Promise me you'll tell him.

534
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,620
He knows, Joss.

535
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,540
He knows.

536
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,510
John...

537
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,280
don't let this-

538
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,050
Joss-

539
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,260
