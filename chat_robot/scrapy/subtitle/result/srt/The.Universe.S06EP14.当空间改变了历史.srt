1
00:00:00,388 --> 00:00:02,597
混沌初世，一片黑暗
male narraor: In the beginning, there was darkness,

2
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:04,291
接着，发生爆炸
and then, bang,

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:07,375
产生了无边无际的
giving birth to an endless expanding existence

4
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,347
时间、空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:13,486
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,958
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the ind-blowing, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:19,027
它就是宇宙
of a place we call The Universe.

8
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,930
彗星撞击海洋导致了
Did a comet slamming into the ocean

9
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:25,263
圣经所说的大洪水？
cause the biblical flood?

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,263
海啸引发的波浪至少有50米高
- The tsunami wave itself was at least 50 meters high.

11
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,399
一个太空火球
narrator: Did a fiery messenger from space

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,569
逆转了基督教的命运？
reverse the fate of Christianity?

13
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,177
一颗时速70,000英里的流星
- Suddenly, at 70,000 miles per hour,

14
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,964
突如其来地撞向地球
this meteor comes crashing to Earth.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,701
天空中的火球
narrator: Did a fireball in the sky

16
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:44,416
彻底摧毁了最早的北美居民？
wipe out the first North Americans?

17
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:48,193
太空确实是一次次地改变了历史
- Space literally has changed history time and time again.

18
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,791
一个独立的科研小组正在展开研究....
narrator: A maverick group of scientists is on a quest...

19
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,883
超巨型彗星的撞击
- Very large comet impacts

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,499
改变了人类文明的发展方向
could have changed the course of human civilization.

21
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,929
反主流科学的研究
narrator: A quest to defy mainstream science

22
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,860
证明了人类历史
and prove that human history

23
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:06,124
因为从天而降的灾难
was rocked with catastrophic moments,

24
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:09,790
而被改变
when space changed history.

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,651
40天40夜的滂沱大雨
40 days and 40 nights of torrential rains.

28
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:32,582
圣经的大洪水故事和吉尔伽美什史诗
The Bible's great flood and the Epic of Gilgamesh

29
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:35,293
都描述到一个广为人知的
are widespread myths that depict an event

30
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,592
人类遭到彻底灭绝的神话
that wiped humanity off the face of the Earth.

31
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,637
这只是一个神话
But was it simply a myth,

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,637
还是确有其事？
or did it really happen?

33
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:49,956
假如真是如此，科学家又如何去解释它呢？
And if so, how can science explain such a catastrophe?

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,776
没有任何理由能说明，超巨型彗星撞击
- There's no reason that very large comet impacts

35
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:01,956
在过去的15,000年间不会出现
could not have occurred during the last 15,000 years.

36
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,762
它应当发生过
And there could have been, even,

37
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,164
甚至还引发了全球性的灾难
a globally catastrophic event

38
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:10,248
改变了人类的发展进程
that could have changed the course of human civilization.

39
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:14,914
考古学家布鲁斯.马赛
narrator: Archeologist Bruce Masse

40
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:18,123
参加了由特立独行的科学家所组成的
is a member of a small group of maverick scientists

41
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:22,081
“全新世撞击工作组”
called the Holocene Impact Working Group.

42
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:25,371
“全新世”是地质术语，用于表示
It's named for the Holocene Epoch,

43
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:28,525
从10,000年前开始的地质时期
which began 10,000 years ago.

44
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:31,928
马赛的组织让天文学领域躁动不已
His group has roiled the world of astronomy

45
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,401
因为它宣称灾难性的撞击
by claiming that catastrophic impacts

46
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:37,497
远比人们想象的要频繁得多
have occurred much more often than supposed

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,428
并因此改变了人类的历史进程
and have actually changed the course of human history.

48
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:52,886
大洪水就是例证
Case in point: the great flood.

49
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,747
圣经的诺亚方舟故事
The biblical story of Noah's ark

50
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:02,386
只是全世界众多的古神话
is simply one version of an ancient story that's found in dozens of myths and legends

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,955
其中的一个版本
across the globe.

52
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,802
我曾经潜心去
- What I decided to do is to take a look

53
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,524
研究世界各地的洪水神话
at this worldwide distribution of flood myths, take a sample of those myths,

54
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:17,608
并收集了175个地方的相关传说
and the sample I selected was 175 locations from across the world.

55
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,189
这些洪水神话
narrator: Most of these flood myths

56
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,863
绝大多数惊人地相似
contain striking similarities,

57
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,952
都有描述到
including the common legend

58
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,191
洪水发生之前
that just before the flood began,

59
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,538
一个拖着大尾巴的天外之物
a celestial creature with impressive tails,

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,718
横过天空
raced across the sky.

61
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:41,316
他们没有科学的彗星知识
- Since they didn't have a science to understand what comets were all about,

62
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,171
就理所当然地去解释
they would try to come up with a natural solution.

63
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:48,232
因此，彗星有可能被当成了蛇
So therefore, a comet might be a snake.

64
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,100
众所周知，彗星有尾巴
narrator: Comets are known to have tails.

65
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:56,315
它带来了另外两个作用：
The visible effect of two byproducts:

66
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,186
尘埃反射阳光
dust reflecting sunlight

67
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,829
并产生电离气体
and glowing ionized gases

68
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:05,315
气体在后面咆哮着，如同喷气式飞机的凝结尾
roaring off the back like jet contrails.

69
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,412
有趣的是
- Interestingly enough,

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,593
你能看到所谓的“逆向彗尾”
you can actually have what's called an anti-tail,

71
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:12,176
从我们的角度看，彗尾就好象是
where, from our point of view, it looks like the tail of the comets

72
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,912
朝着两个完全不同的方向
are actually pointing in two totally different directions.

73
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,084
太阳散发的辐射
So as solar radiation streams off of our sun,

74
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,676
把物质从彗星里蒸发出来
it tends to make the material that's evaporating off of the comet

75
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,871
朝太阳方向伸展
appear to recede away from the Sun.

76
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:28,009
在地球上的某些地方会观察到
narrator: As seen from certain spots on the Earth,

77
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:30,809
尘埃尾巴有时会弯成弧形
the dust tail can sometimes curve around

78
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:34,148
因此它似乎是反向的
so that it appears to point in the opposite direction.

79
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,551
所以，地球上的观察者
- So observers on Earth

80
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,946
会见到一个物体
would see an object

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,520
它看起来好象是头戴饰物
in which it looked like there was a head with a headdress

82
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,226
或者是头上有角
or a horn coming out of its head.

83
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:51,159
在北美和南美的神话中
In North American mythology, South American mythology,

84
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:53,898
它是一条头上长角的蛇
it's a serpent with a horn on it's head.

85
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,856
在印度，它是一条头上有巨角的鱼
In Hindu, it's a fish with a giant horn on it's head.

86
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,967
在大多数神话中，随之而来的是
narrator: In most myths, the creature's arrival

87
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:05,840
一场几乎彻底毁灭世界的
was followed by a watery disaster

88
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,134
洪水灾难
that almost destroyed the world.

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,184
仔细审视这个神话
- If you look at other aspects of this mythology,

90
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:17,377
你会发现，它讲述的是黑暗、飓风级的强风
it's talking about, then, darkness, hurricane-force winds.

91
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,562
还有滂沱大雨
It's talking about torrential rainfall.

92
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:20,995
以及海啸
Talking about tsunamis.

93
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,606
现在，如果把所有信息叠加在一起...
Now, if you add all of that information together...

94
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,240
这就说明
These are the properties that you would get

95
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:34,912
彗星曾深度撞击海洋
from a deep water ocean impact of a comet.

96
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,258
如果一颗彗星曾撞击海洋
- If a comet were to strike in the open ocean,

97
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:47,469
巨大的能量会转移到
you would really get a massive amount of energy

98
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,063
撞击地点的海水
delivered into that part of the ocean that it hit.

99
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,724
巨量的水
narrator: The amount of water

100
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,869
会注入到大气层
injected into the atmosphere would be colossal.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,188
在铁匠铺的锻造车间里
- We're here visiting a forge in a blacksmith shop

102
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,758
我们将演示
to show what would happen when a comet comes in

103
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,527
彗星以高速撞击海洋
at high speeds and impacts the ocean,

104
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,385
传递全部动能到水里的情形
delivering all that kinetic energy into the water.

105
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:19,091
锻造车间通常
narrator: A typical forge can heat carbon steel

106
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:23,007
把碳钢加热到大约华氏2,200度
to approximately 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit.

107
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,882
但彗星超高速袭击
But a hypervelocity comet strike

108
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:30,327
所产生的是10,000度以上的冲击温度
will produce shock temperatures well over 10,000 degrees,

109
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,938
比太阳表面更热
hotter than the surface of the Sun.

110
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,263
太空来的彗星
- A comet coming in from outer space

111
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,402
会携带着巨大的动能
would be carrying with it an immense amount of kinetic energy

112
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,890
因为它是以极端速度移动的
because it's moving at such an extreme velocity.

113
00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,178
当它撞击海洋
When that impacts the ocean,

114
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:49,610
能量使水蒸发
that energy is capable of vaporizing

115
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,530
涉及面积达数百平方公里
up to hundreds of square kilometers of water,

116
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:56,063
因而大量水蒸汽进入到外层大气中
sending plumes of steam up into the outer atmosphere.

117
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,910
高空大气通常只有大约0.5%的水汽
- Normally, in the upper atmosphere, there's only about a half a percent of water vapor.

118
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:09,298
现在却注入了总量惊人的新水汽
So you get this injection of this large amount of new water vapor.

119
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,812
随着被注入大气层的巨量的水倾泻下来
narrator: As the massive infusion of water into the atmosphere rains down,

120
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,409
地球就会下起长达数周或数月的
a global deluge could drown the Earth

121
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,771
全球性暴雨
for weeks or months.

122
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,983
布鲁斯.马赛认为
Bruce Masse believed he had found

123
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,215
自己发现了世界大洪水的可能原因...
a possible source of the worldwide flood myth...

124
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,312
超级彗星的侵袭
A massive comet strike.

125
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,867
但他缺少物理证据
But he lacked the physical evidence.

126
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:53,381
哥伦比亚大学地质学家达拉丝.艾博特
Columbia University geologist Dallas Abbott

127
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,617
调查着可能的宇宙弹坑
investigates potential cosmic craters.

128
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,145
布鲁斯.马赛收集了
- Bruce Masse had compiled

129
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:03,809
一套口述资料
a set of oral histories of catastrophic events

130
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:06,183
听起来象是宇宙撞击引发的灾难
that sounded like they were some sort of cosmic impact,

131
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,684
而且他发现它们的中心
and he found that the center of them

132
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:08,902
在印度洋
was around the Indian Ocean.

133
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,155
通过实际探测水深
narrator: Using bathymetry readings,

134
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:17,203
以及用卫星对洋底深度的变化进行测量
or satellite measurements of depth variations in the ocean floor,

135
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,458
艾博特精确定位了可能的撞击区域
Abbott was able to pinpoint a potential impact zone.

136
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:24,910
她把它命名为“伯克尔弹坑”
She named it Burkle crater,

137
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,898
以此向同校的一位同事致敬
in honor of a colleague at Columbia University.

138
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,605
巨大的伯克尔弹坑
Burkle is a massive depression

139
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,594
位于离马达加斯加海岸
located nearly 1,000 miles

140
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,803
大约1,000英里的地方
off the coast of Madagascar...

141
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:40,394
它的直径约为18英里
About 18 miles in diameter,

142
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,180
深约13,000英尺
Burkle Crater lies at a depth of approximately 13,000 feet,

143
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:50,556
难于开展大规模的研究，而且费用会很昂贵
making an extensive study difficult and expensive.

144
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,049
这样巨大的弹坑
But a crater this big

145
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:57,076
必然会产生超级彗星撞击的另一个影响
would produce another logical fingerprint of a massive comet impact:

146
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:00,036
超级海啸
a mega-tsunami.

147
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,438
彗星撞击海洋比撞击结实的地面
- A comet hitting the ocean would actually be more damaging

148
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,544
所产生的危害更大
than a comet hitting solid ground.

149
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,585
因为它会掀起排山倒海的海啸
And that's because it would send up a gigantic tsunami

150
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,493
猛烈撞击海岸周围的一切
that would slam into the coast all around it.

151
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:21,146
当超级海啸攻击海岸线
narrator: When massive tsunamis strike shorelines,

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,733
其迹象会保留数个世纪
the evidence can persist for centuries.

153
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,455
艾博特把注意力转移到马达加斯加的海岸线上
Abbott turned her attention to the shoreline of Madagascar.

154
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:38,335
在那段时间，我在马达加斯加一无所获
- At the time, I couldn't get data on Madagascar.

155
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,922
但随着谷歌地球的面世
But the minute Google Earth came out,

156
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,124
我立即前往马达加斯加考察
I went and I looked at Madagascar.

157
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:46,724
那里的海啸印记相当明显
And the tsunami deposits there were phenomenal.

158
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,964
我很直接地发现了
I immediately found these huge chevrons,

159
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:53,457
这些或许是世上最大的波浪印记
which I think are probably the biggest chevrons on the planet.

160
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,673
波浪印记是对称的沙丘
narrator: Chevrons are symmetrical sand dunes

161
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,686
分布在世界各地的海岸线上
found along coastlines around the world.

162
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:04,134
有人认为它们是在巨大的波浪
Some believe they form when massive waves

163
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,072
猛烈撞击海岸，然后退去时形成的
slam into the coast and then recede.

164
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,474
其独特的V字形
Their distinctive V shape

165
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:12,328
指明了波浪的方向
may even serve as a directional marker.

166
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:14,674
后向角是一个V字
- The back azimuth is a V.

167
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,008
这里是内陆，V字指向内陆
So this is inland. V points inland.

168
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,194
V字的后向角
The back azimuth of the V,

169
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,914
告诉你原因在哪里
that tells you where the source is.

170
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,690
艾博特声称原因就是
narrator: Abbott claims that source is Burkle crater,

171
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,996
离海岸数百英里的伯克尔弹坑
located hundreds of miles offshore.

172
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,204
但其它人质疑
But others doubt that tsunamis

173
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,983
海啸与波浪印记的关系
have anything to do with chevron formation.

174
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,844
许多地质学家
- The geologists that actually go to the sites

175
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,172
前来实地调查，仔细地考察
and do fieldwork and have looked at these,

176
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,674
他们认为这些与海啸无关
they don't associate those with tsunami.

177
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,705
只是与扬尘有关
They associate those with windblown dust.

178
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,766
因此我怀疑这些
And so I'm skeptical that these things

179
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,080
与海啸的波浪是否有关联
have anything to do with tsunami waves.

180
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,680
但当达拉丝.艾博特来到马达加斯加
narrator: But when Dallas Abbott traveled to Madagascar,

181
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:05,189
她在沙丘内找到了惊人的证据
she found surprising evidence trapped inside the dunes.

182
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:10,362
我们发现海啸沉淀超过200米高
- We found tsunami deposits over 200 meters high.

183
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,042
在这个大土坡的顶上
And when we got to the top of this big hill,

184
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:16,616
我们在沉积物中发现海产品的化石
we found marine fossils in the sediment.

185
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:19,804
在所有我们寻找过的地方
And we found it in all of the locations

186
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,231
都能发现它
where we looked.

187
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,468
飓风只能带来
Hurricanes bring in marine microfossils.

188
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:26,056
在水面生活的
But they only bring the kind

189
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,671
海产品的微化石
that live in the top of the water column,

190
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,263
但在海底生活的
whereas the kind of marine microfossils

191
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,900
海产品的微化石
that live on the ocean bottom,

192
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,140
不会因飓风之类的原因而移动
they don't get transported by things like hurricanes.

193
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:39,820
马达加斯加的化石
Well, the Madagascar fossils are dominated

194
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,753
由海底的海产品所形成
by the ones that live on the bottom.

195
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,273
因此，它们毫无疑问地不是风刮来的
And so they absolutely can't be just windblown fossils.

196
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,968
对全新世小组的成员来说
narrator: For members of the Holocene group,

197
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,155
波浪印记和微化石
the chevrons and the microfossil evidence

198
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:58,075
就是确凿的证据
are the smoking gun.

199
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,043
把它们与世界各地的
When connected to the flood myths

200
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,584
大洪水古神话联系起来
of ancient societies around the world,

201
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,344
呈现出来的是一幅扣人心弦的景象
they help paint a compelling picture.

202
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,010
“洪水-彗星”假说
But the flood-comet hypothesis

203
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,786
与许多天文学家固有的信念相抵触
contradicts the firm beliefs of many astronomers.

204
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,652
宇宙撞击天文学家们，比如马克・博斯劳
Cosmic impact astronomers like Mark Boslough

205
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:25,116
就认为灾难性的撞击
believe that catastrophic impacts

206
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,574
在过去的15,000年间
during the last 15,000 years

207
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,214
根本没有发生过
simply never happened.

208
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:33,934
声称在全新世期间，在人类历史上，
- Anybody who would claim that there have been

209
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,948
发生过大规模破坏环境的撞击
environmentally damaging impacts during the Holocene,

210
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,801
的那些人有强烈的责任
during the era of humans,

211
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:41,086
来进行举证
has a very high burden of proof

212
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,950
因为这样的事情
because the probability that such a thing

213
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,403
哪怕只发生一次，可能性也很小
even once would have happened is very small.

214
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:50,536
我的回答是，特别的主张
- The response has been that extraordinary claims

215
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,443
需要有特别的证据
require extraordinary evidence,

216
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,724
没有人会相信那是一个撞击坑
because nobody believes that an impact crater is confirmed

217
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,645
除非你在那里
until you actually go to the crater

218
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,685
能找到撞击熔体的样本
and you've got samples of the impact melt body.

219
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:04,232
我们现在还没有
We still, at the moment,

220
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,138
获得证明伯克尔弹坑的证据
don't have the evidence to prove Burkle Crater.

221
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,489
与此同时
narrator: In the meantime,

222
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,620
全新世撞击工作组认为
the Holocene Impact Working Group

223
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:15,607
它已经找到了年代更近的证据
believes it has found evidence of a far more recent impact.

224
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,244
这个证据
The evidence, they say,

225
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,127
就埋在格陵兰岛的雪层下
lies buried in the ice sheets of Greenland.

226
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,942
这个证据表明，是一颗彗星
And, they say it points to a comet

227
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:28,542
把欧洲推进了野蛮黑暗的
that helped push Europe into the barbarism

在公元535年的某个时候
Sometime in the year 535 A.D.,

234
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
某些物体有如灰色的面纱
something descended like a gray veil

笼罩着整个地球
over planet Earth.

236
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,258
它让地球进入了近2,000年以来
It created the most severe cooling period

237
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,668
最寒冷的时期
of the last 2,000 years

238
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:14,718
使人类陷入了前所未有的危机
and plunged humanity into an unprecedented crisis.

239
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,221
在那期间
- During that time period,

240
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,484
非常非常多的灰
a very, very large quantity of ash

241
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,022
严严实实地掩盖着地球
completely enshrouds the Earth.

242
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,521
它阻止了阳光的照射
It cuts sunlight off from crops
that are growing on the ground.

243
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,404
耕地里的庄稼纷纷死去
It kills off crops that are under cultivation.

244
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:32,899
它导致了饥荒
It leads to famine because it interrupts

245
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,326
当时人类社会的粮食生产

无法得到保障
that were present on the planet at the time.

247
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:42,979
据历史记载，那是在公元536年初
- We know from historical data that starting early in 536 A.D.,

248
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:45,297
太阳变得非常昏暗
the Sun became very dim.

249
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,590
在美索不达米亚，太阳持续18个月昏暗
And in Mesopotamia, the sun was dim for 18 months.

250
00:14:49,794 --> 00:14:51,633
在那个时期里
And they said that during that time period,

251
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,541
太阳每天只出现4个小时
the Sun came out for about four hours a day.

树木年轮清楚表明

257
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,959
在六世纪有一段时期
that there was a period in the sixth century

those nutrients dwindled down to a very, very low level.

261
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:32,262
因此树轮极其紧密地靠在一起
And so the tree rings are extremely close together.

00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:12,553
位于澳大利亚的卡奔塔利亚湾
is located in Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria.

272
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,339
我查看了
- I looked in satellite altimetry

273
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,181
该处的卫星图
for something in that part of the gulf,

274
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,728
上面的波浪印记指向一个很小的区域
because the chevrons were pointing to a very, very small area.

275
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:27,742
我立即发现海底的这两个圆坑
And immediately, I found these two round holes in the bottom of the gulf.

276
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,942
经过测量
narrator: The craters measured

277
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:34,637
弹坑的直径分别为7英里和11英里
7 and 11 miles in diameter, respectively.

278
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,717
对沉积物的详细研究表明
A detailed study of sediments

279
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,064
其与外星侵袭有关
pointed to an extraterrestrial invader.

280
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:48,264
这一个深海矿样
- This is a deep sea core sample,

281
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,707
与卡奔塔利亚湾的相同
like the ones we studied in the Gulf of Carpentaria.

282
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,676
在我们筛选卡奔塔利亚湾的样品时
And when we sieved the Gulf of Carpentaria samples,

283
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,772
我们发现少量的岩石
we found little bits of rock,

284
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,892
少量的玻璃
we found little bits of glass,

285
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,386
以及一些惊人的矿物
and we also found some shock minerals.

286
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,241
并伴有许多的撞击迹象
And together, these are indications of an impact.

287
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:09,828
它们说明了事件大约发生在1,500年前
And they suggested the event was about 1,500 years ago.

288
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:14,708
所以我认为事件是在公元536年发生
And I knew about this climate event in 536 A.D.

289
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,609
我心想，“如果从冰芯里”
And I thought, "Well, it would be really nice

290
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,963
“能找到一些东西，那就太好了”
to look at an ice core to see if we can see something."

291
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:29,152
冰芯是冷藏地球气候数据的“档案柜”
narrator: An ice core is planet Earth's frozen filing cabinet of climate data,

292
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,778
蕴藏着数世纪的空气微粒和藻类
trapping centuries' worth of airborne particles and algae.

293
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,565
在远离卡奔塔利亚湾的
- We found samples from Greenland,

294
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:42,272
格陵兰岛上
which is about as far away as you can get on the planet

295
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:44,900
我们收集了许多样本
from that site in the Gulf of Carpentaria.

296
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,554
冰芯提供了惊人的证据
narrator: The ice cores yielded startling evidence,

297
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:55,514
包括和卡奔塔利亚湾一模一样的
including magnetized melted rock called spherules

298
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:59,262
磁性熔岩球体
that matched those retrieved in the Gulf of Carpentaria,

299
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:05,542
两种在高能撞击中形成的玻璃
two types of glass that appear to have formed in a high-energy impact,

300
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,996
以及一种不应该出现的
and a misplaced diatom,

301
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,172
只存于热带地区的硅藻海微化石
a marine microfossil that exists only in the tropics.

302
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,704
生长在热带到亚热带的硅藻
- So why should you be getting diatoms

303
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:22,329
为什么在格陵兰岛
that originated in the tropics to subtropics

304
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,051
各处都能发现？
all the way to Greenland?

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,470
没有人能够给出
Nobody has ever found diatoms in Greenland

306
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,348
个中原因
that came from the tropics to subtropics.

307
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,829
这些显微镜下的证据
narrator: The microscopic evidence

308
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,607
指向了外星的撞击
pointed to a celestial impact.

309
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,968
情况就是，一场大爆炸
- What happens is, you get a huge explosion,

310
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,825
把这些物质被抛进大气
and then this material goes up into the air

311
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,037
飘到数百甚至数千公里之外
and travels for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers.

312
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,047
最后沉降下来
And then it's- you know, settles out.

313
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,342
对宇宙撞击来说
narrator: For a cosmic impactor

314
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:01,981
要产生相似于公元535年的
to create a global atmospheric effect

315
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:06,134
那一次全球性大气影响
like the one suspected in 535 A.D.,

316
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,055
撞击物必须有足够的质量和速度
it must have enough mass and velocity

317
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,898
才能产生巨大的爆炸
to create an epic explosion.

318
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,259
高速和低速撞击，它们的区别在于
- The difference between a high-velocity and a low-velocity impact

319
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:20,495
低速撞击不产生爆炸
is, a low velocity impact does not create an explosion.

320
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,453
它会产生一个弹坑
It can make a crater,

321
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:25,050
但不是爆裂弹坑
but it's not an explosion crater.

322
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,578
我们现在要模拟
What we're doing here is setting up

323
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,878
超高速撞击
to do a simulation of a hypervelocity impact

324
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,758
形成弹坑的情形
in the formation of a crater.

325
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,879
我们用硝酸铵混合燃油
And we're using ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil,

326
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:41,423
当点燃它时
so when we set it off,

327
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,189
它会爆炸并产生一个大坑
it's gonna explode and make a huge crater.

328
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:56,133
巨大的爆炸使得大量碎屑纷纷扬扬地
It's a massive explosion that creates a big plume of debris

329
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,979
散落到了周围几英里的地方
that gets scattered for many, many miles around.

330
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,411
如果这是最极端的撞击，将是全球性的事件
And for the biggest impacts, it's a global phenomenon.

331
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,397
假如这个弹坑是撞击形成的
If this crater had been actually formed by an impact,

332
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,577
它会是爆裂性的弹坑
it would be an explosion crater,

333
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,490
因为来自天空的物体
because the object coming from the sky

334
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,647
速度极快，动能极高
is going so fast with so much kinetic energy

335
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,758
它会穿入地表
that it penetrates below the surface

336
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,258
然后变热、汽化和爆炸
and heats up, vaporizes, and explodes.

337
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:26,591
发生在澳大利亚浅水区的高速撞击
narrator: A high-velocity strike in the shallow waters off Australia

338
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:28,716
其爆炸威力之大
could have produced an explosion

339
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:32,554
足以将沉淀物和微粒
large enough to launch sediments and particulates

340
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,271
抛入大气层
high into the atmosphere.

341
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:39,216
抛起的高度非常高
- You can imagine that that'll get kicked up really high

342
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,549
大量的颗粒物质上升到了
and that you'll have a lot of particulate matter

343
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:42,901
高层大气里
up in the high atmosphere,

344
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,864
可谓是遮天蔽日
where it can block out a lot of the sun.

345
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:50,882
公元535年的惨剧
narrator: The disastrous events of 535 A.D.

346
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,160
看起来象是撞击惹的祸
seem to fit the signature of an impact

347
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,757
造成太阳昏暗
followed by a dimming of the sun.

348
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,229
但在论证
But finding the proof

349
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,715
一切皆因宇宙撞击而起
that it all started with a cosmic impact

350
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:04,340
这一观点的时候
is more difficult,

351
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,271
有一个问题成了主要的拦路虎
especially when one glaring question remains.

352
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,229
巨大的太空岩石
What massive space rock

353
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:14,687
能产生并排在一起的
could produce two craters

354
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,479
两个弹坑吗？
side by side?

355
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:24,257
他们被主流的天文学术界视为另类分子
They are considered heretics in the mainstream world of astronomy.

356
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,007
但全新世撞击工作组的科学家们
But the scientists belonging to the Holocene Impact Working Group

357
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,882
仍在不屈不挠地
are determined to prove

358
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,007
去证明太空改变过人类历史
that space has changed human history.

359
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:43,173
公元535年也许会发生这样的事件
One such event may have happened in the year 535 A.D.,

360
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,631
太阳骤然昏暗
when a sudden darkening of the sun

361
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,673
庄稼失收
caused crops to fail,

362
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,930
全球陷入饥荒
leading to worldwide famine.

363
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:55,631
树轮数据证明了惨剧曾经上演
Scientific tree ring data proves the catastrophe happened.

364
00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:00,395
但科学家尚未找出幕后黑手
But science has yet to determine what actually caused it.

365
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,437
在2008年，宇宙撞击研究者达拉丝.艾博特
In 2008, cosmic impact researcher Dallas Abbott

366
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:10,868
发现了澳大利亚卡奔塔利亚湾的
discovered what appeared to be two huge craters

367
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,339
两个巨大弹坑
in Australia 's Gulf of Carpentaria.

368
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,895
她认为这是彗星造成的
She believes they were put there by a comet.

369
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,922
主流观点认为撞击非常罕见
- Well, the mainstream idea is that impacts are very rare

370
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,259
而且大多数的撞击是小行星引发的
and that most of the impacts that happen are asteroidal.

371
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:30,214
但我们收集的资料认为
But the data that we're finding suggest

372
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:32,019
这是彗星撞击
that the impactors that hit were cometary

373
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,478
不是行星撞击
rather than asteroids.

374
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:40,186
由岩石、气体、尘埃和冰构成的彗星
narrator: Composed of rock, gases, dust, and ice,

375
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,769
在突然遭遇到
comets are known to break apart

376
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:44,981
地球这样的大物体时
when they encounter the gravitational pull

377
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,589
会由于万有引力而支离破碎
of large objects like planets.

378
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,630
1992年7月，哈勃太空望远镜
In July of 1992, the Hubble Space Telescope

379
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:56,450
刚好拍摄到这样的情形
recorded exactly this scenario.

380
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:03,005
苏梅克-列维九号彗星经过木星的时候
As comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hurtled past Jupiter,

381
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,957
木星强大的万有引力
the planet's immense gravitational pull

382
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,838
把彗星撕碎
tore the comet apart.

383
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,824
苏梅克-列维九号彗星
- Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

384
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:14,005
破裂成好几块
broke up into several dozen fragments,

385
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:17,658
其爆炸威力相当于
the most massive of which created an explosion

386
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:22,033
6百万兆吨TNT炸药
equivalent to 6 million megatons of TNT.

387
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:25,297
而现在地球上威力最大的
Now, the biggest bomb ever made on Earth

388
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,588
苏联“沙皇”核弹

389
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,446
其当量才50兆吨
which was 50 megatons.

390
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,352
苏梅克-列维九号的撞击
A single impact from Shoemaker-Levy 9

391
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:35,144
威力比“沙皇”大100,000多倍
was 100,000 times more powerful.

392
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,784

narrator: Could a Shoemaker-Levy 9 type breakup

393
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,338

397
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:06,149
彗星撞击相当罕见

每100万年到10亿年才发生一次

是否发生撞击的问题上
of an impact in the Gulf of Carpentaria

404
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:27,532
科学家一直争论不休
continues to generate scientific controversy.

405
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:35,462
但在撞击假说里，最具争议的问题却是
But no impact hypothesis is more controversial

406
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,642
到底是什么让著名的北美洲文明
than the question of what wiped a famed North American culture

407
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,969
从地球上彻底消失
from the pages of history.

408
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:47,004
在欧洲殖民者据为已有的1000年前
Millennia before European colonists claimed it as their own,

409
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:50,823
已经有移民居住在北美洲的克洛维斯
another group of immigrants dominated North America-

410
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,114
直到某些人或某些事情
that is, until someone or something

411
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,753
让他们永远消失
wiped out the Clovis people.

412
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,211
克洛维斯人是居住在北美洲的
- Clovis were an ancient Paleo-Indian people

413
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,578
史前古印第安人
that lived in North America.

414
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,711
有人认为他们是第一批北美洲居民
Some people believe that they were the first people to live in North America

415
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,414
他们越过白令陆桥而来
and that they came across the Bering Land Bridge

416
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:15,100
从美洲北部向南扩散
and radiated down into the Americas from the north, moving south.

417
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,392
考古文物
narrator: Archaeological evidence,

418
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,878
其中包括他们著名的矛
including their famed spear points,

419
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:27,253
揭示出克洛维斯人在上个大冰河时期的兴盛
reveals the Clovis people thrived during the last great ice age

420
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:29,322
他们能够捕猎大型动物
by hunting the megafauna,

421
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:32,475
包括猛玛象和乳齿象
including huge mammoths and mastodons.

422
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:37,753
在某一刻，美洲的大型动物种群
There was a moment where the population of the megafauna

423
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,819
突然变化
in the Americas changed.

424
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:42,530
大型动物忽然间灭绝了
The megafauna suddenly began to disappear.

425
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,127
与此同时
And as they went down,

426
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,002
克洛维斯人也消失了
they brought the Clovis down with them.

427
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:53,239
大约13,000年前
- Approximately 13,000 years ago,

428
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:55,447
发生了一些事情
something happened.

429
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,928
这些事情改变了环境
Something changed the environment.

430
00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:01,389
而且改变得很迅速，也很彻底
It changed it rapidly and profoundly.

431
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,002
整个地球
And all of a sudden,

432
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:07,488
突然间进入了小冰河时期
the planet was thrown back into a little ice age.

433
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:11,530
此次气候变化，被称为“新仙女木事件”
A climatic event we call the Younger Dryas.

434
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,321
在冰川消融和气温回升
narrator: After many thousands of years

435
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:18,349
持续数千年之后
of retreating glaciers and warming temperatures,

436
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,474
新仙女木期逆转了变暖的趋势
the Younger Dryas period reversed the warming trend

437
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,835
对人类和动物造成了极大的伤害
and wreaked havoc on man and beast.

438
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,285
科学家们激烈争论
But scientists argue fiercely

439
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,349
这次180度大转弯的个中原因
over the reasons for this climactic U-turn,

440
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:36,252
争论得特别激烈的是
especially one hypothesis

441
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,640
把责任全部归咎于外太空的假说
that places the blame squarely on outer space.

442
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:44,015
克洛维斯猎人
- The Clovis hunters

443
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,585
已经适应了新的居住环境
were having to adapt to new conditions.

444
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:51,812
彗星在劳伦泰冰原上空爆炸
And one of those changes could have been a comet impact

445
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,668
改变了他们的命运
over the Laurentide ice sheet.

446
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:58,946
“克洛维斯-彗星”假说
narrator: The Clovis comet

447
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,793
可能是全新世撞击工作组
is perhaps the most controversial impact hypothesis

448
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:06,598
最具争议的假说
championed by the Holocene Impact Working Group.

449
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,779
它声称彗星侵袭
It claims that a comet strike

450
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,869
北美洲冰原
into the North American ice sheet

451
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:15,696
使得巨量的内陆湖水涌入海洋
allowed large freshwater lakes to drain into the ocean,

452
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:18,321
使洋流变更
altering the ocean currents

453
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,904
并引发了寒冷的新仙女木期
and triggering the Younger Dryas cooling period.

454
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,223
肯.坦可斯里
Ken Tankersley,

455
00:27:28,431 --> 00:27:31,431
是辛辛那提大学的人类学家
a University of Cincinnati anthropologist,

456
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:35,897
曾在俄亥俄州西北部发现了
uncovered cosmic impact evidence in Sheriden Cave

457
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,973
谢里登洞穴
in northwest Ohio.

458
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:43,868
我们在这里发现了被称为黑团的层
- The layer which we found here is known as the black mat.

459
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,704
该层含有丰富的碳
It's a very carbon-rich layer,

460
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,973
那是剧烈燃烧形成的产物
which, in this case, is the result of intense burning.

461
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:55,038
它是由木炭和大约70种灰烬
It's composed of wood charcoal and the burned remains

462
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,664
所组成的
of approximately 70 species.

463
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,667
需要熊熊的大火、剧烈的燃烧
It takes an intense fire, an intense burning,

464
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,879
甚至爆炸
almost an explosion, if you will,

465
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,472
才能得到这种类型的碳
to produce this type of carbon event.

466
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,653
在该层中，还包含有流星碎片
narrator: The layer also contained meteor fragments.

467
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,309
对超级彗星撞击来说
But more importantly,

468
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:18,528
这似乎是不容质疑的有力证据
seemingly indisputable evidence for a larger cosmic impact.

469
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:23,375
我们在其中找到了冲击钻石
- We have what's called impact diamonds.

470
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,875
冲击钻石，也叫坠落钻石
Impact diamonds, or shatter diamonds,

471
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:29,889
是某种爆炸
occur when some type of explosion

472
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,944
或者是突然的迅猛撞击
or sudden impact occurs with your surface,

473
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,291
压缩碳物质而产生的
compressing carbon material to create these impact diamonds.

474
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,967
因为尺寸微小
narrator: Also called nanodiamonds

475
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,336
它们还被称为纳米钻石
because of their miniscule size,

476
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:48,486
是公认的宇宙撞击的强力证据
they are recognized as powerful evidence for cosmic impact.

477
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:53,095
但它们的发现引起了众多的疑问
But their discovery raises many more questions.

478
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,016
在北美洲发现的
- The supposed presence of nanodiamonds

479
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,249
纳米钻石并不是新仙女木撞击的
in certain locations of North America isn't compelling evidence

480
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,583
能令人信服的证据
for the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis,

481
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,263
因为在许多时候，确认不了这些就是
because in some cases, it's not even clear

482
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,235
真正的纳米钻石
that those are genuine nanodiamonds.

483
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,704
它们可能是仿似纳米钻石的
They may be graphite or graphene compounds

484
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,110
石墨或石墨烯复合物
that kind of masquerade as nanodiamonds.

485
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,971
“克洛维斯-彗星”的主张
narrator: The proposed Clovis comet

486
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:22,707
还似乎漏了一个物理上的大证据：
also appears to be missing one physically huge piece of evidence:

487
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,527
撞击弹坑
an impact crater.

488
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,068
迄今为止，还没有能说明问题的弹坑被发现
To date, no telltale crater has been found.

489
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,818
但太空岩石在撞击地球时
But space rocks don't have to impact the Earth

490
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,610
不一定会引发大灾难
to ignite a catastrophe.

491
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:46,398
因为这几乎无异于触发了
We know because one very nearly touched off

492
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:48,763
一场核战争
a thermonuclear war.

493
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:57,784
纵然遭到普遍的怀疑
In the face of widespread skepticism,

494
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,818
撞击研究小组还是坚信
a small group　of impact researchers claim

495
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:05,290
最近的宇宙大灾难
that very recent cosmic catastrophes

496
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,193
改变了人类历史
have changed human history.

497
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:15,561
在13,000年前的北美洲
13,000 years ago in North America,

498
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:18,956
某些事情突然把克洛维斯文化
something suddenly sent the Clovis culture

499
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:21,192
置于万劫不复的境地
into a tailspin.

500
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,345
一些科学家相信彗星是罪魁祸首
Some scientists believe that a comet was to blame.

501
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:31,887
但迄今为止，没有相应的撞击坑能得到确认
But to date, no impact crater has been identified.

502
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:36,803
事实上，相当多的天外之物永远到达不了地球
But some cosmic projectiles never reach the Earth.

503
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,720
因为它们会在堕落的过程中
Yet they can still rain down destruction

504
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,984
发生空中爆炸而灰飞烟灭
in the form of an air burst.

505
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,087
空中爆炸是流星和彗星
An air burst is when a meteoroid or a comet

506
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:51,553
在抵达地球之前
explodes in the atmosphere

507
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,484
在大气层中爆炸的现象
before reaching the Earth's surface.

508
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,011
所以不会产生弹坑
So it doesn't produce a visible crater.

509
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:58,720
1908年的通古斯事件
A truly excellent example of what is thought to have been an air burst

510
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,818
就是空中爆炸的经典例子
is the Tunguska event over Siberia in 1908.

511
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:08,985
它把2,000平方公里的森林夷为平地
It leveled 2,000 square kilometers of forest.

512
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,742
但是没有撞击坑
But there's no impact crater.

513
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:19,287
当彗星或小行星撞击地球的大气层
- When a comet or an asteroid hits the Earth's atmosphere,

514
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:23,579
就会产生一种很近似于船浪的冲击波
it actually creates a wave very much like the wave in front of a boat.

515
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,817
它使空气震荡
And that shockwave, the shocked air,

516
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:28,580
产生超高的温度并扩散
gets to super-high temperatures, and it radiates.

517
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:31,094
空气散发出光和红外辐射
It radiates light and infrared radiation.

518
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,009
然后加热彗星或者行星
And then that heats up the comet or asteroid

519
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,733
使之汽化
and causes it to vaporize.

520
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,302
即使是小如通古斯事件中的流星
narrator: Even a smaller Tunguska-sized meteor,

521
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,191
其直径只有大约200英尺或更大一点
around 200 or more feet in diameter,

522
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,872
但它空中爆炸的威力
can produce an air burst with 1,000 times more energy

523
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:51,219
比投在广岛的原子弹还大1,000倍
than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

524
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:58,830
在通古斯撞击的13,000年前
Some 13,000 years before the Tunguska impact,

525
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:00,407
克洛维斯的彗星
the Clovis comet

526
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,871
是会产生类似的空中爆炸
could have delivered a similar air burst.

527
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,288
但漫长的岁月
But the North American landscape

528
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,732
会把北美大地上的所有痕迹全部抹掉
would have long ago swallowed all traces.

529
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,580
无论那是彗星撞击地面
Whether it was a ground-impacting comet,

530
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,927
空中爆炸
an air burst,

531
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,982
或者都不是
or neither one,

532
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,621
该气候事件
this climatic event

533
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:26,177
以及它对克洛维斯文化的影响
and its effect on the Clovis culture

534
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,010
给后人留下了一个热议的话题
remain a hotly debated topic.

535
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,663
但解开这个谜团非常重要
But solving the mystery is crucial,

536
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,696
因为在今天也会几乎没有预警地
since the same thing could happen today

537
00:32:36,315 --> 00:32:37,996
发生同样的事
with little warning.

538
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:46,290
现在，假设象通古斯事件一样
- Now, an impact like the Tunguska event,

539
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,380
在当今纽约的上空
a 10-megaton air burst,

540
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,329
10兆吨当量的空中爆炸
say at 5,000 meters over New York City,

541
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:53,440
在5,000米处的地方发生
if that were to happen today,

542
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:57,260
就会导致将近2百万人死亡
would lead to the deaths of almost 2 million people,

543
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:59,849
另外有数百万人受伤
another several million people injured,

544
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:03,079
经济损失将高达数万亿元
and a couple of trillion dollars of damage.

545
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:06,189
所以，即使是小型的空中爆炸
So even air bursts, small events,

546
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:08,523
也极具毁灭性
are something that are very destructive.

547
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:14,198
在2002年爆炸的一颗小流星
narrator: In fact, they are so potentially destructive

548
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:18,148
就充分说明了它们潜在的毁灭性
that when a very small meteor exploded in 2002,

549
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:22,703
它会引发一场核战争
it could have sparked a thermonuclear war.

550
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,023
在2002年6月，发生了
- In June of 2002,

551
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,481
一个可能会严重改变地球历史的事件
an event occurred that could have changed history on Earth in a major way.

552
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:34,425
一个相当小的流星体
A rather small meteoroid,

553
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,260
直径可能只有数米
maybe a couple of meters in diameter

554
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,092
撞进地球大气层
smashed into Earth's atmosphere,

555
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,092
在那里发生空中爆炸
creating an air burst, an explosion up there.

556
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:44,556
在地中海东部上空的
- And this was an enormous explosion

557
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:47,953
这一次猛烈爆炸被卫星观察到了
over the Eastern Mediterranean, and it was observed by satellite.

558
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:51,018
从上空观测到这一现象
This was unusual to be over,

559
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,111
相当罕见
you know, a relatively populated area.

560
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,897
空中爆炸发生时
narrator: At the time of the air burst,

561
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:00,578
巴基斯坦和印度，这两个核武国家
Pakistan and India, two nuclear-armed countries,

562
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,951
正因有争议的克什米尔地区
were embroiled in a hostile military standoff

563
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,717
发生军事纠纷
over the disputed Kashmir region.

564
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:11,300
两国的核战争处于一触即发的状态
The world held its breath as the two nuclear powers

565
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:14,258
让整个世界为之担心
teetered on the hair-trigger brink of war.

566
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:19,272
发生在巴印两国上空的
- So had this impact occurred just a few hours earlier,

567
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:21,314
这次撞击
it was at about the right latitude

568
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,730
好在早了几个小时
to have been over Pakistan or India.

569
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:26,560
它会误导两者之中的一个
This could have been mistakenby either country

570
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,161
以为受到对方的攻击
as a launch against them.

571
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:32,483
然后他们可能会按下核按钮
And they then might have pushed the nuclear button,

572
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,119
导致全面的战争
launching an all-out war.

573
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:37,508
撞击会导致误会
A mistake, basically, caused by an impact.

574
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,535
在地中海东部事件中
narrator: Now known as the East Mediterranean Event,

575
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:44,549
科学界确信这次爆炸说明了
the blast convinced the scientific community

576
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:48,147
在核大战剑拔弩张的时候
that predicting cosmic intruders is critical

577
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:51,035
天外来客可能会挑起事端
when nuclear armageddon is at stake.

578
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:57,257
大多数撞击地球大气层的物体
- The vast majority of objects that hit

579
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:59,410
会突如其来
the Earth's atmosphere are unexpected.

580
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:02,660
大的小行星
The big asteroids,

581
00:35:02,688 --> 00:35:05,642
能够引起全球灾难的
the ones that could create a global catastrophe,

582
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,882
我们已经差不多全都发现了
we've discovered almost all of those.

583
00:35:07,993 --> 00:35:10,104
加以编号并跟踪
They're catalogued. They're tracked.

584
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,660
因此，我们不必担心
And so, we don't expect one of those

585
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:15,146
其中的哪一个会毫无征兆地
to come out from nowhere and hit the Earth

586
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:16,757
袭击地球
because we can see them.

587
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,774
但小的会让我们防不胜防
It's the small ones that can catch us by surprise.

588
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,965
如果其中一颗太空巨石
narrator: But how much notice can we expect

589
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,271
向着地球奔来
if one of these massive space rocks

590
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:30,035
能得到多大的关注呢？
moves onto a collision course with the Earth?

591
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:36,562
这是内布拉斯加州林肯的玛丽.H
That's the question that Mary H. from Lincoln, Nebraska, wanted

592
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:39,592
想知道的问题
to ask The Universe.

593
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:42,132
玛丽，这问题很有意思
- Mary, that's an interesting question.

594
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:45,136
对将要到达的彗星和小行星
We'd like to know about incoming comets and asteroids

595
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,451
我们要尽早知道，设法让它们转向
as far in advance as possible in order to deflect them.

596
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:50,641
目前，小行星可能会在
Now, asteroids might be found

597
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,641
撞击地球前的几十或几百年被发现
tens or even hundreds of years before they hit earth,

598
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,020
能有时间让我们从容布置
allowing plenty of time to do something about them.

599
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,632
彗星的到来却没有什么预兆
Comets might come in with very little warning,

600
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:01,742
我们至多有数月或一两年的时间
only a few months or a year or two at best.

601
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,367
我们可能来不及让它们转向
We might not be able to deflect them.

602
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:11,492
毫无疑问
narrator: There is no dispute

603
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,956
彗星和其它宇宙来客
that comets and other cosmic projectiles

604
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,826
有可能会导致灾难
have the potential to cause catastrophes.

605
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,687
但在现代天文学开始揭开它们的神秘之前
But before modern astronomy began to demystify them,

606
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,797
单从彗星或陨星来看
the mere sighting of a comet or meteorite

607
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,089
它们是有可能改变过人类历史的
had the potential to change human history.

608
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:35,325
公元312年
The year is 312 A.D.

609
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:40,200
辉煌的罗马帝国正处在痛苦的内战中
The mighty Roman empire is embroiled in a bitter civil war.

610
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:44,672
在战场上，康斯坦丁皇帝
Marching into battle, the emperor Constantine

611
00:36:44,825 --> 00:36:49,006
将与对手马克森提的军队相遇
is about to meet the armies of his archrival, Maxentius.

612
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:53,871
帝国的政治命运此时危如累卵
The political fate of the empire is at stake.

613
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:59,283
康斯坦丁是赫赫有名的罗马皇帝
- Constantine was a Roman emperor famous for a number of things,

614
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:02,797
并不想去皈依基督教
not the least of which is his conversion to Christianity.

615
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,839
但他在第四世纪
Constantine's adoption of the Christian religion

616
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:08,242
对基督教实施的怀柔政策
in the fourth century is instrumental

617
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,681
让他的声望骤增
in the sudden popularity and the spread of that religion

618
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:14,797
也让罗马帝国忽然间转变成基督教国家
by suddenly converting the Roman empire to a Christian empire.

619
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:20,172
许多人认为康斯坦丁的重大转变
narrator: Many believe Constantine's fateful conversion

620
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:24,394
发生在他看见血十字横过太阳的时候
occurs when he sees a fiery cross above the Sun.

621
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,172
他认为这是基督教上帝的神迹
Interpreting this as a sign from the Christian god,

622
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:33,658
于是命令军队在盔甲上画上十字
he commands his troops to paint crosses on their shields.

623
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:39,408
康斯坦丁的军队获得了胜利
Constantine's troops emerge victorious.

624
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:44,574
不久之后，他颁布《米兰敕令》
Soon after, the emperor signs the Edict of Milan,

625
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:49,783
为基督教永远摆脱异教的形象，奠定了坚实基础
setting the stage for the ultimate triumph of Christianity over paganism.

626
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:58,157
但有些人认为康斯坦丁的所见
But some believe Constantine's vision

627
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,643
可以从天文学上去解释
has an astronomical explanation.

628
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,699
现在看来，他所见到的景象
- It's believed now that what he personally observed

629
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:08,149
其实就是流星侵袭地球
was a meteoric impact against the Earth.

630
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,227
他在大白天突然看到有一颗流星
That he's looking skyward in broad daylight,

631
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,838
正以70,000英里的时速侵袭地球
and suddenly at 70,000 miles per hour, this meteor comes crashing to Earth.

632
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:18,879
他幻想着
His vision in seeing that is-

633
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:22,171
这是神灵的兆示
he interprets it as being a divine signal.

634
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:29,379
有一个强有力的证据
narrator: There is one powerful clue

635
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,448
能够帮助确认这次的宇宙事件：
that could help validate this cosmic event:

636
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:34,879
弹坑
a crater.

637
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,893
一个地质小组在意大利中部山区
And a team of geologists may have found it

638
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,754
发现了它
in the hills of central Italy.

639
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,518
宇宙撞击
Have cosmic impacts

640
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,059
曾经扭转了人类历史的发展方向吗？
altered the course of human history?

641
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,754
这个问题在全球的天文学界，甚至是宗教界里
It's a question that provokes the world of astronomy

642
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,281
掀起了轩然大波
and even the world of religion.

643
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,115
公元312年
In the year 312 A.D.,

644
00:39:07,642 --> 00:39:09,420
康斯坦丁的命运
the fate of Christianity

645
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,601
也许曾被宇宙事件所左右
may have been decided by cosmic intervention.

646
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,781
在决战前夕
Just before a decisive battle,

647
00:39:18,017 --> 00:39:22,559
罗马皇帝康斯坦丁亲眼目睹了一次奇观
the Roman emperor Constantine experiences a vision.

648
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:26,517
他思索着天空里的事情
- He remembers seeing something in the sky,

649
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:29,628
并把它解释为神灵给予的兆示
and he interprets this as being a sign from god,

650
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:31,904
基督教上帝给予的兆示
a sign from the one true Christian god.

651
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:36,503
这次有重大意义的景象
narrator: Some believe this fateful vision

652
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:38,059
有人认为是
was a fiery meteor

653
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:41,128
一颗冲向地球的火球般的流星
on a collision course with the Earth.

654
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:45,239
你的所见，取决于你离得有多远
- What you would see, of course, would depend on how far away you are.

655
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:48,378
你会看到一颗非常明亮的流星
You would see an extremely bright meteor

656
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:50,781
在白天的天空中划过
coming through the sky, and you'd see it even in the daytime.

657
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:54,260
炫目的它可能和太阳一样明亮
It would be blinding, perhaps as bright as the Sun.

658
00:39:54,336 --> 00:39:58,155
然后它会撞击地面，而你会看到一次大爆炸
And then it would hit the ground, and you would see a big explosion.

659
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,794
按照一个瑞典地质小组的说法
narrator: According to a Swedish geology team,

660
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:12,240
康斯坦丁见到流星很可能真有其事
Constantine's meteor might very well be real.

661
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,950
有一个弹坑作为证明
And there's a crater to prove it.

662
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,294
在1999年，该小组在意大利中部的高原地区
In 1999, the team discovered a mysterious body of water

663
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:23,085
发现了一个神秘的水坑
in the highlands of central Italy.

664
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:30,091
他们声称这个小湖和周围的20个凹坑
They claim the small lake and some 20 nearby craters

665
00:40:30,335 --> 00:40:34,303
是流星撞击的结果
are the results of meteorite fragments.

666
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:39,137
但这个证据远不足以让人信服
But the evidence is far from conclusive.

667
00:40:40,696 --> 00:40:44,363
有人认为这些凹坑是古代人的贮水池
Some think the craters are ancient manmade reservoirs.

668
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,321
还有人怀疑它们只是二战时期的东西
Others suspect they only date back to World War II.

669
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:00,474
某些凹坑的迹象
- There's ordinance from some of the craters

670
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:03,557
说明了它们实际上是炸弹坑
that suggests that they are actually bomb craters.

671
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:09,474
问题是，这里曾经是
- The problem is, it's in a place

672
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,196
人口密集的地方
where there have been a lot of people.

673
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,140
它也许是一个贮水坑
And it was perhaps used as a watering hole.

674
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:18,924
它是人类活动
It's been so overprinted by human activity,

675
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,112
留下的遗迹
and I don't know if that one will ever be resolved.

676
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,469
它只是一个凹坑而已
But it certainly could be a crater.

677
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:29,807
斯兰特弹坑撞击假说里，有许多经不起推敲的地方
- One of the weakest parts of the Sirente crater impact hypothesis

678
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,858
其中之一是根本没有发现撞击矿物
is that the shocked minerals simply have not been found.

679
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:36,682
没有明显证据能说明曾发生过突然的撞击
There's no clear evidence that there was a whammo type impact there.

680
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:40,473
无论是不是宇宙撞击
narrator: Cosmic impact or not,

681
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,626
康斯坦丁见到奇观
Constantine's vision is considered

682
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:46,122
被公认是人类历史上最关键的事件之一
one of the most pivotal events in human history.

683
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,237
没有这个事件
- Had it not been for this event,

684
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:53,529
基督教能成为在欧洲占统治地位的宗教
would Christianity have become the dominant religion of Europe

685
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,300
然后扩展到美洲吗？
and then spread to the Americas?

686
00:41:55,737 --> 00:41:56,820
这很难说
It's hard to say.

687
00:41:56,834 --> 00:42:01,028
但显而易见的是，这次事件对促使康斯坦丁
But it's easy to say that this one event was pivotal

688
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:03,598
广泛支持基督教
in forcing Constantine

689
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,612
起到关键性的作用
to fully embrace the Christian religion.

690

691
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,431
我们居住的星球
narrator: We live on a planet

692
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,306
是宇宙长期作用的产物
ceaselessly shaped by the cosmos

693
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:21,236
偶尔受到侵入者的攻击
and occasionally by invaders raining down fire.

694
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,778
太空力量对人类历史的改变
The power of space to alter human history

695
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,889
存在着争议
remains controversial.

696
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:32,833
也存在着这样的问题：它多久会发生？
But the question remains: how often does it happen?

697
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:36,903
对全新世撞击工作组的成员来说
For members of the Holocene Impact Working Group,

698
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:39,708
答案就是：比主流科学公认的
the answer is: far more frequently

699
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:42,514
更为频繁得多
than mainstream science currently accepts.

700
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:48,267
在最近的10,000至15,000年间
- So impacts over the course of human civilization

701
00:42:48,486 --> 00:42:50,639
在对人类文明的影响方面
in the last 10,000 to 15,000 years,

702
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,652
我们毫不犹豫地相信
there's no question in our minds,

703
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:55,269
撞击在人类的进化
have played an important role

704
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,666
和人类文明的演变中
in the development of human evolution

705
00:42:57,694 --> 00:43:00,514
扮演着一个重要的角色
and the evolution of human civilization.

706
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,624
但其它人对此强烈反对
narrator: But others hotly disagree.

707
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:12,458
外星物体没有足够的可能
- There just aren't enough potential impactors out there

708
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,122
曾撞击过地球
to have hit the Earth.

709
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:17,589
其发生的概率--
And the kind of rates that they're suggesting-

710
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:21,179
直径数公里的物体撞击地球
kilometer-sized objects hitting the Earth

711
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:22,498
每几千年就会发生--
every few thousand years-

712
00:43:22,524 --> 00:43:24,364
即是说，如果万一有物体
I mean, if there were enough objects

713
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:25,911
要撞击地球
to hit the Earth at that rate,

714
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:28,204
我们只是擦肩而过
we'd be getting near-misses.

715
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:29,512
每年都有一两次
We'd be getting objects that size

716
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,204
我们以为物体
coming between the Earth and the Moon,

717
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:33,193
要在地球和月球之间穿过
you know, one or two of those a year.

718
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,260
但我们从未见过其发生
And we've never seen anything like that.

719
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,673
所以，这种概率不存在
The rate just isn't there.

720
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,700
激烈的争论会一直继续
narrator: The debate will continue to rage,

721
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:47,182
可能会持续到人类文明的末日来临之际
perhaps until the very end of human civilization.

722
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:52,155
届时，宇宙对人类历史改变的结束
But will that end be a gradual demise

723
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:56,080
会是逐渐消亡的形式
or a sudden violent demonstration

724
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,608
还是突然的轰轰烈烈的方式？
of how space can change history?
