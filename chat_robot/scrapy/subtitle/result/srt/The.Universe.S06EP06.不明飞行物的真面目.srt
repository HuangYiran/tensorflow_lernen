1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,380
天地伊始  一片混沌
In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,880
忽地一声巨响
And then-- Bang!

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,640
时空与物质由此而生
Giving birth to an endless, expanding existence

4
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,981
继而不断发展  永无止尽
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:12,221
每天都有新发现解开其中
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

6
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:15,752
神秘莫测  令人大开眼界  却又致命的秘密
the mysterious, the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:17,203
这就是我们的
of a place we call

8
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:18,903
宇宙
the universe.

9
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:24,103
成千上万的人声称亲眼见过不明飞行物
Thousands of witnesses have claimed to see UFOs.

10
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:28,184
他们对此现象的描述是惊人的相似
And their accounts are often strikingly similar.

11
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,355
坠落的飞盘  加上尸体残骸
You have a crashed saucer, but also some crashed bodies.

12
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:32,926
还有政府介入的掩饰行为
You have government cover-up.

13
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:37,656
主流科学一致认为目前证据不足
Mainstream science says the evidence just isn't there.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,707
从不明飞行物到外星飞船是一个很大的跨越
It's a big jump between a UFO and an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,048
但如果不明飞行物的确是外星飞船
But if UFOs were really extraterrestrial craft,

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,479
那其中又隐藏了何种令人匪夷所思的技术
what kind of mind-bending technologies would we find under the hood?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,650
外星飞船一定要有特殊技术
You'd have to have some sort of technology that was capable

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,520
才能抵消惯性作用
of canceling the effects of inertia.

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,861
不明飞行物神秘面纱后的
When it comes to Unidentified Flying Objects,

20
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,251
真实面目究竟是什么呢
what is the real deal?

对于无数追随者来说
For millions of believers,

30
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,695
这一切始于1947年6月24日
it all began on June 24, 1947.

31
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:31,676
商人飞行员肯尼斯・阿诺德当时正在
A businessman and pilot named Kenneth Arnold is flying solo

32
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,797
华盛顿州的雷尼尔山附近独自飞行
near Mount Rainier, Washington.

33
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,368
突然  他看到九个飞行器组成一队
Suddenly he sees a group of nine aircraft

34
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:40,688
以惊人的速度飞行
moving at incredible speeds.

35
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,669
这些飞行器高度反光
They were highly reflective,

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,539
并以超音速列队飞行
and they were flying at supersonic speeds,

37
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,260
它们还会突然改变航线
in formation, changing course abruptly.

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,750
以当时的技术无法达到该速度
The speeds were unattainable at the time.

39
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:54,471
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
《不明飞行物之科学》作者

40
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:56,201
那时喷气式飞机和超音速飞机还未问世
This was before the age of jets and certainly supersonic jets.

41
00:01:58,082 --> 00:01:59,272
身为训练有素的飞行员
Being a trained pilot,

42
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,642
为了确认自己看到的是飞行器
he did several things to corroborate their existence

43
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:04,503
而不是某种大气效应
to make sure he wasn't seeing some kind of atmospheric effect.

44
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:07,903
他摆动自己的头  改变机身的角度
He changed his-- his head angle. He changed the aircraft angle.

45
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:09,413
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

46
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,114
他甚至调整了飞机位置
He even positioned the aircraft such that

47
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:13,914
让白雪作为这群飞行器的背景
there was a light snow in the background behind the objects,

48
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,665
而在白雪的映衬下  这群飞行器显得很暗
and they appeared dark against a light surface.

49
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:21,396
但就在阿诺德设法接近时  不明物体消失了
Before Arnold can maneuver closer, the objects are gone.

50
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,957
这算得上是现代史无前例的发现
It was basically unprecedented in modern times.

51
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:28,728
从未有人见过类似的物体
No one had seen anything like this.

52
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:34,258
后来在他讲述事件时
In the days that follow, newspaper reporters misquote Arnold,

53
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,989
飞碟
肯尼斯・阿诺德 飞碟到来

54
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,349
记者误引了阿诺德的话
as he tries to make sense of the incident.

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,060
当时他说它的飞行方式像碟子在水上漂
In fact, he said it moved like saucers skipping on water.

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,720
赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

57
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,211
而记者把这个意思理解错了
Now, of course, the reporter kind of messed that up

58
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,311
而报道说它们看起来像碟子
in reporting it and said that they looked like saucers.

59
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,912
"飞碟"一词由此而生
The term "Flying saucer" is born.

60
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,522
飞碟

61
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:55,772
阿诺德的发现首开现代不明飞行物现象的先河
And Arnold's encounter launches the modern UFO phenomenon.

62
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:01,243
几周后  即在1947年的夏天
Weeks later, in the summer of 1947,

63
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:06,214
在新墨西哥州的罗斯威尔附近发生了
perhaps the most famous incident involving an Unidentified Flying Object

64
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:09,235
史上最著名的不明飞行物事件
is reported near Roswell, New Mexico.

65
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:12,706
罗斯威尔事件是典型的不明飞行物现象
Roswell's become the poster child of the UFO phenomenon,

66
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,896
因其具备所有必要因素
because it has all the necessary ingredients.

67
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,027
坠落的飞碟  加上尸体残骸
You have a crashed saucer, but also some crashed bodies.

68
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,877
还有政府介入  他们绝对隐瞒了实情
You have government cover-up. There was some sort of cover-up.

69
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,818
当局发布的是虚假信息
There was misinformation given out by the authorities.

70
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:28,049
澳大利亚空军在罗斯威尔地区牧场上空发现飞碟

71
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,489
消息最初是从空军那边传出的
The original account put out by the air force at the time was

72
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,819
说这就是来自外太空的飞碟
that this was a flying saucer of alien origin.

73
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:31,739
瑞米将军否认了罗斯威尔飞碟

74
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,580
但没过多久  这个说法就被否认了
And then later, very quickly, was denied, and the story then

75
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,411
改称这是个坠毁的气象气球
was that this was a weather balloon which had crashed and

76
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,132
上面没有载人
that there were no occupants on board

77
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,322
说有外星人更是无稽之谈
and that there was nothing extraterrestrial about it.

78
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,172
发现飞碟的农场主后悔自己说出了这个事情

79
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:50,593
其他目击者宣称看到了坠毁飞行器的残片
Other witnesses claimed to have seen actual pieces of a crashed spacecraft--

80
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:55,054
报道称  这些材料超越了当时的科技水平
Materials that are reportedly unknown to science.

81
00:03:56,955 --> 00:03:59,885
阿诺德的目击与罗斯威尔事件
Both Arnold's sighting and the Roswell incident remain

82
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:04,555
都未得到官方证实  二者本身也颇有争议
officially unconfirmed and highly controversial.

83
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,937
几乎每年都有许多关于不明物体的报道
Just about every year, there are thousands of reported sightings

84
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,067
它们多数出现在空中
mostly in the sky,

85
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:15,338
便被认为是外星飞船
of objects that they assume are extraterrestrial craft--

86
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,678
即不明飞行物
So-called UFOs.

87
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,649
这个"不明"很关键  因为它们从未被确认过
The "U" is important, of course. They're unidentified.

88
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,450
我本人也曾看到一个从地平线飞起
I personally have seen a bright light start at the horizon

89
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,310
进而直入云霄的亮点
and shoot off into the clouds.

90
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,910
严格来说这就是个不明飞行物
Now, strictly speaking, that was a UFO.

91
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:34,541
从不明飞行物到外星飞船是一个很大的跨越
It's a big jump between a UFO and an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

92
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,212
科学家认为
Scientists argue that

93
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:41,283
大部分观察到的不明飞行物要么来自地球
most UFO sightings either have Earthly origins--

94
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:46,944
例如人造卫星  气球或者飞机
Like satellites, ballons, and aircraft.

95
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:52,315
要么来自宇宙  如陨石和彗星
Or cosmic origins, such is meteors, comets,

96
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:56,416
也可能是特别耀眼的  比如金星
or even the specially bright, Planet Venus

97
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:01,857
但当我们无法解释不明飞行物现象时
But when a UFO sighting has no known explanation,

98
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:05,517
它会不会就是外星飞船呢
could it be an extraterrestrial craft?

99
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:10,638
既然如此  究竟何种技术才能够制造出
And if so, what kind of technologies could possibly explain the behaviors

100
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,229
这些目击者所描述的现象
that witnesses actually report?

101
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,630
这些飞行器是如何制成
How would such craft be built?

102
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,560
其间又需要攻克怎样的难题
And what problems would they have to overcome?

103
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,521
报道中所述多种不明飞行物的行为
A lot of the behavior of UFOs that people have reported

104
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:26,581
都超出了我们目前物理学水平
are things that are beyond our current level of physics--

105
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:30,432
极快速率  极致加速度与急促转弯速度
Extreme rates of speed or extreme acceleration, extreme turn rates,

106
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,793
这些都是人类目前无法实现的
things that just we're-- we're not capable of doing

107
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:36,963
否则驾驶员甚至飞行器都要承受巨大损害
without extreme harm to a pilot or destroying a spacecraft.

108
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:42,154
这些目击者描述了超快的加速度
Eyewitness accounts of super fast accelerations,

109
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:45,275
闪电般的转向与急停
lightning turns, and sudden stops

110
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,866
这些似乎违反了已知的物理学定律
seem to violate known laws of physics,

111
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:52,056
但外星人是否已掌握毋须遵守规律的技术呢
but could aliens find a way around these laws?

112
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,907
需要强调的一条是惯性定律
So what we have to keep in mind here is the principle of inertia.

113
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:59,888
露丝安妮・沃克薇姿
普林斯顿大学

114
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,388
由艾萨克・牛顿首先提出
That principle, stated first by Isaac Newton,

115
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,988
即一个处于静止或运动的物体
says that an object at rest or in motion

116
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:06,399
只有受外力影响才会改变其初始状态
tends to stay at rest or in motion unless acted on by an outside force.

117
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,270
因此为了适应如此剧烈的惯性变化
So, to generate these kinds of crazy changes in inertia,

118
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,600
就需要对这些物体施加极大的外力
you'd really have to act on that object with an immense amount of force.

119
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:17,751
例如  一架战斗机飞行员
Following the same logic, a fighter pilot

120
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:19,602
以近音速的速度飞行
traveling near the speed of sound,

121
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,432
并试图在该速度下  调转90度
attempting to make a 90-degree turn at the same speed,

122
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:27,703
将承受将近300G的力
would experience something close to 300 "G"S of force.

123
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:31,454
飞行员穿着压力服时
The most that a human pilot wearing a pressure suit

124
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:35,784
最多能够承受约10G的力而不至晕厥
can manage without blacking out is around ten "G"S.

125
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,336
如果它的身体构架和人类有几分相似
If his physiology were remotely similar to humans,

126
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:45,696
进行300G力的转向
an extraelestial pilot undergoing a 300 "G"s maneuvering

127
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,437
会立即导致死亡
would instantly perish.

128
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,648
它的内脏会继续往前运动
His internal organs would continue moving forward

129
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,579
因撞击骨骼而碎裂
and crush against the skeleton.

130
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:58,779
如果它们跟人类相似
If they were similar to us,

131
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,870
就得知道如何处理液体喷撞
they'd probably have to have a way of ejecting fluid--

132
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,810
就是体内的液体
Internal fluid-- Inside their bodies

133
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:04,921
这样它们就能解决
so that they dealt with

134
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,261
内脏在体内四处游动的问题
this problem of their organs floating around inside,

135
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:11,021
如果能固定好内脏  加以适当的缓冲
and if they were strapped in properly and cushioned properly, uh,

136
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:15,572
在加速或减速时  它们的内脏就不会受损
end up not having internal damage when they accelerated and decelerated.

137
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:20,063
为有效抵消飞行器本身的惯性作用
To effectively cancel the inertial effects on the craft itself,

138
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:22,484
这些飞行员需要利用的
the pilots might switch on a technology

139
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,714
是现代人类目前只能叹而观止的技术
that is beyond the reach of modern humans.

140
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:29,925
为了不受这转弯所带来的300G的影响
So, in order to cancel out the effects of a 300-g turn

141
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:31,956
并且不会被这巨力所压碎
and not be squished by that amount of force,

142
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,646
你必须要有一种技术或装置
you'd have to have some sort of technology or a device

143
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:37,527
来抵消惯性作用
that was capable of canceling the effects of inertia.

144
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:41,517
这个装置能够控制重力效应
The device would have to manipulate the force of gravity,

145
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,008
运用一种力场
using a type of force field

146
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:48,948
抵消并控制整个宇宙的重力作用
to counteract the gravitational forces that rule the entire universe.

147
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,470
你可以根据需要
This device, you could turn on if you wanted to,

148
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
启动或关闭该装置
then turn it off if you wanted to,

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,890
或者这个装置能够自动启用和关闭
or maybe it would come on and off automatically.

150
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,031
这项技术远远超出人类的能力
This is high technology that's out of sight.

151
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,502
如果科学解释不了
But if science can't yet explain

152
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:08,592
这些飞行器如何克服惯性这一关键问题
how these craft could overcome the deadly problem of inertia,

153
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,523
那飞行器的外形又是怎么一回事呢
can it help explain their shapes...

154
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:17,635
尤其是该如何解释这个最为出名的飞碟形状呢
Particularly the most famous shape of all, the flying saucer?

155
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:25,435
20世纪50年代末  美国空军测试了飞行车
In the late 1950s, the U.S. Air force tested the Avrocar,

156
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:30,306
但其设计不稳定  毫无空气动力优势
but the design had poor stability and few aerodynamic advantages,

157
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,317
正好证明碟状飞行器
proving that high speeds are unattainable

158
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:36,648
无法在地球大气层高速行进
for saucer craft in Earth's atmosphere.

159
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,099
三角翼或者楔形  都比碟形设计更稳定
The delta wing, or wedge shape, is a far stronger candidate--

160
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,500
这是现代军事飞行器设计者所熟知的事实
A fact that is well known by modern military aircraft designers.

161
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,591
事实上  目击楔形不明飞行物的报道数目
In fact, the percentage of UFO sightings reporting a wedge-shaped craft

162
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,572
在近几十年来呈逐年增长趋势
have increased in recent decades,

163
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,622
后掠翼喷气机  甚至是像蝇翅设计的
a trend that mirrors the emergence of swept-wing jets

164
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:03,743
B2隐形轰炸机则应运而生
and even flying-wing designs like the B-2 stealth bomber.

165
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:07,424
这些年来人们所报告的飞行器外形一直在改变
The shapes that people have reported over the years have changed,

166
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:10,234
最近报告的形状基本都是楔形
with the most recent ones being more wedge-shaped.

167
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,615
因此  人们的描述其实反映的是
So, really, people's accounts tend to reflect

168
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,955
当时最先进的飞行器
the most advanced aircraft of the time.

169
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,376
除了运行方式和外形
Beyond movement and shape,

170
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:20,556
要解开不明飞行物之谜
any attempt to explain the science of UFOs

171
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,997
还牵涉到噪音问题
has to deal with the noise factor,

172
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,207
准确地说  是它完全无噪音现象
or rather, the lack of noisy.

173
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,728
关于不明飞行物的报告均称
UFO reports consistently claim

174
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,189
这些物体在移动过程中没有发出任何声音
that the objects moved without making any sound.

175
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,849
几乎所有的目击报告中都提到
Almost all of these sightings,

176
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,740
它没有半点噪音
it's a real rule-- there's no noise,

177
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,130
但按理说  在地球大气层中
which you would expect to hear from

178
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,931
任何高速运动的飞行器都会产生噪音
any fast-moving craft in the Earth's atmosphere.

179
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,381
人们能够听见
You would hear it.

180
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:48,101
在实际情况中会产生音爆
What actually happens is that you get what's called a sonic boom,

181
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,772
这是飞行器高速飞行时
and that's a special pressure wave that

182
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:53,062
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

183
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:55,143
穿过大气所产生的特殊压力波
sweeps through the atmosphere along with the craft.

184
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:56,553
当人在地面上所听到
So you're on the ground,

185
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:01,544
巨大音爆的产生是由于
and that huge sonic boom is the result of that pressure difference

186
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,895
飞行器在穿越大气时
between the front of the aircraft and the back of the aircraft

187
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:09,436
其首尾压力不同所致
as it pushes through the atmosphere.

188
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:15,727
外星飞行器能够设法消除超音速飞行中
Could an alien craft somehow cancel out the enormous pressure wave

189
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:18,627
产生的巨大压力波吗
that supersonic flight generates?

190
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,298
答案也许就在
The answer could lie

191
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:27,429
最新一代的数码消音耳机所采用的技术中
in the technology used in the latest generation of digital noise-canceling headphones.

192
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,250
消音技术确实存在
So there is such a thing as a sound-canceling technology,

193
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:35,621
即选取想要消除的声音
where you take a particular sound that you're interested in canceling

194
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:39,101
之后播放相反的声音  以达到抵消的效果
and kind of broadcast the negative of that sound to cancel it out.

195
00:10:39,362 --> 00:10:42,172
据我所知  现代技术还无法
Now, I'm not aware of any technology that's capable of

196
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,282
抵消冲击波
doing that with shock waves.

197
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:48,533
要抵消音爆所带来的震耳欲聋的效果
Canceling out the ear-splitting, body-shaking effect of a sonic boom

198
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:52,524
必然需要一些先进的工程技术
would certainly require some advanced engineering skills.

199
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:57,355
假设静音已解决  而隐形又该如何解释
And if there is silence, what about invisibility?

200
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:02,946
一些报道称不明飞行物在天际凭空消失
Some reports claim that UFOs simply disappear into thin air.

201
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,137
现阶段正在研究的一种人类技术
One promising human technology currently being researched

202
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:10,017
也许能够解释这一现象
might explain such phenomenon.

203
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:16,159
一种即将问世的技术也许可以改变物体的像
There is a technology on the horizon which might change things visually.

204
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,249
那是一种光线扭曲技术
And that is a kind of light-bending technology.

205
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,840
属于超材料的一种
As a class, they're called metamaterials.

206
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,280
热门电影中有不少展示
If you want to think about popular movies,

207
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,780
例如哈利波特电影中的隐形斗篷
think the invisibility cloak in the Harry Potter movies.

208
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:33,432
超材料依靠聚合物基质以及金和铜
Metamaterials use combinations of polymer substrates, gold, and copper

209
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:39,012
有效地扭曲物体周围的电磁波
to forcibly bend electromagnetic waves around an object.

210
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:43,284
光线被引导绕过物体
The light is guided around the object rather than being

211
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,434
而非反射或折射
reflected or refracted.

212
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,435
若天外来客无法到达地球
But advanced materials, stealth capability,

213
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:54,596
先进材料  隐形能力
and mind-bending maneuverability would all come to nothing

214
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:59,236
和超强的机动性都将是纸上谈兵
if our visitors were unable to get to Earth in the first place.

215
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:02,607
我认为其他文明成功来访的几率
I'd say that the chances of another civilization making it

216
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,778
是非常小的
here to visit us are pretty miniscule.

217
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,228
但如果它们真的做到了
But if they did make it,

218
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:09,359
那意味着它们已经解决了诸多难题
it would mean that they had solved a whole bunch of problems,

219
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:12,839
包括我们还无法解答的材料科学问题
including material-science problems that we don't have answers to.

220
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,910
因此他们的技术将领先我们许多
So they'd have technology far beyond ours,

221
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,030
甚至超越了我们想象
perhaps even beyond what we've dreamt of at this point.

222
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:24,321
科学家推断出了一些独具匠心的技术
But scientists can imagine several ingenious technologies

223
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:29,352
可以完成这看似不可能完成的星际旅行
that could bridge the seemingly unbridgeable distance between the stars,

224
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:34,403
包括一种能量巨大的爆炸式推进
including one explosive propulsion source that's so apocalyptic,

225
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:38,134
可能身在数光年外的我们也能观测到
we might see them coming light years away.

226
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,996
数十年来  无数有关不明飞行物的报道
For decades, countless UFO reports have

227
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:50,916
从世界各个城市和乡村传来
surfaced from cities and countries around the globe.

228
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:57,287
但并非所有事件都发生在地球上
But not all UFO sightings have been reported from the surface of planet Earth.

229
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,139
2009年7月19日
On July 19, 2009,

230
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,480
美国宇航局奋进号航天飞机上的视频监视员
viewers of a NASA video feed from the space shuttle endeavor

231
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,920
发现一碟状物体
reported seeing a disc-shaped object

232
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,601
徘徊于太空船的机械臂上方
hovering above the shuttle's mechanical arm.

233
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,011
收到图像  只有9.65公里的距离
Roger that visual, it has only six miles...

234
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,802
此类太空不明飞行物的目击事件
Space-based UFO sightings like this have purportedly happened

235
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:22,162
在人类航天史上时有发生
throughout the history of manned spaceflight.

236
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,843
无法断定的宇宙现象
Unspecified cosmic phenomenon,

237
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,964
是否就是
or could it suggest the possibility that

238
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:34,424
大型星际战舰正在银河系中航行
huge extraterrestrial starship are cruising the Milky Way galaxy?

239
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,026
星际旅行  是科幻题材的主要内容
Space travel between the stars-- It's a staple of science fiction, right?

240
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:43,016
赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

241
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:41,317
晚间电视节目上能见到
You see it every night on television.

242
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:42,647
在电影情节中里也常出现
You see it in the movies all the time.

243
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,337
但我们真的能实现吗  有哪种物种做到了
But could we really do it, or could any species really do it?

244
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,778
星际距离非常遥远
Well, the distances between the stars are enormous-- Really enormous.

245
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,669
星际旅行并不违背物理学
Interstellar travel doesn't violate physics.

246
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,920
我们并不能排除其发生的可能性
It isn't that you can rule it out,

247
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,610
说  "它们绝对到不了这里"
and say "There's absolutely no way they can come here."

248
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,870
只是它实现的可能性微乎其微
It's just that it's very, very hard.

249
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:07,051
以距地球最近的半人马座阿尔法星为例
Just traveling from the Earth to Alpha Centauri,

250
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,742
它与地球的间距有4.5光年
our closest neighboring star at nearly 4 1/2 light years,

251
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,622
超过人类现有最强力火箭的射程
is beyond the reach of our most powerful rockets.

252
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:20,454
如果遥远星系的先进文明前来访问
If an advanced civilization were to visit us from a distant star system,

253
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:23,914
它们绝对不会使用化学燃料的火箭
we can pretty much rule out that they would use chemical rockets to get here.

254
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:25,714
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

255
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,485
不管阿波罗  土星五号还是航天飞机
Despite the impressive pillar of fire and smoke that we see

256
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,066
发射时有着多么壮丽的火焰和烟雾
during Apollo, Saturn V, or shuttle launches,

257
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:33,446
化学火箭在太阳系中走不了多远
chemical rockets don't get you very far in a solar system.

258
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,907
作为现存航行最远的空间探测器
To give you some context for that distance,

259
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:42,698
露丝安妮・沃克薇姿
普林斯顿大学

260
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:40,578
发射于1977年的旅行者一号的工作是
our furthest known space probe is Voyager 1,

261
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,728
反馈星际间距的信息
launched in 1977.

262
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,689
它以每小时6.1万公里的速度
It's been flying for 34 years

263
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,809
飞行了34年
at 38,000 miles per hour,

264
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,939
而它现在才刚飞离太阳系没多久
and it's only now starting to leave our Solar System.

265
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
如果它的目的地是半人马座阿尔法星
If its destination were Alpha Centauri,

266
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,901
则需要超过5.6万年的时间
it would take over 56,000 years

267
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,441
才能到达这最近的星系
to reach even the closest star system.

268
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:03,212
如果星际旅行可以在人的一生中完成
To engage in interstellar missions on time frames of a human lifetime,

269
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:04,852
理查德・奥博塞
理论物理学家

270
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,852
时间约为50年
around about 50 years,

271
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:05,373
可以得出
we can see that

272
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:10,113
我们的航行速度至少要提高1,000倍
we need to increase the speed that we can travel by at least a factor of 1,000.

273
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:12,194
科学家已证实
Scientists have determined

274
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:17,795
光速达到了令人咂舌的每秒三十万公里
that the speed of light is a mind-blowing 186,000 miles per second.

275
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,005
星际飞船若航行于星系之中
A spacecraft traveling the star systems

276
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:23,356
需要达到光速的相对比重
would have to reach a significant percentage of that speed

277
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,876
才可能到达最近的星系
even to reach the nearest star.

278
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,917
最大的难题就是重量
The biggest obstacle is weight.

279
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,078
化学火箭负载量极大
A chemical rocket exacts a huge weight penalty,

280
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:37,738
因为它要装载所有的能源供给
because its entire fuel supply must be carried on board.

281
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,799
经计算得出
We can calculate that

282
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,959
仅仅是达到光速6%的
even to reach 6% of the speed of light

283
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,620
化学火箭所需燃料
using chemical rocket fuel,

284
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,450
就得超过整个宇宙的质量
you would need more rocket fuel than exists mass in the universe.

285
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,151
据此可知
So we really know that

286
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:53,531
光靠化学火箭燃料无法完成星际旅行
it's actually impossible to reach another star system using chemical rocket fuel.

287
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:57,722
如果外星来访已然实现
If extraterrestrial visitations are even possible,

288
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:01,373
它们一定解决了燃料问题
their spacecraft must solve this problem.

289
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:06,574
2011年  美国宇航局的D型纳米帆
In 2011, NASA's Nanosail-D

290
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:10,415
成为第一艘环绕地球飞行的太阳帆
became the first solar sail to orbit the Earth.

291
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,835
这块9.29平方米的超薄帆利用太阳光
The ultra-thin 100-square-foot sail uses sunlight,

292
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:17,926
或是光子压力来作为推动力
or photon pressure, as a source of propulsion.

293
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:21,267
火箭推动不可改变的局限性在于
One of the immutable limitations of rocket propulsion

294
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:25,097
就是需要随火箭体携带燃料
is the fact that any rocket has to carry its fuel with it.

295
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:29,238
太阳帆则能利用自然资源的优势
A solar sail can take advantage of the naturally occurring resources,

296
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:31,329
即太阳发出的光量子
namely photons emanating from the sun,

297
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,059
从而转化为太阳帆的推动力
which can be used to propel that solar sail.

298
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,540
同理  悬挂式滑翔机没有能源或引擎
Similarly, a hang glider can fly without any fuel or an engine

299
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:43,041
仅仅利用我们身边的自然资源
just by taking an advantage of the natural resources we're surrounded by,

300
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:46,692
遵循大气流通规律  亦能成行
namely the atmosphere and the laws of aerodynamics.

301
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,845
可载生物飞船要达到足够速度
To achieve sufficient speeds to tow a spacecraft supporting life forms,

302
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:08,816
需要直径达数百公里的巨型太阳帆
the sail would have to be huge, up to hundreds of miles in diameter.

303
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,897
由于恒星产生的光子压力
And because the photon pressure from a star

304
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:15,857
会随着太阳帆航行渐远而减弱
would decrease the further the sail traveled,

305
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:21,538
有人设想过用高聚激光束驱动太阳帆
some have envisioned a concentrated laser beam directing energy at the sail.

306
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:34,571
但最终无法避免的是
Eventually and sadly,

307
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:38,161
所有的滑翔机在一定时段后都会降落
this hang glider and all hang gliders at some point have to land,

308
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,772
但使用高聚激光束的太阳帆
but a solar sail riding a beam of laser energy

309
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:44,683
在理论上可以完成星际旅行
could conceivably travel to the stars.

310
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,464
太阳帆能达到的最大速度
The max speed of a solar sail--

311
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,524
约为光速的10%
About 10% the speed of light.

312
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:56,125
最大速度  每秒三万公里

313
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:55,815
靠激光光子能量从地球到半人马座阿尔法星
Travel from Earth to Alpha Centauri using laser-generated photons--

314
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,786
大约需45年
About 45 years.

315
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:00,966
最大速度  每秒3万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  45年

316
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,317
当前  美国宇航局及其他航天机构
Currently, NASA and other space agencies

317
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,697
计划发射更多的太阳帆
have plans for launching more solar sails.

318
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:13,198
但宇宙中还有其他更强大的动力源
But there are other, more powerful sources of propulsion in the universe.

319
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,279
十九世纪六十年代有人提出一种推进方法
In the 1960s, a method of propulsion was proposed

320
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,970
即在飞船尾部
where a spacecraft would literally

321
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,680
安置一系列爆炸物
drop a series of explosive charges out the back,

322
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:25,631
爆炸带来的能量将推动飞船前进
and the force of the explosions would push the spacecraft forward.

323
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,411
原型机被称作"核脉冲推进"
The prototype was called the "Orion Drive,"

324
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:32,182
实际上人们进行了一系列常规炸药的试验
And there were actually a series of experiments done with conventional charges

325
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,823
以证明这是可行的
to show that it would work.

326
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:38,193
然而"核脉冲推进"燃料使用的是核弹
The Orion Drive, however, was proposed to use nuclear charges.

327
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,524
为模拟核脉冲形式的推进系统
In order to simulate an Orion-style propulsion system,

328
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,524
保罗和吉姆正在搭建示范装置
Paul and Jim here are rigging up a demonstration

329
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,865
他们将少量化学炸药装入罐中
where they're going to put a small chemical charge inside this barrel,

330
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:50,725
将其炸到约15至18米的空中
and we're going to lift this off the ground 50, 60 feet in the air.

331
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:53,746
我们将计算这次爆炸释放的能量
We're going to actually calculate the energy released in this explosion

332
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:56,797
并将其同实际的核脉冲飞船系统中的
and compare it to a nuclear charge you might find on an actual

333
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,307
核爆能量进行比较
Orion Spacecraft system.

334
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,408
核脉冲飞船模拟器已准备就绪
Our Orion spacecraft simulator is rigged and ready to go.

335
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,789
我们将在内部燃火  使其在空中爆炸
We're going to light off the charges inside, blow the can up into the air,

336
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,080
将其与核脉冲形式推进中
and compare that with the energy release from a

337
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,470
核爆炸所产生的能量进行比较
typical nuclear explosion that would be used on an Orion-style drive.

338
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:25,922
十九世纪五十年代后期
The Orion Spacecraft,

339
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:29,393
洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室所研制的核脉冲飞船
studied at Los Alamos in the late 1950s,

340
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:33,573
计划将核裂变作为推动力能源
proposed nuclear fission as its propulsion source.

341
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:41,596
裂变能量来自于原子核分解时
Fission energy is produced when the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts,

342
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,216
释放出中子与质子
producing free neutrons and protons

343
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,556
并产生大量的伽马射线能量
and release tremendous γ ray energy.

344
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,909
炸药使这个重达16公斤的罐子
The explosive charge in this 35-pound barrel

345
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,370
冲到高空约18米处
lofted it about 60 feet in the air.

346
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,130
而在广岛着陆的小型核弹能够
A small nuclear charge in the Hiroshima range would liberate

347
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:11,171
释放出约2,700万倍的能量
about 27 million times more energy.

348
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,911
显而易见  这是保证星体间航行
Clearly, that's a practical propulsion drive for

349
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:17,502
甚至星际航行的推进驱动力
interplanetary or even interstellar travel.

350
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:23,233
由于飞船尾部核脉冲推进需要大爆炸的冲击力
Because of the huge explosions that an Orion Drive would require, on the back of the spacecraft,

351
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:28,004
用以吸收爆炸冲击力的大块厚实金属板
you would have a huge, thick metal plate that would absorb the thrust of the explosion

352
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,945
以及一系列的冲击波吸收器便是不可缺少的
and a series of shock absorbers to keep the crews from

353
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:34,465
它们将船员与爆炸后的余震隔离
getting jolted each time the charges went off.

354
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:38,886
核裂变能源飞船的最大速度
The max speed of a nuclear-powered fission spacecraft--

355
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,187
大约是光速的5%
About 5% the speed of light.

356
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:45,838
最大速度  每秒1.5万公里

357
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,618
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri--

358
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:48,468
大约需要90年
About 90 years.

359
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:50,268
最大速度  每秒1.5万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  90年

360
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,019
若不是能量来源十分强大
Despite its powerful fuel source,

361
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:56,679
裂变飞船比还太阳帆要慢
the fission craft is actually slower than a solar sail.

362
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,520
加快速度意味着
Boosting speed would mean

363
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:03,661
它需要另种更剧烈的核反应
turning to another, more intense nuclear reaction.

364
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,242
人们熟知核裂变技术
Fission technology is well known and understood.

365
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:10,242
使用其制造能源已有几十年
And we've been using it to generate power here on Earth for decades,

366
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,653
但还存在另一种核技术
But there is another kind of nuclear technology,

367
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:14,523
即核聚变
and that is nuclear fusion.

368
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:21,694
太阳的能量来自于核聚变
Fusion is the power source of the Sun.

369
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:24,445
太阳核心的温度非常高
In the core of our Sun, the temperatures are so high,

370
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:28,306
原子们的剧烈运动导致其互相撞击
atoms are moving so fast that they slam into each other,

371
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:31,796
产生新的元素并释放能量
creating new elements and liberating energy.

372
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:34,857
与裂变相反
The opposite of fission,

373
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:40,378
当两个原子熔合成单个新超重原子时
fusion energy is produced when two atomic nuclei fuse together

374
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:43,128
就产生了聚变能
to form a single heavier nuclear.

375
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:47,569
从而释放出巨大能量
The result is a huge liberation of energy.

376
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,880
十九世纪七十年代的"戴德拉斯工程"
A fusion-powered spacecraft was proposed in a 1970s study

377
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:56,981
计划研究聚变能飞船
called "Project Daedelus."

378
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:00,112
其任务是造访巴纳德星
It's mission called for a trip to Barnard's star,

379
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:03,772
距地球约5.9光年
some 5.9 light years distant.

380
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,333
与核弹不同的是
Instead of nuclear bombs,

381
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,933
核聚能太空船的推进力
the fusion-powered craft creates the propulsion

382
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:12,094
源于一个反应箱
on board in a reaction chamber.

383
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,745
戴德拉斯级太空船的燃料球芯块
The fuel pellets for the Daedelus class starship

384
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:19,925
由氘-氦3的混合芯块组成
consisted of pellets composed of a deuterium-helium-3 mix.

385
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:24,036
由相对论性电子束激发
These would have been ignited by what we call relativistic electron beams.

386
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:26,567
这些含有极高能量的电子
These are extremely high energy electrons

387
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,457
击中氘-氦-3芯块
that would have hit the deuterium-helium-3 pellets,

388
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,788
致使它们融合
caused them to fuse,

389
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:32,928
并释放出大量能量
and a huge amount of energy would be released.

390
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,239
戴德拉斯需要二百五十个这样的芯块
The Daedelus design called for 250 of these pellets

391
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:39,989
在超过两年的时段中不间断地释放能量
to be released every second for over two years.

392
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,740
太空船将重达五万五千吨
The spacecraft would have weighed 55,000 tons,

393
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,140
其中绝大部分是燃料
most of which would have been fuel.

394
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,561
这个重量对宇宙飞船来说未免太大
The weight penalty for such a spacecraft would be high

395
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:53,712
但有一种先进技术能解决这个问题
but an advanced civilization could eliminate the problem

396
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:58,263
即在星际旅行过程中开采氢燃料
by mining the hydrogen fuel during its interstellar journey.

397
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:02,044
氘  或说重氢
Deuterium, or heavy hydrogen,

398
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:04,394
在地球上储量丰富
exists in abundance on Earth,

399
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:06,105
尤其是在海水中
notably in seawater,

400
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:10,305
但氦3则是更为罕见的同位素
but helium-3 is a much rarer isotope.

401
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,806
它存在于太阳系的月球上
In our Solar System, it can be found on the Moon

402
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:19,006
在木星和土星上的含量则极为丰富
and in vast quantities on Jupiter and Saturn.

403
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:24,288
科学家们提议在穿越物资匮乏的空间时
Scientists have proposed using huge hydrogen scoops

404
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:28,918
使用巨型集氢器来开采氦3
to mine the helium-3 needed to cross the void of space.

405
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,560
请试想
So it's conceivable

406
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,820
如果你有一艘核聚能太空船
that if you had a craft that was powered by nuclear fusion,

407
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,850
进入另一恒星系统时
you could go to another star system,

408
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:40,951
可以利用那颗星球上的氢来补充燃料
and then use the hydrogen available from that star to refuel.

409
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:45,922
设备齐全的聚合能太空船
The self-contained fusion-powered spacecraft

410
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,183
因而可以避免负载巨大的重量
could avoid a huge weight penalty

411
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,433
并以一定速度
and reach speeds

412
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:54,313
在适当的时段内进行近恒星探测
that could allow near-star exploration in a reasonable time frame.

413
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,974
核聚能太空船的最大速度
The max speed of a nuclear-powered fusion spacecraft--

414
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:05,706
最大速度  每秒4.7万公里

415
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,895
能达到光速的百分之十五
up to 15% of the speed of light.

416
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,746
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri--

417
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:08,366
最大速度  每秒4.7万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  约35年

418
00:24:06,036 --> 00:24:09,086
约需三十五年
about 35 years.

419
00:24:10,137 --> 00:24:12,497
核动力航天的巨额花费  所需物流支持
The immense costs, the logistics,

420
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:15,988
甚至国家政策在很久以前
and even the politics of nuclear-powered spaceflight

421
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:20,738
使得所有计划迟迟未能运行
long ago caused humanity to scrap any and all plans.

422
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,766
但是一个足够先进的文明社会
But a sufficiently advanced society

423
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,682
能够利用核动力
could trade nuclear propulsion

424
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,938
达成那些看似不可能的事
for what seems like an impossible paradox--

425
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,798
以光速达到瞬间位移
Traveling at light speed without moving at all.

426
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:43,250
UFO真能以高速
Can UFOs actually achieve the immense speeds

427
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:45,816
完成星际旅行吗
required for interstellar travel?

428
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:49,164
答案也许就埋藏在
One potential answer may be buried

429
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:53,213
美国核心地带的三十英尺之下
30 feet beneath the ground in America's heartland...

430
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,859
就在伊利诺斯州芝加哥郊外的
the Fermilab Tevatron Collider

431
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,114
费米实验室电子伏对撞机
outside Chicago, Illinois.

432
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:05,191
稍慢于光速的质子和反质子
Racing just below the speed of light, particles of protons and antiproton

433
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:08,419
分别由相反的方向发射
are launched in opposing directions.

434
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,716
以高能对撞形式结合
They meet in a high energy collision.

435
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:16,748
这种撞击产生的伽马射线
The impact produces gamma rays--

436
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,544
是宇宙最强的能量源
the highest energy source known in the universe

437
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:24,124
也是实现星际旅行的可能性关键
and potentially the key to interstellar travel.

438
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:29,056
在地球上制造反物质的最佳方法
The best way of making antimatter here on Earth

439
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,099
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

440
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,161
就是采用
is to employ probably

441
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:34,540
爱因斯坦最为出名的方程式
the most famous equation that Einstein taught us,

442
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,504
即质能方程
which is E=mc2,

443
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:41,275
说明一定的质量是可以产生能量的
which tells us that for a certain amount of matter, we can get energy.

444
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:45,024
这个理论因其实际影响重大而意义非凡
It's a great idea because it's incredibly efficient.

445
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:50,245
可以把粒子中所有的质量转化成能量
You essentially take all of the mass in those particles and convert it into energy.

446
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,174
但如果反物质必须由人为产生
But how can antimatter exist in the universe

447
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,352
它怎么会存在于宇宙中呢
if it must be artificially manufactured?

448
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:02,524
这是来自费城的史蒂芬・H
That's the question that Stefan H. from Philadelphia

449
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,639
向宇宙提出的质疑
texted the Universe.

450
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:29,175
反物质是否存在  我们将如何观测
史蒂芬・H  宾夕法尼亚州费城

451
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,658
史蒂芬  反物质是一定存在的
Stefan, antimatter definitely exists,

452
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,823
当它接触普通物质
and when it meets up with normal matter,

453
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:14,080
爆发出强大的电磁辐射
it explodes in a burst of electromagnetic radiation.

454
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:17,609
我们可以在实验室制造少量反物质
Now, we can make small bits of antimatter in laboratories,

455
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,246
但也可以从太空中收集
but we can also collect antimatter from space.

456
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,043
某些带电的宇宙光
Some cosmic rays, which are charged,

457
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,830
来自太空的高能粒子
very energetic particles coming from space,

458
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:29,326
的确是由反物质组成
actually consist of antimatter.

459
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,107
目前  超级对撞机是唯一
Currently, the super-collider is the only

460
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,975
在实际中生产反物质的方法
practical way to produce antimatter.

461
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:42,837
而如今它的数量有限
And right now it's created in very small quantities.

462
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,180
如果我们能找到
If we could figure out a way

463
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:47,529
生产和储存大量反物质的方法
to both create and store enough antimatter,

464
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,619
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
加利福尼亚人文研究所

465
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:49,733
我们将拥有一种可储存的燃料
we would have a storable fuel which,

466
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,340
当它和普通物质混合时
when mixed with ordinary matter,

467
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,163
将释放出巨大能量
would liberate a huge amount of energy

468
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:58,874
比核裂变或是核聚合更有效
at a rate way beyond what either fission or fusion can do.

469
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:03,716
因为反物质是存在于世的
Because we know antimatter exists

470
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:07,324
我们可以生产并将其储存
and we know antimatter can be created and stored,

471
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,223
也许某种先进文明
it is conceivable that an advanced civilization

472
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:12,285
理查德・奥伯塞
理论物理学家

473
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:14,481
可以生产并利用反物质能量
could create and harness the power of antimatter

474
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:18,089
用其制造一枚反物质火箭
in sufficient quantities to create an antimatter rocket.

475
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:24,143
一艘反物质飞船可以达到不可思议的速度
An antimatter ship could achieve unbelievable velocities,

476
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,859
仅次于光速
cruising just below light speed,

477
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:31,200
与穿过银河系的粒子束速度不相上下
nearly matching the speed of a star beam streaking across the galaxy.

478
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,610
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星的行程时间
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri

479
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:38,296
最大速度  每秒28.5万公里

480
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:37,685
即通过4.5光年的路程
4 1/2 light years distant--

481
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:40,982
最大速度  每秒28.5万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  5年

482
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,639
大约需要5年
about 5 years.

483
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:43,268
人类无法想象
In human terms,

484
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:46,245
生产足够的反物质微粒
the cost of creating enough antimatter particles

485
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:49,852
来运作这样一艘星际飞船所需经费
to power such a starship would be astronomical.

486
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:54,273
也许外星人财力雄厚  足以承担
It might be affordable in alien currency,

487
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:59,264
但制造一艘反物质太空船所需代价太大
but an antimatter spacecraft like this comes at a high price.

488
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:04,266
来自于反物质动力的伽马射线危害极大
The gamma rays from antimatter propulsion are so dangerous,

489
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:08,757
它们会摧毁飞船上所有生物细胞结构
they could destroy the cell structure of any living beings aboard ship.

490
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:13,377
星际飞船上必须有一个先进的防护装置
This starship would have to include an advanced shielding mechanism

491
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:16,245
以保障船员的生命安全
to keep the crew alive.

492
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:19,371
其行驶速度飞快
And at such high rates of speed,

493
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:23,110
对宇宙有一定破坏作用
there are equally destructive threats in the universe.

494
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:27,160
宇宙空间浩瀚无边
Space is pretty empty,

495
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,294
但如果以近光速行驶于其中
but if you were moving close to the speed of light,

496
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:33,073
露丝安妮・沃克薇姿
普林斯顿大学

497
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:31,951
就需要一个极佳的防护系统
you'd need an extremely effective shielding system

498
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:35,268
免其遭受星际尘粒的破坏
that would allow you to be protected from interstellar dust particles

499
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,987
它们几乎可以摧毁一艘光速行驶的太空船
that would all but annihilate a spacecraft traveling that fast.

500
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,447
但是如果太空垃圾如此危险
But if space debris is so dangerous,

501
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:45,923
何不避而远之呢
why not avoid it completely?

502
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:50,764
解决方案和星际迷航粉丝的想法有些类似
The solution might be one familiar to Star Trek fans,

503
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:52,690
即星际飞船
namely a starship that

504
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,287
以光速达成瞬间位移
could achieve light speed without even moving.

505
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:00,126
实际上可以制造一种曲速泡
In effect, one would create what is called a "Warp bubble"--

506
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:02,281
这名字源于科幻小说
the name taken straight out of science fiction--

507
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:07,012
就是当一艘太空船稳坐于这个扁平泡内
and that would involve compressing a region of space-time in front of a spacecraft

508
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:11,021
将太空船前某一范围内的时空压缩
and expanding a region of space-time behind a spacecraft

509
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:16,023
并扩大其后某范围内的时空
while the spacecraft itself sat stationary inside this flat bubble.

510
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:20,262
如此就能有效地驾驭时空波浪
So one would effectively be riding a wave of space-time.

511
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,758
曲速引擎就像一种纯粹理想化的实验状态
A warp drive may seem like pure Sci-Fi fantasy...

512
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:31,349
但在1994年  一位广受尊重的年轻物理学家
But in 1994, a well-respected young physicist

513
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,454
米给尔・阿库别瑞
named Miguel Alcubierre

514
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:36,119
发表了一份重大提议概述
published a serious proposal outlining

515
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,491
曲速引擎  广义相对论范围内的超速旅行

516
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,447
如何在受控的空间扭曲穿梭
how to travel in a controllable space warp.

517
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,317
阿库别瑞的曲速引擎还存在许多难题
There are huge obstacles to Alcubierre's warp-drive solution.

518
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,916
最大的障碍便是"暗能量"
The biggest is called "Dark energy"...

519
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:56,477
有三位科学家在2011年
A cosmic phenomenon recognized in 2011

520
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:59,433
发现并证明了这一宇宙现象
when three scientists were awarded the Nobel prize

521
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,779
并因此获得诺贝尔奖
for proving its existence.

522
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,260
关于暗能量现象
The simplest explanation that's been proposed

523
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,835
最简单的解释就是
for the phenomenon of dark energy is that

524
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:13,166
空间自身的固有特性
there's an intrinsic property of space itself

525
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:16,223
令其趋向扩张膨胀
that makes it want to expand.

526
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:20,912
通过观察宇宙已逝去的时空
You can actually see it by looking at receding parts of the universe

527
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:24,271
以及额外的加速度便可知晓
and seeing that there's this extra acceleration component,

528
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:26,868
但又不像太阳能或其他能源
but it isn't a stored energy source

529
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:30,014
它并非可储存能源
like solar energy or other kinds of energy.

530
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,212
所以它也不是那么匪夷所思
And so it's not inconceivable--

531
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:35,708
宇宙某个角落
it's not beyond the realms of possibility

532
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,492
应该存在某种先进文明
that some advanced civilization

533
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:40,188
已然将暗能量技术谙熟于心
existing somewhere in the universe has learned

534
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,890
并利用其制造另种形式的动力
how to harness dark energy to create an exotic form of propulsion.

535
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:49,761
但实际上  曲速引擎还存在另一个障碍
But there's another obstacle to a workable warp drive.

536
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:54,261
利用扭曲将太空船往前推动的唯一办法
The only known way to pull a spacecraft forward within a warp

537
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:58,810
需要利用黑洞的剧烈能量
requires harnessing the intense energy of a black hole.

538
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:02,720
简单来说就是
The sort of simple notion is somehow

539
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:05,486
用某种方法制造一种高浓缩物质
to make a very concentrated bit of matter,

540
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:09,565
极度浓缩至可以产生黑洞
extremely concentrated, on the level which would cause a black hole.

541
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:14,066
如果能制造出一个小型黑洞
If you could generate a black hole on a small scale, so to speak,

542
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,392
让它悬浮在飞船前方
you could dangle it in front of the ship

543
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:20,522
利用它的空间扭曲拖动飞船缓缓前行
and use its space distortion to sort of drag the ship along.

544
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,989
由曲速引擎推动的外星飞船
And exactly how fast could a warp drive tow

545
00:31:23,991 --> 00:31:26,346
到底有多快
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

546
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,669
阿库别瑞在文中明显提出了以下观点
The clear implication of Alcubierre's work was that it should be possible,

547
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:35,627
如果你能设计出曲速引擎
if you can make this design of a warp drive,

548
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:41,198
其速度就能达到光速的任意倍
to achieve speeds almost any multiple of the speed of light.

549
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:45,109
一艘由空间扭曲驱动的光速飞船
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri

550
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,286
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星的时间
aboard a light speed craft powered by a space warp--

551
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,898
最大速度  每秒至少29.9万公里

552
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,562
约四年半
about 4 1/2 years...

553
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,362
最大速度  每秒至少29.9万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  至多4.5年

554
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:55,904
只要能保障船内人员安全  时间可以更短
or less, as long as everyone on board doesn't incinerate.

555
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:01,686
阿库别瑞的引擎存在一个问题
One problem with the Alcubierre drive is within that warp bubble,

556
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:04,012
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

557
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:05,355
曲速泡中的温度远比太阳内核要高
temperatures would rise to far hotter than the core of our Sun.

558
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:06,619
非常热
That's hot.

559
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:14,718
到达地球之前还有一个小问题
Just one more small problem to solve for the chance to reach planet Earth.

560
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:20,110
如果一艘将要抵达地球大气层的外星飞船
But what if such an alien spacecraft were to arrive in earth's atmosphere,

561
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,714
在曲速泡中行驶
riding in a warp bubble,

562
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,599
被黑洞拖着呢
towed by a black hole?

563
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,956
即使这并非拥有众多目击证人的首例
It might not be the first mass-witness UFO sighting,

564
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:30,564
但一定会是最后一次
but it would certainly be the last.

565
00:32:35,277 --> 00:32:38,082
1997年3月13日
March 13, 1997...

566
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,639
成千上万人目睹了一次光学现象
thousands of people witness an optical phenomenon

567
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:44,757
漂浮在亚利桑那州的上空
drifting across the Arizona skies.

568
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:50,330
有关几何形亮点的消息传得沸沸扬扬
Reports of a series of bright lights in geometric patterns are widespread,

569
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:52,887
包括多人目睹一艘身长1.6公里
including multiple sightings over Phoenix

570
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,314
并伴有规律性灯光闪烁的太空船
of a craft up to a mile wide with lights

571
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:59,421
出现在凤凰城上空
winking on and off in sequence.

572
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,138
重现当晚的景象
Reconstructing the events of that evening,

573
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,385
那次凤凰城的闪烁灯光就是
the lights of the phoenix lights were almost certainly

574
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:07,109
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

575
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:08,932
空军战机A-10抛出的信号弹
flares dropped by an air force A-10 aircraft,

576
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:14,315
加之人类会将其联想为一个实体外形
in conjunction with the human tendency to envision a solid shape connecting them.

577
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,254
这才是凤凰城灯光事件的最好解释
That's the best explanation for the Phoenix lights.

578
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:23,136
对很多人来说  凤凰城灯光事件正是
For many, the Phoenix lights incident was

579
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:27,927
巨型宇宙飞船曾造访此地的直接佐证
direct proof that a huge extraterrestrial craft had arrived.

580
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,216
有人甚至将其称为母舰
Some even called it a mother ship.

581
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,134
母舰存在的目的
The purpose of an extraterrestrial mother ship

582
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,963
是外星人造访理论的基础
is fundamental to the theories of alien visitation.

583
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:45,228
这是穿越星际空间中遥远距离的唯一方式
It's the only way to bridge the vast distances of interstellar space.

584
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:47,964
"母舰"这一说法
The term "Mother ship," I think,

585
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:51,412
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
《不明飞行物之科学》作者

586
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:53,156
和"飞碟"这个词是在同一时期出现的
came into being around the same time that "Flying saucers" as a term came into being.

587
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,772
大众普遍认为
And I think the universal notion

588
00:33:55,773 --> 00:34:00,332
仅能容下一人的航空器无法完成星际旅行
was you couldn't make an interstellar trip in a person-sized craft.

589
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,887
一定得是巨型飞船
You have to have something really large.

590
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,009
母舰就如地球上的航空母舰一样
An apt earthly analogy of a mother ship is that of an aircraft carrier.

591
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:08,542
理查德・奥博塞
理论物理学家

592
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:11,538
航空母舰穿梭于大洋之间
An aircraft carrier travels the vast distances across the oceans,

593
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,137
其目的则是运载小型战机
but its purpose is to transport smaller aircraft which

594
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:18,394
这样它们便可执行任务等等
can then go on and engage in whatever their missions may be.

595
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:24,037
如果需要成百上千年才能抵达地球
If the journey to Earth is long, on the order of centuries or even millennia,

596
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:29,490
母舰会比航空母舰有更多的功能
the mother ship would be much more than just an aircraft carrier.

597
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:33,550
这是一艘"方舟"
There's the generational or "Ark ship,"

598
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,207
它是一艘拥有独立生态系统的巨型飞船
Which is a very large spacecraft that is essentially an enclosed ecosystem,

599
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,760
居民会在船舱内生老病死
in which generations of inhabitants expect to be born, grow old, and die

600
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:47,482
直至很长时间后抵达最终目的地
over the long period it takes the spacecraft to reach its ultimate destination.

601
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,762
利用"假死"技术
Perhaps with technology, such as suspended animation,

602
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:55,651
外星乘客会进入睡眠状态
biological alien passengers could be put to sleep

603
00:34:56,073 --> 00:34:59,019
直到长途旅行结束时再苏醒
and revived after the vast journey.

604
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,128
若要在这一航行中幸存下来
Surviving such a journey would also mean

605
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:08,410
就要能承受住推动飞船航行的破坏性能量
surviving the destructive energy powering the spacecraft itself.

606
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:12,429
其中一种合理的设计
One logical design solution,

607
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,415
是雪茄形的母舰
a cigar-shaped mother ship,

608
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:18,664
正是众多不明飞行物目击者声称所看到的
is precisely what many UFO witnesses claim to have seen.

609
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:22,934
对任何一种先进动力系统来说
For any advanced propulsion system,

610
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,253
都会尽可能让船员远离
you would want to situate the crew as far away as possible

611
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,417
引擎动力源
from the engine source.

612
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:31,985
所以飞船都是极细长的设计
So one possible design would be a very long, thin design,

613
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:34,992
引擎置于在飞船尾端
with the engine located at one end of the spacecraft

614
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,129
其间用某种框架将船员区尽可能地
and then some kind of truss connecting the crew section

615
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:39,533
与这种先进动力装置隔开
as far away as possible

616
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:42,740
以避免高能中子
so as to avoid damage from high-energy neutrons,

617
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:46,078
X射线以及伽玛射线对人体的损害
x-rays, or gamma rays from the advanced propulsion system.

618
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:50,919
倘若此种方舟曾抵达地球
If such ark ships have in fact visited planet earth,

619
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:55,169
它们所留下的痕迹则是无法磨灭的
the evidence would be overwhelming and undeniable.

620
00:35:57,245 --> 00:36:00,912
所有外星先进的推进技术有一个共同点
Something all these exotic and advanced propulsion technologies have in common

621
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:04,371
即它们都能辐射出巨大能量
is that they all radiate prodigious amounts of energy,

622
00:36:04,452 --> 00:36:06,165
因此就算隔了几光年的距离
and so we'd be able to see them,

623
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,889
我们也能观测到
like beacons on a lighthouse,

624
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:10,203
就像灯塔上的信号灯一样
from sometimes light years away.

625
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:13,561
X射线束  伽玛射线束
The concentrated emission of x-rays, gamma rays,

626
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,856
甚至次原子微粒团都是可疑现象
or subatomic particles would be suspicious,

627
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,516
因为这些都不是地球上
'cause we don't see that in our environment locally

628
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:22,152
所常见的现象
under any normal circumstances.

629
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,169
除去肉眼所能见到的迹象
Beyond the obvious visual evidence,

630
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:27,424
一艘母舰
the physical effect of a mother ship

631
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:29,760
靠近地球表面所产生的物理效应
approaching so close to the Earth's surface

632
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,569
能导致一场大灾难
could be a terrifying form of apocalypse.

633
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:37,828
若出于某种原因
If, for whatever reason,

634
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,488
该外星文明没有关闭引擎
this extraterrestrial technology or civilization chose not to turn off their engines,

635
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,804
地球生物则会经历一场浩劫
it could be catastrophic for life on Earth,

636
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:49,665
受到高能中子  X射线以及伽玛射线的荼毒
as we would be bathed in high-energy neutrons, x-rays, and gamma rays.

637
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:53,494
若是某种"曲速飞行"
If it's something which is a version of a warp drive,

638
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:56,171
那么就会产生空间畸变
then you're talking about space distortion, and

639
00:36:56,393 --> 00:37:00,932
就不能接近大质量的物体  包括星球
you wouldn't want to be too close to any major mass, including the planet.

640
00:37:03,258 --> 00:37:05,853
这种劫难访问说认为
Such catastrophic visitations assume that

641
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:11,004
外星人甘愿舍身于外太空只为造访地球
aliens are willing to risk their own lives in interstellar space...

642
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,352
但是或许还有更好的方法
But there might be a better way...

643
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,678
他们可以待在自己的星球上
They could stay at home...

644
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,730
利用智能机器人来探索宇宙奥秘
and explore the cosmos using a race of thinking machines.

645
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:36,163
对于不明飞行物的众多狂热爱好者来说
For many ardent believers in the UFO phenomenon,

646
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:39,821
1947年夏  美国新墨西哥州罗斯威尔
the Roswell, New Mexico, event in the summer of 1947

647
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:44,352
罗斯威尔
市区范围
高空3570

648
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:44,051
是人类史上首次接触外星人
is the defining alien encounter in human history.

649
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:50,466
民间传闻中  有关这次坠毁事件
In popular culture, the most lasting detail from the purported crash

650
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:56,130
最持久不衰的是发现了外星尸体的消息
came from the descriptions of extraterrestrial bodies found at the scene.

651
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:03,035
随后几十年里  这种想象中的"灰种人"
In the ensuing decades, this vision of alien beings, known as "The grays,"

652
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:06,994
常出现在科幻小说中
Became the accepted standard in science fiction

653
00:38:07,697 --> 00:38:10,132
或是外星人事件报道里
and recurring alien-encounter reports.

654
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:14,583
硕大的头部也许解释了
The oversized heads may explain

655
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:20,046
我们所预料的外星人特征  即它们智商过人
an expected feature in alien biology-- Greater intelligence.

656
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:23,664
与人类相比  头骨越大脑容量越大
The larger skulls would contain larger, more advanced brains

657
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,069
大脑更发达
compared to ours.

658
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,640
在星际航行中要解决棘手问题
Mastering the profound challenges of interstellar travel

659
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,597
固然需要更加智能的物种
would certainly require great intelligence,

660
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:38,939
但它还需要超出有机生物系统的元素吗
but might it require something that is beyond organic biology?

661
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:43,719
科幻小说中包含的误重大误区
One area of science fiction where we might be making kind of a big mistake

662
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:45,745
赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

663
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:48,921
即我们将外星人臆想成某种生物体
is to assume that the aliens are biological, that they're living things.

664
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:54,826
我认为  有很多种有机体
I think that the possibilities for the kinds of organisms

665
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,199
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
加利福尼亚人文研究所

666
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:58,684
可以进行星际航行
which might travel between the stars are really wide open.

667
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,391
可能在科幻小说中所提及的
And one possibility that has appeared on occasion in

668
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:04,247
实际上是指智能机器人
science fiction is machine intelligence.

669
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:08,978
根据近期出现的方程  即摩尔定律
According to a recent earthly equation known as Moore's Law,

670
00:39:09,451 --> 00:39:12,657
单机芯片上的晶体管数量
the number of transistors on a single computer chip

671
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,833
每18个月增加一倍
doubles every 18 months,

672
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:18,751
意味着计算机处理速率也会快一倍
meaning computer processing speed doubles.

673
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,531
这种趋势已持续了半个世纪以上
This trend has continued for more than half a century and

674
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:27,260
至少要延至2020年以后
is expected to continue through 2020 or later.

675
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:31,170
处理速率的爆炸式增长
The exponential explosion of processing speed

676
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:34,347
为以"人工智能"为题材的科幻小说
is opening the door on a staple of science fiction

677
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:37,014
开启了一道大门
called "Artificial Intelligence."

678
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,866
如果你发明了一台智能机器  一百年之后
So, if you invent a thinking machine, 100 years later,

679
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:44,501
它不止是比你要聪明
that machine is not only smarter than you are,

680
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,817
它还比此前任何人都要聪明
it's smarter than all humans that have ever lived.

681
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:47,910
这就是人工智能
And that's the difference

682
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,725
与真正人的智力之间的差别
between artificial intelligence and real intelligence.

683
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:54,404
人工智能能够飞速进化
Artificial intelligence can evolve enormously faster.

684
00:39:55,328 --> 00:39:59,667
但最令我们担心又期待的在于
But I think the form of AI that we find most both menacing and promising

685
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:03,655
人工智能既能够像人脑般运作
is the kind of AI that could in fact do what our brains can do,

686
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:06,051
又具备人类的思维
can think the way we can think.

687
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:11,293
在斯坦福大学的人工智能实验室中
At Stanford university's artificial intelligence laboratory,

688
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:16,224
智能机器的发展趋势就是这种倾向
the future of truly intelligent machines is rapidly approaching.

689
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,973
以下难点使得人工智能变得十分棘手
There are a few things that make AI difficult.

690
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,391
即我们不知如何去改进计算机
One is we don't really know yet how to make computers learn as

691
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:25,637
让它的学习效率变得和人类一样
effectively as humans can.

692
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,824
似乎现代计算机运行速度受限仅仅是因为
It seems that our computers today just aren't as fast as we

693
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:31,971
人类不愿让它们模仿其认知过程
would like them to get to simulate the learning processes

694
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,047
进而取代人脑
that take place in the human brain.

695
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,951
人工智能实验室

696
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,111
斯坦福的学生设计了一台击打型机器臂
To demonstrate early-stage artificial intelligence,

697
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:43,608
来演示人工智能研究的初期成效
Stanford students designed a fighting robot--

698
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,116
是一台在击打中学习的智能机
One that attempts to learn as it fights.

699
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,145
它现在在做的是  自我防守
Okay, so what it's doing now-- It's trying to defend itself,

700
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:53,141
它会随着您的动作作出反应
so it's reacting to your motion.

701
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:56,198
即这个机器人会根据您手中剑的走向
So, depending on how you move your sword,

702
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:59,685
对您的动作行为作出反应
the robot will adapt to your motion and to your behavior.

703
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:03,956
研发此类机器人对于真正人工智能的意义
How important a step on the road to true artificial intelligence

704
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:06,632
有多深远呢  托尔斯滕
are robots like this, Torsten?

705
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:11,112
我们在这里运用的人工智能方案
So here we are using artificial-intelligence methods,

706
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:14,530
比如认知方案  是让机器人适应其周围环境
like learning methods, to adapt to the environment of the robot,

707
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:19,561
但我们对机器人的真实想法无从了解
but we are still not at a stage where the robot is really thinking.

708
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:24,133
现代计算机的智能依旧不及普通人类
Today's computers are still far less intelligent than almost any human.

709
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:28,813
但着眼于未来  我相信计算机最终
But in the future, I think computers could eventually

710
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:31,720
能达到甚至超越人类智力
reach, and maybe even surpass, human intelligence.

711
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:35,187
倘若真到了这一步  设想每人的钱包里
And if that's the case, imagine that each of us has a computer

712
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,373
都有台电脑  在手机或钱包里都可以
in our wallet--a cell phone or wallet--

713
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,490
智力能与爱因斯坦相抗衡  甚至超越他
That was as smart as Einstein or even smarter.

714
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:42,045
整个文明将会怎样变化
How will civilization change,

715
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:44,229
那时的人类又会做出怎样的创举呢
and what are the amazing things we could do then?

716
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:48,449
这种击打型机器人引领世界尖端科技
Advanced as it is on Earth, the fencing robot is

717
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,007
它是能够适用于星际航空器中的
but a crude analogy for the type of machine intelligence that

718
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,673
人工智能机的简单模拟
could pilot an interstellar spacecraft.

719
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:01,007
智能机的革新将首次接触
The immense obstacles of space travel,

720
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,436
星际航行中的大问题
including the sheer time scale and cosmic hazards,

721
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:10,471
包括时标偏离及宇宙无尽凶险
build a strong case that a race of intelligent machines will make first contact.

722
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,850
但话说回来  倘若真的存在星际航行一说
But honestly, if interstellar travel really takes place,

723
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:19,761
送出非生物体才是明智之举
it seems sort of reasonable to not send the biological beings.

724
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:22,407
因为生物体的生命力有限  经不起这样的折腾
I mean, they're fragile. They have finite lifetimes.

725
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:26,647
在美国宇航局领先于人类探索
Just as NASA sends robotic probes to explore the Solar

726
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:28,763
将勘探机器人送去探测太阳系之际
System in advance of human explorers,

727
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,057
兴许我们会通过外星来的勘探机器人
our first contact with an alien civilization

728
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:33,362
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

729
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:33,362
与异星文明发生首次碰触
may be with its robotic probes.

730
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:38,113
它究竟是生物体还是人工智能体
Biologic being or AI super being?

731
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:41,211
我们的憧憬在与其首次接触前
Our vision of an extraterrestrial will remain

732
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:45,430
都属于纯粹的臆测
mere speculation until first contact is made.

733
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:49,049
但我们要等多久呢
But how long will we wait?

734
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:51,034
撇开缺失确凿证据不说
And despite a lack of hard evidence,

735
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,778
异域智慧文明
just how likely is the

736
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,076
存在的可能性有多大呢
existence of another intelligent civilization?

737
00:42:58,202 --> 00:42:59,965
有人确信
Some believe it is highly likely

738
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,862
宇宙每个角落都有生物存在的迹象
that the universe teems with life.

739
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:07,632
银河星系存在了很长时间
The galaxy has been around for a long time.

740
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:10,169
太阳系虽是悠久
The Solar System's been around for quite a long time,

741
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,943
但也不及它的历史久远
but the galaxy much longer.

742
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:13,577
银河系中的星体
And the stars in it--

743
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:17,345
有许多比太阳和太阳系都要古老
Many of them are much older than the Sun and our Solar System.

744
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:20,031
所以  如果存在异星文明
So the chances are, if civilizations are out there,

745
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:22,558
它们应该比人类文明要源远流长得多
they've been around for longer than we have.

746
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,102
倘若真的存在  就说有十万年了吧
If they exist, say, for 100,000 years,

747
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,897
这种异域文明间的碰触几率就非常大了
then the chances are pretty good, I think,

748
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:29,132
它们应该掌握了 能在宇宙间交流的方式
they will have learned to either communicate

749
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:32,330
甚至是星际航行技术
across interstellar space or possibly travel.

750
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:36,129
而在首次接触之前
Until first contact occurs,

751
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,288
人类只能继续仰望星空搜寻不明飞行物
humanity will continue to scan the skies for UFOs.

752
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:44,729
目前依然无从证明外星飞船的存在
None have been proven to be extraterrestrial craft so far,

753
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:49,008
但这并不是否认人类总有一天会
but that does not rule out the possibility that humanity may

754
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:52,656
发现智慧文明存在的痕迹
one day discover evidence of an intelligent civilization,

755
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,581
也许它就在苍穹尽头的某处
they were on heavens,

756
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,258
更靠近它们家园的地方
or much closer to home.
