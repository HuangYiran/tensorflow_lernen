1
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,299
你在这儿啊
There you are.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,469
嗨, 我只是想偷闲呼吸一下新鲜空气
Hey, I was just stealing a breath of fresh air.

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,888
我原以为你在探测这个城市
I thought you were off exploring the city.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,056
正准备去
About to.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,769
我在大陆找到了这个athosians人做的
I picked this up on the mainland.
The athosians made it.

6
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,605
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,780
很漂亮
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,574
你是怎么知道我的生日的?
How did you find out?

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,910
这我可不会说
Mum's the word.

10
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:47,713
行了, 我们已经检查完生活区了
继续前进
All right, we're done with the living quarters.
We're moving on.

11
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:51,425
等, 等, 等一下, 在你走之前
告诉我你有没有发现比我们现在更好的住处?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, before you go,
did you see any better than our current quarters?

12
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:52,552
有一些
A few.

13
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:54,387
实际上, 其中有几个相当不错
Some of them are pretty nice, actually.

14
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,514
那好, 他们的面积大概有多大?
Well, what kind of square footage
are we talking about?

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,266
我是谁, 你的房产经纪人么, Rodney?
What am I, your realtor, Rodney?

16
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:01,477
我们来这里是要解开Atlantis的秘密
We're here to unlock the secrets of Atlantis.

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,065
没错, 是这样, 我正在找一个带书房的单人卧室
最好还带个阳台, 不过这个我不强求
Yeah, well, I'm looking for a one-bedroom with a den.
Preferably with a balcony, but I'm not married to it.

18
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,900
长官, 来看这个
Sir, check this out.

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,819
我们最好还是让自己舒服一点
至少在幽灵来这以前...
We might as well be comfortable,
at least until the Wraith get here...

20
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,279
别说了, 等一下
shut up for a second.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,419
怎么了? 看到什么了?
What? What is it?

22
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,671
某种实验室
Some sort of laboratory.

23
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:31,465
我们已经碰到很多了
这个城市里到处都是
We've come across dozens of those.
The city's full of them.

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,426
这个有什么不寻常么?
Something unusual about it?

25
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:53,362
我想我得说... 是的
I'd have to say... yes.

26
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:54,792
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第15集 在我沉睡之前
Season 1: Episode 15 Before I Sleep

27
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,020
听着, 我们不能就这样整天站在这里看着她
Well, we could stand here looking at her all day.

28
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,565
我们要做的是把她弄出这个箱子
What we've got to do is get her out of this box.

29
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,943
Rodney, 我们不能冒那个险
看看她. 她至少有100岁了
Rodney, we can't take that chance.
Look at her. She's at least 100 years old.

30
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,778
这也就是为什么
我们现在要分秒必争了
Which is why every second counts.

31
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,655
我的意思是, 在我们还在这里争论时
她随时可能倒下死掉
I mean, she could drop dead while we stand here arguing.

32
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,615
她怎么可能死掉? 你说过她已经被冷冻了
How can she drop dead? You said she was frozen.

33
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,617
从技术上说, 她的新陈代谢处于停滞状态
Technically, she's in a state of metabolic stasis.

34
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,412
是的, 老化会在很大程度上得以延缓
不过不是完完全全的停止
Aging slowed considerably,
yes, but not entirely suspended.

35
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,414
你是在说这个女人还活着?
You are saying this woman is still alive?

36
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:29,041
是的
生命信号系统指示还有生命迹象
Yes.
Life-sign systems indicate viability.

37
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,670
根据我能够得到的原始数据
她在那个地方已经呆了一万年了
According to the initial data I've been able to access,
she's been in that chamber for 10,000 years.

38
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,213
一万年?
10,000 years?

39
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,092
看上去还没有超过9000年
Doesn't look a day over 9,000.

40
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,262
从她现在的样子判断, 她会继续以极慢的速度老去
直到最终走向死亡
She'll continue to age at a very slow rate
until she dies, which, judging by the look of her,

41
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:45,183
看上去更像是这马上就要发生, 而不是再过一段时间
我坚持我最初的观点
seems more likely to occur sooner rather than
later, bringing me back to my original point.

42
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,225
看看他
Look at her.

43
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,353
她太老了, 我担心她会在复苏的过程中死去
She's so old, I'm afraid the process
of reviving her might actually kill her.

44
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,733
我们不能再让
同一个活生生的古人交谈的机会
We cannot let this chance to talk to a living,
breathing ancient slip through our fingers.

45
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:54,609
从我们的手中滑过
Again.

46
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,985
那么我们谁知道她还记得些什么?
And who knows what state of mind she'll be in?

47
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,738
更不用提她还可能携带有某种恐怖的传染病了
Not to mention the fact she might carrying
some horrifying contagion.

48
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,031
谁知道她对这个城市了解多少?
And who knows what she knows about our city?

49
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,241
更重要的是
她还有可能知道周围哪里存放有ZPM
More importantly,
does she know about any ZPMs lying around?

50
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,368
啊, 这有可能
Ah, there's a thought.

51
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,790
- 唤醒她
- 但是, 博士
- Revive her.
- But, doctor

52
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,667
- 这是我的命令
- 谢谢
- That's my call.
- Thank you.

53
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,383
我一直认为这个城市被遗弃了
And all the time we thought the city was abandoned.

54
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,387
有没有可能亚特兰蒂斯人在离开这里
前往地球的时候把她留下了?
Is it possible the atlantians left her behind
when they abandoned the city for Earth?

55
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,389
也许是她自己想留下
Maybe she wanted to stay behind.

56
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,891
也许是他们把她给忘了
Maybe they forgot about her.

57
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,227
如果是那样, 当她醒来时
肯定会非常愤怒
In which case, she's going to be
really pissed when she wakes up.

58
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,521
如果她能记起所有事情的话
If she remembers anything at all.

59
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,825
呼吸很浅
Breathing shallow.

60
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,411
脉搏很快
Pulse rapid.

61
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,541
我要用脑电图描记器来检查一下脑部的活动
I'll run an E.E.G. To determine any brain activity.

62
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,921
这是什么?
What is it?

63
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,840
我不知道
I don't know.

64
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,095
星际之门的拨号地址, 一共有五个
Gate addresses, five of them.

65
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,139
M7G 677. 我们到过那个星球
M7G 677. We've been to this planet.

66
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,724
Weir博士...
Dr. Weir...

67
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,317
你好
Hello.

68
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,195
你能听到我的声音么?
Can you hear me?

69
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,324
是的, 我怕的就是这个
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

70
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,118
冷冻损伤
Freezer burn.

71
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,744
我想她没有被冻僵
I thought she wasn't frozen.

72
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,205
一万年了, 你还想她能够起来活蹦乱跳?
10,000 years, you expect her to dance a bloody jig?

73
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,833
没错, 不过我想说的是眼睛, Carson.
你看看她的眼睛
Yeah, but it's the eyes, Carson.
You got to look at the eyes.

74
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,459
灯还开着, 不过没人在家
(意指老人双眼无神, 灵魂不再)
The lights are on, but nobody's home.

75
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,795
这不需要专业的医学人士就可以知道...
Doesn't take a medical professional to know that...

76
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,923
当然她能够看到我们...
of course she can see us...

77
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,011
而且还可以听见我们
And hear us.

78
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,929
Hello. 感觉怎样?
Hello. How are you feeling?

79
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,605
奏效了
It worked.

80
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,898
什么?
What was that?

81
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,318
- 她说, "奏效了".
- 什么意思?
- She said, "it worked".
- What does that mean?

82
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,153
我的想是某种东西生效了
I assume something worked.

83
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,280
- 是的, 这可真是一针见血
- 谢谢
- Yes, that's very sharp.
- Thank you.

84
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,285
Hello?
Hello?

85
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,955
她睡着了
She fell asleep.

86
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,917
当她状态更稳定一些的时候
把她转到医务室去
When she's a bit more stable,
transfer her to the infirmary,

87
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,753
我要对她全程录像
记录下一切
and I want video on her at all times,
recording everything.

88
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,172
如果她说了什么
我们可能不会有机会听到第二遍了
We might not get a second chance
at anything she may say.

89
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,132
让我们希望我们能够听到第一遍, 哈?
Let's hope we get a first, huh?

90
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,471
太大了, 是么?
Too big, huh?

91
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,390
我并没有说它太大
我只是在指出它的尺寸
I'm not saying it's too big.
I'm just pointing out its dimensions.

92
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,936
- 好吧, 它还不是那么大
- 先生们
- Well, it's not that big
- Gentlemen?

93
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:39,815
我们只是想知道在亚特兰蒂斯
是否还有其他我们尚未发现的被冷冻的人
We were just wondering whether there are
any other frozen bodies out there in Atlantis
that we haven't discovered.

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,859
而我刚才正在说在短期内
我们还没有办法知道
And I was just saying there's no way
of knowing in the short term.

95
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,029
这就好像要去搜索曼哈顿的
每栋建筑物中的每个房间
It'd be like searching every room
in every building in Manhattan.

96
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,614
这很要花些时间
It'll take a while.

97
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,701
天才知道,  还有什么无法显示在
探测器上的惊人的东西在那儿等着我们
God knows what other kinds of surprises
are out there, not showing up on the sensors.

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,787
啊, 那就是我们想要查明的
Ah, that's what we're here to find out.

99
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:53,746
Weir 博士?
Dr. Weir?

100
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,789
什么?
Yes?

101
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:56,749
你最好到医务室来
You'd better come to the infirmary.

102
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,084
我们的病人醒了么?
Is our patient awake?

103
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,003
是的, 而且她说了非常不可思议的事情
Aye, and she's saying the most peculiar things.

104
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,547
马上就到
On our way.

105
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:18,145
她时昏时醒, 仍然很虚弱
不过这个女人身上有点奇怪的东西
She's drifting in and out, still very weak,
but there's something a wee bit odd about this woman.

106
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,148
她叫我Carson.
She called me Carson.

107
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,568
他知道我的名字
She knows my name.

108
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,319
也许是她无意中听到了你和某人的谈话
Maybe she overheard you talking to someone.

109
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,195
不会
No.

110
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,614
当她醒来时, 只有我一个人在这里
I was alone in here when she woke up.

111
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,074
是不是某种潜意识?
What about subconsciously?

112
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:34,078
- 我听说过某些昏迷中的病人能够听到...
- 不不, 不仅仅是这个
- I've heard stories of coma patients
being able to hear...
- No, no, it's more than that.

113
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,247
她知道很多事
She knows things.

114
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,261
你感觉怎样?
How are you feeling?

115
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,471
看着你
Look at you.

116
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,852
我原以为我再也见不到你们当中的任何人了
I didn't think I'd see any of you again.

117
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,317
实在是太想你们了...
Missed you all so terribly...

118
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,529
甚至是你, Rodney.
Even you, Rodney.

119
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,780
你看到了?
You see?

120
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,492
对不起
I'm sorry?

121
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,453
我们认识你吗?
Do we know you?

122
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,829
哦, 当然
Oh, yes.

123
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,044
我就是你, Elizabeth.
I'm you, Elizabeth.

124
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,011
- 时间旅行?
- 她正是这么说的
- Time travel?
- That's what she said.

125
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:32,929
她...
She...

126
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,142
不知怎的通过某种方法回到了过去
当时古人还住在这座城市中
somehow found a way to travel back in time
to when the Ancients inhabited the city.

127
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,769
她是如何...
How did she...

128
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,479
做到的?
do this?

129
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,607
这会是当她再次醒来时
我向她询问的首批问题之一
That will be one of the first questions
I ask her when she wakes up again.

130
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,108
如果她能够再次醒来的话
If she ever wakes up again.

131
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,946
我们不要这么快就排除这种可能性
那就是, 这个女人有可能是, 嗯...
Let's not be too quick to exclude the possibility
that the woman might be, um...

132
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,864
用临床术语怎么说来着?
what is the clinical term?

133
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:52,949
傻子?
Nuts?

134
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:59,664
她可能是有老年痴呆, 是的, 不过这不能解释
她为什么知道那么多关于我们大家的事情
She may be senile, yes, but that doesn't explain
how she knows so much about all of us.

135
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,541
那么时间旅行真的是可能的么?
Is time travel even possible?

136
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:06,128
好吧, 根据爱因斯坦的广义相对论
在物理法则中没有什么可以阻止它的发生
Well, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity,
there's nothing in the laws of physics to prevent it.

137
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,256
不过需要提醒你的是
这是极难实现的
Extremely difficult to achieve, mind you.

138
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:13,970
你需要一定的技术来操纵黑洞, 用它来建立一个虫洞
(这个虫洞)不仅仅是通过了空间的点, 还通过了时间
You need the technology to manipulate
black holes to create wormholes
not only through points in space, but time.

139
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,514
而不是说通过一部漂亮的DeLorean就可以
(DeLorean是《回到未来》三部曲中
可以穿梭时空的一种车子)
Not to mention a really nice DeLorean.

140
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,641
不要跟我谈到那部电影上去
Don't even get me started on that movie.

141
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,142
我喜欢那部电影
I like that movie.

142
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,105
DNA测试结果
Results of the DNA test.

143
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,358
是吻合的
It's a match.

144
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,946
她就是你
She is you.

145
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,749
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

146
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,838
如果她已经在那个休眠室中为我们的到来
已经等了数千年了
If she's been waiting in that stasis chamber
all these millennia for us to arrive,

147
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,091
那为什么系统没有在我们到达这里的时候
试图自动唤醒她？
why didn't the system automatically attempt
to revive her the moment we got here?

148
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,760
答案是: 它确实试过了
Answer: it did.

149
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
我已经回头仔细察看了
从我们来到这里之后的数据记录
I've been going over the data from our arrival.

150
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,806
我们首先注意到的一件事就是
One of the first things we noticed

151
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,310
休眠实验室所在的城市区域
有一个突发的能量波动
was a sudden power surge in the section
of the city where the stasis lab was.

152
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,021
系统曾经试图唤醒他
只是我们不知道
It was trying to revive her,
only we didn't know that.

153
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,025
我们所看到的只是更多的能量正在从
一个几近耗尽的ZPM中流出
All we saw was more power draining
from an already nearly depleted ZPM,

154
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,902
因此我们关闭了所有的次要系统
so we shut down all secondary systems.

155
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,445
我差点杀了她...
I almost killed her...

156
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,030
你
you.

157
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,450
觉得这非常不可思议么?
How weird is that?

158
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,326
是的
Very.

159
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,536
非常非常不可思议
Very, very weird.

160
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,958
看着你自己...
Looking at yourself...

161
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,045
将会变成什么样子...
How you will be...

162
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:34,300
实际上, 今后你的样子和她现在并不相同
Actually, how you will be will be
different than how she is right now.

163
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,553
当她返回过去的同时
也制造了一个分离开的现实
See, the moment she went back in time,
she created a separate reality,

164
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,058
第二个你, 生活在一个... 平行的世界中
a second you, living in a... in a parallel world,

165
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,186
这是基于量子论的其中一个解释
according to one of many
interpretations of quantum theory.

166
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:49,148
我的意思是, 简单的讲,
这个解释认为宇宙, 实际上
I mean, simply put, this interpretation
states that the universe is, in fact,

167
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,152
在决定所对应的每个可能的结果上
分类成无数个自身的副本
split into an infinite number of copies of itself
in which every possible outcome

168
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:58,616
所有曾经做过的决定都会在这个
拥有无限多层次的多重宇宙的某个地方存在着
to every decision ever made all exists somewhere
in this infinitely layered multi-universe.

169
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,662
简单的讲
Simply put.

170
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,372
是的, 简而言之
Yeah, in a nutshell.

171
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,499
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?

172
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,339
我有很多事情要告诉你
There's so much to tell you.

173
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,093
笔记...
The note...

174
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,761
我做过笔记
I had a note.

175
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,720
是的
Yes.

176
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,680
是的, 是的, 是的, 是的
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

177
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,140
我们找到了你的笔记, 请原谅我的率直
We got your note, and forgive my bluntness,

178
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,726
但是我们真的需要知道
你和古人间发生的所有事
but we really need to know everything about
your encounter with the Ancients,

179
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,020
从你发回过去的时刻说起
beginning at the point where you went back in time.

180
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,148
特别是, 你是如何返回过去的
因为那将对我们非常有用
Specifically, how you went back in time,
because that would be very useful for us

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,110
Rodney... 让"我"来说
Rodney... let me talk.

182
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,242
那是一个意外
There was an accident.

183
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,786
我记得...
I remember...

184
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,080
我们通过星际之门来到这里...
We arrived through the Stargate...

185
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,669
灯光自动点亮了...
The lights came on by themselves...

186
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,882
当它们感觉到我们时...
Sensing our presence...

187
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,675
谁干的?
Who's doing that?

188
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,553
城市慢慢的开始苏醒...
The city slowly awoke...

189
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,727
Weir博士, 你得来看看这个
Dr. Weir, you have to see this.

190
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,896
有很多东西我都得去看
There are a lot of things I have to see.

191
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,856
当心点
Just be careful.

192
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,487
这里一定是控制室
This must be the control room.

193
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,740
这, 这很显然是他们的DHD
This, this is obviously their version of a DHD.

194
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,782
噢, 很明显
Oh, obviously.

195
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,536
这个地方可能使能量控制系统
某种类型的计算机接口
This area is probably power control systems,
some sort of a computer interface of some kind.

196
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,163
- 你为什么不研究一下?
- 好的, 看, 这里有问题
- Why don't you find out?
- Well, see, that's the hitch.

197
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,874
我们已经让整个城市的照明系统启动了
空气也开始循环
We've got lights coming on all over the city,
air starting to circulate,

198
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,834
可是这些控制台却没有得到任何能量, 因此...
but no power coming out of these consoles, so...

199
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,670
等等,  退回去一会儿
Wait a minute. Back up a second.

200
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,922
事情并不是这样
That isn't the way it happened.

201
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,423
我们到的时候, 所有设备都正常启动了
Everything came online when we arrived.

202
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,635
照明, 计算机, 能量控制, 所有系统
It was lights, computers,
power control systems, everything.

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,678
我可以立即就访问到数据库
I was able to access the database immediately.

204
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,972
我碰到的不是这样
That's not what happened.

205
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,559
第一次不是这样
Not the first time.

206
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,740
你没什么能够帮她的吗?
Isn't there something you can give her?

207
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,826
她正处于一个极端脆弱的状态
She's in an extremely fragile state.

208
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,579
她的血压很低, 心跳非常微弱
Her blood pressure is low, her heart is very weak.

209
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:14,710
如果我使用刺激性药物, 我担心会导致
危险的心律不齐, 甚至是更糟
If I administer a stimulant, I'm afraid it may
induce a dangerous arrhythmia or worse.

210
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,508
我并不是说用某种强力刺激性的药物
只要足够让她每次的清醒多维持几分钟就可以了
I'm not talking about a strong stimulant, just enough
to keep her alert for a few more minutes at a time.

211
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,803
在她每次昏睡之前
我们很难从她那里听到足够多的陈述
We hardly get a couple of words out
of her before she dozes off.

212
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,474
我需要提醒你的是
一个一万岁的女人是很不寻常的
Which, I might remind you,
is not uncommon for a woman of 10,000.

213
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:39,819
Carson, 我知道你很不情愿
不过相信我, 她可以挺过去的...
Carson, I understand your reticence,
but trust me when I say I believe she can handle it...

214
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,906
而且我知道这也是她想要的
And I know she'd want it.

215
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,786
好吧
Okay.

216
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,799
没事, Carson.
It's okay, Carson.

217
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,970
我只是跟你一样, 因为这些而有些兴奋
I'm just as freaked out about all this as you are.

218
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,935
我们的病人怎么样了?
How's our patient doing?

219
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,358
血压正在上升, 而且正如你所说的
她已经清醒多了
Pressure's improving, and as you can tell,
she's much more alert.

220
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,737
你能起来到别处去看看么?
Are you up for getting out of here?

221
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:50,139
看到这个城市
这样浮在海面上
Seeing the city like this,
sitting on the surface of the ocean.

222
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,352
你们无法想象我是多么的如释重负
You can't imagine how relieved I am.

223
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,771
你在说什么?
What are you saying?

224
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,606
在第一次中城市没有浮上来么?
The city didn't rise the first time 'round?

225
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,941
是的
No.

226
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,692
没有
No.

227
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:08,115
从我们来到这里的那一刻开始
城市就陷入了很大的麻烦之中
The city was in serious trouble
from the very moment we arrived.

228
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,369
我们正在尝试使用临时的电池电力
来接通这些控制台
We're trying to interface these consoles
with temporary battery power,

229
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,331
看看我们能否访问城市的主能源系统
然后让这里运作起来
see if we can access the city's main power systems
and get this place up and running.

230
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,166
Weir博士,  Sumner上校
Dr. Weir, colonel Sumner.

231
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,253
能请你下来到我这里看看么?
我们在你下面三层
Can you come down here and meet me, please?
We're three levels down from you.

232
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,921
就来
Right away.

233
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,965
我们能够做些什么?
How we doing over there?

234
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,299
目前什么都不行
Nothing yet.

235
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,134
好吧, 那就让我们来看看我们能做的
Well, let's see what we can do, then.

236
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,429
我们只能保护这个地方的一小片区域
We've only been able to secure a fraction of the place.

237
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,347
它太大了
It's huge.

238
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,641
这么说这真的可能是哪个失去的城市, 亚特兰蒂斯了
So it might really be the lost city of Atlantis.

239
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,226
我想很有可能
I'd say that's a good bet.

240
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,144
噢, 上帝
Oh, my god.

241
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,944
我们在水下
We're underwater.

242
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,030
我想说我们是在海面几百英尺以下
I'd say we're under several hundred feet of ocean.

243
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,581
这会是一个麻烦
This could be a problem.

244
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,252
哦, 不
Oh, no.

245
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,299
Weir博士, 我需要你马上到控制室来
Dr. Weir, I need to see you
in the control room immediately.

246
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,389
这个城市有一个防护罩, 某种能量力场
正是它把海水挡在外面
The city has a shield, some sort of
a energy force field holding the water back.

247
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
就是说, 它曾经有一个防护罩
That is, it had a shield.

248
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,934
能量系统已经接近输出的最大限度了
The power systems are nearing maximum entropy.

249
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,020
我们的到来大大加快的它们的损耗
Our arrival hastened their depletion, big time.

250
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,982
我的意思是,  你可以看到, 防护罩正在快速的崩溃
I mean, you can see, the shield is collapsing rapidly.

251
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,775
城市的一些部分已经被洪水淹没
Several sections of the city are already flooded.

252
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,527
我们可以使用自己的发电机么?
Can we use our own power generators?

253
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,863
我怀疑我们的naquadah发电机无法提供
足够的能量来维持防护罩
I doubt our naquadah generators can supply
enough power to sustain the shield,

254
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,031
而且我们也几乎没有时间来试了
and we probably don't have time to try.

255
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,117
我说的是快速的崩溃, 我指的是快速
When I say rapidly collapsing, I mean rapidly.

256
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,873
Sumner少校, 我要你命令你的安全卫队
停止搜索这个城市
Colonel Sumner, I need youto order
all your security teams to stop searching the city

257
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,209
立即撤退到星际之门所在的房间
and fall back to the gateroom immediately.

258
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,962
Sumner, 你听到了么?
Sumner, do you copy?

259
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,547
Weir博士, 我是Sumner...
Dr. Weir, this is Sumner...

260
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,433
Sumner上校淹死了?
Colonel Sumner drowned?

261
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,983
而且他不是唯一的牺牲者
And he wasn't the only one to perish.

262
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,278
我们应该通过星际之门将人们疏散出去
We should start evacuating people through the Stargate.

263
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,112
做不到
We can't.

264
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,033
现在系统中剩余的能量已经被转到防护罩上去了
为了抵挡海水
Whatever power's left in the system has been diverted
to sustaining the shield holding the ocean back.

265
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,660
为什么会发生在现在?
Do we know why this is happening now?

266
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,787
防护罩本可以继续抵挡海水100年的
The shield might've held the water back
for another 100 years,

267
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,081
但是我们到来之后
能量的消耗急剧的提高了
but power consumption spiked when we arrived.

268
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,666
它的发生是由于我们的到来?
This is happening because we arrived?

269
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,750
是的
Yes.

270
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,544
那后备能量呢?
What about auxiliary power?

271
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,379
我会尝试使用我们自己的一个发电机
来接通星际之门
I'll try to interface the gate
with one of our generators.

272
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,839
希望时间足够
Hopefully there's enough time.

273
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:32,093
Grodin, 查询一下星际之门控制系统
看看我们能不能在数据库中找到一些星际之门的拨号地址
Grodin, access the Stargate control systems, see if
you can locate any gate addresses in the database.

274
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,889
我们可能没有足够的能量返回地球
不过也许我们有足够的能量到达飞马座的其它什么地方
Won't be nearly enough power to gate back to Earth, but
maybe we'll have enough to gate elsewhere in pegasus.

275
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,185
队伍中有人发现了一个航空港
里面全部是他们称之为船的东西
Some of our team discovered a bay full
of what they're calling ships.

276
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,562
就像是太空船?
As in space ships?

277
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,813
我们应该去看看
We should check them out.

278
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,232
- 你认为你能够驾驶么
- 我差不多可以飞任何东西
- You think you could figure out
- I could fly just about anything.

279
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,359
好的, 去吧
Good. Go

280
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,087
- 我将从这个开始, 你从那些
- 我们在找什么?
- I'll start with this. You start with one of those.
- What am i looking for?

281
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,673
看看它们能够装多少人
也许我们可以飞离这里
See how many people they can fit.
Maybe we can fly out of here.

282
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,471
城市的两片平台已经完全被水淹没了
第三块也快崩溃了!
Two piers of the city are almost entirely flooded,
a third about to collapse as well!

283
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,057
Weir博士, 这些飞船看起来对我们非常有用
Dr. Weir, these ships look like a good fallback.

284
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,767
每艘都可以装不少人
They can hold several people each.

285
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,936
学习如何驾驶它们是另外一个问题
Learning how to fly them's going to be another matter.

286
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,689
我看看我能够在城市的示意图上找到一条出路
I'll see if I can pull up a schematic, find a way out.

287
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,774
这艘船跟其它的不太一样
This ship seems different than the others.

288
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,859
怎么不同?
Different how?

289
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,444
它有一个与众不同的控制台
It's a different control console.

290
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,779
我已经用无线电通知了Zelenka.
他正在赶来检查的路上
I've radioed Zelenka.
He's on his way over to check it out.

291
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,740
- 好的, 我也过来看看
- 哦, 不
- Good, I'm on my way, too.
- Oh, no.

292
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,116
怎么了?
What's wrong?

293
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,368
这个城市正在进入最后的自我保护模式
The city's going into a last-gasp self-protect mode.

294
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,329
城市中的防水墙正在迅速的关闭当中
Airtight bulkheads are slamming shut all over the city.

295
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,580
我们已经有人被困住了
We've got people trapped.

296
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,832
- 那不会保护他们么?
- 太少了, 太迟了
- Wouldn't that protect them?
- It's too little, too late.

297
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,044
大部分的房间已经被破坏了
持续上升的海水已经困住了我们很多人
Most of the rooms are already breached.
We've got people trapped with water rising.

298
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:48,961
该死
Damn.

299
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,671
我试试取消系统的自我控制
I'll try to override the system,

300
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:54,217
打开那些门, 不过这会严重影响
向星际之门输入能量
open the doors, but that's seriously
hampering efforts to rig power to the Stargate.

301
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,016
如果那些飞船是我们离开这里的唯一方法
If these ships turn out to be our only way out of here,

302
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,644
我可不想等得太久以至于无法到达航空港
I don't want you waiting too long to get up to the bay.

303
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,480
Rodney...
Rodney...

304
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,190
yes, yes, yes, 我听到了
yes, yes, yes, I heard.

305
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,358
去吧
Go.

306
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,532
怎么样了?
How are we doing?

307
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,741
这艘飞船跟其它船不一样
This ship is different than the others.

308
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,201
是的, 这我知道
为什么? 它是用来做什么的?
Yeah, we know that. Why? What's it do?

309
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,411
我不知道 我需要更多时间
I do not know. I will need more time.

310
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,913
我们没有时间了
We don't have time.

311
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,331
它是密封的, 我想
It's airtight, I assume.

312
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,166
它是太空船, 应该是
It's a space ship. It'd better be.

313
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,920
Sheppard少校, 我在航空港的屋顶找到了一个舱门
我看看能不能打开它
Major Sheppard, I've located a roof hatch
in the gate ship bay.  I'll try to get it open.

314
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,381
那是什么?
What was that?

315
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,760
控制室外的密封门已经全部都关闭了
我们被锁在里面了
Bulkhead doors leading out of the control room
have all slammed shut. We're locked in.

316
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,928
你能把它打开么?
Can you get it open?

317
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,638
我正在努力!
I'm trying!

318
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,196
别管那个了. gate room已经进水了
Forget it. The gate room's flooding.

319
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,699
把门打开到这里来, 我们在这里等你们
Get them open and get up here.
We're waiting for you.

320
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,452
Elizabeth, 我们准备继续尝试收回屋顶
只要它打开了, 我们就走
Elizabeth, we're going to keep trying to
retract the roof. As soon as it opens, you go.

321
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,245
Rodney...
Rodney...

322
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,707
没有时间来争论了! 灾难就在眼前
Look, there's no time to argue!
Catastrophic failure is imminent.

323
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,042
把你们自己管好, 走吧
Just lock yourself in and go.

324
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,007
尽管你已经尽力了
你还是什么也做不了, Rodney.
Despite your efforts,
there was nothing you could do, Rodney.

325
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,969
不久以后, 控制室就被水淹没了
Within seconds, the control room was flooded.

326
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,764
我死了?
I died?

327
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,352
你没有放弃努力, 一直到最后
You never gave up trying, right until the end.

328
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,443
好吧...
Well...

329
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:41,115
作为男人我很想知道, 当面临如此可怕的情况时
我会如何选择
A man wonders how he would choose to go out,
given such dire circumstances.

330
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,618
现在我知道了
Now I know.

331
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,454
试图拯救其他人的生命
Trying to save the lives of others.

332
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,123
不过最终还是失败了
But ultimately failing.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,337
- 我敢肯定如果我拥有的时间可以再多几秒, 我就可以..
- 等等
- I'm sure if I had a few more seconds, I could...
- Wait a second.

334
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,798
为什么自动保障机制没有把城市浮上水面?
Why didn't the failsafe mechanism engage
and raise the city to the surface?

335
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,177
因为第一次没有自动保障机制
Because there was no failsafe the first time.

336
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,597
Atlantis继续留在海底
Atlantis remained on the ocean floor.

337
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,141
防护罩完全崩溃
The shield completely collapsed.

338
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:13,147
海水冲了进来
流进城市中的每个房间
Water came crashing in,
flooding every room in the city.

339
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:21,572
你们两个在试图帮助其他人
登上飞船的时候淹死了
You both drowned while attempting
to get our people into ships,

340
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:29,163
而我们, 同 Zelenka一起,
发现我们自己也被困住了
and we, along with Dr. Zelenka,
we found ourselves trapped.

341
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,082
我们需要离开这里!
We need to get out of here!

342
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,132
McKay把舱门打开了么?
Did McKay get the hatch open?

343
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,217
我不知道
I do not know.

344
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,804
少校, 我们有六个人挤在了一艘船里
我们应该怎么做?
Major, there's six of us stuck in
one of the ships! What do we do?

345
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,932
你干了什么?
What did you do?

346
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,851
我不知道
我想我刚把它打开了
I don't know.
I think I just turned it on.

347
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,310
待命, 中士
Stand by, sergeant.

348
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,439
我没怎么看过说明手册
不过我好像可以正确的操作它
I'm not much for instruction manuals,
but I could use one right about now.

349
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,614
哦, 我的天哪
Oh, my god.

350
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,659
这是在宇宙空间中
发生什么了?
It's space.
What happened?

351
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,952
现在你想做什么?
Now what did you do?

352
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,829
我不知道, 我只是...
I don't know. I just...

353
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,875
那是什么?
What was that?

354
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,423
我们受到了攻击
We were under attack.

355
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,302
我们不知道我们在哪里
也不知道谁在朝我们射击
We didn't know where we were
or who was shooting at us.

356
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,223
然后那时John...
And that's when John...

357
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,728
- Carson!
- 我是Beckett.
- Carson!
- This is Beckett.

358
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,938
我需要医疗帮助
在会议室, 快
I need medical assistance
in the conference room asap.

359
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,825
她怎样了?
How's she doing?

360
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:52,788
稳定下来了, 不过仍然非常虚弱
并且正在变得更加虚弱
Stabilized, but still very weak,
and getting weaker.

361
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,877
濒临死亡的你
正注视着你自己的脸
Your own mortality,
staring you right in the face.

362
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,047
我无法想象你此时的感受
I can't imagine how you must be feeling.

363
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:12,850
当她看着我的时候, 就好像她在感知我的心灵
同时我也在感知她的心灵
When she looks at me, it's as if she's
sensing my thoughts, and I'm sensing hers.

364
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,895
这很让人不安
It's very unsettling.

365
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,065
在你这么想的时候
我觉得没有什么比这更不可思议的了
Just when you thought this
place couldn't get any weirder.

366
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,234
好吧, 很明显
Well, it's obvious.

367
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,945
他们逃跑时所乘坐的飞船一定是某种时间机器
The puddle jumper they escaped in must've
been some sort of a time machine.

368
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,030
在它内部, 一定装配有某种特殊的组件
It had to have an additional
component built into it.

369
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,365
Flux capacitor
(电影《回到未来》里时间机器的核心部件)
Flux capacitor.

370
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:32,203
是的, 问题是
时间机器现在在哪里?
Yeah, question is,
where is the time machine now?

371
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,957
我们为什么不问问她?
Why don't we ask her?

372
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:41,963
发生什么了?
What happened?

373
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,966
你能告诉我们么?
Can you tell us?

374
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,135
你们逃离时所乘坐的飞船
它现在在哪?
The ship that you escaped in,
where is it now?

375
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,973
没有了
It's gone.

376
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,144
是谁在向我们射击?
Who is shooting at us?

377
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,980
现在更好的问题是
我们应该如何还击?
Better question is,
how do we shoot back?

378
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:07,822
这是我做的么?
Did I do that?

379
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,077
抓好了!
Hang on!

380
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,583
接下来我所知道的就是...
The next thing I knew...

381
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,711
我在这里醒来
I woke up here.

382
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,338
什么, 你说现在?
What, you mean now?

383
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,049
不是
No.

384
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:29,510
那时
Then.

385
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,892
你醒了
You're awake.

386
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,936
他的名字叫Janus.
His name was Janus.

387
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:44,734
他治好了我的伤
并向我解释发生了什么
He healed my wounds and
explained to me what had happened.

388
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,236
你们的飞船被击落了
Your ship was shot down.

389
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,864
我们在海底找到了它
We retrieved it from the ocean floor.

390
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,535
Sheppard少校, Zelenka博士呢?
Major Sheppard, Dr. Zelenka?

391
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,704
他们没有生还
No one survived.

392
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:04,086
哈! 啊, 你也品尝一下终极失败的痛苦吧
Ha! Ah, the bitter
taste of ultimate failure.

393
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,172
如果你能够找到
修好那个该死的防护罩的方法的话
Well, if you had just figured out
how to fix the damn shield

394
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,466
从一开始, 我们当中就不会有人会死了
in the first place,
none of us would've died.

395
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,677
我已经尽我所能了, 包括试图拯救你们那英勇的努力...
抱歉
I did everything I could, including valiantly
attempting to save your... sorry

396
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,305
先生们... 注意点
Gentlemens... focus.

397
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,018
请继续
Please continue.

398
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,941
不必说, 我当时非常困惑
Needless to say, I was very confused.

399
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:31,155
他对我解释说
我逃离时所乘坐的飞船是...
He explained to me that
the ship we had escaped in was...

400
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,950
一个时间机器
a time machine.

401
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,369
而他就是这个机器的建造者
He was the one who built it.

402
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,666
在我感觉好点之后
他把我带到亚特兰蒂斯人的议会面前
After I was feeling better,
he brought me before the atlantian council.

403
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,168
我们欢迎你来到亚特兰蒂斯城
We welcome you to the city of Atlantis.

404
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:45,837
谢谢
Thank you.

405
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,257
很不幸, 你的到来正好赶上了这里的战争
Unfortunately, your arrival has
come at a time of great conflict.

406
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:54,971
我们已经被围困了多年
而且作为一个保护措施, 我们把城市沉入了海底
We've been under siege for many years and have
submerged our city as a measure of protection.

407
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,056
是的, 这非同寻常
Yes, it's extraordinary.

408
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,809
这就是我们通过星际之门来到这里时所发现的
It's how we found the city when
we came through the Stargate.

409
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:00,601
从地球?
From Earth?

410
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,311
是的
Yes.

411
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,730
距今一万年后
10,000 years from now.

412
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:14,532
这很值得关注, 我们的所采取的行为
成功的保护了城市这么多年
It should be noted that our actions have
succeeded in protecting the city for so many years.

413
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:18,077
我们非常希望Weir博士的到来
没有改变这个的可能性
Let us hope Dr. Weir's arrival
has not altered this eventuality.

414
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,290
不过因为跟幽灵的直接接触
她可能已经影响了
By directly encountering the Wraith,
she may have already set in motion

415
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,586
一系列的事件
这将会使我们的未来与她离开的那个未来很不相同
a chain of events that could lead to a
future far different from the one she left.

416
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,797
对不起, 幽灵是什么?
I'm sorry, what are the Wraith?

417
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,844
他们告诉我那种被称为幽灵的生物
They told me of beings called Wraith,

418
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:41,100
邪恶的, 可怕的敌人
他们的力量和科技无人能敌
a vicious, formidable enemy whose
power and technology rivaled their own.

419
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,852
是的, 事实上, 我们已经...
Yes, actually, we've already...

420
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:49,692
亚特兰蒂斯人派出了一个
在他们最强大的舰队保护下的代表团
The atlantians sent a delegation protected
by their most powerful warships

421
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,362
为了达成停战协议这个微弱的希望...
in the faint hope of negotiating a truce...

422
00:26:53,404 --> 00:27:00,620
一对一的话, 亚特兰蒂斯人的飞船更强大
不过幽灵实在是太多了
one on one, atlantian ships were
more powerful, but the Wraith were so many.

423
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,246
在那场大战之后...
After that great battle...

424
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,125
亚特兰蒂斯人的失败只是时间问题了
it was only a matter of time.

425
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,670
我们正在等待最后一艘
从其他星球返回的运输船
We're awaiting the last of
our off-world transport ships

426
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,923
然后我们就会开始通过星际之门进行撤退
before beginning our evacuation
through the Stargate.

427
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,424
你们要去哪里?
Where will you go?

428
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,967
我们会返回地球
We're returning to Earth.

429
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,802
欢迎你加入我们
You are welcome to join us.

430
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:19,805
谢谢
Thank you.

431
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,265
这个举动非常友好, 不过...
That's very kind, but...

432
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:27,355
我想你应该了解
我渴望回到未来, 我到我的人民中去
I'm sure you must understand my desire
to return to the future, to my people.

433
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,817
我希望我能够再次使用时间机器
I was hoping I would be able
to use the time machine again,

434
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,780
设置它到达的时间
正好为我们刚刚穿过星际之门那一刻
and program it to arrive at the precise
moment we came through the Stargate,

435
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:41,827
并且, 如果可能的话, 希望能让我带走一个ZPM
那将会极大的帮助我们.
and if it was possible, and you had a ZPM I could
take back with me, that would help us considerably.

436
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,789
要知道, 这个城市的能源系统
到那时实际上已经快耗尽了...
See, the power systems of the
city were virtually depleted when...

437
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,085
不行 对时间的干涉已经够多的了
No. Enough of this tampering with time.

438
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:53,339
因果关系不应该被如此轻率的对待
Causality is not to be treated so lightly.

439
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,132
没有人在轻率的对待它
No one's treating it lightly.

440
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,845
你就在, 正是由于你坚持进行的那些实验
You are, with your insistence
on continuing these experiments

441
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,347
无视议会的指责
despite the condemnation of this council.

442
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,852
我们命令你停止这些活动
然而我们现在却坐在这里
We ordered you to cease these
activities, and yet here we sit,

443
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,479
面对着来自未来的一个访客
face to face with a visitor from the future

444
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:13,693
而她正是乘坐着那个你承诺不再
建造的机器到来的
who arrived here in the very machine
you agreed not to construct.

445
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:21,909
我们正准备从这个城市撤离
只是希望它能够安全的屹力很多年
We are about to evacuate this city in
the hope that it will lie safe for many years,

446
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,412
直到某一天, 我们的种族将会回来...
and then one day, our kind will return...

447
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,415
他们做到了
and they have.

448
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:32,670
正是由于我的实验
我们现在才有机会...
It is because of my experiments
that we now have the opportunity...

449
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,882
够了! 我们没有时间争论这个了
Enough! We have no time for this.

450
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:42,930
我现在正式命令摧毁这个时间旅行装置
I am hereby ordering the
destruction of this time-travel device

451
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,767
以及所有和它的设计有关的材料
and all the materials
connected with its design.

452
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:53,107
欢迎你和我的人民一起返回地球
You are welcome to
return to Earth with our people.

453
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,693
你不能回到你的人民中去
You shall not be returning to yours.

454
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,127
检查结果的最后一组数据
更明显的确定了我的判断
The last set of test results
only confirm the obvious.

455
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:18,257
她的骨骼、肌肉、循环系统和神经系统
全部都被岁月严重侵蚀了
Her skeletal, muscular, circulatory, and
neuroendocrine systems have all been decimated by age.

456
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:23,679
我已经观测到了肾衰竭、肝衰竭
以及她最近的虚脱对他身体所造成的损伤
I'm seeing renal failure, liver failure,
and evidence of a stroke from her recent collapse.

457
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,264
她还有多长时间?
How long does she have?

458
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,558
我怀疑她活不过今晚了
I doubt she'll live out the night.

459
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,519
请...
Please...

460
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:37,193
我不知道我还剩多少时间
来向你们讲述这个
我已经等待了这么久想要告诉你们的故事
I don't know how much time I have left
to tell the story I've waited so long to tell.

461
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,324
议会...
The council...

462
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,577
他们非常不安...
they were very upset...

463
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,662
是的
yes.

464
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,956
你说了他们决定毁掉那个时间机器
You said they decided
to destroy the time machine.

465
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,375
我试图说服他们
I tried to talk them out of it.

466
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,001
我不能放弃希望
I couldn't give up hope.

467
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:58,214
感谢上天, 我有一个支持者
Thankfully, I had an ally.

468
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,882
你需要和Moros谈谈
You need to talk to Moros.

469
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,802
Weir博士被带到这里并不是她的错
Dr. Weir was brought here
through no fault of her own.

470
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,595
她不应该为此而受到惩罚
She shouldn't be punished for it.

471
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,889
她可以跟我们回到地球
并自由的跟我们生活在一起
She's free to come with us back
to Earth and live among our kind

472
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,976
她需要回到她的时代
而不是留在我们当中
she needs to return to
her time, not remain in ours.

473
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,769
这是不可能的
That's not possible.

474
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,105
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:15,940
等一下
Wait.

476
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,402
我想你并不了解我们已经付出了多少
I don't think you understand
how far we've come

477
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:23,155
以及我的人民做出了多大的牺牲
只是希望能够见到你们
or how much my people have
sacrificed in the hopes of meeting you.

478
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,200
我们称你们为古人
We call you the Ancients.

479
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,245
星际之门的建造者
The gate builders.

480
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:32,290
我们穿越了数个星系
只是希望能够找到一个伟大的民族
We've crossed galaxies in
the hopes of finding a great people.

481
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:37,128
求你了, 难道你们就没有其它的方法可以帮助我了么?
Please, is there no other way you can help?

482
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,757
我们可以在撤离之后永久封闭星际之门
We could block the Stargate
permanently after the evacuation.

483
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,304
这样, 在将来, 你们的队伍
就不可能会来到这里
That way, in the future, your
team will be unable to come here.

484
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,764
如果他们无法到来
这个城市就永远都不会被发现
If they can't come,
the city may never be found.

485
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,058
但是她的探险队中的那些人的生命就会得救
But the lives of her
expedition would be saved.

486
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,772
感谢你的慷慨提议
不过我们是探险者, 正如你们一样
Thank you for your generous offer,
but we are explorers, just like you.

487
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:04,322
这不奇怪 因为他们是我们这个人种的第二次进化
Which should come as no surprise, since
they are the second evolution of our kind.

488
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,574
你还没有理解么?
Don't you understand?

489
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:10,453
这个城市将会生存一万年
This city will survive 10,000 years.

490
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,920
议会的决定是无法修改的
The council's decision is final.

491
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:30,223
当然, Janus拒绝承认失败
Of course, Janus refused to concede defeat.

492
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:35,937
别人越是告诉他不要这么做
他就越是要这么做
The more someone told him not to
do something, the more he had to do it.

493
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:41,275
所以他背着议会另外准备了一份方案
So he came up with an
alternate plan behind the council's back.

494
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,322
我所能做的就是尽量跟上他
It was all I could do
to try to keep pace with him.

495
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,959
我可以问一下你现在正在做什么吗?
May I ask what it is you're doing?

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,087
计算必要的能量需求
Calculating the necessary power needed.

497
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,256
需要用来...
Needed for...

498
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,425
你说过, 在你们到达之后不久
防护罩就崩溃了
You said the shield collapsed
shortly after your arrival.

499
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:10,471
我必须找到一个尽量延长能量供给的方法
I have to find a way to
extend the supply of power.

500
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:15,893
你们把它们称作什么?
What is it you called them?

501
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:17,728
ZPM
ZPM.

502
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,855
零点模块
(Zero Point Module)
Zero point module.

503
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:20,481
是的...
Yes...

504
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:27,238
他们本被设计用来并行工作
所有三个同时为城市提供能量
They're designed to operate in parallel, all
three providing power to the city simultaneously.

505
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,160
然而  如果依次使用的话
就有可能保存必要的能量, 以备必要时使用
However, used in sequence, it may be possible to
sustain the necessary power for the needed time.

506
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,124
我简直无法相信我的眼睛
I couldn't believe my eyes.

507
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:43,379
三个ZPM, 正在我的面前
Three ZPMs, right in front of me.

508
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:46,340
不过, 还是有一个小问题
There is one small problem, however.

509
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:52,263
必须有人留在城市里
让能量从一个设备转移到另外一个
Someone will need to remain behind in the city to
transfer the power from one device to the other,

510
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,683
依次替换它们
to rotate them sequentially.

511
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,144
在这数千年间?
Over thousands of years?

512
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,021
这是可能的
It is possible.

513
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,193
Janus, 请向控制中心报告
Janus, please report to central control.

514
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,739
他们的运输船归航了
Their transport ship was inbound.

515
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,034
它遭受到了强大火力的攻击
It was taking heavy fire.

516
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:21,626
防御罩被摧毁了! 我们正在还击, 不过我们无法前进!
敌船的数目实在是太多了
Cloaking shields damaged! We're returning fire, but
we cannot access! There's too many enemy ships.

517
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,085
而且还有更多正在赶来
And there are more coming.

518
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,422
启用辅助动力  尽量摆脱他们
Engage auxiliary power.
Try to outrun them.

519
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:34,180
那艘运输船上有超过300人
There are over 300 people on that transport.

520
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:44,815
开始撤离
Begin evacuation.

521
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,943
我们必须离开, 现在
We must leave, now.

522
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,686
该死, 我又睡着了
Damn, fell asleep again.

523
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,230
你不是唯一睡着的
Well, you're not the only one.

524
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:28,734
你现在觉得痛苦么?
Are you in any pain?

525
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,529
就算是, 你觉得我们会承认么?
Would we admit it if we were?

526
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,076
我希望我们能为你再做些什么
I wish there was more
we could do for you.

527
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,911
噢, 看你
Oh, look at you.

528
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,956
总是那么烦恼
Always worrying.

529
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,709
你给自己施加的压力太大了
You put too much pressure on yourself.

530
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:47,461
还记得么...
Remember...

531
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,090
那次悲惨的波罗的海谈判么?
that miserable baltic negotiation?

532
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,719
simon在那之后跟我们说了些什么?
What simon told us afterwards?

533
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:55,928
呼吸?
Breathe?

534
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,222
在其它事物之中
Among other things.

535
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,226
享受当前的时光
Enjoy the moment.

536
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:09,859
现在所拥有的, 阳光, 微风...
What's here right now,
the sun, the breeze...

537
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,071
我们的生日
our birthday.

538
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,493
Sheppard没法守住这个秘密, 对么?
Sheppard couldn't keep it to himself, huh?

539
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:23,789
我只是想说, 不要再对自己那么刻薄了
I'm just saying stop being
so damn hard on yourself.

540
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:28,878
生命短暂
Life is quick.

541
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:31,881
对你而言不是
Not for you.

542
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,926
这是我的选择, Elizabeth.
It was my choice, Elizabeth.

543
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,054
我当时无法预知它的后果...
I didn't second-guess it then...

544
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,724
我现在也无怨无悔
and I don't regret it now.

545
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:56,280
Weir博士在哪里?
Where is Dr. Weir?

546
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,115
她已经通过星际之门了
She's gone through the gate.

547
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,577
她是第一批撤离的
She was among the first to evacuate.

548
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,370
很好
Good.

549
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,557
Janus为我准备了休眠室
Janus prepared the stasis chamber for me.

550
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,394
他说那就像是一个深沉的 无梦的睡眠
Said it would be like a deep, dreamless sleep.

551
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,272
我正在输入指令
让系统唤醒你两次
I'm inputting commands for
the system to revive you twice,

552
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,984
其中的间隔大约是三千三百年
这样你就可以轮换ZPM
at intervals of approximately 3.3 thousand
years so that you can rotate the ZPMs.

553
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:37,238
接下来我会给你重新激活休眠程序的操作说明
I'll give you instructions on how to
reactivate the stasis process afterwards.

554
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,617
我还输入了一些必须的指令
当传感器探测到你的探险队到达之时
I'm also entering the necessary commands to
commence final revival the moment sensors

555
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:45,246
就开始最终的唤醒程序
indicate the presence of your expedition team.

556
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:51,961
我觉得我有必要告诉你
存在一种可能性
Look, I feel that I must tell
you that there is a possibility,

557
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:55,423
尽管可以持续很久
不过它还是可能不会成功
remote as it is,
that this might not succeed.

558
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,633
我知道
I know.

559
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,553
无法预测在那么长的时间内将会发生什么
It's impossible to predict what'll
happen over such a long period of time.

560
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,972
我坚信 你会活下来的
I'm convinced that you will survive.

561
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,977
不过尽管你不能成功的可能性非常小
But in the highly unlikely
eventuality that you don't,

562
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:11,230
我还是编织了一个自动保护机制
来保护这个城市
I've programmed a failsafe
mechanism to protect the city.

563
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,190
自动保护?
A failsafe?

564
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,234
是的, 如果能量输出低到了一个危险的水平
Yes, if the power drains to a critical level,

565
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:20,072
将城市保持在洋底的机制将会释放
城市将会上浮到海面
the mechanism holding the city on the ocean floor
will release, and it will rise to the surface.

566
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,200
真的?
Really?

567
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:31,501
然后他们就离开了, 他们所有人
通过星际之门回到了地球
and then they left, all of them,
returning to Earth through the Stargate.

568
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:40,301
这些是什么?
What's all that?

569
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,012
我的研究
My research.

570
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,682
你想再建造一艘时间船?
You're going to build another time ship?

571
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:49,977
我不知道是否能成功
委员会将会监视我的一举一动
I doubt I'll succeed, seeing that the
council will be watching my every move.

572
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,646
你相信你会找到方法的
I'm sure you'll find a way.

573
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,860
我已经屏蔽了除了地球以外
所有到这个星际之门的拨号地址
I've blocked all addresses
to the gate except Earth.

574
00:37:58,528 --> 00:37:59,987
你会是安全的
You will be safe.

575
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,241
谢谢你
Thank you.

576
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:07,328
谢谢你, 是你给了我希望
亚特兰蒂斯仍然会生存
Thank you, for giving me
the hope that Atlantis will survive

577
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,249
再过一万年
在你再次发现它之后
another 10,000 years
after you discover it again.

578
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:37,149
我准备好了
I'm ready.

579
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,712
然后就只剩下我一个人了
And then I was alone.

580
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,534
我把城市设为休眠状态...
I set the city to slumber...

581
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:03,736
然后开始我那漫长的回家之旅
and began my long journey home.

582
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,664
它奏效了, 休眠, 自动保护
It worked, the stasis, the failsafe.

583
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,000
你献出了你的整个一生
You gave up your entire life.

584
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:25,508
不, 因为我们是同一个人
No, because we are the same person.

585
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,428
我生命中最美好的部分才刚刚开始
The best part of my life is just beginning.

586
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,850
我就要去探索新的星系
I'm exploring a new galaxy.

587
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,231
我眼前还有很长的岁月
I have years ahead of me still.

588
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,197
相信你自己, Elizabeth.
Trust yourself, Elizabeth.

589
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,660
所有的事情...
All that matters...

590
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:55,329
就是现在
is right now.

591
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:04,547
那个笔记, 我写下它, 是怕万一我无法活下来
The note, I wrote it in case I didn't survive.

592
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,800
Rodney看明白了么?
Has Rodney figured it out yet?

593
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,261
五个星际之门的地址
Five gate addresses.

594
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,096
他们是前哨战...
Outposts...

595
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:18,019
每处都有一个零点模块
each one with a zero point module.

596
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,605
Janus 告诉我的
Janus told me.

597
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:28,237
她留下的那个笔记,  是已知的拥有ZPM的行星
The note she left, it's coordinates
of planets to have known ZPMs.

598
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,118
它们应该还在那
They could still be there.

599
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,703
M7G 677在这上面
M7G 677's on here.

600
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,288
这太令人惊奇了
Elizabeth, 我们曾经到过...
This is amazing.
Elizabeth, we've got...

601
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,383
我们正准备开始我们的任务简报, 所以...
We're about to start our mission briefing, so...

602
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:33,135
我就过来
I'll be right there.

603
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,473
事实上, John
Actually, John?

604
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,434
让我独自呆几分钟, 好么?
Give me a minute, will you?

605
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,145
当然可以


Sure.
