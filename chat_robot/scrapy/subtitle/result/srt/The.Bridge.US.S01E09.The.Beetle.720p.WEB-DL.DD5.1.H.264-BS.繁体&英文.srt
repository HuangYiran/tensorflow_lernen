《邊橋謎案》前情提要
Previously on The Bridge...

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,890
包里裝的是什么
What's in the gym bag?

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,470
雷雷哥什么時候辜負過你
Has old Ray Ray ever let you down.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,000
發射器

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,950
它們都指向了戴維·泰特
All roads lead back to David Tate.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,260
調查局的戴維·泰特
David Tate? FBI?

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,300
你認識這個人
You know him?

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,850
戴維·泰特已經死了
David Tate's dead.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
她當時打算離開戴維
She was gonna leave David.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,690
我猜那晚他們有過爭吵
My guess is they got in a fighe that night,

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,420
之后她拽著凱萊布  去找她的新男人
she grabbed Caleb, went to be with her new man.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,360
卻發生了意外
Never made it.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,000
這到底是誰
Who the heck is this?

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,300
尸體的身份是
Body was I.D.'d

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,150
于八月六號失蹤的肯尼斯·黑斯廷
as Kenneth Hasting went missing in August 6.

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,170
馬可  這是肯尼斯·黑斯廷
Marco, this is Kenneth Hasting,

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,130
他的駕照還在使用中
and he has a current driver's license.

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,530
駕駛執照

19
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,930
這個人是戴維·泰特
That's David Tate.

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,460
你沒認出來我吧
You don't recognize me, do you?

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,340
我跟很多人打過交道
Look, I meet a lot of people...

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,180
你要干什么
Hey-hey... What the hell?

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,910
2007年2月10日  美洲邊境大橋上
There was hit-and-run on the Bridge of the Americas,

24
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,830
發生一起肇事逃逸
February 10, 2007.

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,680
你毀了我的人生
You took my whole life away.

26
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,110
我認識吉爾·泰特
I know Jill Tate.

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,070
我和她有外遇時  跟戴維還是朋友
We had an affair while I was friends with David.

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,850
她死于肇事逃逸時  你還在跟她交往嗎
Were you still with her when she died in the hit-and-run?

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,280
是的
Yes.

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,610
你就是橋那邊的那個人
You're the man across the bridge.

31
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,340
累了嗎
Tired?

32
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,450
沒有
Not really.

33
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,260
我也沒有
Me neither.

34
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,470
我兒子在哪里
Where is my son?

35
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,640
我兒子
My son?

馬可
Marco.

47
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,460
我已經和墨西哥城警方取得聯系

48
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,600
他們要答案

49
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,330
快了  隊長

50
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,990
我們知道他的長相
We know what he looks like.

51
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,840
厲害的美國專案組逮捕他了嗎
Has your fancy American task force arrested him yet?

52
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,080
還沒有
No, they haven't.

53
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,630
馬可
Marco,

54
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,110
在沙漠里殺掉印第安人是一回事

55
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,480
但他剛殺害的可是索爾先生的獨子

56
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,430
我明白  隊長

57
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,220
不  你不明白

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,120
如果你沒忙著跟蹤美國佬警探

59
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,960
你可能已經抓住他了

60
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,750
找到他  否則我們都會在監獄里刷馬桶

61
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,860
明白嗎

62
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,350
明白  隊長

63
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,980
他不會罷休的
He's not done.

64
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,340
我知道
I know.

65
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,030
華瑞茲的花花公子怎么卷進此事了
How does this Juarez playboy fit into this?

66
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,880
圣地亞哥·索爾是一起肇事逃逸事故的嫌疑犯
Santiago Sol was a suspect in the hit-and-run accident

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,440
事故導致泰特的妻子死在橋上
that killed Tate's wife on the bridge.

68
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,830
她說她愛我  而且
She told me she loved me, and...

69
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,710
想和我在一起
she wanted to be with me.

70
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,220
我不在乎她
It was nothing to me.

71
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,810
你在她身上泄欲
You used her for sex.

72
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,000
不是
No.

73
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,700
你愛過她嗎
You loved her?

74
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,920
當然不愛
No.

75
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,930
你早該告訴她
Well, you should've told her that.

76
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,230
她根本聽不進去
Oh, she believed what she wanted to believe.

77
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,840
那是因為你在騙她
That's 'cause you were lying to her.

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,970
真不敢相信  天啊

79
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,710
桑婭  并非所有事都是非黑即白的
Sonya, not everything is black and white.

80
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,620
如果他知道了呢
What if he knows.

81
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,880
不
No.

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,520
不可能
That's not possible.

83
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,530
我們是朋友
We were friends.

84
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,920
我和他一起出席他們的葬禮
I was at their funeral with him.

85
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,890
他毫不知情
He did not know.

86
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,320
如果他現在知道了呢
What if he knows now?

87
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,760
如果他現在知道了
What if he knows now

88
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,910
并放過了向你復仇的大好時機
and he didn't kill you when he had the chance...

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,270
因為他另有陰謀
because he's planning something else.

90
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,940
王八蛋  我的家人

91
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,450
我要回家
I'm going home.

92
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,450
凱撒
Cesar?

93
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,040
你好啊  你出來干什么
Hey, there. What are you doing out?

94
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,290
雷在哪
Where's Ray?

95
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,010
我不知道
I don't know.

96
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,040
從臉開始劃
Start with the face.

97
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,440
住手

98
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,840
凱撒  你干什么

99
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,350
雷在哪

100
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,580
在屋里

101
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,340
讓開

102
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,210
不  女士  拜托

103
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,610
別逼我做不想做的事

104
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,330
搞什么  你個混蛋

105
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,250
你裝什么爺們

106
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,030
你不過是個軟弱的仆人罷了

107
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,560
謝謝
Thank you.

108
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,630
我別無選擇
I had no choice.

109
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,060
現在怎么辦
What do we do now?

110
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,150
阿爾瑪  快接電話

111
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,330
她不接電話
She won't pick up.

112
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,160
你最近一次跟她說話是什么時候
When was the last time you spoke with her?

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,410
好幾天了
Days.

114
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,030
我有不詳的預感
I have a bad feeling.

115
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
格斯呢
What about Gus?

116
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,750
他也不接電話
Oh, he's not picking up either.

117
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,280
潔娜  你嚇我一跳
Zina, hi. You scared me.

118
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,440
怎么了
Something wrong?

119
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,240
沒事  只是...
No, you-you just...

120
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,790
就是...
Well, yeah, it's just-just...

121
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,200
你不是說你還在...  還沒回來
I thought you said you were still in, uh, out of town

122
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,940
所以要遲些見面嗎
and that's why we couldn't meet until later?

123
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,130
你說你還在拉雷多
You said you were stil in Laredo.

124
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,820
-我說過嗎  -是啊
- I did? - Yeah.

125
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,740
你是在耍我嗎
Are you messing with me?

126
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,970
我還留著你的短信
I-I have the text.

127
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,530
這不是我發的  格斯
Um, that's not me, Gus.

128
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,130
這是我以前的手機號
That's my old cell number.

129
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,400
我搬家之后我們就沒發過短信了
We haven't texted since I moved.

130
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,930
希望你沒給這妹子透露太多
Hopefully, you didn't tell this girl too much.

131
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,130
等下
Wait, so..

132
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,140
我們稍后不約會嗎
we are not meeting later?

133
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,680
不啊
Um, no.

134
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,970
好吧
Okay, uh...

135
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,780
我得走了
I... I have to go.

136
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,180
阿爾瑪
Alma?!

137
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,970
阿爾瑪  孩子們
Alma?! Girls?!

138
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,530
也許她們出去了
Maybe they're out.

139
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,260
這個時間
At this hour?

140
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,860
會去哪
Where would they be?

141
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,290
羅薩里奧
Rosario...

142
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,340
我是馬可

143
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,170
索菲亞和莉莉跟你在一起嗎

144
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,580
好吧

145
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,270
我知道了  什么時候

146
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
她說要去哪了嗎

147
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,510
好的  不不不
Okay. No, no, no, no.

148
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,750
沒什么事

149
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,040
謝謝  再見

150
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,570
她們和阿爾瑪在一起
They're with Alma.

151
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,080
她一小時前把她們接走了
She picked them up an hour ago.

152
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,530
那就好
That's good.

153
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,070
每晚睡在同一個人身邊很難嗎
Is it hard to sleep next to the same person every night?

154
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,200
別現在提這茬啊  桑婭
Not now, Sonya.

155
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,670
我在找阿爾瑪和孩子們呢
I'm trying to find Alma and my kids, all right?

156
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,900
我需要你幫忙
I need your help.

157
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,430
抱歉
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,850
跟我說說戴維·泰特
Tell me about David Tate.

159
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,660
他...
Oh, he..

160
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
想做出些改變
he wanted to make a difference.

161
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,020
一直想立案調查華瑞茲那些女孩的死
Kept trying to open an investigation on the Dead girls of Juarez.

162
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,120
然后呢
What happened?

163
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,160
他的上司不允許我們調查
His bosses shut us down.

164
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,370
他工作出色嗎
Was he good at his job?

165
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,350
非常出色
Very.

166
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,770
意外發生之后
By then, the accident happened

167
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,910
他整個人都變了
and he's changed.

168
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,570
所以他干這個應該很在行
So he's gonna be good at this.

169
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,760
你什么意思
What-what does that mean?

170
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,120
無論他下一步計劃是什么  都不會出錯
Whatever he' planning next, he won' make mistakes.

171
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,290
你非得現在說這樣的話嗎
Did you really hav to say that right now?

172
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,860
實事求是
It's the truth.

173
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,240
問題就在這里  桑婭
that is the problem, Sonya!

174
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,580
你為什么不能說點別人愛聽的話呢
Why can't you just tell people what they want to hear.

175
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,600
你愛聽什么話
What do you want to hear?

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,910
我愛聽你說我家人不會有事
I want to hear my family's gonna be okay.

177
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,950
我現在得讓自己有信心
I really need to believe that right now

178
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,670
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

179
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,680
是我妻子
It's her.

180
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,080
阿爾瑪
Alma.

181
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,530
你好  馬可
Hello, Marco

182
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,110
好久不見
It's been a long time.

183
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,560
我家人在哪
Where is my family?

184
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,370
你有一個美滿的家庭  馬可
You have a beautiful family, Marco.

185
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,200
很難想象你居然身在福中不知福
It's hard to imagine why a man would just throw that away.

186
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,140
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch.

187
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,780
我要宰了你
I'm... I'm gonna kill you.

188
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,260
也許你有這個機會
Well, maybe you'll get that chance.

189
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,090
她們在哪
Where are they?

190
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,140
跟我在一起
With me.

191
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,940
誰想玩游戲
Who wants to have some fun?

192
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,140
沒事吧
Is everything okay?

193
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,560
沒事  公事而已
Oh, yeah, it was just work.

194
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,870
你真不想給你丈夫打電話
You sure you don't want to call your husband

195
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,770
告訴他你們在哪嗎
and let him know where you are?

196
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,900
不想
No.

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,210
我給你買了這個
I got you this..

198
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,180
還有這個
..And this.

199
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,450
你太美了
You look beautiful.

200
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,270
狗娘養的

201
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,620
傻逼

202
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,820
她們在他手上
He has them!

203
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,620
你千里迢迢就是來看她干活的嗎
Did you come all this way to watch her work?

204
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,790
不是
No.

205
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,600
換我就會
I would.

206
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,350
你怎么想的  斯蒂文
What's on your mind, Steven?

207
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,370
我的跟你談談
I need to talk to you.

208
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,890
好的
Okay.

209
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,790
我發現工作對口齒有幫助
I find that work helps the tongue.

210
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,520
你來試試
Give it a shot.

211
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,700
沒錯
Yeah.

212
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,500
確實感覺很好
Yeah, that feels good.

213
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,800
你有心事嗎
What's on your mind?

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
我殺了一個人
I killed a man.

215
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,220
好吧
Okay.

216
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,750
你會說我犯戒了嗎
Are you gonna tell me I sinned?

217
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,330
得看當時的情形
Depends on the situation.

218
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,960
你我都清楚
As we both know,

219
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,080
犯戒這種事是對有信仰的人講的
sinning supposes a belief in a higher power.

220
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,520
而你不信神  斯蒂文
Which you lack, Steven?

221
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,010
我信
Yes, I do.

222
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,910
被你殺死的人
This man you killed,

223
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,710
他是好人還是壞人
was he a good man or was he a bad man?

224
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,030
他身上有這個
He carried this.

225
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,290
這好像是...  皮膚
Well, that looks like... That's skin

226
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,240
人皮
That's human skin.

227
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,340
這人是誰
Who was this man?

228
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,940
他是伊娃的男友
He was Eva's boyfriend.

229
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,190
赫克托
Hector?

230
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,470
她跟我提起過他
She's told me about him.

231
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,650
尸體在哪
Where's the body?

232
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,320
我拖到沙漠里  準備埋掉
I took it out to the desert to bury it...

233
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,530
但發生了一件怪事
and the funniest thing happened.

234
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,780
有人過來把尸體搶走了
This man came and took it from me.

235
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,020
這是好事
Well, that's a good thing.

236
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,210
你就會說這些話嗎
Well, that's-that's all you're gonna say.

237
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,240
你如釋重負了吧  斯蒂文
I think you're I the clear, Steven.

238
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,560
我該怎么對伊娃講
What do I tell Eva?

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,130
實話實說
The truth.

240
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,530
她是個好女人
Oh, she's a good woman.

241
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,650
沒錯  她很特別
Yes, she is. Special.

242
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,340
沒錯
That's right.

243
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,550
鮑勃  我一直對她有非分之想
Bob, I've been thinking about her in a special way.

244
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,440
這很正常  斯蒂文
That's natural, Steven.

245
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,490
咱們去吃火腿沙拉  邊吃邊聊
Let's discuss this over a ham salad.

246
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,400
很高興聽你這么說
I'm so glad you said that.

247
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,340
最近食欲很好
I've been so hungry of late.

248
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,700
經歷這種事后會這樣的
That happens after such things.

249
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,510
我第一次殺人后總是吃不夠芝士漢堡
My first kill, I couldn' get enough cheeseburgers.

250
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,390
我以前經常和家人來這里
I used to come here with my family.

251
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,580
你兒子叫什么名字
What was your son's name?

252
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,180
迦勒
Caleb.

253
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,980
他總喜歡把石子放在滑梯上
He used to put rocks on that slide.

254
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,010
他就喜歡玩這個
That was his thing, you know.

255
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,640
還有樂高積木
That and Legos.

256
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,190
總讓他無比的開心
Made him totally happy.

257
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,290
他是怎么出事的
How did it happen?

258
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,590
一次交通事故
A car accident.

259
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,020
我們沒必要談這個
We don't have to talk about this.

260
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,260
沒事的
Oh, it's okay.

261
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,900
講出來舒服多了
Feels good to talk about it.

262
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,570
尤其是對你
Especially with you.

263
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
這件事讓我變了一個人
It made me a different person.

264
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,780
我對世界充滿了怨恨
I-I was mad... at the world.

265
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,790
當我在街上看見幸福美滿的家庭時
I'd see happy families on the street and...

266
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,530
我會希望厄運降臨在他們身上
I'd wish bad things on them.

267
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,670
這感覺一定很糟
That must be terrible.

268
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,390
我心中仍有那憤怒
I still have that anger.

269
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,360
我天天都在控制它
Work on it every day.

270
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,560
我無法想象這樣失去自己的孩子
I can't imagine losing a child like that.

271
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,440
希望你永遠也不用體會
I hope you never do.

272
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,600
是啊
Yeah.

273
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,360
我們帶孩子們去吃點東西  然后
Let's get the girls something to eat, and, uh,

274
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,020
我會給你一個驚喜
 I'll show you the surprise.

275
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,890
好吧
Okay.

276
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,870
格斯
Gus!

277
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,640
真慶幸你沒事

278
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,200
我打電話你一定要接  知道嗎

279
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,850
每次都要接知道嗎  每次都要
Okay? You always pick it up! Always.

280
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,030
知道了  發生什么事了
Okay. What is wrong?

281
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,730
阿爾瑪和妹妹們呢
Where is Alma and the girls?

282
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,860
我們不知道
We don't know.

283
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,870
格斯  你認識一個叫肯尼斯·黑斯廷的人嗎
Gus, do you know a person named Kenneth Hasting?

284
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,560
黑斯廷先生
Mr. Hasting?

285
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,170
你是說阿爾瑪的同事
The guy who works with Alma?

286
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,190
你說什么
What?

287
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,390
他們是大學同事
At the university.

288
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,850
為什么你會問起他
Why are you asking about him?

289
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,210
聽我說
Okay, listen to me.

290
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,640
告訴我阿爾瑪說過要離開嗎
I need to know if Alma said anything about leaving.

291
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,100
沒有
No.

292
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,570
索菲亞和莉莉呢
And Sophia and Lilly?

293
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,180
我以為你們已經抓到兇手了
I thought you said you had the guy.

294
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,620
我們錯了
We were wrong.

295
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,100
我是桑婭·克羅斯
Sonya Cross.

296
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,970
肯尼斯來過家里嗎
Has Kenneth been in my house?

297
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,460
我不清楚
I-I don't know.

298
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,660
可能吧
Maybe.

299
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,570
你應該早告訴我的  格斯
You should have told me that, Gus

300
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,260
我知道  只是
I know, it's..

301
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,710
她叫我不要告訴你
She asked me not to.

302
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,720
你確定是同一個人嗎
Are you sure it's the same guy?

303
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,980
是的
Yes.

304
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,040
她們不會出事吧
Are they going to be okay?

305
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
我不知道
I don't know.

306
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,020
他們找到黑斯廷的公寓了
They found Hasting's apartment.

307
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,780
我得把你帶去警局
Okay. I'm taking you to the station.

308
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,780
你待在這里不安全
It's not safe for you here, alright?

309
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,100
快走
Let's go.

310
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,010
他在整棟樓都埋了炸藥
He had this entire building wired to blow.

311
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,850
有他的蹤跡嗎
Any sign of him?

312
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,840
還沒有
Nothing yet.

313
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,720
聽著  我們會抓到他
Listen, we're gonna get this guy,

314
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,740
我們會把你的妻子和孩子們救回來的
and we're gonna get your wife and kids back.

315
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,180
這家伙還真閑啊
This guy had a lot of free time on his hands.

316
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,410
有什么發現嗎
What you got?

317
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,810
你親自看看吧
See for yourself.

318
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,850
小心腳下
Watch your step.

319
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,610
這就是你說的驚喜嗎
Is this the surprise?

320
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,190
不  我忙活這個好一陣子了
No, I've been working on this for a long time.

321
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,640
這曾經是個狩獵小屋
Used to be an old hunting cabin.

322
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,000
你絕對想象不到我做了些什么
You're not gonna believe what I've done.

323
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,560
這里面有兩只倉鼠  誰想先來喂它們
I got two hamsters. Who wants to feed 'em first?

324
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,380
進來吧
Come on.

325
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,670
你來嗎
You coming?

326
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,190
好
Yeah.

327

好了
Okay.

329
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,980
不許偷看
No peeking.

330
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,270
好的
Okay.

331
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,130
快看  媽媽

332
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,530
親愛的  我看不到

333
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
這就好了
Here we go.

334
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,190
不許偷看
No peeking.

335
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,140
好的
Okay.

336

你保證
Promise?

337
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,380
我保證
I promise.

338
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,280
姑娘們  告訴媽媽把眼睛閉上
Girls, tell your mommy to keep her eyes shut.

339
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,240
這是一個大大的驚喜
This is a very big surprise.

340
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,200
我真的不想再玩這個游戲了
I really don't want to play this game anymore.

341
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,190
你會嚇到孩子們的
You're scaring the girls.

342
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,860
快了
Almost.

343
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,010
快了
Almost.

344
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,400
把手伸出來

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,090
把手伸出來
Hold out your hand.

346
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,180
好了
Okay.

347
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,840
現在用力握住這個
Now, hold on to this very tight.

348
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,520
睜開雙眼
Open your eyes.

349
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,950
天啊
Oh, God.

350
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,220
現在要小心了
Now, careful.

351
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,820
如果你的手離開那個手柄你就只剩五秒鐘
Take your hand off that lever, you only have five seconds

352
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,560
和你的女兒們說再見了
to say good-bye to your daughters.

353
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,680
驚喜
Surprise.

354
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,200
上帝啊
Oh, God.

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,710
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,280
等等
Stop!

357
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,420
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

358
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,860
怎么了  媽媽
What's wrong, Mommy.

359
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,550
打開門
Open the door.

360
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,940
肯尼斯

361
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,320

371
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,770
謊言就像小小的黑色蝴蝶  史蒂文
Lies are like little black butterflies, Steven.

372
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,060
它們依附著你  直到你說出真相
They cling to you till you speak the truth...

373
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,250
然后給它們自由
And you set them free.

374
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,860
伊娃  史蒂文有話想對你說

他在我家襲擊我
He attacked me in my home,

387
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,290
我別無選擇
and I didn't have choice.

388
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,500
你愛他
You loved him.

389
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,310
我不該
I shouldn't have.

390
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,680
對不起  伊娃
I'm sorry, Eva.

391

考珀正在查華瑞茲那邊所有的資料

不  還沒有
No, not yet.

398
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,240
我們現在非常忙  好嗎
I mean, look, we're busy right now, all right?

399
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,660
我知道  但是等一下好嗎
I know, but just wait, okay?

400
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,620
你記起有關肯尼斯的事了

不  是關于潔娜的

爸爸  這很重要

是什么事  孩子

I've been texting Zina this whole time, but...

408
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,150
但其實不是她

409
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,940
"不是她"是什么意思
What do you mean "It wasn't her"?

I ran into her this morning, but she didn't know anything.

告訴了冒名短信我的人

413

因為他們說對案子很感興趣

幾周前

426
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,430
跟她說過吉娜被拘留的事嗎

427
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,840
她不知道這孩子今天遇到真的潔娜了
He doesn't know that he ran into the real Zina this morning.

00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,200
幫我把這張紙交給坐在長凳上的那個人
I need you to give this to the man sitting on tha bench.

444
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,090
多謝
Thank you.

445
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,350
他遲到了
He's late.

446
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,360
過來了
Incoming.

447
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,070
等等  別急
Hey, hey, hang on, hang on.

448
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,070
有人讓我把這個交給你
Somebody told me to give this to you.

449
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,070
別動
Hey, hold it.

450
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,990
你在干什么  孩子
What are you doing, son?

451
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,810
-有人讓我把這個給你  -他在哪
- A man told me to give that to you. - Where?

452
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,670
他在那
He's over there.

453
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,640
這是什么
What is it?

454
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,330
GPS坐標

455
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,460
走吧
Let's go.

456
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,060
寶貝兒

457
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,720
把你妹妹帶到角落里去

458
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,600
動作要快

459
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,890
老天  幫幫我
Oh, God, help me.

460
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,590
別讓我女兒死

461
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,090
聽到我父親的消息嗎
Have you heard from my dad?

462
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,530
沒有
No.

463
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,350
我很擔心
I'm worried.

464
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,970
我知道  一有動靜我會通知你的
I know. I'll let you know if we hear anything.

465
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,050
那是吉娜吧
So that is Gina?

466
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,340
是啊
Yes.

467
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,340
我不知道原來我在跟他說話
I didn't know I wa talking to him.

468
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,040
他很狡猾
He's smart.

469
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,070
他計劃這一切很久了
He's been planning this for long time.

470
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,300
奇怪的是
What's weird is...

471
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,620
他卻讓我離父親更近了
He made me closer to my dad.

472
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,030
格斯  你在說什么
What are you talking about, Gus?

473
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,020
我們聊天的時候
When we were chatting.

474
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,310
你以為自己再和一個女孩子聊天
You thought you were talking to a girl.

475
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,160
但我對他傾訴對父親的感情時
I know, but he gave good advice,

476
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,070
他給我很多很好的建議
when I told him how I was feeling about my father.

477
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,090
格斯
Gus...

478
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,670
我還在忙
I have work to do.

479
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,880
嗯  好
Yeah.

480
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,740
不打擾你了
Sure.

481
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,770
應該在那邊
Should be down there.

482
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,030
馬可  你得做好準備
Gonna have this rigged, Marco.

483
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,270
可能是陷阱
Could be rigged.

484
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,420
馬可  別激動
Marco, easy!

485
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,750
慢點  慢點
Go easy, easy, easy!

486
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,640
阿爾瑪  阿爾瑪
Alma! Alma!

487
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,390
孩子們和你在一起嗎

488
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,250
孩子們都在這里

489
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,120
只有你們在里面嗎

490
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,820
是的

491
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,080
用什么東西把這個砸開
I need something to break this down.

492
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,290
閃開點
Look out.

493
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,740
行了

494
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,390
馬可
Marco

495
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,080
這是個手雷

496
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,500
小心  小心

497
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,340
孩子們

498
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,490
快和我出來

499
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,330
快點  孩子們

500
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,240
來吧  快走  快走
Come on, go, go, go.

501
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,370
快跑  快跑
Run, run, run, run, run!

502
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,040
救救我

503
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,550
把手給我

504
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,120
小心  小心

505
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,560
沒事的  有我呢

506
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,870
有我在

507
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,250
別害怕  有我在
I have you.

508
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,780
看著我

509
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,490
別害怕

510
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,080
我們要配合好

511
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,740
我數三個數

512
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,920
你把它給我

513
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,030
我扔的時候  你就趕快蹲下  明白嗎

514
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,050
一

515
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,650
二

516
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,270
三

517
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,450
沒事了

518
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,620
都過去了

519
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,910
我想回家

520
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,680
我帶你回家

521
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,050
我帶你回家

522
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,540
他們沒事了  你爸爸找到她們了
Hey, they are OK, your father has them.

523
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,140
-他們捉住他了嗎  -沒有
- Did they get him? - No.

524
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,050
我想回家
I want to go home.

525
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,290
不行  我開車送你去安全房
You can't. I'm driving you to a safe house.

526
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,290
你爸爸在那和你碰面  走吧
Your father will meet you there. Let's go.

527
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,860
挖得夠深了
That's probably deep enough.

528
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,390
謝謝

529
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,400
你要告訴雷嗎
You are gonna tell Ray.

530
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,750
你說呢
Should I?

531
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,100
我覺得還是別告訴他了
I don't think it's a good idea.

532
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,280
等等
Wait.

533
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,540
我來
Let me.

534
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,420
然后會怎樣
What happens next?

535
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,410
倒上石灰
Lime.

536
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,030
加速腐爛
It will speed up the decomposition.

537
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,530
尸體一個星期之內就會消失
The bodies will be gone in a week.

538
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,160
不  我的意思是然后我們怎么辦
No, I mean wha happens next?

539
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,980
說不準
Ah, it depends.

540
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,640
希望能風平浪靜
Hopefully, nothing.

541
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,560
我得帶我老婆出去看場電影
I'm gonna take my wife out to go see a movie.

542
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,360
假裝什么也沒發生
and pretend none of this happened.

543
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,970
謝謝你  凱撒
Thank you, Cesar.

544
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,480
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

545
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,450
沒什么  夫人

546
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,350
我們明天再談吧
We'll talk tomorrow.

547
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,900
有關地道的事
About the tunnel.

548
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,000
到底該怎么辦
How it's gonna work now.

549
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,620
我們知道他是誰
We know who he is.

550
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,910
我們會抓住他的
We'll get him.

551
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,860
所以這一切都是因為我爸
So this is all about m Dad?

552
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,740
我沒這么說
I didn't say that.

553
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,270
他做了什么事
What did he do?

554
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,940
你該去問他
You should ask him that.

555
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,560
為什么黑斯廷要這么做
Why would Mr. Hasting do this?

556
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,270
沒道理啊
It doesn't make sense.

557
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,710
他還有什么事沒做
What he's not done?

558
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,700
不太對勁兒
It doesn't make sense.

559
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,570
怎么了
What?
