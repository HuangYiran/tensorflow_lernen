00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a recipe for disaster

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A four-course meal of "No sirree"

95
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It seemed that happily ever after

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was happy everyone was after me

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a cup of good intentions

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A tablespoon of one big mess

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A dash of overreaction

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I assume you know the rest

101
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I assume you know the rest

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One little slip

103
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One little slip

104
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a fusion of confusion

105
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}With a few confounding things

106
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess I probably took the wrong direction

107
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well I admit I might've missed a sign or two

108
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I took a right turn at confusion

109
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A left when I should've gone straight on through

110
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I ran ahead with my assumptions

111
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And we all know what that can do

112
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One little slip

113
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One little slip

114

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And a few confounding things

116
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I get the feeling in this town I'll never live 'til I live down

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The one mistake that seems to follow me around

118
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But they'll forget about the sky When they all realize

119
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This guy's about to try to learn to fly

120
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or hit the ground

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How's it going?

122
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a cup of good intentions

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a humble little stumble

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}With a big ungraceful

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then my dad'll finally have a reason to be proud of me.

191

199
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's hurt. It stung. OK? - It's hurt, but... Yes.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. Buh-buh... - But, it's...

202
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's got to happen now is the nut needs to be cracked open.

203
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And not one little chip at a time, but... bam!

204
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Smash! Bits of emotion flying everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, forget the nut part. Here's the main thing.

209
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK, yes, but... - Here's the real solution.

211
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You and your dad talk-talk-talking... closure!

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Up next... Chicken Little.

370
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Clearly a long shot, folks.

371
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team.

372
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's gonna lose the game for us! - Wait!

373
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If he can get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse

374
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all.

375
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's had a terrific game so far. A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

376
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, kid, listen up.

377
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have an itty-bitty, teeny-tiny strike zone.

378
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no way he can throw you out! Take the walk. Don't swing.

379
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I have a good feeling... - Look at me. Don't swing.

380
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take the walk. You hear me? Just take the walk!

381
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But, coach, wait! - Don't swing!

382
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine,

383
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Little advances to the box. He's going to bat from the right.

384
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Make it the left. No, the right.

385
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- The right. - Easy out!

386
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Left field's found something better to do,

387
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach

388
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- and right field's digging for grubs. - Play ball!

389
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why him?

390
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why now?

391
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I won't embarrass you, Dad. Not this time.

392
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's the wind-up, the pitch! It's a high cutter.

393
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ball!

394
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Uh... Strike one!

395
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

396
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The catcher lays down the signals. Here's the pitch.

397
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

398
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stee-rike two!

399
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ohh!

400
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I said, don't swing!

401
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't swing!

402
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No! - Batter up!

403
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's two in the hole!

404
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One more strike, it's a punch out, folks,

405
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and we're all going home.

406
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Today is a new day.

407
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't swing!

408
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, take away my squeaky toy! It's a hit!

409
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- A hit? - A hit?

410
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A hit?

411
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The batter is unbelievably at home plate.

412
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!

413
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go, son! Run! Run!

414
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Run!

415
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There he goes, the wrong way.

416
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Wait, wait, wait! - No, no! Not that way!

417
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Run the other way! - Turn around!

418
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's turned! I've never said these words before,

419
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but he's actually rounding home plate!

420
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Goosey steps on home... - A new day!

421
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A tie game! They're scrambling in the alley.

422
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Looks like Rodriguez has it. Nope, it's the center fielder!

423
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second.

424
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Catch is complete, but where's the ball?

425
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Little touches the bag and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

426
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The fielders are having trouble. Commotion out there!

427
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's stuck! It's stuck! - Tip the cow!

428
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the old tip-the-cow play.

429
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He heads for the hot corner, a stand-up triple!

430
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yes! - Hold up! No!

431
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's going for the whole enchilada!

432
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!

433
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go back! You're never gonna make it!

434
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Tries to lighten his load!

435
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders!

436
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He slides for the dish!

437
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's going to be a photo finish at home!

438
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're out!

439
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, folks. Folks, what a heartbreaker.

440
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Wait! - Wait!

441
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait a cotton-picking second. Hold your horses, here,

442
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and horses hold your breath. This might not be over. He...

443
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's...

444
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Safe! The runner is safe!

445
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's all over, folks!

446
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Acorns have done the impossible!

447
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For the first time in 20 years, we won the pennant!

448
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mothers, kiss your babies! You've witnessed a miracle!

449
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Remember where you were at this moment. The smells! The sounds!

450
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's a new winner in town and his name is Chicken Little!

451
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was just a lucky hit!

452
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours!

453
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The victory, the triumph, the glory!

454
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And getting doused with a sticky drink that soaks into your undies

455
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and chafes for hours!

456

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Uh...

553
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

554
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, that's it. We are doing an intervention!

555
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have got to stop messing around and deal with the problem!

556
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- She's right! - Abby, please.

557
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is exactly what fell on me the first time.

558
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no way I'm bringing this up again.

559
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No, he's not. - Runt!

560
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.

561
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. I'm sure there's a simple, logical explanation.

562
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, it could be a piece of weather balloon,

563
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or maybe it's part of some experimental communications satellite.

564
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't care. I want it out of my life, gone for good.

565
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everything back to normal.

566
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

567
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everybody thought it was from space and stuff?

568
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane.

569
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.

570
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. It's frozen pee. Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

571
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Could you stop saying that? - What? Pee?

572
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Pee. - Tinkle?

573
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Piddle? Wee-wee? - Whiz?

574
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, subject change.

575
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Make pishee? - I don't care what it is!

576
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you gonna help me get rid of it or not?

577
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Flying Fish! Take cover!

578
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fish!

579

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, wait, whoa, son! Where's the fire here?

583
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Chicken Little has something to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

584
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who're we talkin' about?

585

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

586

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ha! You got to be ready to listen to your children,

587

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}even if they have nothing to say.

588
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sit tight, Fish! - Fish! We will try to save you!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...maybe he's a half-living host

600
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}implanted with their face-hugging embryo babies.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just leave me some ammo, little water,

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are we lookin' for?

699
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know.

700
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Uh, yeah. OK. I know this looks bad,

701
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but there's an invisible spaceship right there

702
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with aliens who are here to invade Earth!

703
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me show you.

704
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ooh, bad throw.

705
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, let me try again.

706
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Bad throw. - We all know I don't have a good arm,

707

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but there's these cloaking paneIs on the bottom.

708
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:49,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They make it disappear. One fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head.

709
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}At least we can sell the video to Chickens Gone Wild.

712
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm telling ya, it was here! - No, wait! There were aliens!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's true! They had eyes... They're glowing and then tentacles!

714
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And maps with planets with X's through them! Aah!

715
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Runt, that's enough!

716
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection!

717
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

718
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why can't you keep that child of yours under control?

719
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What kind of parent are you?

720
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm telling the truth.

721
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

722
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You gotta believe me this time.

723
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, son. I don't.

724
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks.

725
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

726
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Looks like this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding.

727
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:03,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash!

728
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:09,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Cluck, don't take it so hard. No one blames you.

729
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in

730
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}after yet another Chicken Little incident last night.

731
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear,

732
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves

733
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- from the nearest park bench. - Hello? I'm sorry.

734
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello? I apologize. Hello? Give me a break!

735
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? You were trampled? That's terrible.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You have hate mail. - Sorry. That wasn't very funny.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You have more hate mail. - Hi. What are you saying, sir?

739
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your hate mail box is full.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank goodness the cloud blocked the last letter. Hello?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah? -

743
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yeah? Well, I'dlike to see you try.

744
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If there was ever a time to talk to your dad...

747
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:40,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...it's now.

748
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's too late for that.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's too late, baby, now it's too late.

750
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Though they really did try to make it.

751
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Runt.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just think about it.

753
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something inside has died and they just can't hide

754
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.

755
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Runt, I really just want to be alone right now.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- His name is Kirby? - They left him behind?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Darth Vader is Luke's father?

761
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, don't... Come on, come on, don't cry.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK.

765
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:05,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}See, guys? He's cool. He was just freaked out. That's all.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those are your parents?

769
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And they brought the galactic armada?

770
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him! - There you are. Get in the car.

771
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I gotta tell you something. - What?

772
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know, I know! You were right! Alien invasion. I see that now.

773
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look up! There it is!

774
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad, you know, about that...

775
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's actually a rescue mission. - Rescue mission?

776
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This alien kid was left and they're coming back to get him!

777
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will?

778
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?!

779
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway.

780
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Son!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth!

783
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the end of the world as we know it

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch out for the kid! No! Don't! Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!

794
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Chicken Little!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? Where's your head?

797
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We gotta get outta here! Come on! Come...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You, with the running and the jumping! - Dad. No, wait.

799
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you guys doing? We gotta get outta here!

800
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's like War of the Worlds out there!

801
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Stop pulling! - Just listen to me for one second!

802
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's not dangerous! - We are under attack!

803

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem?

804
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You're never there for me! - What?

805
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, that's not what I had in mind, but...

806
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're never there for me. I mean,

807
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell.

808
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And not at the ball field and not now!

809
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is good! Keep going. Keep going!

810
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've been ashamed since the acorn thing.

811
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have to talk because Modern Mallard says avoiding closure

812
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}can lead to molting. I'm already small

813

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I don't think I could handle being bald!

814
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}l...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...realize, son.

817
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}l- I never meant to...

818

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...

819
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're right. You're right.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, she was always good with stuff like this.

822
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Me...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you need to know that I love you,
