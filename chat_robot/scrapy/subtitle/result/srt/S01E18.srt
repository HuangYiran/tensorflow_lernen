1
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,460
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard.

2
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,963
少校!
Major!

3
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:56,024
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第18集 天赋
Season 1 : Episode 18
The Gift

4
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,286
继续
Continue.

5
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,538
不把我放在心上, 啊?
Going easy on me, huh?

6
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,456
我向你保证, 少校, 不是的
I assure you, Major, I am not.

7
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,541
继续
Continue.

8
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,553
你没事吧?
You okay?

9
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,056
是的
Yes.

10
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,266
真的?
Are you sure?

11
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,227
以前可都是我被打倒在地上
Because it's usually me
picking my butt up off the mat.

12
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,897
说实话, 我没有睡好
Truthfully, I have not been sleeping much,

13
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,900
我总是在梦中看到幽灵
and when I do,
I've been having nightmares about the Wraith.

14
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,610
做这种恶梦的不仅仅是你一个人
Well, you're not the only one.

15
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,780
自从我父亲被掠走之后
还从来没有这么糟糕过
It has not been so bad since my father was taken.

16
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,293
根据Zelenka博士的计算
According to Dr. Zelenka's calculations,

17
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,296
据幽灵到达这里还剩不到一个星期了
we have less than one week before the Wraith arrive.

18
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,173
我需要一些方案
I want options.

19
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,675
你是说除了哭着进入梦乡之外?
You mean besides crying ourselves to sleep?

20
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,137
不是我
我已经有好些天没有睡觉了
Well, not me.
I haven't slept in days.

21
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,015
那么经过了这么多不眠之夜之后
你有什么可以展示给我们看的, Rodney?
And what do you have to show
for your sleepless nights, Rodney?

22
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,186
自从我们到这里以来, 除了防护罩
我们还找到了一些防御武器系统
Since we got here, we've uncovered a number
of defensive weapons systems beyond the shield...

23
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,773
- 我们认为我们最好的主意就是控制椅
- 这正是我想说的
- We think our best option is the control chair.
- I was going to say that.

24
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,651
- 是的, 不过你挨得太久了, 跟往常一样
- 不错, 不过我想说的是, 这可能不是我们最好的选择
- Yes, but you were taking too long, as usual.
- Yes, but the point is, this may not be our best chance.

25
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,069
- 那你再举一个更好的?
- 先生们
- Name a better one.
- Gentlemen.

26
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,280
当然, 跟防护罩一样
能量是我们最大的问题
Of course, like the shield,
power will be our biggest problem.

27
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,574
我们甚至不能让那座椅子完成初始化
We haven't even been able to initialize the chair yet,

28
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,202
更不用说找到足够的能量
让它运行起来
much less determine whether we can
meet the power requirements to run it.

29
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,703
好吧
有消息就通知我
Okay. Keep me posted.

30
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:51,415
Sergeant Bates, 阿尔法站点准备得怎么样了?
Sergeant Bates, where are we with our alpha site?

31
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,837
我们已经完成了地面和空中的防御
现在已经打扫干净, 可以建立大本营了
We've completed the ground and aerial security
sweep and are ready to begin establishing base camp.

32
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,047
我们现在在等Sheppard少校的最后验收
We're just awaiting final inspection by major Sheppard.

33
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,340
午饭后就去
Right after lunch.

34
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,842
很好
Good.

35
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,928
Teyla, Athosian准备好撤离了么?
Teyla, are the Athosians getting
prepared for an evacuation?

36
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:07,265
是的, 不过很多人认为
没有星球可以躲避幽灵的袭击
Yes, but many believe there is
no other world that is safe from the Wraith.

37
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,517
他们想留下?
They want to stay?

38
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:14,188
根据从盟友听到的消息以及我们的亲眼所见
幽灵正在这个星系的每个角落洗劫
As we have heard from our allies and seen for ourselves,
there are cullings happening all over the galaxy.

39
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,357
我们人民花费了他们的一生来躲避幽灵
My people have spent
their lives hiding from the Wraith.

40
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,152
是的, 现在不同的是
我们准备毁掉这座城市
Yes, well, the difference here
being we do intend to destroy the city

41
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,029
而不是让它落入幽灵之手
rather than let it fall into the hands of the Wraith,

42
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:27,535
如果是那样的话, 任何留在大陆的人
将会无法通过星际之门进行穿梭
and, if it comes to that, anyone left on the
mainland will be cut off from the Stargate for good.

43
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,831
还好, 感谢Rodney发现了星际之门的控制水晶
Now, thanks to Rodney's discovery
of the Gate's control crystal,

44
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,709
我们至少知道, 可以把它带上
希望它可以派上用场
we at least know we'll be able
to take that with us and hopefully use it

45
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,460
在未来某个时候可以再次访问地球
to access Earth again some time in the future.

46
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,962
我们知道了,  Weir博士
We understand that, Dr. Weir.

47
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,464
- 很抱歉, 我...
- I'm sorry, I...

48
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,675
我只是想说
Athos的人民想让你知道
I am merely saying that
the people of Athos wish you to know

49
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,179
如果我们想留下来战斗的话
他们也可以来帮忙保卫这座古人的城市
that if we are going to stay and fight,
they too will help defend the city of the ancestors.

50
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,098
- 这非常值得尊敬, 不过我...
- 噢, 行了!
- Well that is very honorable, but I...
- Oh please !

51
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,475
我们完全没有可能留下来战斗
We can't possibly consider staying and fighting.

52
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,144
我不同意
Well, I disagree.

53
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:56,439
我认为这完全在可能的范围之内
I think it's entirely within the realm of possibility.

54
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:02,570
成千上万凶神恶煞的敌人正坐着它们
高度先进的飞船在赶来干掉我们的途中
There are tens of thousands of life-sucking aliens in
highly advanced spaceships on their way here to destroy us.

55
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,990
而我们有什么, 200人,
而且大部分还是科学家
And we have what, 200 people,
most of whom are scientists

56
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,075
它们之前从来没有开过枪
who've never even fired a gun before?

57
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,913
虽然很不情愿, 而且这是第一次
我这次不得不同意Kavanagh
Shockingly, for the first time ever,
I find myself having to agree with Kavanagh.

58
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,541
我想说的是我们不要放弃... 现在还不能
All I'm saying is let's not give up... just yet.

59
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,960
那么我们大家都应该记住的东西是什么?
What was that we were supposed to all remember?

60
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,295
很重要的东西
Something important.

61
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,380
哦, 是的, 就是这个... Alamo
Oh, yes, that's right... the Alamo.

62
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,469
是的, 你们都是科学家
没人想把你们这些人送上前线
Granted, you guys are scientists. No one's
considering putting you guys on the front line,

63
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,679
不过科学家确实可以扭转战争
but science can turn the tide of war.

64
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,473
瞧瞧原子弹
Look at the a-bomb.

65
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,683
那并不是我们最自豪的时刻
Not exactly our proudest moment.

66
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,602
现在的事实是, 幽灵还没有到达这里
The fact is, the Wraith aren't here quite yet,

67
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,481
在那以前, 我希望每个人
都在做他们所能够做的最好的事情
and until that moment, I would like everyone
to remain focused on what it is they do best.

68
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:43,945
就像我最开始所说的
如果有任何可行的方案, 我需要它们
Like I said off the top,
if there are any options, I want them.

69
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,321
就这
That's all.

70
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,549
Teyla?
Teyla?

71
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,801
嗨
Hi.

72
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,220
Kate Heightmeyer
Kate Heightmeyer.

73
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,265
是的, 对
刚才想不起来了, 抱歉
Yes. Right.
I knew that. I'm sorry.

74
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,268
没关系
介意我坐在这里么?
No problem.
Mind if I join you?

75
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,229
不, 当然不会
No, of course not.

76
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,650
是不是觉得很奇怪, 在我们很累的时候
记忆就这样从脑海中溜走了
Strange how the memory
just goes away when we're tired.

77
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,779
- 你是一名医生, 对吧?
- 心理学家, 事实上
- You are a doctor, right?
- Psychologist, actually.

78
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,033
跟Beckett博士不同?
And that is different than Dr. Beckett?

79
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,286
是这样
Quite, yes.

80
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,913
我侧重于心理方面
I deal with the mind.

81
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,875
我帮助人们应对情绪上的问题
I try and help people deal with emotional problems,

82
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,545
就像焦虑, 沮丧, 外伤过后的精神抑制
like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic distress.

83
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,756
不必说, 自从我们到这以来
我一直都非常忙
Well, needless to say,
I've been pretty busy since we got here.

84
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,050
可以想象
I can imagine.

85
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,554
我知道你为你的人民做的事情
有很多跟我的工作类似
I'm sure that you do a lot of the
same things that I do for your people,

86
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,767
不过总是要保持一副勇敢的容貌
对你来说一定是非常困难
but it must be very hard on you,
always having to keep such a brave face.

87
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,562
力量来自于希望
From strength comes hope.

88
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,689
没有希望, 我的人民可能早就不复存在了
Without hope, my people would be lost.

89
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,569
你一定认为在我们面前
你也必须表现得非常坚强
You must feel you have to be
outwardly strong for us, as well.

90
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:14,660
Teyla, 我知道你的价值和你的忠诚
在过去曾经受到这里一小部分人的质疑
Teyla, I know that your value and your loyalty
have been questioned by a few here in the past.

91
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:19,123
不过我想告诉你的是
如果你需要与人谈谈的话, 我会乐意奉陪的
What I'm trying to say to you is,
if you ever need to talk, I'm here.

92
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,209
是Sheppard少校叫你来的吧?
Did major Sheppard ask you to speak with me?

93
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,085
是的, 他本可以...
Yes, he may have...

94
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,128
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,548
我并不是有意冒犯, 不过我没事
I do not mean to be rude, but I'm fine.

96
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,133
真的
Really.

97
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,681
非常感谢你的关注
I appreciate your concern.

98
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,821
少校
Major.

99
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,074
Teyla
Teyla.

100
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,659
你告诉Heightmeyer什么了?
What did you tell Dr. Heightmeyer?

101
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,329
就是你所跟我说的那些
就是你无法入睡因为总是在做噩梦
Exactly what you told me. That you
couldn't sleep because you were having nightmares.

102
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,123
我是信赖你才跟你这样说的
I confided in you.

103
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,335
你是我的队伍中的一员
这让我有责任为你负责
You're a member of my team,
which makes you my responsibility,

104
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:10,007
而且我只告诉了一个人, 而她的工作
正是处理此类事情的
and I only told one person, whose job, by the way,
is to deal exactly with this sort of thing.

105
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,635
我的精神没有任何问题
There is nothing wrong with my mind.

106
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,303
没人说有问题
Nobody said there was.

107
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,599
为了让你的人尊敬我, 而不是认为我疯了
我一直都在努力
I have a hard enough time getting your people
to respect me without them thinking I'm crazy.

108
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,102
没人认为你疯了
而且每个人都很尊敬你
Nobody thinks you're crazy,
and everybody respects you.

109
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,520
不是这样的
That is not the point.

110
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,649
听我说, Teyla, 你可能需要休息一下
Look, Teyla, you may want to sit this one out.

111
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,401
什么意思?
What do you mean?

112
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,528
Rodney, Ford和我正准备去
Well, Rodney's staying back,
and Ford and I are just going to

113
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,447
最后检查一下阿尔法站点
在我们必须转移到那里之前
check out the alpha site
one last time before we have to move in.

114
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,993
如果我们必须撤离的话
我的人民也将被迫转移到哪个星球
Should we evacuate, my people
will be forced to that planet as well.

115
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,161
我保证对每个人来说
那里都会是安全的
And I'll make sure it's safe for everyone.

116
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,499
听着, Teyla, 我并不是说
你有什么地方不对劲
Look, Teyla, I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with you.

117
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,753
但愿不会这样, 不过你自己也承认
你的表现有些离谱
God forbid, but you yourself admitted
that you were a little off your game.

118
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,965
今天早上在报告厅
你无缘无故的呵斥Weir博士
You snapped at Dr. Weir this morning
in the briefing room for no good reason.

119
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,009
现在你又在朝我开火, 仅仅因为
我觉得你可能需要一些帮助
Now you're biting my head off
for caring that you might need help

120
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,345
因为已经三天了
你一直没法好好睡上一觉
dealing with the fact that it's been
three days since you've had any sleep.

121
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,765
我很抱歉, 不过我并不需要任何帮助
I'm sorry, but I do not need any help.

122
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,060
幽灵就要来了
我现在需要的就是做些什么
The Wraith are coming.
What I need is to do something.

123
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,729
是的, 很好
Okay. Good.

124
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,981
我建议你去打个盹
I suggest you take a nap.

125
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,311
- Teyla
- McKay博士
- Teyla.
- Dr. McKay.

126
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,688
我只是, 嗯...
I was just, um...

127
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,942
我们正彼此注视着对方
We're seeing each other.

128
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,072
你和Heightmeyer医生?
You and Dr. Heightmeyer?

129
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,286
你知道我是如何的喜欢
具有伟大... 思想的女人
Well, you know how much
I love women with great... minds.

130
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,289
请不要告诉... 任何人
Just don't say anything to... anyone.

131
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
我会替你保密的
Your secret is safe with me.

132
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,626
好的, 很好
Right. Very good. Excellent.

133
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,634
Heightmeyer医生?
Dr. Heightmeyer?

134
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,386
Teyla  请进
Teyla. Come in.

135
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,179
很抱歉打扰你了
I'm sorry to bother you.

136
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,266
- 我可不可以...
- 当然
- Is it all right if I...
- Of course.

137
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,976
请坐吧
Please, have a seat.

138
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,825
我并不是十分清楚这是如何工作的
I guess I'm not really sure
how this is supposed to work.

139
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,035
没事, 放松
Just relax.

140
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,079
告诉我你脑袋中所想的东西
Tell me whatever's on your mind.

141
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,501
我作过一些很恐怖的梦
I have been having bad dreams.

142
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,212
我感觉...
I feel...

143
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,595
在这个基地中的每个人可能都会觉得害怕
Everyone on this base is probably afraid.

144
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,890
- 我不知道我为什么到这里来打扰你...
- 你是不是总是感觉到幽灵?
- I do not know why I'm bothering you...
- Have you always been able to sense the Wraith?

145
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,144
是的, 自从我记事开始
Yes. Since I can remember.

146
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,937
这种感觉像是什么?
Well, what does it feel like?

147
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:25,786
感觉就像来自身体内部的一股很深的寒意
It feels like a deep cold that comes from within.

148
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,332
我第一次有这个感觉的时候
还是一个小女孩
I first felt it when I was a girl.

149
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:35,338
我无法呼吸, 然后不知道为什么
接着我就听到了幽灵的梭镖飞船
I could not breathe, and I did not know why,
and then we heard the darts.

150
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,341
你现在也是这样的感觉么?
Do you feel that way now?

151
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,554
我感觉我的心中有个结
将来某个时候就会发作
I have had a knot inside me for some time now.

152
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,934
据我所知, 它们的飞船
距离亚特兰蒂斯还有很长一段距离
As I understand, though,
their ships are still a great distance from Atlantis.

153
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,686
你真的能够从这么远的地方感觉到它们?
Can you really sense them from so far away?

154
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,275
这种感觉跟过去有一点不同
This feeling is a little different than in the past.

155
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,904
也许是因为它一直在那里
Perhaps it is because it is always there now.

156
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,572
我已经习惯了
I am getting used to it.

157
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,703
在我的一生中
还从来没有碰到这么多的幽灵醒来
Never before in my lifetime
have so many Wraith been awake.

158
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,540
你的人民当中, 很多人都有这个能力么?
Do many of your people have this ability?

159
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,083
有些人有
Some.

160
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,587
在这些人当中
一些人对幽灵的感觉更强一些
Among those few, some can
sense the Wraith stronger than others.

161
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,633
我总是第一个知道它们要来的人
I have always been among
the first to know they are coming.

162
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,301
这让你很特别
That makes you special.

163
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,886
这会让你有什么感觉?
How does that make you feel?

164
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,931
我不知道
我从来没有深入的思考这个问题
I do not know.
I suppose I have not given it much thought.

165
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,057
为什么不呢?
Why not?

166
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,726
为什么有些人的眼睛是蓝色
而其他人是褐色的?
Why do some people have blue eyes and others brown?

167
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,276
跟我讲讲你的噩梦
Tell me about your nightmares.

168
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,154
它就是我
It was me.

169
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,990
你站在你自己的身边?
You were standing over yourself?

170
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,910
它就是我... 不过它又不是我
It was me... but it was not me.

171
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,870
我是一个幽灵
I was a Wraith.

172
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,373
事实上, 人们浪费了大量的时间
试图解释它们的梦境
The truth is, people waste a lot of
time trying to interpret their dreams.

173
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,959
它们其实只是在我们睡觉时
我们大脑的另外一种思考方式
They're really just another way
our brain thinks when we're asleep.

174
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,461
并没有什么隐藏的含意
There are no hidden meanings.

175
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,756
实际上, 我们总是倾向于忘记
我们所梦到的几乎所有的东西
In fact, we tend to forget
most everything we dream about.

176
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:46,093
我们有意识的大脑能够判断
哪些东西对我们最为重要
Our conscious mind is capable
of deciding what's most important to us.

177
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,723
可是实际上, 在某种程度上,
我看到自己变成一个幽灵对我来说非常困惑
Well, the fact that, on some level,
I see myself as a Wraith is very disturbing to me.

178
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,562
我认为你所具有的这种特殊能力,
这种可以感觉幽灵的天性,
I think this special ability you have,
this talent for sensing the Wraith,

179
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:01,776
在你的意识中将你和它们联系起来,
而这也正是你试图抗拒的
connects you to them in your mind,
maybe in a way you would like to deny.

180
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,323
你说在过去从来没有真正的考虑这个问题
我认为这不是真的
You said you hadn't really given it much thought
in the past. I don't think that's true.

181
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,368
那我应该怎么做? 我又不能改变它
What am I supposed to do? I cannot change it.

182
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,747
也许是不行, 不过我们所害怕的
正是这些未知的东西
Probably not, but the unknown frightens us.

183
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:22,338
我们都愿意感觉一切都在控制之中
即便大部分时候我们的能力事实上还远远不够
We all like to feel in control, even though most of the
time our power over most things is just an illusion,

184
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,262
不过我发现我们对某样东西了解得越多
我们就越可以说服自己, 我们可以控制它
but I find the more we know about something, the more
we can convince ourselves we are in control of it.

185
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,476
我已经对你进行了我所能够采取的每项测试
I ran every test I could on all of you from the get-go.

186
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,229
从生理学上讲, 你和你的人民
跟我们是完全一样的
Physiologically, you and
your people are the same as we are.

187
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,274
我无法解释你所具有的那些超能力
I have no explanation for any
of your special super powers.

188
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,984
我只有一个
I only have one.

189
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,236
我看到过你战斗
I've seen you fight, my dear.

190
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,241
我过去曾经认为这种能力是
家族血统所遗传下来的
并以此作过一些追查
I have previously traced this ability as something
that is passed on through family lineage.

191
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,159
你说这不是生物学上的?
Does that not make it biological?

192
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,205
看起来应该是, 不过没有你的族谱中
每个人的基因样本
It would seem so, but without genetic samples
from everyone in your family tree,

193
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:01,961
我也无法标示出
引起这一生理学反映的基因片段
I would have little to no chance of identifying the specific
characteristic that causes the anatomical response.

194
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,881
这非常困难
It'd be difficult.

195
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,177
那如果你和我一同飞到大陆中去,
有没有这个可能呢?
Any chance you would have time
to fly me over to the mainland?

196
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,180
如果你想将你的生命掌握在你自己手中
If you're willing to take your life into your own hands.

197
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,308
我很乐意
I'd love a break.

198
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,368
你变了, Teyla
You've changed, Teyla.

199
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,995
我的头发变短了
My hair is shorter.

200
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,581
不止是你的头发, 亲爱的
It's more than your hair, dear.

201
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:44,086
我仍然还可以看到那个
常常为我画出美妙图画的小女孩
I can still see the little girl
who used to paint me beautiful pictures

202
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,006
那个唱着古人歌曲的小女孩
while she sang the songs of the Ancients.

203
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,675
我早就已经不是那个小女孩了, Charin
I have not been that girl in a long time, Charin.

204
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,807
不, 即便是Teyla, Athosian人的领袖,
也总是可以抽空来探访我, 老Charin, 这样卑微的人
No, but even Teyla, leader of the Athosians, always
found the time to come and visit with poor, old Charin.

205
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,435
我很想念你做的tuttleroot汤
I have missed your tuttleroot soup.

206
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,773
不过我想并不只是我的汤
让你来到这里
But I suspect it's more than my soup
that has brought you here.

207
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,736
你来这里是要把我拉出我的帐篷
并把我带到另外一个星球
You've come to pluck me from my tent
and take me to yet another world.

208
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:16,202
现在不是, 不过看起来我们可能不得不
再次撤离, 至少是暂时性的
Not yet, but it seems we may have
to evacuate again soon, at least temporarily.

209
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,665
假如实现不了, 你会答应么?
Did you allow yourself to expect differently?

210
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,377
我仍然相信终究有一天
我们可以从幽灵的阴影中解放出来
I still believe that we can
one day be free of the Wraith.

211
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:30,258
你可以为那些英勇献出自己生命的人
去讲这些故事
You can save such stories for those
whose bones aren't failing them.

212
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,554
Charin...
Charin...

213
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,890
你知道为什么我会感觉到幽灵即将到来?
do you know why I can sense the Wraith coming?

214
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,934
你生来就是如此
You were born to it.

215
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,937
在每一代人中, 总有几个人具有这个能力
There have been a few in every generation.

216
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:47,191
我知道, 不过从来都没有人想过
为什么会这样么?
I know, but has no one ever
wondered how that is possible?

217
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:51,779
有些人认为这是祖先们所传下来的天赋
Some believe it was a gift from the ancestors.

218
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,823
你呢?
And you?

219
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,620
你父亲让我不要告诉你
Your father asked me not to tell you.

220
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,667
我父亲已经不在了
My father is not here anymore.

221
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:13,176
不能让其他活着的Athosian人知道
No other living Athosian
knows of this, for good reason.

222
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,304
求你了
Please.

223
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,681
无论如何告诉我吧
Tell me anyway.

224
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:25,021
我的祖父曾经告诉我一个故事...
My grandfather used to tell a story...

225
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,983
从来没有人听过的...
no one has ever heard the like, before or since...

226
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:33,779
关于少数被送回来的人
about the few who once returned.

227
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,865
被送回的?
Returned?

228
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,036
有一个星球...
There was a planet...

229
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:45,041
就跟我们所想到的一样
幽灵经常光顾那里
as was expected, every so often, the Wraith came,

230
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:50,630
村民被掠走, 不过那里
在这个特别的星球
villagers were taken, but there,
on this particular planet,

231
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,428
有几次, 被掠走的人又回来了
on several occasions, the taken came back.

232
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,686
有些人认为祖先们
将他们所珍爱的东西遗传了下来
Some believed that the ancestors
had returned their loved ones to them,

233
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:11,025
那种可以免受幽灵迫害的天赋
that they had been blessed with a gift
that made them unwanted by the Wraith.

234
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,738
还有人甚至还讲述了一些故事
那些被掠走的人如何征服了幽灵
Others even told tales of how the taken
had somehow vanquished the Wraith,

235
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,075
不过不久之后, 被掠走的人就开始感到害怕
but soon, the taken began to be feared.

236
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,243
为什么?
Why?

237
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,703
他们说听到了一些声音
They spoke of hearing voices.

238
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,206
很多人开始行为古怪
Many began to behave strangely.

239
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:29,168
有些人变得非常暴力, 甚至杀人
Some became violent, even murderous.

240
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,421
听起来好像
这并不是由古人所造成的
Well, it doesn't sound like
the Ancients were responsible for that.

241
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,506
不是
No.

242
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,759
村民们开始转向那些被掠走的人
这是一场大屠杀
The villagers turned on the taken. It was a massacre.

243
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,344
除了极少数, 大部分人都被杀死了
All but a few were killed.

244
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,389
剩下的人被放逐了
The rest were ostracized, sent away.

245
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:45,977
从那里后, 那个村子被掠走的人
就再也没有回来的了
After that, no others that were taken
from that village ever returned again,

246
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:54,068
不过那些活下来的, 他们就是那些
Charin所认为的传递天赋的人
but those few who survived, they are the ones
who Charin believes passed on the gift.

247
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,697
- 而有一个被掠走又活下来的人就是...
- 我的祖先
- And one of the taken that survived was...
-  My lineage.

248
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,284
我有发生这件事的星球的地址
I have the address to the planet where this happened.

249
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,286
Charin说那个村子早就不复存在了
Charin says the village is long gone.

250
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,915
剩下的只有废墟
不过我仍然很想去那里
All that is left are ruins,
but still, I wish to go there.

251
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,209
现在?
Now?

252
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,297
我认为发生这一切的原因
一定要大白于天下
I believe this must be coming to light now for a reason.

253
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,216
也许我们可以发现真正所发生事情的证据
Maybe we can find evidence of what really happened.

254
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,803
听着, Teyla, 我们还有很多事情要去做
Look, Teyla, there are a lot
of things that we need to get done.

255
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,307
也许这可以帮我们找到一个
抗击幽灵的方法
Maybe there is a way to fight
the Wraith that we have yet to discover.

256
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:33,024
或许我的祖先并没有达到足够的认知水平
以弄清楚这种天赋到底是什么
Perhaps my ancestors were simply not enlightened
enough to recognize their gift for what it was.

257
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,612
去看看没有什么大不了的
Doesn't hurt to take a look around.

258
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,374
- 长官, 这儿什么都没有
- 我知道
- Sir, there's nothing here.
- I know.

259
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,920
- 天黑了, 我们是不是该回去了?
- 再给她几分钟
- Well, it's dark. Shouldn't we be getting back?
- Give her a minute.

260
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:55,755
长官...
Sir...

261
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,758
Ford, 我需要她能够摆脱这一切
好好睡上一觉
Ford, I need her to put
this behind her, get some sleep.

262
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,928
我们大家这样做, 不管会发生什么
We all do so, whatever it takes.

263
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,974
Rodney?
Rodney?

264
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,601
我在这里收到一些信号
I've got something here.

265
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,894
真的么?
Really?

266
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,271
我不知道  我收到了一些...
I don't know. I've got a little...

267
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,984
你收到了一些什么?
You've got a little what?

268
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,403
嗨, McKay, 你收到了一些什么?
Hey, McKay, you've got a little what?

269
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,615
什么?
What?

270
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,286
哦, 你们这些家伙不要跟我开玩笑了
Oh, it's okay when you guys make fun of me.

271
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,955
Rodney?
Rodney?

272
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,249
收到一个微弱的能量信号
Picking up a faint energy signal.

273
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,501
变得越来越强了
It's getting stronger.

274
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,920
从这里发出的
Coming from here.

275
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,130
这里什么都没有
There's nothing here.

276
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,342
古人的设备到现在为止
还从来没有欺骗过我们
Well, the magic ancient device hasn't lied yet.

277
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,677
这是实心的
It's solid.

278
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,262
这里确实有些东西很奇怪
Well, there's definitely something weird here.

279
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,763
怎么奇怪?
Weird how?

280
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,975
- 那是怎么回事?
- Teyla!
- How about that?
- Teyla!

281
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,977
Teyla!
Teyla!

282
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,814
如果你有一个良好的开端
也许, 你就可以冲进去
Maybe if you got a good running start.
You know, really slam into it.

283
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,489
你是怎么做到的?
How'd you do that?

284
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,284
我不知道
我只是在找出来的路
I do not know. I was just looking for a way out.

285
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,755
看起来像是在幽灵的飞船里面
Looks like the inside of a Wraith ship.

286
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,674
他们到底在这里做什么?
What the hell were they doing here?

287
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,649
Rodney.
Rodney.

288
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,984
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.

289
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,278
Sheppard说你认为找到了一个幽灵的实验室?
Sheppard said you think you found a Wraith laboratory.

290
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,698
看起来像是
某种隐藏的秘密研究室
Certainly looks that way.
Some sort of hidden secret facility.

291
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,034
很明显被抛弃很长时间了
It's obviously been abandoned for a very long time.

292
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:53,664
我要把这个数据记录器
接入到某个计算机终端
I was able to pull this data recorder
from one of the computer consoles.

293
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,709
你认为幽灵是在
那个星球上的人身上做实验?
You think the Wraith were experimenting
on the people of that planet?

294
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,919
我也说不清楚
I have no idea.

295
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,505
- 希望这个东西能够告诉我们
- 它们为什么要保密呢?
- Hoping this thing will tell us.
- Why their need for secrecy?

296
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,342
幽灵可以随便掠走人们
用他们做任何想做的事情
The Wraith can take people at will
and do whatever they want with them.

297
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,762
搞定了
Here we go.

298
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,140
这里
There.

299
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,226
现在, 这个, 嗯...
Now, that, uh...

300
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,354
我对这个一窍不通
that means absolutely nothing to me.

301
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,899
上一次我见到类似的内容
展示的是一个飞船的星系定位系统
Last time I saw the contents of one of these,
it showed a galactic positioning system for ships.

302
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:22,610
它有更多的... 图像而不是符号
It was more... pictures than symbols.

303
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,861
我想...
I wonder...

304
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,076
你就知道这些
你实际上并没有读完那个句子
Just so you know, you didn't
actually finish that sentence out loud.

305
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,495
这很显然是一种语言
Well, this is obviously a language.

306
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,829
幽灵的语言?
Wraith language?

307
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,748
有理由相信是
That would make sense.

308
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,625
我想好好看看这个
I'd love to have a good look through this.

309
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,085
随便
Knock yourself out.

310
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,087
我要回去看看那个控制椅了
I have to get back to the control chair anyway.

311
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:50,096
你认为为什么你可以通过那道门
而其他人却不行呢?
Why do you think you could access
the doorway when no one else could?

312
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,013
我不知道
I don't know.

313
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,891
是不是因为只有幽灵
才可以进入那个秘密的研究室?
Is it because only a Wraith
can enter a secret Wraith facility?

314
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,184
我不是幽灵
I'm not a Wraith.

315
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,313
告诉我... 当幽灵的感觉如何?
Tell me... what does it feel like to be a Wraith?

316
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,899
我觉得很饿
I feel hunger.

317
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,538
你还记不记得最后一次
我坐在其中一个当中时发生了什么?
Don't you remember what happened
last time I sat in one of those?

318
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,207
现在的能量远远不够
这玩意儿什么也做不了
There's nowhere near enough power
in the thing to do anything.

319
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,251
那为什么还要搞得这么麻烦呢?
先生们, 已经很晚了
Then why bother? Gentlemen, it's quite late.

320
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,879
我们只是想判断一下到底需要多少能量
We are trying to determine exactly how much power

321
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,173
才能操纵由这个椅子所控制的系统
is required to operate the systems
that are controlled by the chair.

322
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,466
为了做到这一点, 它必须就必须启动
And in order to do that, it needs to be on.

323
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,593
你现在有这个基因了
You have the gene now.

324
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:32,346
是的, 不过我在集中精力想着
如何激活这个东西的时候
我就没有办法分析返回的数据了
Yeah, but I can't be trying to analyze
the feedback data while I'm concentrating
on keeping the damn thing activated.

325
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,514
你为什么不去分析一下它?
Why don't you analyze it?

326
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,391
是的, 我可以分析它
不过Rodney并不认为...
Well, I could analyze it,
but Rodney doesn't think that...

327
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,684
先生们, 怎么样了?
Gentlemen, how's it coming?

328
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,935
不好
Well, not good.

329
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,646
我很抱歉, 这帮不上忙
Carson, 我需要你
Well, I'm sorry.
This won't help. Carson, I need you.

330
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,731
噢, 感谢上帝
Oh, thank god.

331
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,690
不过我们正在用他
But we're using him.

332
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,984
- 怎么了? 有人受伤了?
- 你的理论是对的
- What is it? Is someone hurt?
- You were right.

333
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,444
真令人高兴  是关于什么的理论?
Lovely. About what?

334
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,406
那个幽灵是在古人到达飞马星系之后
开始进化的理论
Your theory of the Wraith evolving after
the Ancients arrived in the Pegasus galaxy.

335
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,616
简直是开玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

336
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,742
(我赢了), 付钱吧
Pay up.

337
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,743
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

338
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,870
幽灵的语言是从古人的语言派生出来的
The Wraith language is a derivative of ancient.

339
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,246
那并不绝对就说...
Well, that doesn't categorically mean...

340
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,748
Rodney, 请听我说
Rodney, please.

341
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,417
那并不是我想见你的原因
That's not why I need to see you.

342
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,837
我已经能够翻译幽灵的数据设备中
记录的日志的第一部分了
I've been able to translate the first part
of the log from the Wraith data device.

343
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:05,713
真的么?
Really?

344
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,094
- 好了, 我们再试试Kusanagi博士
- 再试试Kusanagi
- All right, we'll try Dr. Kusanagi again.
- Kusanagi again.

345
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,180
- 马上
- 好的
- 谢谢
- Now.
- Okay.
- Thank you.

346
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,566
早上好
Good morning.

347
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,528
你看起来就像我担心的那样
You look like I fear.

348
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,782
我们整晚都没睡
Well, we've been up all night.

349
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,701
你想找我?
You wished to see me?

350
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,787
你最好坐下来
You'd better sit down.

351
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,497
怎么了?
What is it?

352
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,670
我翻译了你带回的日志的第一部分, 然后...
Well, I translated the first part
of the log you brought back, and...

353
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,506
你真的认为你不想坐下来?
are you sure you don't want to have a seat?

354
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,222
幽灵在你的祖先身上做了一些实验
The Wraith were conducting
experiments on your ancestors.

355
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:00,268
实际上, 只是一个幽灵
而且它这样做是违背了其它幽灵的意愿
It was just one Wraith, actually, and he was
doing it against the wishes of the other Wraith,

356
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,311
这就是为什么它要秘密进行
which is why he was doing it in secret.

357
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,105
他做了什么?
What was he doing?

358
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:10,486
我想他正试图让他们的食物来源
与他们这个物种更加协调
I think he was trying to make their
food source more compatible with their species.

359
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,571
我不明白
I do not understand.

360
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,614
这很难成功
It was very easy to miss.

361
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:17,952
事实上, 我甚至无法进行必需的比较
来分离特定的片断
In fact, I couldn't even make the kind of comparison
necessary to isolate the specific strand.

362
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,663
我们需要幽灵的细胞
这个我们终于得到了
We needed Wraith cells,
which we eventually got,

363
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,916
不过我们还需要包含在这些细胞中的
完整的基因图谱
but then we needed a full mapping of
the genetic code contained within those cells,

364
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,334
而这个还没有完成50%...
which wasn't even 50% complete...

365
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:25,960
求你了
Please.

366
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,213
告诉我
Tell me.

367
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,677
在你的遗传信息中, 含有一些幽灵的DNA
You have some Wraith DNA in your genetic makeup.

368
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,058
你在说Teyla有一部分是幽灵?
You're saying Teyla is part Wraith?

369
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,185
一个很小的部分
A very small part.

370
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,480
这让她同你一样, 跟我们不同
由于你所带有的古人的基因
Which makes her about as different from us as
you, because of the ancient gene you possess.

371
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,065
还有一些其它的东西
Well, and some other things.

372
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,775
如果知道这个, Bates就会发狂的
Still, Bates is going to go nuts over this.

373
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,110
我们先不要把这个公布出去
Let's just keep this one under our hat.

374
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:54,614
是的, 很显然Teyla将会非常在意每个人的反应
Well, obviously Teyla is very concerned
about how everyone will react.

375
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,409
怎么, 这么说你认为这个幽灵科学家
正试图让人类, 怎么说呢, 更可口?
What, so you think this Wraith scientist was
trying to make humans what, more tasty?

376
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:03,539
日志看起来是在说明他正在试图寻找一种方法
以让取食的过程更加有效
The log seems to indicate that he was looking for a
way to make the feeding process more efficient.

377
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:07,460
我想你说过它们具有一些
类似于人类的基因特征
I thought you already said they had a number
of genetic characteristics similar to humans.

378
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,672
确实是这样, 不过相比我们而言, 它们还是
更接近于攻击Sheppard 少校的麻烦制造者
They do, but they're still much closer to the bug
creature that attacked major Sheppard than to us.

379
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,342
嗨, 不要再提那个了好么
Hey, I thought we weren't
going to mention that anymore.

380
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,468
抱歉
Sorry.

381
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:21,098
同时令我们感兴趣的还有幽灵的语言
看起来是从古人的语言派生出来的
Also interesting is the fact that the Wraith
language appears to be a derivative of ancient,

382
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:25,436
这就意味着幽灵是在
古人到达飞马星系之后发展起来的
which seems to suggest that the Wraith
evolved after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

383
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,732
我的理论就是古人无意中
允许人类在一个星球上进化
My theory is that the Ancients unwittingly
allowed humans to evolve on a planet

384
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,443
同时还有... 昆虫物种在上面
with the... insect species on it.

385
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:38,282
在某种情况下, 这些昆虫以人类为食
并且不知为何将我们的DNA结合进了它们的DNA
At some point, the insects fed on humans and
somehow incorporated our DNA into theirs.

386
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,701
幽灵就是这种组合所进化出来的结果
The Wraith are an evolution of that combination.

387
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,539
照你这么说, 实际上是古人创造了幽灵?
So, what you're saying is the
Ancients actually created the Wraith?

388
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,164
不经意间
By accident.

389
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,541
或者是疏忽
Or negligence.

390
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,501
不管是哪种方式, 这都无所谓了
Well, either way, it doesn't matter.

391
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,797
从根本上说, 在生理学上我们对幽灵了解得越多,
我们就越有可能制造出一种生物武器
Ultimately, the more we know about Wraith physiology,
the closer we get to a biological weapon

392
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,383
用它来袭击幽灵, 保护人类免受伤害
that can attack the Wraith and leave humans unharmed.

393
00:27:55,383 --> 00:28:00,888
是的, 不过此时, 我们所知道的就是
古人可能偶然间制造了幽灵
Yes, but for the moment, all we know is that the
Ancients might have accidentally created the Wraith,

394
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,890
以及为什么Teyla可以感觉到它们的到来
and why Teyla can sense them coming.

395
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,436
具有讽刺意味的是, 秘密揭开了,
不过不管是哪个都无法帮助我们阻止它们的到来
I mean, fabulous, mystery solved, but neither of
which that help, in any way, stop them from coming.

396
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,230
Rodney是对的
Rodney's right.

397
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,815
让我们回去干活吧
Let's get back to work.

398
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,650
谢谢
Thank you.

399
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,572
我知道这不是我的错
I know that it is not my fault.

400
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,448
我什么也做不了
There's nothing I can do about it.

401
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,953
事实上, 我现在跟昨天
以及上星期没有什么不同
The fact is, I'm really no different now
than I was yesterday or last week.

402
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,746
不过你感觉到不同了
But you feel different.

403
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,248
是的
Yes.

404
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:34,255
我想我最担心的就是人们会如何看待我
I think the thing that I am most
worried about is how people will perceive me.

405
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:41,554
我的父亲告诉人们, 我与众不同
这是天赋
My father told people that it was a gift,
that I was special, but in a good way.

406
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:45,016
我可以帮助我的人民
通知他们幽灵即将到来
I could help my people by warning
them of the Wraith's approach.

407
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:51,814
他这样做是为了保护我, 不过在多数情况下, 我想
这也是为什么他们首先把我当作首领的原因
He did it to protect me, but in many ways, I think
that it is why they first turned to me as a leader.

408
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,734
正如你刚才所说的,
你跟昨天没有什么不同
As you just said, you're no
different than you were yesterday.

409
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:58,571
是的, 不过现在他们有理由害怕我了
Yes, but now they have reason to fear me.

410
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,495
好了, 即便是Sheppard坐在那个椅子中
我们仍然不能...
All right, even with major Sheppard in
the chair, we weren't able to...

411
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,540
怎么了?
What is that?

412
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,545
你所说的让我想起...
Something you said made me wonder...

413
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,549
我想我们所决定的
应该是更重要的事情...
I thought we decided there
were more important things...

414
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,468
为什么幽灵科学家停止了实验?
why did the Wraith scientist stop the experiments?

415
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,637
我说过的什么让你想起了这个?
What would I have said that
would make you think that?

416
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,263
我记不起来了
I don't remember.

417
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,307
这真是... 真是一个好问题
我只是想知道我说过的什么...
Well, it's just... it's a good point.
I'm just wondering what I said that...

418
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,351
抱歉, 你想到了什么?
Sorry. What have you got?

419
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,062
首先, 我认为是其它幽灵抓住了他
Well, at first I thought it was
because the other Wraith caught him.

420
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:31,771
他们没有?
They didn't?

421
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,689
没有, 根据这个, 他是自己停止的
No, according to this, he stopped on his own.

422
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:37,026
现在你的话让我想搞清楚为什么
其它幽灵不想这些实验在第一个地方进行
See, now you've got me wondering why the rest
of the Wraith didn't want these experiments
taking place in the first place.

423
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,152
很对
Exactly.

424
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,531
特别是当它们每个人都可以从中获益的时候
Especially since they were supposed to
be intended to improve things for everyone.

425
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,949
是的, 我也是这样想的
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

426
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:43,741
我刚说的
I just said it.

427
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,492
你可以停一下么?
Will you stop?

428
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,911
OK, 现在是最重要的部分...
Okay, here's the most interesting part...

429
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,331
幽灵使用某种心灵感应网络来相互交流
The Wraith communicate with each
other using some sort of telepathic network.

430
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,666
我注意到了
I noticed that.

431
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,084
幸运的是
Thankfully,

432
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,294
它们还不能读取人类的心灵
they can't seem to read the
minds of humans, though.

433
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,591
这很好, 不过这跟幽灵停止试验
有什么关系呢?
That's good, but what does this have
to do with the Wraith stopping the experiments?

434
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:04,303
因为, 通过将哪怕是很小一部分的
幽灵DNA组合到人类的DNA当中
Because, by combining even small
amounts of Wraith DNA with humans,

435
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,682
那个科学家赋予了人类幽灵的精神能力
the scientist was giving the
humans Wraith mental abilities.

436
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,143
他那些试验的受实验者
能够听到幽灵的通信
The subjects of his experiments were
able to hear the Wraith communications.

437
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,565
Teyla所讲述的故事中,
那些人们所听到的声音就是...
In the stories that Teyla told,
the voices that the people heard were...

438
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,692
是幽灵, 其实
were Wraith. Exactly.

439
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,277
这很可能让他们发疯
It must have driven them mad.

440
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:23,823
那个幽灵科学家找不到解决办法
所以最终他放弃了
The Wraith scientist couldn't find a
way around it, so eventually he gave up.

441
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,907
我不理解
I don't understand.

442
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,993
我是说, 他为什么又让他们回到人群当中呢?
I mean, why let them back in
the general population, then?

443
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:32,248
看起来他认为这样与普通人类
杂种繁殖之后应该会削弱这种反应
Well, it seems he thought that interbreeding
with normal humans might dilute the effect.

444
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,625
当他认为这种想法错了的时候
已经太迟了
Before he realized he was wrong, it was too late.

445
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:39,964
当其它幽灵发现了他所做的一切之后
它们那个星球上的所有人一扫而光
When the other Wraith did find out what he had
done, they wiped out all the people on the planet...

446
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:46,470
不过这是在一些受实验者被放逐以及
被迫离开之后
but not before several of the test subjects had
already been ostracized and forced to leave.

447
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,389
好吧, 这对我们有什么帮助?
Okay, so how does this help us?

448
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,559
Teyla可能不仅仅只有可以感觉到
幽灵即将到来的能力
Teyla may have more than just
the ability to sense the Wraith coming.

449
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,062
你是说你认为Teyla可能可以...
You're saying you think Teyla might be able to...

450
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,316
接入到幽灵的精神网络?
tap into this Wraith psychic network?

451
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:03,029
如果她可以的话, 我们就能够收集到
所有我们需要的关于它们的内部信息
If she can, we'll be able to gather
all the intel we ever needed about them.

452
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:14,457
我以前从来没有听到过幽灵的思考
I have never been able to hear
the thoughts of the Wraith before.

453
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,669
根据笔记的记载, 所有的被赋予幽灵DNA的
受测试者, 都有这个能力
According to the notes, all the test subjects
who were given the Wraith DNA, they had the ability.

454
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,339
可能是因为你以前从来没有尝试过
It's possible it's because
you've never actually tried before.

455
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,510
你不知道你可以读取幽灵的心灵,
而且很坦白的说, 谁曾想过?
You didn't know you could read Wraith
minds, and quite frankly, who would want to?

456
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,974
听着, Teyla, 如果我认为这不会给我们
带来一些潜在的重要的信息的话
Look, Teyla, I would not even
consider asking you to do this

457
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:35,728
我不会要求你这样做的
if I didn't think it could potentially
provide us with some vital information.

458
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,439
我只是不知道我该怎么去做
I just do not know what to do.

459
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,816
好吧, Heightmeyer医生有办法
Well, Dr. Heightmeyer has a theory.

460
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,529
我认为有可能, 经过漫长的时间,
经过很多代人之后
I think it's possible that, over time,
through several generations,

461
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,033
具有你这种能力的人
已经建立起了一道心理上的防线
people with your ability have developed a mental
barrier to the thought projections of the Wraith.

462
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,410
某种自我保护机制
Sort of a self-defense mechanism.

463
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,745
如果我们可以穿过那道...
If we can get past that...

464
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:53,704
怎样穿过?
How?

465
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,332
我们有一种被称作催眠的治疗方法
We have a treatment process called hypnosis.

466
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,668
Heightmeyer可以引导你穿过它
Dr. Heightmeyer can lead you through it,

467
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,922
而且Beckett博士将会一直守在旁边
监视你的身体状况
and Dr. Beckett will remain on hand
at all times to monitor your physiology.

468
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,217
幽灵仍然还在非常远的地方, 是不是?
The Wraith are still very far away, are they not?

469
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,137
是的, 而且McKay, 他确实也对心灵感应的范围
有一些疑虑
Yes, they are, and McKay, he does have
some doubts about the range of this telepathy.

470
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,099
不过如你所说的
你现在已经可以感觉到幽灵了
But as you've said, you can sense the Wraith now.

471
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,812
如果这可以激发你意识中
一个更大的潜能的话
If that's merely a bleed-through effect
into your consciousness of a greater latent ability,

472
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,314
那么就值得去打破这道心理防线
then it may be worth trying to break the barrier.

473
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:26,404
非常诚实的讲, 如果是在其它情况下
我是不会推荐这样做的
To be perfectly honest, it's not something I would
ever recommend doing under any other circumstances.

474
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:31,158
不过现在已经远不是平常的情况了, Teyla
But these are far from normal
circumstances that we're in, Teyla.

475
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,786
如果我确实可以为我们提供一些东西...
If I can somehow provide us with something...

476
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,539
它们的战略, 某个弱点...
their strategy, a weakness...

477
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,792
我看我别无选择
I see no other choice.

478
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,010
好了, 我认为已经准备好了
Okay, I think we're ready.

479
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,845
好了么?
Are you?

480
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,307
OK, 我现在要你呼吸...
Okay, I want you to breathe...

481
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,059
完全的, 深深的呼吸, 并且尽量的放松
nice and deeply, and try to relax.

482
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,896
Beckett博士准备注射一计轻度的镇静剂
Dr. Beckett's going to administer a mild sedative.

483
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,149
如果这奏效的话
我们应该还可以彼此间对话
Now, if this works, we should still be able
to communicate with each other.

484
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:07,653
记住, 我们任何时候都可以
使用一个非常低等级的电流来唤醒你
Remember, we can wake you at any time,
using a very low-grade electrical current.

485
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,488
这不会造成任何伤害的
It won't hurt at all.

486
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,241
如果想停止, 就说"out", 我们马上就会停下来
Just say, "out", and we'll end it.

487
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:16,454
现在, 在我说话的时候注视这个灯光
Now, focus on this light as I speak.

488
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:22,460
你跟我说过, 你从幽灵那里得到的就是
来自于身体内部的寒冷, 黑暗的感觉
You told me that the feeling that you get
from the Wraith is a cold, dark feeling deep inside you.

489
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,754
我要你想着这个感觉
I want you to think about that.

490
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,465
在你的头脑中寻找这个感觉
Look for it in your mind.

491
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:30,301
现在,  闭上眼睛, 仔细聆听
Now, close your eyes and listen to it.

492
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,178
不要抵抗
Don't resist.

493
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,306
顺其自然
Go to that place where it lives.

494
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,233
你听到了什么?
What do you hear?

495
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,695
什么也没有
Nothing.

496
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,325
你跟我说过你的父亲被幽灵掠走
You told me that your father was taken by the Wraith.

497
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,036
你还记不记得自那以后的感觉?
Do you remember sensing it that day?

498
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,329
是的
Yes.

499
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,082
后头想想那种感觉
Think back to that feeling.

500
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,001
现在仔细听
Now listen.

501
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,004
你听到了什么?
What do you hear?

502
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,257
噪声
Noise.

503
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,802
说话声, 很多说话声, 窃窃私语
Voices, so many voices, whispering.

504
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,178
靠近些去听
Listen closely.

505
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,139
听一个声音
Listen for one.

506
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,060
我可以看到了
I can see.

507
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,228
告诉我们你看到了什么, Teyla
Tell us what you see, Teyla.

508
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,438
我在一艘飞船上
I am on a ship.

509
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,149
我在走路
I am walking.

510
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,860
她真的看到了正在发生的事情?
She can actually see what's happening?

511
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,238
如果幽灵可以发射出他们的思维,
那么那就可以包括它们所看到的东西
If the Wraith can project their thoughts,
then that may include what they're seeing.

512
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,574
有其它幽灵
There are other Wraith.

513
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,410
它们没有注意到我
They do not notice me.

514
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:42,957
我在一个房间中, 四周贮藏满了人
以便它们取食
I am in a room full of people being preserved
so that they can be fed upon.

515
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,006
我正在取食
I am feeding.

516
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,841
我正在杀死他
I am killing him.

517
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:54,510
停止. Beckett, 停止
Stop. Beckett, stop.

518
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,888
没事了
It's okay.

519
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,432
没事了, 你在这里, 在亚特兰蒂斯
It's okay. You're here, in Atlantis.

520
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:01,100
Teyla, 我...
Teyla, I...

521
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:05,980
我没有权利要求你这样做
I had no right to ask you to do this.

522
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,232
把这些东西从我身上拿开
Get these things off of me.

523
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,317
好的, 平静下来, Teyla.
All right, settle down, Teyla.

524
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,902
我会把这个拿掉
I have to take this off.

525
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,320
我不能让她做这些, John.
I can't put her through this, John.

526
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,363
我知道这是我的主意, 不过它的代价太大
I know it was my idea, but it's too much to ask.

527
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,490
当幽灵的母船出现的时候
你可能就会是另外一种想法
You might feel differently once the hive ships show up.

528
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,159
Weir博士
Dr. Weir.

529
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:19,785
你为什么让他们停下来?
Why did you make them stop?

530
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:20,912
对不起?
Excuse me?

531
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:23,497
我正在前往这里的一艘母船上
I was on one of the hive ships that is headed here.

532
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,041
我可以听到他们
I could hear them.

533
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,167
我可以看到
I could see.

534
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,251
这是有效的
It was working.

535
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:29,253
你看到它们正在取食
You were watching them feed.

536
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,838
是的
Yes.

537
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,757
我确实感觉到它们当中有一个正在取食
I actually felt one of them feed,

538
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,342
不过我可以承受
but I can handle it.

539
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,927
你可以帮助我们, 我知道
I can help us, I know it.

540
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:36,928
Teyla, 我不会再...
Teyla, I never should've...

541
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,474
我要再试一次
I am going to try again.

542
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:53,194
我正走过飞船
I am walking through the ship.

543
00:35:56,948 --> 00:36:00,535
我在某个控制室中
I am in some sort of control room.

544
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,265
你们都是如此的可怜
You are all so pathetic.

545
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:25,434
我觉得这不是Teyla在说话
Something tells me that's not Teyla talking.

546
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,520
没有什么可以阻止我们
Nothing can stop us.

547
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:29,772
唤醒她
Wake her up.

548
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,401
你们都将去死
You are all going to die.

549
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,777
马上!
Now!

550
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,790
发生什么了?
What happened?

551
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,213
Beckett已经给她服用了镇静剂
她现在正在休息
Dr. Beckett has her sedated,
and she's resting comfortably.

552
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,758
她看起来没事, 不过我需要一些时间
来了解她看到了什么
She seems fine, but I would like some time
to let what she's been through sink in.

553
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,260
她可能是受到了惊吓
She may still be in shock.

554
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,305
我不知道会不会有长期的心理影响
I have no idea what
the long-term psychological effect will be.

555
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,892
她说她可以看到某种控制室...
也许一张地图, 一份攻击计划
She said she could see some type
of control room... maybe a map, an attack plan.

556
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,019
她需要更仔细的看一下
She just needs to get a better look.

557
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,270
John, 你当时在那里
John, you were there.

558
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:13,482
一个幽灵控制了她
A Wraith had control of her.

559
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,947
有虫洞连接进来
Incoming wormhole.

560
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,704
我们收到了Bates上士的身份识别码
We're getting sergeant Bates' I.D.C.

561
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:27,622
是阿尔法站点
It's the alpha site.

562
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,789
我是Bates上士
This is sergeant Bates.

563
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,833
红色代码 我们正受到攻击, 正急速赶来!
Code red. We're under attack and coming in hot!

564
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,544
放下防护盾
Lower the shield.

565
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,514
快, 快!
Move it, move it!

566
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:46,891
好了, 我们都到了
That's it, we're clear.

567
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,310
升起防护盾!
Raise the shield!

568
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,689
所有人都还好吧?
Is everybody okay?

569
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,609
所有回来人员报道
All off-world personnel accounted for.

570
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,111
我想那个星球已经不再安全了
I guess that planet isn't safe anymore.

571
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,279
它们坐飞船出现在那里
They showed up by ship,

572
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,865
在我们准备离开的时候
在星际之门的旁边丢下某种设备
and dropped some sort of device
by the Gate as we were leaving.

573
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,659
我以前见过
I've seen it before.

574
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:05,868
它们在标记那个星球
They're tagging the planet.

575
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,537
如我我们要从亚特兰蒂斯撤退
我们需要另外选一个地方
If we're going to evacuate Atlantis,
we're going to need a new place to go.

576
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,080
那个星球应该无人居住
That planet was supposed to be uninhabited.

577
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,081
幽灵过去想要什么?
What did the Wraith want with it?

578
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:10,998
我不知道
I don't know.

579
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,627
看起来它们好像知道我们在那里
It's almost like they knew we were there.

580
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,468
我已经接近了, 我已经很近了
I was close. I was so close.

581
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,595
我认为如果我还有一次机会...
I really think if I had another chance...

582
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,722
嗨, 你没有必要向这里的每个人
证明所有事情
hey, you don't have to prove
anything to anyone around here.

583
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,766
我认为这可以带来一些改变
I think this could make a difference.

584
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,142
我看到一个全息图
I saw a hologram.

585
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,477
我想那是一幅地图
I think it was a map,

586
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,895
甚至可能是一个作战计划
maybe even a battle plan.

587
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,438
我们知道它们的作战计划
We know their battle plan.

588
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:35,898
它们要来把我们清除掉
They're coming to wipe us out.

589
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,150
我不是十分肯定这是真的
I'm not so sure that is true.

590
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,402
它们需要从我们这里得到一些东西
They want something from us.

591
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,320
是的, 是的, 他们想吃掉我们
Yeah. Yeah, they want to eat us.

592
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,030
不, 不仅仅是这些
No, something more.

593
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,824
它们在孤注一掷
They are desperate.

594
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:45,449
真的么?
Really?

595
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,994
是的, 很令人惊奇
Yes, it is surprising.

596
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:53,624
它们对征服我们非常有信心,
不过这主要是因为它们的数量非常之多...
They are confident in their dominance over us,
but mainly because there are so many of them...

597
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,043
太多了以至于无法维持很长的时间
too many to sustain for long.

598
00:38:56,085 --> 00:39:00,798
它们都过早的醒来,
而四周没有足够的食物
They have all awakened early,
and there is not enough food to go around.

599
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:02,049
这只是一种感觉
It was just a feeling.

600
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:05,386
那种声音很难分离出来
The voices were so hard to separate.

601
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:07,555
你记不起来其中一个通过你所说的话?
You don't remember one of them speaking through you?

602
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:12,268
不, 不过我记得在这以前的感受
No, but I remember the feeling just before it happened.

603
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:12,852
下一次...
Next time...

604
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:17,565
我想 Weir 博士不会允许再进行一次了
I don't think Dr. Weir will let there be a next time.

605
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:26,824
如果你说的是真的, 那么就有可能是
Teyla将我们的阿尔法站点的位置告诉给了幽灵
if what you're saying is true, then chances are
it was Teyla who gave away the location
of our alpha site to the Wraith.

606
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:27,992
我认为没有足够的时间
I don't think there was time.

607
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,119
你不知道它们在那个区域没有飞船
You don't know that they didn't
have a ship in the general area.

608
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:34,582
我同意, 现在回想起来, 要求Teyla
连接到幽灵, 这可能是一个错误
Look, I admit, in retrospect, asking Teyla
to connect with the Wraith, it may have been a mistake.

609
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,251
很客气地说, 我认为这是毋庸置疑的
With all due respect,
I don't think there's much doubt about that.

610
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,503
放松一下, 上士
Take it easy, sergeant.

611
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,714
她并不是有意想透漏我们的位置
It's not like she willfully gave away our position.

612
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:44,467
她想再试一次
She wants to try again.

613
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:48,846
她说她已经接近某个非常重要的东西
某件她可以说服我们去了解的东西
Look, she says she was getting close to something big,
something she's convinced we need to know.

614
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:49,931
不行, 我很抱歉
No. I'm sorry.

615
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,975
问题是, 我不敢保证Teyla所想的
是对她最有利的
The problem is, I'm not sure Teyla's thinking
about what's best for herself.

616
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,936
同时她可能更加威胁我们的安全
Or that she could compromise us further.

617
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:58,189
从这一点来说, 相比它们了解我们的
我们需要从幽灵那里了解更多
At this point, we have more to gain
from the Wraith than they do from us.

618
00:39:58,231 --> 00:39:59,607
她想要去做
She wants to do it.

619
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:06,989
事实是, 我们没有什么可以阻止她去尝试
所以如果我们都在那里是不是更好?
Fact is, there may not be anything we can do to stop her
from trying, so isn't it better if we're all there?

620
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,954
好吧
Okay.

621
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:18,960
闭上你的眼睛, 放松, 聆听那些声音
Close your eyes and relax, and listen for the voices.

622
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:39,689
Teyla?
Teyla?

623
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,941
终端连接
Break the connection.

624
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:42,775
没有作用
It's not working.

625
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:43,693
不要!
No!

626
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,361
Teyla!
Teyla!

627
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:27,236
我只能希望, 我们没有给她造成心理损害
I can only hope we haven't
caused her psychological damage.

628
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:28,988
Teyla是我所认识的最强健的人之一
Teyla's one of the strongest people I know.

629
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,451
事实上她可以在以前走过的日子中
很好的处理这些...
The fact that she's been able to hold it together
until now after what she's been through in her life...

630
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,619
你们在这里
now, there you are.

631
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,704
少校, Weir博士
Major, Dr. Weir.

632
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,581
Carson, 你感觉怎么样?
Carson, how are you feeling?

633
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,125
有些头疼, 不过我没事
Doozy of a headache, but I'll be fine.

634
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:41,959
Teyla醒了
Teyla's awake.

635
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:46,088
她想见你们两个
She wants to see both of you.

636
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:52,178
Teyla, 你口渴么? 我可以给你倒些水么?
Teyla, are you thirsty? Can I get you some water?

637
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,929
不用
No.

638
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,015
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

639
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:57,308
我本以为我可以阻止...
I really thought I could prevent...

640
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,727
没事, 所有人都还好
it's all right. Everyone's fine.

641
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:03,189
我们所关注的是幽灵可以任意连接你
We are concerned that the Wraith
can connect to you at will, though.

642
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:05,399
这以前从来没有发生过?
It has never happened before?

643
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:10,154
不, 我肯定我必须首先连接到他们
No, I am sure I have to connect with them first.

644
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,490
我看到了它们的计划,
I saw their plans,

645
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,992
它们的飞船来到这里的路线
the route their ships are taking to get here.

646
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,118
很好
That's good.

647
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,328
还有
There's more.

648
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,206
它们想要的不仅仅是亚特兰蒂斯
They do not just want Atlantis.

649
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,458
它们了解你们
They know about you.

650
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,584
什么意思?
What do you mean?

651
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,169
Sumner
Sumner.

652
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:27,672
那个母幽灵并不仅仅是取食他
The female Wraith wasn't just feeding on him.

653
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,298
她在审问他
She was interrogating him.

654
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,926
这就是为什么它们全部都醒来
That is why they're all waking up.

655
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,303
这就是为什么它们要来这里
That is why they are coming here.

656
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:40,268
它们知道亚特兰蒂斯是唯一通往
一个全新的, 富饶的取食场的通道
They know that Atlantis is the only way to get
to a new, rich feeding ground.

657
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,272
地球


Earth.
