00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}School isn't even out yet.

5
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should come back.

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate going in there.

10

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. Excuse me.

15
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny?

16
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm so close to getting...

22
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Summertime is for real games, not video games. Healthy stuff.

23
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, let's see...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding?

27
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick, you can't play your music that loud.

28
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lenwood?

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Heffley, it's good to see you.

31

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Heffley.

32
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

33
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... you've changed.

34
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been going to Spag Union Prep School.

35
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They really turned me around.

36
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may remember I was a bit of a troublemaker.

37
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah.

38
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're cleaning all this up! You hear me?

39
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Spag Union, what grade does that start?

40
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eighth grade, sir.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going into the eighth grade.

43
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cannonball!

44
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to see you, sir. Ma'am.

45
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called me "sir".

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to be so cool. Like me.

47
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L?ded Diper.

48
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubby, over here!

49
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, honey, go help your brother.

50
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's so funny?

51
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm peeing!

52
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh, ugh!

53
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, so, I have one more week of school, then it's summer vacation.

54
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which sounds great, but for me,

55
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}summer vacation is basically a three-month guilt trip.

56
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because the weather's nice,

57
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everyone expects you to be out all day frolicking.

58
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La, la, la, la, la

59
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the truth is, I've always been more of an indoor person.

60
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To me, the perfect way to spend summer vacation

61
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is in front of the TV playing video games.

62
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, my dad's idea of a perfect

63
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}summer is the opposite of mine.

64
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real problem is, me and my dad have nothing in common.

65
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But as long as I stay one step ahead of him...

66
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I have a shot at a fun summer.

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last day of school!

68
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. It's kind of sad.

69
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sad? Are you crazy?

70
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to play video games all summer. It's going to be awesome.

71
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's one person I will miss.

72
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys!

73
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Holly!

74
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see her when school starts again.

75
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In three months? A lot can happen in three months.

76
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Holly. How was your summer?

77
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great! I got married.

78
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know my husband... Chirag.

79
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Gregory.

80
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last period of the school year!

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it is still a school day, so...

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}open Discovering History to chapter 7.

83
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the last day of school. Like anyone brought their books.

84

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pity him.

86
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you're not prepared.

87
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Draybick, I'd be honored to share my book with Greg Heffley.

88
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fregley claims to wear a special cologne,

89
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but everyone knows he just never washes.

90
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great!

91
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley.

92
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to make a connection with Holly this summer.

93
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tired of being...

94
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"friends".

95
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with being "friends"? We're friends.

96
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get her to sign my yearbook.

97
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She signs lots of yearbooks.

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when she signs mine, I'll ask her

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay!

101
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rest of the class is free time.

102

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just regular summer stuff.

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Volunteering at the shelter, building with Habitat for Humanity...

106
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and giving tennis lessons to little kids.

107
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about you?

108
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going to get to the end of Twisted Wizard 2 this summer!

109
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I have time because of all the other stuff I'm doing.

110
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, can I sign your yearbook?

111
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure. You're only in seventh grade once.

112
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not always true, by the way.

113
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Andy Spitz has been in seventh grade for four years.

114
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... why don't you write down your phone number, too?

115
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

116
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go!

117
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye!

118
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

119
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gregory!

120
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me! Help me!

121
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you sign my yearbook?

122
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course!

123
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holly, you didn't finish writing...

124
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that your brother?

125
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L?ded Diper's coming to rock a town near you!

126
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aw! You're getting your yearbooks signed? That is so cute.

127
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck?

128
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, Greg was sick on picture day.

129
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you send in a photo of him for the yearbook?

130
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! I remembered!

131
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Heather Hills.

132
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in.

133
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I need to finish signing Greg's yearbook.

134
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}News flash. I don't care.

135
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

136
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you didn't...

137
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... Heather.

138
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going on a world tour with my band.

139
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're around, I could comp you chicks some tickets.

140
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

141
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Holly!

142
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahh!

143
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow! Ow!

144
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was trying to act cool, but I know she was into me.

145
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Rowley, you are so cute."

146
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cute's underlined three times!

147
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Stay cool. XOXO, Holly." What did she write in yours?

148
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Have a great summer. You're such a good... friend."

149
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Friend"?

150
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man!

151
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the kiss of death. "Friend". That sucks!

152
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Despite Rodrick's negative attitude,

153
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have very clear goals for the summer.

154
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, play video games. Two, get together with Holly.

155
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or three, both at the same time.

156
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, you're an amazing gamer.

157
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

158
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our neighbors, the Warrens, have kids that are the outdoorsy type.

159
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay, but...

160
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my dad has this crazy idea

161
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that physical exercise is normal.

162
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those guys are setting a bad example.

163
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad has his eye on me, so the key to a successful summer...

164
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be to stay one move ahead.

165
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those Warren boys are already up, raring to go.

166
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our boys probably won't even get up till noon.

167
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Did you say something?

168
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing up?

169
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the first day of vacation.

170
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you think I'd just lie around all day?

171
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, that's exactly what I thought.

172
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't find Manny's Tingy.

173
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's probably time...

174
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for him to move on from that ratty old blanket anyway.

175
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manny was given Tingy right after he was born.

176
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back then, Tingy was a fluffy blue blanket.

177
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now, it's a couple of pieces of yarn

178
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}held together with raisins and boogers.

179
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think he cares anymore?

180
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure it'll turn up.

181
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

182
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this garbage.

183
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad and I don't agree on anything, except for...

184
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the comic Li'l Cutie.

185
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We both hate it. But we can't stop reading it!

186
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my BFF... Best Father Forever!

187
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's not even a joke!  -I know.

188
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we please focus? We need to find Manny's Tingy.

189
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ohh!

190
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to be late for work.

191
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you!

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vacation is on!

193
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg.

194
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg.

195
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you really going to sit inside all day and play video games?

196
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey.  -Oh.

197
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dad.

198
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you... sweating?

199
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I just finished up some sports... playing.

200
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh.

201
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was your day?

202
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Horrible! Manny still hasn't recovered from losing Tingy.

203
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe it's for the best. I think he should really move on.

204
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tingy!

205
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tingy! Oh, my gosh, honey, you found your blanket!

206
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is great, but how did it end up in the...

207
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Garbage?

208
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank?

209
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

210
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't.

211
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't...

212
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}know...

213
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it meant that much to him anymore.

214
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could you?

215
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good morning.  -Morning!

216
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations, player, all your hard work has paid off.

217
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're now a Level Nine Necromancer!

218
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You played video games all day.

219
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

220
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I've been playing sports.

221
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it! No more video games for the rest of the summer!

222
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do that!

223
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, I can! I will! I am!

224
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm unplugging it!

225
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does the DVD or the cable box go into...

226
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does the DVD player go into the cable...

227
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think this is funny?

228
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's amusing.

229
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then how about no video games and...

230
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no television for the rest of the summer? Does that make you laugh?

231
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, no!

232
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stopped laughing!

233
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha!

234
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess who's the laugher now? Me! I'm the laugher!

235
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the laugh ingest laugher that ever laughed!

236
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny stuff!

237
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to work on my battle diorama.

238
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank!

239
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? First Tingy, and now Greg's video games?

240
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General Lee isn't going to paint himself.

241
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is important.

242
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't take away everything they love and disappear downstairs.

243
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to get to Greg's level and really engage with him.

244
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find an activity you both enjoy.

245
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we going to do, play Twisted WarlockalL day?

246
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate to say it, but we have absolutely nothing in common.

247
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What Greg needs is a role model.

248
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone he can look up to. Sit down and talk with him.

249
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do, but he doesn't listen to me.

250
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, hanging out together is no fun for either of us.

251
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always complain that your father

252
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never spent enough time with you

253
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you were young.

254
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you're doing the same thing.

255
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be the father you wish your father had been.

256
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

257
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should put in more time.

258
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That didn't sound good.

259
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rise and shine!

260
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Saturday!

261
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get to spend the whole day together!

262
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know...

263
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it takes a while to get here

264
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's an effort to get the boat out...

265
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this is what it's all about.

266
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and me, spending quality time together.

267
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, buddy, hand me some bait.

268
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

269
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we should think about getting back.

270
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As bad as this was...

271
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom 's idea of a good summer activity was even worse.

272
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so glad...

273
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you all decided to become founding members

274
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the Reading Is Fun Club!

275
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

276
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}let's share the books you brought.

277
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not so sure these qualify as literature.

278
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about I get some real books? Classics.

279
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something to stimulate your minds.

280
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right back!

281
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much, Gregory, for making the summer a time...

282
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to study and write book reports.

283
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I want to do this? My summer's turned into a nightmare.

284
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should come with me to the country club!

285
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really fun and you get to be outside all day.

286
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ta-da!

287
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get this party started! Oh, yeah!

288
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

289
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do I do? I want to call Holly, but the number's no good.

290
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the last two numbers are missing.

291
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means there's only 100 different numbers it could be.

292
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got it!

293
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call every number it could be until I get the right one.

294
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Freggers speaking.

295
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Pickup or delivery?

296
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Brad.

297
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

298
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the coach.

299
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coach Malone?

300
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this?

301
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell him, Greg.

302
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg? Greg who?

303
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, listen up, "Greg". I don't know who you are...

304
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if you call again, I'll reach through the phone...

305
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far, this is shaping up to be the worst summer ever.

306
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! We'll be late for the Battle of Phillipi!

307
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad's really into Civil War reenactments, which are basically...

308
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a bunch of grown men dressed

309
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as soldiers running around in muddy fields.

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't get to carry a gun. I had the honor of being bugle boy.

311
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We re-enactors pride ourselves on being completely authentic.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

316
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's spring, 1861!

317
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're trying to outflank Porterfield's armies!

318
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no video games! Come on!

319
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

320
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Now, the deciding factor...

321
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the reason we win this battle...

322
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is we hold the element of surprise.

323
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

324
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we need the element of surprise!

325
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kid ruined everything!

326
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get him!

327
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

328
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a reenactment! We won!

329
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

330
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Greg. I can't make it to the book club.

331
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom's taking me to the country club. She said I could invite you.

332
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks.

333
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's crack open Little Women and see what's up with the girls.

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you say so.

337

344
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crowded today?

345
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The nice weather really brought people out.

346
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Amy wasn't kidding!

347
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is crowded today.

348
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is crowded?

349
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Care for a smoothie?

350
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They bring stuff to you?

351

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry!

354
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I do like being outside...

355
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I'm outside at a country club.

356
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Holly Hills!

357
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,330

358
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a member.

359
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you didn't think maybe you should tell me that?

360
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's step... swing... catch it up high.

361
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye! And remember, work on your forehand.

362
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Holly.

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys!

364
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were going to call me.

365
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was going to, but... then I realized I'd see you here.

366
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what are you up to?

367
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm helping the tennis coach.

368
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I give lessons to little kids.

369
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so weird. We're all about tennis!

370
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool! We should play sometime.

371
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I've never played...

372
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd love to play!

373
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about tomorrow at eleven?

374
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eleven's perfect.

375
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you tomorrow!

376
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow it is!

377
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's how you improve your summer.

378
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La, la, la, la

379

380
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no.

381
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please more. More. Oh, come on, Manny!

382
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,350

383
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Somebody looks like they actually had fun.

384
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

385
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

386
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the guy I'm looking for.

387
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

388
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My office is offering a summer internship.

389
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I signed you up for it!

390
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's an internship?

391
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

392
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll come to my office every day...

393
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you'll have your own responsibilities. It's like a job.

394
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do I get paid?  -No.

395
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got me a non-paying job?

396
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can be work buddies!

397
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long till we go home?

398
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got here eight minutes ago!

399
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounds really great, but...

400
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is awkward.

401
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just that... I already got a job.

402
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You got a job?

403
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Rowley invited me to the country club...

404
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I saw a "Help Wanted" sign.

405
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to the manager and he hired me.

406
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he liked my pluck.

407
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

408
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually got a job?

409
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. But I can call and tell him I can't if you want me...

410
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! That's fantastic! Can you believe it, Susan?

411
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our son got himself a job!

412
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

413
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody around here actually did something.

414
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's great!

415
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Keeping you down the new sheriff in town #

416
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I'm the man I'm the man, I'm the man #

417
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Don't mess with me, hoss 'Cause I lay down the laws #

418
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I'm the man I'm the man, I'm the man #

419
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we should tell her we've never played tennis.

420
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We played Ultimate Tennis on the Wii, it's the same thing.

421
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, guys.

422
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Holly!

423
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jinx!

424
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. What is she doing here?

425
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should we start with a rally?

426
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a rally?

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Rowley. Can you ever be serious?

428
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll let anyone in this place.

429
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must be why you're here.

430
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

431
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's play doubles. Patty and me versus you two.

432
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

433
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill you!

434
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

435
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

436
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifteen, love.

437
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd she call me?

438
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow!

439
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

440
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, oops.

441
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thirty, love.

442
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you say... love!

443
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

444
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a weirdo.

445
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, little girl, would you like a dance? #

446
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

447
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, little girl, want a quick romance? #

448
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, little girl, won't you take a chance #

449
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# and celebrate summer with me #

450
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, little chick, where'd you learn that trick? #

451
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, don't you know you got rock and roll? #

452
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hey, little girl, won't you take a chance #

453
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it! I got it!

454
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# And celebrate summer with me #

455
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

456
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have either of you actually played tennis before?

457
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah... Ultimate Tennis on the Wii.

458
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not exactly the same thing.

459
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could give you a few pointers.

460
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to follow through. Like this.

461
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh!

462
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to go. It's an emergency.

463
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mega-emergency.

464
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The printer messed up the invitations for my Sweet Sixteen.

465
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does that have to do with me?

466
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People have expectations. Everything has to be perfect!

467
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never understand what it's like to be pretty.

468
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you drive me home later?

469
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back for you? No. It's like ten minutes away!

470
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now move it or lose it.

471
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

472
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, right?

473
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you guys later!

474
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye!

475
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad for the first day of my fake job.

476
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, now Dad and I are both "working men "...

477
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we get along great.

478
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy Fourth of July!

479
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Li'l Cutie cartoonist to retire in three months"!

480
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We won't have to read that garbage anymore!

481
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good riddance!

482
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every Fourth of July,

483
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}our neighbors, the Warrens, throw a big party for the whole block.

484
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom and Dad make us all go. Which is bad...

485
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I've been a voiding Rodrick's built-in lie detector.

486
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, worker bee.

487
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you having a job doesn't pass the smell test.

488
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it does. It totally does!

489
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, sweetie.

490
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

491
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my boys, it's go, go, go!

492
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to wrestle them in every night.

493
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same with my boys.

494
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in my Wilderness Explorers troop now. They love it!

495
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I loved being in the Wilderness Explorers.

496
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You did?  -Yeah. Loved it.

497
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one camping trip we took as kids, you cried the whole time.

498
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I broke my arm in two places.

499
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cried the whole time.

500
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I...

501
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It hurt.

502
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? You should join the Wilderness Explorers.

503
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm more of an indoor person.

504
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly. When's the next meeting?

505
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The waiting list for our troop is a mile long.

506
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody wants to join the best of the best.

507
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that your dog? We grew up with a dog.

508
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nutty. Frank named him.

509
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can never be too young to learn responsibility.

510
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should get your boys a dog.

511
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That's a great idea.

512
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'll speak to Dad about my suspicions.

513
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do whatever you want.

514
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will.

515
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay! Okay!

516
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't really have a job.

517
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holly Hills is a member,

518
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if I'm at the country club, I can hang out with her.

519
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it.

520
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa!

521
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So is Heather Hills there, too?

522
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Heather who?  -I want in.

523
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't get you in there. I go as Rowley's guest.

524
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go as your guest.

525
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't bring the guest. I am the guest.

526
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no guest for the guest.

527
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm...

528
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things are getting complicated.

529
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at least something good came out of the barbecue.

530
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Introducing...

531
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the new member of the Heffley family!

532
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey!

533
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Frank.

534
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you'd checked with me first.

535
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this is more of a family decision.

536
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's a good puppy?

537
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can call him Shredder!

538
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

539
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rip jaw?

540
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can call him Sweetie.

541
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie!

542
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie, that's a great name!

543
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad was willing to go with any name Mom wanted

545
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it meant he didn't have to take the dog back.

546
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie!

547
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie.

548
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

549
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie! Sweetie!

550
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always thought I wanted a dog, but...

551
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm having second thoughts.

552
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, ready? Sit. Sit!

553
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good! Hey, did you see that?

554
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, now shake.

555
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yoo-hoo!

556
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shake. Shake.

557
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

558
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sweaty"?

559
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure it spells Sweetie, Dad.

560
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

561
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

562
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With Sweetie around, I'd hoped

563
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad would forget about joining the Wilderness Explorers.

564
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Dad connected with his old troop master.

565
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As your father knows...

566
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we take our scouting very seriously in Troop 133.

567
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's true.

568
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the very best get to be part of this troop.

569
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so great to be back here, Troop Master Barrett!

570
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you boys get yourselves a uniform,

571
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the first thing you'll do...

572
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is clean out that musty old storage locker.

573
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

574
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Okay.

575
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad got more than he bargained for.

576
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he couldn't wiggle out of it, that would set a bad example.

577
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whittling is the kind of skill you'll need...

578
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for our upcoming wilderness weekend.

579
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting splinters.

580
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is impossible.

581
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have finished, Troop Master Barrett!

582
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems the only break I'll get this summer is at the country club.

583
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is, as long as Rodrick doesn't ruin things.

584
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

585
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget about me.

586
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go around the back!

587
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marco!

588
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polo!

589
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marco!

590
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polo!

591
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick?

592
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick!

593
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, guvnor! Top of the crumpet to you! Ooh!

594
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the nearest loo, mate? Mustered up a wee little tinkle!

595
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to sound like a snob,

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm not sure Rodrick is country club material.

597
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marco!

598
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polo!

599
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! You can hold your breath a really long time!

600
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like another smoothie?

601
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thanks. Polo!

602
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to order a few things.

603
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not serious.

604
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm very serious. Two orders of fries, vanilla shake extra thick...

605
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and anything with bacon on it.

606
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fish out of water!

607
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally! I thought I'd never find you!

608
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's Rodrick doing here?

609
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got invited! You got a problem?

610
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No problem!

611
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom is going to kill you! When did you get a tattoo?

612
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a lot you don't know about me, Greggy.

613
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Having Rodrick at the country club really made me nervous.

614
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told him to keep a low profile.

615
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't want to get fired from my fake job.

616
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, of course, he didn't listen.

617
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Heather Hills time.

618
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go over there.

619
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not. She's coming to me.

620
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick did have a plan.

621
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, he came up with it himself.

622
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess he saw Heather's Lifeguard outfit and figured she'd be into...

623
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}saving people and stuff.

624
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cramp!

625
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. What time does the snack bar close?

626
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I, a guidebook? Come back when you're drowning.

627
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cramp!

628
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no need to be mean.

629
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Hey, look, I'm drowning! Hey!

630
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, shrimp, the reason I'm here in this ridiculous outfit

631
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to get credit for my college application.

632
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! I can't...

633
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm drowning over here!

634
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So bounce.

635
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cramp! Help! Help!

636
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

637
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you!

638
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

639
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't even know you!  -You're okay.

640
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is happening?

641
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ohh!

642
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess what?

643
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to the shore this weekend

644
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and my mom said I could invite you!

645
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boardwalk's awesome.

646
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on the Cranium Shaker. You haven't lived till you've done that.

647
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should come!

648
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think most people would agree I'm a pretty likeable kid...

649
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but for some reason, I've never clicked with Mr. Jefferson.

650
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg. Honey.

651
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father and I have something to give you.

652
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've showed us you're responsible enough to have one.

653
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your own cell phone.

654
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you serious? My own cell phone?

655
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't have a keypad.

656
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a starter phone. You can call home or 911.

657
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't want to overwhelm you.

658
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

659
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a good time!

660
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you.

661
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to the boardwalk!

662
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait to ride the Cranium Shaker!

663
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Cranium Shaker?

664
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're too funny, Greg.

665
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wants to sing?

666
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me!

667
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five thousand bottles of milk on the wall

668

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five thousand bottles of milk

669
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take one down, pass it around

670

673
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're so far from the boardwalk.

674
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah! It's much quieter up here!

675
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we play "I love you because "?

676
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yay!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're silly and you make me laugh.

680

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My turn.

681

691
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's awfully crowded here.

692
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's quieter at the amusement park.

693
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wants ice cream?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, thanks.

699
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just remembered I'm lactose intolerant.

700
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet us back here in exactly one hour.

702
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

703

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my mom said...

705
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll come back later when the line goes down.

706

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no line!

707
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did promise my mom we wouldn't go on any scary rides.

708
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Rodrick says you haven't lived till

709

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've been on the Cranium Shaker.

710
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you been on this ride?

711
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's way scary.

712
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear what happened last summer?

713
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brother knows a guy

714
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whose second cousin's half-brother

715
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}went on this ride and got decapitated.

716
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No way!  -Way.

717
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's true. I was working the ride that day.

718
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:22,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The car came down and his head... wasn't in it.

719
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you guys get to the top...

720
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}be sure not to rock the car back and forth.

721
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how...

722
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said not to rock the car!

723
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or our heads will be torn off!

724
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, in case we don't make it,

725
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's something I have to tell you.

726
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One time, I went to the bathroom and I didn't wash my hands.

727
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One time, I used your toothbrush to get dog poop off my shoe.

728
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What?

729
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down!

730
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg!

731
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley!

732
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, Greg!

733
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please!

734
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg! Greg!

735
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were supposed to meet us an hour ago.

736
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were searching everywhere.

737
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were about to call the police.

738
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're very disappointed in you, Rowley. Very disappointed.

739
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They let us off easy!

740
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you upset? They didn't even yell at us.

741
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They almost yelled.

742
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was nothing. My parents would have screamed their heads off.

743
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're disappointed in me.

744
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big deal. Better than getting punished.

745
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe for you. You're used to it.

746
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait to hit the hay.

747
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, where are you going to sleep?

748
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we're bunkmates! Hope you don't snore.

749
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take this anymore.

750
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Help. Get me out of here."

751
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"These people are driving me crazy."

752
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send, send, send!

753
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, sleepyheads!

754
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Num, num, num, num!

755
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have nine hundred and forty-nine e-mails?

756
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to go to the bathroom.

757
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to get out of here!

758
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

759
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please check the number and dial again.

760
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a piece of junk!

761
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}911. What is the nature of your emergency?

762
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

763
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Are you hurt?

764
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have anything to tell us, Greg?

765
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

766
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything about, "These people are driving me crazy"?

767
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Officers?

768
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a knife!

769
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not resist!

770
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your hand!

771
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to explain to Rowley's Dad

772
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I didn't mean to call 911...

773
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he really wasn't interested in what I had to say.

774
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're always getting into trouble with that Rowley kid.

775
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm starting to think he's a bad influence.

776
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley. How's it going?

777
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I guess.

778
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, are we still on for the country club?

779
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually... I'm not going to the country club today.

780
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

781
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Coming, Mom! Got to go!

782
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready to get my country club on!

783
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley isn't going and I can't get in without him.

784
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Well, you snuck me in.

785
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So instead, sneak yourself in and then sneak me in.

786
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How? I need Rowley to get me past the front desk.

787
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg! If you don't go to "work"...

788
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dad" will know you don't have a job.

789
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem, right? Remember, you're a Jefferson.

790
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't forget to take out the trash.

791
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

792
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you going to say hello?

793
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

794
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How rude of me. Hello.

795
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley!

796
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, Greg.  -Cool.

797
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't expect to see you here.

798
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Well, my plans changed.

799
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I changed my... change. I mean...

800
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'll catch up with you later?

801
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe it!

802
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lied. You never lie!

803
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parents don't want me to invite you anymore.

804
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought if I lied, I wouldn't hurt your feelings.

805
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh.

806
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was impressive.

807
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's pretty high.

808
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you talking to yourself?

809
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Of course not!

810
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were. You're talking to yourself because you're scared.

811
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not scared. That's crazy!

812
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't understand because you're just a little kid.

813
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then go.

814
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holly! Where's your sunblock?

815
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

816
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

817
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I don't understand.

818
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I'm just a little kid.

819
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Greg!

820
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Holly!

821
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh, it is so hot out. It's nice to cool off in here.

822
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, great.

823
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was going to get ice cream. Want to join me?

824
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'd be awesome!

825
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, no.

826
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another time, maybe.

827
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure? It's really good here.

828
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'm trying to lose a couple pounds. Thanks anyways.

829
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

830
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not the kind of person who likes skinny dipping...

831
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:42,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I had no choice but to splash around all day, avoiding people.

832
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attention, everybody, the club will be closing in 10 minutes,

833
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so everyone out of the pool.

834
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley!

835
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! I need help!

836
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I help you, sir?

837
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh...

838
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you pass me those?

839
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These?

840
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh!

841
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You loser!

842
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure that was the first and

843
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}last time I'll ever go on the high dive.

844
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, with all the excitement, I forgot about Rodrick.

845
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick?

846
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick!

847
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:06,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick!

848
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh!

849
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you hugging me when Mom

850
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}isn't here to see it? Get off me!

851
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have you been?

852
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things might be getting harder at the country club,

853
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but my fake job made things much easier with Dad.

854
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, brother.

855
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, can you make my hiccups hic down?

856
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to pick up Manny from his play date.

857
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll have dinner when I get back.

858
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:38,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

859
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

860
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm already in enough trouble.

861
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that dog does anything to Tingy...

862
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow.

863
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

864
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good Sweetie.

865
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's a good boy?

866
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's going to give Tingy to Daddy?

867
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are.

868
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are!

869
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on!

870
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go that way, go that way!

871
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an idea.

872
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, Sweetie.

873
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good idea. Good thinking!

874
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, good.

875
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Sweetie.

876
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, good, good, good.

877
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha!

878
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it!

879
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let him have that.

880
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie!

881
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let him have that! Don't eat that!

882
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

883
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that... dog spit?

884
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could there be so much?

885
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Susan!  -Mom!

886
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go clean the house. I'll clean the roast! Go!

887
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boys barely touched your pot roast.

888
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding? I'm stuffed.

889
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I filled up on vegetables.

890
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More for us, then.

891
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you did different...

892
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this pot roast is unbelievable.

893
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chef's secret.

894
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

895
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And juicier!

896
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you are?

897
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Roland Gropper.

898
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a nice day, Roland.

899
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you told one lie.

900
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can accept that. But this is getting out of control.

901
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you have a lying problem.

902
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't lie about coming to the club today! We didn't even talk today.

903
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how do you keep getting in here without me?

904
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. You're not a member?

905
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone want a smoothie?

906
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care whether you're a member... but why sneak in?

907
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to hang out with you this summer.

908
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you my phone number. Why not just call me?

909
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried, but I only had half the number, and...

910
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm freaking out! The D.J. for my Sweet Sixteen canceled...

911
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he can fly to Africa to help build a hospital. What a jerk!

912
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what do I do for music? Whistle?

913
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about live music?

914
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know the band Loaded Diper?

915
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ew. That's a gross name.

916
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Live music would be really cool!

917
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be the first at our school to have a real band.

918
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's true.

919
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just coming off a world tour and are in town.

920
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could get them to come as a favor for me.

921
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of music do they play?

922
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything! They can play anything.

923
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

924
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where were you?

925
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rodrick, you are going to owe me the rest of your life.

926
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:12,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got Loaded Diper a gig...

927
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}playing at Heather Hills' Sweet Sixteen.

928
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

929
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loaded Diper activate.

930
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You have her favorite song.  -Song, check.

931
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She wants you in tuxes.  -Tuxes, check.

932
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're ignoring everything I'm saying, aren't you?

933
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ignoring you, check.

934
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, little bro. It's going to be a good show. The best.

935
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley! What are you doing next week? Loaded Diper needs roadies!

936
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you stand to be near me when I lied?

937
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?  -I'm a liar.

938
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can never trust me again.

939
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sacred bond of our friendship is broken.

940
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:12,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley, I get it. You didn't want to hurt my feelings.

941
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I didn't mean to get you in trouble with the Cranium Shaker.

942
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right.

943
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was actually pretty fun. Now we can say we've really lived.

944
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what about the gig?

945
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always wanted to be a roadie!

946
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rise and shine, buddy!

947
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't want to be late for work.

948
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll drop you off at the way to the office, okay?

949
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now Holly knows I'm not a member,

950
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's no reason to sneak into the country club.

951
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if my Dad finds out I don't really have

952
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a job, my life won't be worth living.

953
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Dad.

954
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm even considering telling him I got downsized.

955
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

956
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't think he'll like it.

957
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The thing is, I'm using...

958
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so many identities, I'm having trouble keeping track of them.

959
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This bill is five times the normal amount.

960
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Mr. Jefferson,

961
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but your son has been ordering a lot of smoothies this month.

962
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is now.

963
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is not my son.

964
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. That's Roland Gropper.

965
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, Arthur!

966
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rowley!

967
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:34,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rowley! My man! What's up?

968
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! You forgot your sunblock.

969
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank Heffley.

970
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your son racked up a lot of charges on my account.

971
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:48,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? He works here. Tell him.

972
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must be some mistake. We don't employ minors.

973
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you not work here?

974
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe not.

975
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$260 worth of smoothies? What were you thinking?

976
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know you get charged for what you order.

977
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll pay.

978
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very good, sir.

979
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you going to yell at me? Aren't you mad?

980
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

981
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just disappointed.

982
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got some serious trouble.

983
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not you. Me.

984
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, mostly you.

985
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what I found in the mail.

986
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome, prospective parents,

987
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Spag Union Preparatory School.

988
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through these gates is a world in which your boy will learn to thrive.

989
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we will impress upon him our three cornerstones to success:

990
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Intensive study, physical exercise, and, of course, discipline.

991
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to play video games.

992
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was playing all the time... sometimes two hours a day.

993
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd lie to my parents and tell them I was studying when...

994
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:10,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}really, I'd sneak to the mall to hang out with my friends.

995
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parents sent me to Spag Union.

996
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My parents sent me to Spag Union.

997
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't waste my time with video games anymore.

998
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spag Union taught me there's more

999
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}adventure to be found in a good book.

1000
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't lie about where I am anymore.

1001
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks to Spag Union

1002
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the tracking device around my ankle, my parents know...

1003
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where I am 24/7.

1004
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spag Union, turning irresponsible

1005
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}little boys into men since 1925.

1006
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spag Union!

1007
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're going to send you there.

1008
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really messed up.

1009
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do I do?

1010
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilderness weekend!

1011
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have 48 hours to prove to Dad you don't need Spag Union.

1012
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How?

1013
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By being the all-time best Wilderness Explorer there ever was.

1014
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go to Spag Union! I don't want to go to school without you!

1015
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not really my choice.

1016
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:16,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Hello to the end of the beginning of it all #

1023
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it? Is it solid?

1024
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir!

1025
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Sir"?

1026
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1027
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is where my troops set up!

1028
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Stan. There's plenty of good sites.

1029
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a break. You don't know the first thing about camping.

1030
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the rules, Stan. Whoever gets

1031
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}here first gets the pick of the campsites.

1032
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The best way to lay claim to a camp is to put tents on it.

1033
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explorers! Install camp!

1034
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait. Wait!

1035
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, come on, come on, come on!

1036
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:42,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold it up!

1037
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Put it on!  -I'm trying!

1038
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not here, over there!

1039
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move! Get the front!

1040
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Frank. Doesn't look like there's any room...

1041
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for troops here, but there's still plenty of good sites.

1042
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's mighty convenient being so close to the bathrooms.

1043
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all know the story of the muddy hand, don't you?

1044
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a dark and stormy night, like this one.

1045
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is not stormy.

1046
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In these very woods, an old woodsman, a kindly soul...

1047
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was chopping wood in the rain for

1048
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a group of Wilderness Explorers.

1049
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what happened?

1050
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

1051
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you consider the old woodsman

1052
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}chopping off his own hand was nothing!

1053
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't the Wilderness Explorers help him?

1054
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1055
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got scared and ran away.

1056
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would they do that?

1057
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back at camp, the boys got to talking.

1058
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They decided that they should have helped the old woodsman

1059
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he was helping them.

1060
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when they got back to his cottage, his body was gone!

1061
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gone?

1062
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that was left...

1063
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was his hand!

1064
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like this story.

1065
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not one of those boys was ever seen again.

1066
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only clue to what happened was

1067
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a muddy handprint on the side of the tent.

1068
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say the muddy hand is still out there...

1069
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:44,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}looking for more Wilderness Explorers...

1070
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and...

1071
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}revenge!

1072
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't buy it.

1073
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can a hand move by itself?

1074
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:02,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember "The Muddy Hand" from when I was a boy.

1075
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't beat the classics.

1076
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay! Bedtime, everyone.

1077
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Muddy hand!

1078
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you do that?

1079
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do what?  -Hit me in the hand with a mallet!

1080
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Me?  -Yeah, you, with the mallet in your hand!

1081
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't stop making you mad at me.

1082
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you...

1083
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why am I mad?

1084
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I keep messing up.

1085
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, everybody messes up. Even me.

1086
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not afraid to admit it when I do.

1087
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go to sleep.

1088
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear at Spag Union, you have to call

1089
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the teachers "sir", even the ladies!

1090
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see their tents?

1091
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They weren't even arranged in formation! What a bunch of losers.

1092
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, son. A troop is only as good as its leader.

1093
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any troop that would let Frank Heffley be Assistant Troop Master

1094
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is bound to be weak.

1095
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are two types of people in the world.

1096
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Predators...

1097
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and prey.

1098
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank Heffley is a wounded gazelle.

1099
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show them what Heffleys can do.

1100
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make things worse. You'll end up at Spag Union for sure.

1101
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only if we get caught. And I have a plan.

1102
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is campsite 42.

1103
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This "X" is Stan Warren's tent.

1104
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wait till they're not looking and

1105
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}weave a web between these trees.

1106
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we make the web super-sticky.

1107
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:32,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we get some ants and put them in their sleeping bags.

1108
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they get into their bunks,

1109
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the ants will drive them crazy!

1110
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll come running out and get stuck in

1111
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the web like flies. Revenge will be ours.

1112
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1113
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been ensnared by my own handiwork.

1114
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here are the ants.

1115
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll signal you if anything happens.

1116
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoot-hoot! Hoot-hoot!

1117
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1118
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A refrigerator? Ready-made meals?

1119
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A TV?

1120
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't camping!

1121
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoot-hoot! Hoot-hoot!

1122
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good-bye, Gregory. You will always

1123
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}be remembered for your bravery.

1124
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raccoons.

1125
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm.

1126
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1127
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you?

1128
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, little guy!

1129
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy needs a new fur hat!

1130
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1131
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's there? Show yourself!

1132
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Whoa!  -Ahh!

1133
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahh! No!

1134
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone from your troop violated our campsite.

1135
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a thousand dollar tent!

1136
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what happened?

1137
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did it.

1138
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg, no!

1139
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad.

1140
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my idea.

1141
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't let them take the fall for me.

1142
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't mean to burn up the tent.

1143
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but...

1144
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we did.

1145
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greg was only defending your honor!

1146
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Warren disrespected you.

1147
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called you a wounded gazelle.

1148
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your boy should be expelled.

1149
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a disgrace to every Wilderness Explorer...

1150
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, Stan! Just shut up!

1151
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what is that?

1152
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A store-bought s'mores maker?

1153
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A TV?

1154
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pre-tied knots?

1155
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan, you're a phony!

1156
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much for the big camper.

1157
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to report this to the Wilderness Committee.

1158
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see who looks ridiculous then, huh?

1159
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From what I hear,

1160
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Warren was completely abandoned

1161
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by his Wilderness Explorer troop.

1162
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:59,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These days, he runs a badminton league for kindergarteners.

1163
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get out of here.

1164
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a confession to make.

1165
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate camping.

1166
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand what's so great about sleeping in a bag.

1167
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like being in a bag isn't bad enough,

1168
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have to lie in the dirt, too!

1169
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. It's crazy!

1170
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beds were invented for a reason.

1171
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. And roofs. And walls. And bathrooms.

1172
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pizza delivery places.

1173
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look at me.

1174
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sending you to Spag Union.

1175
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what my grandpa used to say?

1176
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"A man who never made a mistake..."

1177
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"never made anything."

1178
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trick is...

1179
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to be responsible and learn from your mistakes.

1180
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can do that.

1181
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a really great kid, Greg.

1182
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:18,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm not just saying that because we're a lot alike.

1183
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Comic strip fans all over the country are

1184
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rejoicing at the news that the beloved...

1185
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Li'l Cutie will continue.

1186
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The son of cartoonist Bob Post is taking over for his father...

1187
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and says he is looking forward to

1188
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}continuing Li'l Cutie's adventures

1189
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for generations to come.

1190
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't be happening!

1191
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll never get rid of that garbage!

1192
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, golly.

1193
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say, I didn't expect

1194
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Wilderness weekend to work out so well.

1195
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now all I have to worry about is getting through L?ded Diper's gig

1196
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without looking like an idiot.

1197
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're on in 30 minutes.

1198
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax! My brother was working on

1199
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the pyrotechnics all day, it's gonna kick butt.

1200
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What does your brother do?

1201
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a demolition expert.

1202
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave the rocking to us, okay? It's what we do.

1203
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now get to work, roadies.

1204
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Is that supposed to be Heather?

1205
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Weird.

1206
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is amazing!

1207
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's even a chocolate fountain!

1208
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? You two are roadies.

1209
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means you're employees. No chocolate fountain for employees.

1210
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These guys are my friends.

1211
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, Holly.

1212
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. You've managed to take my Sweet Sixteen...

1213
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and make it all about you.

1214
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So selfish!

1215
01:22:58,630 --> 01:22:59,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So selfish!

1216
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, midgets, the only reason you're

1217
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}here is 'cause I was forced to invite you.

1218
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So stay out of my eye-line! Comprende?

1219
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's into drama.

1220
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's like Rodrick in a dress!

1221
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is your brother's band all set up?

1222
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:22,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really looking forward to their performance.

1223
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was your grandmother's.

1224
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:35,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it's, like, used?

1225
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

1226
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to make a love connection with Heather.

1227
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to sing lead vocals.

1228
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't know how to play drums.
