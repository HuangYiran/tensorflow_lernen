东区女巫前情提要
Previously on Witches of East End

2
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:03,781
起作用了! 等等 别消失啊
It worked! Wait. Don't go away.

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,204
我太笨了
I suck at this.

4
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,648
阿奇博尔德・布朗宁 
Archibald Browning. 

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,524
在二十世纪初建立了这个地方
The man who built this place back in the early 1900s.

6
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:11,100
你只不过杀死了我的大女儿 
You only killed my eldest daughter. 

7
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,020
英格丽德已经重生了
Ingrid was reborn.

8
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,557
记着 我认识你已经好几个世纪了
Remember, I've known you for over several centuries,

9
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:16,884
你可能是我们中最有天赋的一个
and you're probably the most gifted one of us all.

10
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,008
我们的族类必须服从一点 
All of our kind must abide. 

11
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,943
我们决不泄漏我们的身份
We never reveal ourselves.

12
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,193
我将成为你的嫂子 
I'm going to be your sister-in-law, 

13
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:23,859
我希望你和我的丈夫...
and I want you and my husband...

14
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,610
我不能看着你和他在一起
I can't watch you with him.

15
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:27,383
基利安!
Killian!

16
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,364
酒吧里的电路出了故障
The electrical system at the bar went haywire.

17
00:00:29,398 --> 00:00:30,598
只是做我的本职工作而已
Just doing my job.

18
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:34,703
秘密是恋爱中的毒药 你说对吗?
Secrets are poison in a relationship, don't you agree?

19
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,921
- 嗨 - 天啊...
- Hey. - Oh, my God...

20
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,438
你在这做什么?
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:55,390
- 游泳啊 - 哦
- Swimming. - Yeah.

22
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:58,527
- 这个我知道 - 漂亮又聪明
- That much I can figure out. - Beauty and brains.

23
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,453
真是完美啊
Quite the combination.

24
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:03,565
告诉我 你一直这么自以为是吗?
Tell me something. Have you always been a smart-ass?

25
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,809
差不多
Pretty much.

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,144
说真的 你在我的游泳池里做什么?
Seriously, what are you doing in my pool?

27
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:11,031
佩内洛普说我可以随意用她的游泳池
Penelope said I could use her pool whenever I want.

28
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:13,149
这比冰冷的海水好多了 所以...
It beats the freezing cold ocean, so...

29
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,251
你叫她佩内洛普? 
You call her Penelope? 

30
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,652
你知道这有点奇怪 对吧?
You know that's really weird, right?

31
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:16,734
她是你妈妈啊
She's your mom.

32
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:19,359
真的吗? 现在听起来你更像我妈妈
Really? 'Cause right now it sounds like you're my mom.

33
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,932
那么 你以后会经常来这了?
So, does this mean you come here often?

34
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,992
这是搭讪吗? 你在勾引我?
Is that a line? Are you trying to pick up on me?

35
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:28,215
拜托 想得美
Please. You wish.

36
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:31,344
你说的对 我确实想
You're right. I do.

37
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,974
我希望你以后不那么说话
Uh... I wish you wouldn't say things like that.

38
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,659
拜托 我只是开个玩笑  
Come on, I'm just messing around.  

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,760
我知道 我...
I know. I...

40
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:45,148
不只是这个 我... 我觉得你好像在等我
It's not just that, I... I feel like you're waiting for me or something.

41
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:47,267
我不希望你那样
And I don't want you to.

42
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,736
我没有等啊
I'm not waiting.

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,606
但是我听见你的话了 一清二楚
But I hear you, loud and clear.

44
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,571
我记得你的医生还不允许你游泳
I don't recall your doctor giving you permission to swim yet.

45
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,370
我很好
Uh, I'm fine.

46
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,692
上周你刚刚被电击过呢
Well, you suffered a profound electric shock last week.

47
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:04,423
但我觉得好像我有了几千块钱一样
And yet I feel like a thousand bucks.

48
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,021
好吧 那不算很多钱 基利安
Yeah. That's not a lot of money, Killian.

49
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,751
- 是啊 对你来说不算 - 你知道吗?
- Well, maybe not to you. - But you know what?

50
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,111
我希望你下午来趟医院 我要给你复查
I'd like you to come by the hospital this afternoon so I can take a look at you.

51
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,489
- 一点 怎么样? - 好的 老爸
- Say... 1:00? - 'Kay, Dad.

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,881
你们两个和好了?
So, you guys are just cool now?

53
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,477
不 还没有
No, not really.

54
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:22,631
但是 这么多年我一直很想他
But, like, I've missed him all these years, and if there's a way

55
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,043
即使让我们达到正常关系的一半 
we can even have a halfway normal relationship, 

56
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,987
我也会尝试的
I might as well try.

57
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,852
还能怎么样? 毕竟他是我弟弟啊
What can I say? He's my little brother.

58
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:31,905
你是我见过的最好的人
You know, you are the best person I've ever met.

59
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,158
- 最好的? - 最好的
- The best? - The best.

60
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:46,920
英格丽德・波尚
Ingrid Beauchamp.

61
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:48,372
加德纳夫人!
Mrs. Gardiner!

62
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,455
我正好在找你 
Just the woman I wanted to see. 

63
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,105
需要我帮你找什么书吗?
Can I help you with a book?

64
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,243
不用 我给你带了件礼物
No, but I've come bearing gifts for you.

65
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:56,547
你知道 费尔黑文正在重修
As you know, renovations at Fair Haven have been ongoing,

66
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,600
我找到了一些以前的宝贝
and we've unearthed quite a few gems from the past.

67
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,468
- 哦... - 有一样特别的东西...
- Oh... - One in particular...

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,138
我觉得你会感兴趣
I thought you'd be interested in.

69
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,277
这简直...
Wow. That's...

70
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,643
不可思议吧? 
Uncanny, right? 

71
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:13,420
我看到的时候简直不敢相信
I could hardly believe it when I saw it.

72
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,599
她和你一模一样 英格丽德
She looks exactly like you, Ingrid.

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,185
有点吧 我觉得眼睛有点像
A little, I guess, around the eyes.

74
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:20,804
她可能是你的双胞胎姐妹呢
She could be your twin.

75
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,668
这个女人一定是你的亲戚 你觉得呢?
This woman must have been a relative of yours, don't you think?

76
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:24,941
绝对的
Definitely. Yes.

77
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,929
我家已经在这住很久了
I know my family has lived in this town

78
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,115
所以这很有可能
for a long time, so that would make sense.

79
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,164
我很好奇她是谁
I wonder who she was.

80
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,083
还有她看起来为什么这么忧虑
And why she looks so troubled.

81
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,252
你觉得她看起来很忧虑?
You think she looks troubled?

82
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:36,620
是的
I do.

83
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,020
东区女巫 第一季第06集

84
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,029
- 好的 记住我教你的 - 好的
- All right, remember what I taught you. - Right.

85
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,855
深呼吸... 设定目标...
Deep breath... Set your intention...

86
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,857
然后释放出来
And let it out.

87
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,664
- 天啊! 我做到了! - 你做到了!
- Holy crap! I did it! - You did it!

88
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:05,115
我真为你自豪
I am so proud of you.

89
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:07,080
你达到一个新的水平了
You're at a whole another level with this stuff.

90
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,955
是啊 太不可思议了 
I know. It's incredible. 

91
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,204
就像... 我突然变强了
It's like I'm... Suddenly stronger.

92
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,372
我觉得我对生活更有掌控力了
And I feel more in control of my life.

93
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,786
我告诉基利安要向前看
I told Killian to move on.

94
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,983
我做到了! 而且当时他没穿衣服 
I did! And he was shirtless at the time, 

95
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,537
所以你知道我有多厉害了吧
so you know I meant it.

96
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,770
他为什么没穿衣服?
Why was he shirtless?

97
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,531
我们当时在泳池里 思想别那么龌龊
We were in the pool. Get your mind out of the gutter.

98
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,896
好的 祝你好运
Okay. Good for you.

99
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,488
现在好像没有什么我做不到的了
It's like there's nothing I can't do right now.

100
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,891
你能灭火吗? 因为你刚刚点火了
Can you put out fires? 'Cause I think you started one.

101
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,893
也许我太强了?
Maybe I'm too powerful?

102
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,647
是的 那... 对 你就是那样
Yeah. That... yeah, that's what you are.

103
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,863
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

104
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:45,082
我认为我们没什么要做的
Well, I don't think there's anything we can do.

105
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,917
如果她发现那是我呢?
What if she figures out it's me?

106
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,670
英格丽德 我想没人会因为
Ingrid. I don't think anyone's

107
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,872
看了那张百年老照
gonna look at that hundred-year-old photograph

108
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,508
就觉得你是一个巫师
and decide that it means you're a secret witch

109
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:59,013
会因为一个古老的咒语而不断地重生
under an ancient curse that causes you to be reborn

110
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:02,716
你也说了 她认为那是个亲戚
You said it yourself. She assumed it's a relative.

111
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,385
怎么了?
What's going on?

112
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,319
佩内洛普找到了一张
Uh, Penelope found an old photograph 

113
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,111
英格丽德在费尔黑文的老照片
of Ingrid at Fair Haven.

114
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:12,092
你是担心她会认出你来吗?
Oh. And you're worried she's gonna figure out it's you?

115
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,612
睡衣不错哦
Cool bathing suit.

116
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,864
我不知道 只是 我知道那是我
I don't know. It's just, I know that it's me,

117
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,866
但是我不知道我其他轮回的任何事
but I don't know anything about my other lives,

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,234
我有点好奇
and I'm starting to get curious.

119
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,368
- 哦 - 是的
- Oh. - Yeah.

120
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:23,473
和我在一起的那个小女孩是谁?
Who is that little girl I'm with?

121
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:25,486
为什么我会在费尔黑文? 
Why was I hanging out at Fair Haven? 

122
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:27,741
我认识阿奇博尔德・布朗宁吗?
Did I know Archibald Browning?

123
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:31,176
不怎么认识 这... 没什么...
Not really. It's... not really...

124
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,839
- 值得深究的 - 没错
- Worth getting into that. - No.

125
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,907
我知道肯定不仅如此 
I can tell there's more to this. 

126
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,136
为什么你们不想让我知道?
Why don't you want me to know?

127
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,390
我不想你被你的前世所限
I don't want you to be defined by all your other lives.

128
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:47,595
我不想你背负着前世的罪过
I don't want you to carry the baggage of all your mistakes.

129
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,296
什么罪过?!
What mistakes?!

130
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,801
好吧 别告诉我
Fine. Don't tell me.

131
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,609
她不会死心的
She's not gonna stop.

132
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,648
你知道她有多固执 我们应该告诉她真相吗?
You know how determined she is. Should we just tell her the truth?

133
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:07,035
如果我们告诉她 她也许永远不会原谅你
If we tell her, she may never forgive you.

134
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,784
你真想冒那个险吗?
You really want to risk that?

135
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:18,292
好的 深吸气
All right, big breath in.

136
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,010
呼气
Out.

137
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,595
好了
All right.

138
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,529
还不错 不过你还要进行全面的血液检查
Sounds good. But you should have a full blood panel done.

139
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,301
我有点怀念你的说教了
I oddly miss these lectures.

140
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,470
像以前一样
Feels like old times.

141
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:33,075
想回到以前 还需要很多努力
You got a long way to go before it's like old times again.

142
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,205
但是... 看到你差点没命
But... seeing you almost die 

143
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,843
确实让情况乐观了不少
did put things in perspective.

144
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:40,314
向我保证你会去检查 好吗?
Just promise me you'll get a checkup, all right?

145
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:43,200
不如我保证不再被电击吧?
How about if I just promise not to get electrocuted again?

146
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,590
成交吗?
Deal?

147
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:47,871
加德纳医生?
Dr. Gardiner?

148
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,255
我对你从莫拉・撒切尔嗓子里拿出来的东西
I ran some tests 

149
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:50,874
做了些测试
on the mass you pulled from Maura Thatcher's throat.

150
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,628
它似乎是由有机海绵状骨组织组成的
It appears to be made of some sort of organic, spongy osseous tissue.

151
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,571
但是我了解到 它...
But get this, it...

152
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,717
天哪 我没有发现还有病人在这 我很抱歉
Oh, God, I didn't realize you had a patient in here. I am so sorry.

153
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,773
不 没关系 我们结束了  
No, no, it's okay. We're finished. 

154
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,796
艾米 这是我的弟弟 基利安
Amy, this is my brother, Killian.

155
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:05,785
基利安 这是马修斯医生 
Killian, Dr. Matthews, MD, 

156
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,058
博士 医学研究的超级巨星
PhD, medical research superstar.

157
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,894
我们等会再说吧
Um, we can finish this later.

158
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,563
别介意我在这
Oh, hey, don't leave 'cause of me.

159
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:16,734
我很喜欢这个有机海绵状骨组织的故事
I love a good organic, spongy, osseous tissue story.

160
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,499
谁会不喜欢呢?
Oh. Well, who doesn't?

161
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,071
我不知道加德纳医生还有一个弟弟
So, I didn't know Dr. Gardiner had a brother.

162
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:24,192
是啊 他喜欢低调行事 可我就出现了
Yeah, he likes to keep that quiet. But here I am.

163
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,195
对啊 干得好
Yep, and here you go.

164
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,481
我还有工作要做 
I've got work to do. 

165
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,831
很糟糕 今天你不是我唯一的病人
Shockingly, you're not my only patient today.

166
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,439
- 真的很高兴见到你 艾米 - 我也是
- Really nice to meet you, Amy. - You, too. Yeah.

167
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,310
这怎么可能...  
How is that possible... 

168
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,692
英格丽德 猜发生了什么?
Ingrid, guess what?

169
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,280
你在干嘛呢?
Oh. What are you doing?

170
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:45,755
- 刨根问底 - 这是什么意思?
- Falling down the rabbit hole. - What do you mean?

171
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,613
佩内洛普找到这张我在费尔黑文的照片
Penelope found this picture of me at Fair Haven,

172
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:50,293
和我在一起的这个小女孩看起来异常亲切
and I'm with this little girl who looks strangely familiar,

173
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,262
但老妈不肯告诉我她是谁 你也知道她
but Mom won't tell me who it is; you know how she gets

174
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,121
一向对过去守口如瓶 所以我想 
about the past, so I thought, 

175
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:54,865
我不需要老妈
hey, I don't need Mom,

176
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,750
我是个研究员... 我就做一些研究吧
I'm a researcher... I'll just do some research.

177
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,886
然后我弄明白了它是雅典娜
And that's how I figured out it was Athena.

178
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,021
谁是雅典娜?
What was Athena?

179
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,927
照片里的小女孩是雅典娜・布朗宁
The little girl in the picture was Athena Browning.

180
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,512
阿奇博尔德家的人 
As in Archibald. 

181
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:09,104
你知道吧 那个建立费尔黑文的男人
You know, the man who built Fair Haven.

182
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,487
- 撒旦教 邪教领袖 - 我不明白
- Satanist, cult leader. - Yeah, I don't get it.

183
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:15,532
雅典娜是阿奇博尔德的女儿 你有水吗?
Athena is Archibald's daughter. Do you have any water?

184
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,285
我好渴啊 这还很押韵呢
I'm really thirsty. And that rhymed.

185
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,161
英格丽德 这布朗尼蛋糕里
Ingrid, is there anything else 

186
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,007
除了巧克力还放了什么东西?
in these brownies besides chocolate?

187
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,625
完全正确!
Exactly!

188
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:28,952
- 这就是关键! - 什么是关键?
- That is the point! - What is the point?

189
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,587
所有努力的关键 努力跟上我的思路
Of the entire endeavor. Try to keep up.

190
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,215
当我发现这小女孩是谁时
See, when I realized who the little girl was,

191
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,135
我想 见鬼 这和我有什么关系
I thought, holy shit, what does this have to do with me,

192
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,720
...为什么老妈不想让我知道?
...and why doesn't Mom want me to know? 

193
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,211
我是个女巫啊 我只用念一段咒语
I'm a witch; I'll just cast a spell.

194
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,273
一个帮我恢复记忆的咒语 我查找了魔法书
A spell to help me remember So I searched the Grimoire,

195
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,442
然后找到了这个配方 虽然我有点搞砸了
and I found this recipe, which I messed with a little,

196
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,576
但之后我成功了... 
and then I did it... 

197
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:44,978
一个帮我记起1906年的生活
a spell to help me remember

198
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,802
的咒语... 我把它烤到这布朗尼蛋糕里了
my life from 1906... I baked it into this brownie.

199
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:49,514
- 然后呢? - 我很肯定是骗人的
- And? - I'm pretty sure it's bunk.

200
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,704
我把整盘的蛋糕都吃了 我没有任何感觉
I've eaten the entire pan. I don't really feel a thing,

201
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,732
除了有点小激动 你想尝一块试试吗? 
except I'm a little agitated. 

202
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,634
看这对你有没有用
Do you want to try one, see if it works on you?

203
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,580
不用了! 谢谢 这挺诱人的 
No! No. Thank you. That's tempting. 

204
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,541
但我要去见达什
But I'm gonna meet Dash,

205
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:59,009
然后我会去上班
and then I'm gonna go to work.

206
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,210
- 好吧 - 你要告诉我之后如何 好吗?
- Okay. - You let me know how that goes, okay?

207
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:07,250
真是一点帮助也没有啊 魔法布朗尼
Thanks for nothing, magic brownie.

208
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:12,872
英格丽德
Ingrid.

209
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:08,561
你是我见过的最美的尤物
You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen.

210
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,168
我爱你 阿奇博尔德
I love you, Archibald.

211
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,144
这些测试结果肯定是错的
Okay, these test results can't be right.

212
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,979
我也是这么认为的
I didn't think so either.

213
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,111
所以我重复测试了 无数次
So I ran them again. And again and again...

214
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:18,079
你确定组织样本没有被污染吗?
Are you sure the tissue sample wasn't compromised?

215
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,750
我要装作没听见你刚才的问题
I'm gonna pretend like you didn't just ask me that question.

216
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:24,110
我没有质疑你 这些测试结果不科学啊
It's not you I'm questioning. These test results are unscientifically possible.

217
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:27,222
我在一本名不见经传的医学杂志上
Well, I did find an example of a similar phenomenon 

218
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,089
找到一例相似的现象
in an obscure medical journal.

219
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:33,376
似乎 在1995年 路易斯安那州的乡村
Apparently, in 1995, a woman in rural Louisiana

220
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:36,011
一名喉咙疼痛 呼吸困难的女子到
presented in a small county E.R. with severe throat pain

221
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,180
小镇急症室
and obstructed breathing.

222
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:39,899
他们发现这东西生长在她的气管里
They found one of these growing out of her windpipe.

223
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,147
这是先天性的吗?
And it was idiopathic?

224
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:46,233
是的 尽管她声称这是因为她被女巫诅咒过
Yep. Although she claims it was because she was cursed by a voodoo priestess.

225
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:47,669
或许我们可以联系那个医院 
Okay, maybe we should contact that hospital 

226
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,773
相互参照下我们的发现
and cross-reference our findings.

227
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,826
我们不能 因为
We can't. Get this.

228
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,763
在这件事发生三周后 医生和两名研究员
The admitting doctor and two researchers all died

229
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:56,662
都因为严重的肺部感染而死
of severe lung infections three weeks after the incident.

230
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,331
医院也被捣毁了
The hospital was demolished due

231
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,149
因为明显的石棉污染
to an apparent asbestos contamination.

232
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,984
样本也永远无法复原了
The sample was never recovered.

233
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,986
- 这还真没帮助啊 - 是啊
- Well, that's not very helpful. - No.

234
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,578
你好
Hello.

235
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:08,862
我可以进来吗?
Can I come in?

236
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,959
- 嗨 宝贝 - 弗雷娅 很高兴见到你
- Hey, babe. - Freya, so good to see you.

237
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,995
那是什么东西啊?
Hi. What is that thing?

238
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,098
那是医学未解之谜
That is a medical mystery.

239
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,025
但我会解开谜团的
But I'm gonna solve it.

240
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:19,987
它是从哪来的?
Where'd it come from?

241
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,937
那天莫拉・撒切尔在弯曲手肘对你们大叫以后
Oh, I pulled it out of Maura Thatcher's throat

242
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,799
我从她的嗓子里拿出来的
the day she freaked out on your family at the Bent Elbow.

243
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,846
是吗?
You did?

244
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:27,149
或许她被女巫诅咒了呢
Hey, maybe she was cursed by a voodoo priestess.

245
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,536
什么?!
What?!

246
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,784
她开玩笑的 我们为什么不休息一下呢?
She's kidding. Look, why don't we take a break?

247
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,053
要不我们去吃午餐吧?
Maybe we should grab some lunch?

248
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:34,296
- 好啊 - 好
- Yeah, sure. - Okay.

249
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,377
不
Oh, no.

250
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,350
阿奇博尔德
Archibald.

251
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,173
我又收到弗雷娅的信了!
I got another letter from Freya!

252
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,898
她在旧金山定居了 
She's settled in San Francisco 

253
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,176
她还说找到了这辈子的真爱
and says she's met the love of her life.

254
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:06,512
- 还有什么新鲜事? - 我好想她啊
- What else is new? - Oh, I miss her so.

255
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:10,062
伊迪丝 告诉我你的症状
Edith, tell me what the problem is.

256
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,732
我的手很酸 我都抬不起来了
My hands are so sore I can barely lift 'em.

257
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,902
我怕再也用不了这手了
And I'm afraid they'll never work again.

258
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,171
别担心
Well, not to worry.

259
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:22,241
温迪会给你调配适合的药膏
Wendy will mix you just the right salve.

260
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,599
现在 闭上眼睛  伊迪丝
And in the meantime, close your eyes, Edith.

261
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,911
妈咪嘛咪哄
Sana manus mulieris huius.

262
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,536
妈咪嘛咪哄
Sana manus mulieris huius.

263
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,520
老天
Oh, my.

264
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,719
感觉好多了
It's much better.

265
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:37,320
好神奇
Like... magic.

266
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:40,648
这是我在欧洲学的一点医治疗法
It's just a little healing technique I picked up in Europe. 

267
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:46,215
伊迪丝 这是擦手的软膏 一天擦两次
Edith, this is the ointment that you rub on your hands twice daily.

268
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,247
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

269
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:50,250
你们三个真是创造奇迹的人
You three really are miracle-workers.

270
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,851
谢谢你 伊迪丝
Thank you, Edith.

271
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,718
乔安娜...
Joanna...

272
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,027
气色不错嘛
You're looking well.

273
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:18,529
这要两美元
That'll be two dollars.

274
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:25,285
还有一件事
Oh, uh, one more thing.

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,124
我有个门徒生病了
One of my disciples has fallen ill.

276
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,174
我在找一种草药 它叫热狐
I'm looking for an herb. It's called feverfox.

277
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,871
我从没听过这草药
I've never heard of it.

278
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,712
我记得我在你的货架上见到过
Hmm. I believe I've seen it here on your shelves.

279
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:38,393
它是... 它是一种蓝色的粉末
It's a... it's a bluish powder.

280
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,920
对 我姐说的没错 我们没有库存热狐
No. My sister's right. We don't stock feverfox.

281
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:45,639
它是非法的 用不好就会有剧毒
It's illegal and rather toxic in the wrong hands.

282
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,721
我以为你从来没听说过它呢
Hmm. I thought you'd never heard of it.

283
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,706
她没听过 我听过
She hasn't. I have.

284
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,308
我们没法帮你
We can't help you.

285
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,709
没关系
Of course.

286
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,579
那我走了
Well, I'll be going, then.

287
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,719
女士们你们真应该去费尔黑文看看
You ladies really must pay a visit to Fair Haven.

288
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,990
它终于建完了 我想你们会被我们的成果打动
It's finally complete, and I think you'll be impressed with what we're doing.

289
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:11,077
它是我们另一种层次的存在
It is the next level of being for our kind.

290
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,829
- 不了 谢谢你 - 我们很好
- No, thank you. - We're good.

291
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,474
但愿如此
As you wish.

292
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,315
英格丽德?
Ingrid?

293
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,317
见到你真好
Good to see you.

294
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,517
嘿 怎么了?
Hey, what's up?

295
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,085
我们应该担心这玩意儿吗?
Should we be worried about this?

296
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,735
你从哪儿拿到的?  
Where did you get that? 

297
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,757
在医院 怎么了? 这是什么东西?
At the hospital. Why? What is it?

298
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,560
枝毒 死亡树枝 碰到就会死
Ramus mortium, branch of death. You touch it, you die.

299
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:48,025
什么?
What?

300
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,124
万一已经晚了呢?
What if it's too late?

301
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,745
枝毒病毒需要几周的时间才能侵入体内
Ramus mortium sickness takes a few weeks to kick in.

302
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,118
所以我们还有时间 我们能治好 
So we have time. We'll fix it.  

303
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,226
要是侵入了会怎么样?
And when it does kick in?

304
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,264
你知道那种湿乎乎的金属性的东西
You know that, uh, drippy metallicy stuff

305
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,033
- 也是树枝的一部分吗? - 是的
- that was on the branch? - Yeah. Uh-huh.

306
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,990
它会缓慢而坚定地注入到你的肺里 
That slowly but surely fills up your lungs 

307
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,270
直至你窒息而死
until you drown from within.

308
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,272
- 你为什么告诉我这些? - 你问的啊
- Why would you tell me that? - You asked.

309
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,208
那也没必要回答得这么直白嘛
You didn't have to answer that honestly.

310
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,578
天那 都怪你 是你对莫拉施的咒
Oh, my God. This is all your fault. You were the one that put the spell on Maura.

311
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:16,796
不 不 不 我使不出这么阴险毒辣的招数
No, no, no. This is something much bigger, much darker.

312
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:18,798
我觉得是假冒者袭击她的时候干的
I bet it happened when the shifter attacked her.

313
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,451
那为什么莫拉能从如此的剧毒下死里逃生?
So why isn't Maura dead if this thing is so toxic?

314
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:23,887
她是寄主 它在体内生长 所以她有免疫
She's the host. It grew from within, so she's immune.

315
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,683
而你正相反...  
You on the other hand...  

316
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,446
我知道 我是被感染的
Oh, yeah, I know. I'm infected.

317
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:30,473
好吧 弗雷娅 我需要你好好听我说
Okay, Freya, I'm gonna need you to listen to me.

318
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,103
我不会骗你
I'm not gonna lie to you.

319
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:35,152
患上枝毒病很严重 非常严重
Ramus mortium sickness is bad. Really bad.

320
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:37,595
我见过死于这病的人 在三百年前
I've seen people die from it. I've seen you die from it

321
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,166
我还见过你死于此病 所以我需要你振作起来
300 years ago, so I'm gonna need you to suck it up.

322
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,533
哇哦 这真是世上最扯的鼓励了
Wow. This is the world's shittiest pep talk.

323
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,618
我的意思是你不一定会死
My point is you don't have to die from it.

324
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,354
那时候我们不知道怎么治 但现在我们有办法
We didn't know how to stop it back then. We do now.

325
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,913
这药水就可以治愈 我需要你来制作
This drink is the cure. I'm gonna need you to make it.

326
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,176
但为什么是我?
But why me?

327
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,164
亲爱的 尽管你毫无经验 
Honey, even with all your inexperience, 

328
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:54,795
但你有使用药剂的天赋
you have a gift for potions.

329
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,380
这是与生俱来的
It's in your blood.

330
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:59,032
我永远赶不上你在这方面的能耐
I'm never gonna be able to make it as good as you.

331
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,552
这个树枝也能杀死普通人吗?
So this branch can kill regular people, too?

332
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,001
任何碰到它的人 
Anybody who touches it. 

333
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,656
但这个解药可以在几年内提供保护
But this antidote offers protection for a few years...

334
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,708
就像是破伤风针... 防止再次感染
It's kind of like a tetanus shot... Just in case you're re-exposed.

335
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,162
所以达什和艾米也得服用
So I'm gonna have to get Dash and Amy to take this, too.

336
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,268
是 一定要让他们喝得多多的 好吗?
Yes. And make sure they drink a lot, okay?

337
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,067
当你耳鸣的时候就说明你痊愈了
You'll know that you're cured when your ears start ringing.

338
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,902
- 弗雷娅? - 啥?
- Freya? - Huh?

339
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,722
作为一个给力的女巫 你是在拯救生命 
You're gonna save lives, like the ass-kicking witch that you are.

340
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,158
好的
Okay.

341
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:36,285
"你看他的父母
"Interruption to his father and mother,

342
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:41,125
他们这般为他忍耐着 是多么耐心而善良啊"
how patiently and kindly so ever they might endure it for his sake..."

343
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,821
- 英格丽德! - 雅典娜！
- Ingrid! - Athena!

344
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,108
你没来吃晚饭 你说过要给我编辫子
You missed dinner. And you said you were going to braid my hair.

345
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,202
我知道 我实在走不开 
I know. I couldn't get away. 

346
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,105
抱歉 我明天给你编吧
I'm sorry, but I'll braid it tomorrow.

347
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,890
- 保证? - 嗯
- Promise? - Mm-hmm.

348
00:17:56,924 --> 00:17:58,892
准备睡觉吧 亲爱的
Go get ready for bed, dear.

349
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,112
- 晚安 老爸 - 晚安 英格丽德
- Good night, Daddy. - Good night, Ingrid.

350
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,536
你今天很有说服力呢
You were very convincing today.

351
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,605
我差点儿以为你不认识我
I almost believed you didn't know me.

352
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:16,126
那怎么可能
That would be an unthinkable reality.

353
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,501
你带来热狐了吗?
Did you bring the feverfox?

354
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,789
好姑娘
Good girl.

355
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:34,457
卡利俄铂! 带伊丽莎白进来！
Calliope! Fetch Elizabeth!

356
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,933
伊丽莎白 很高兴你决定面对这些
Elizabeth, I'm glad you decided to go through with this.

357
00:18:40,935 --> 00:18:42,302
你不会后悔的
You won't regret it.

358
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,488
我得承认我有点儿紧张
Oh, I must admit I'm a little nervous.

359
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,608
我哥哥以为你们是魔鬼
My brother thinks you all do the devil's work.

360
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,027
你哥哥是白痴
Your brother is a cretin.

361
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:52,812
英格丽德和我超越凡人
Ingrid and myself are superior creatures.

362
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,998
我们愿意和你们这类人来往是你的福气 
You're lucky we're willing to deal with your kind at all,

363
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,583
更何况我们还帮你
let alone help you the way we are.

364
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,653
我看到 你把钱带来了
I see you've, uh, brought the money.

365
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,338
这是我全部家当了
This is everything I have.

366
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,594
我不想说谎
I'm not going to lie.

367
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,513
这个... 会疼的
This... will hurt.

368
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:11,456
很疼
A lot.

369
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,264
谢谢你
Thank you.

370
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,695
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes

371
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:27,180
然后喝下去
and drink.

372
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:32,152
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

373
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,322
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

374
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:40,327
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

375
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:44,331
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

376
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:48,001
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

377
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:51,638
妈咪嘛咪哄
Spiritus obscuri da viriditatum.

378
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,759
奏效了吗?
Did it work?

379
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:02,411
奏效了 你又年轻了
It did. You are young again.

380
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,574
你如愿以偿了
You have what you wanted.

381
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,298
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

382
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:11,024
永生永世感激不尽 
I'm forever in your debt.

383
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:15,241
卡利俄铂 今晚的仪式在泳池举行
Calliope, tonight's ritual will take place in the pool.

384
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:17,890
帮伊丽莎白准备入会
Prepare Elizabeth for her initiation.

385
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,407
我保证你会喜欢 亲爱的
I promise you'll love it, dear.

386
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:31,928
我们也可以... 准备了吗?
Shall we... prepare, as well?

387
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:26,571
- 谁准备好迎接下一轮啦? - 哦
- So, who's ready for another round? - Oh.

388
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,873
你又忘了准备我那杯
Once again, you forget a glass for me.

389
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:30,038
你还是喝你的根汁汽水吧 
You stick to your root beer. 

390
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,008
你可是我们指定的司机
You're our designated driver.

391
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,893
你们一群人都想坐我摩托车?
Ah, you guys all want to pile onto my motorcycle?

392
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:34,528
我说了你可以开我的车
I said you could use my car.

393
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,605
谢谢你今晚约我出来 弗雷娅
Thank you for inviting me out tonight, Freya,

394
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:38,657
但我可告诉你 我还不太擅长
but I have to tell you, I am a bit of an amateur,

395
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,647
我不知道我再喝一杯还能不能受得了
and I don't know if I can handle another one of these, um...

396
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,082
这叫什么来着?
What are they called?

397
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,387
东区解药... 带花样的
East End Antidote... with a twist.

398
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,831
对 是的 喝完前三轮我已经醉得不行了
Right. Yeah, I'm pretty drunk from the last three rounds.

399
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,856
- 胡说! 我们是在庆祝诶！ - 什么?
- Hogwash! We are celebrating! - What?

400
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,399
你刚才真的说了"胡说"? 
Did you really just say "hogwash"?  

401
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,160
好吧 等一下 我们在庆祝什么?
Okay, wait. What are we celebrating?

402
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:57,030
我们在庆祝你俩将会
We are celebrating the fact that you two are about

403
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,791
解决你们之前在研究的医学难题
to solve that whole medical mystery you were working on earlier.

404
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,552
其他医生怎么说?
What do the other doctors say?

405
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,841
还有谁跟你们一起研究?
Who else is working on it with you? 

406
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:04,247
也许我们应该把他们也叫来
Maybe we should invite them here,

407
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,872
进行一局头脑风暴怎么样?
maybe have a little brainstorming session?

408
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,809
哇哦 我觉得自打我认识你以来
Wow. I think this is the most interest

409
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:11,048
这是第一次你对我的工作这么感兴趣
you've shown in my work since the day I met you.

410
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,038
嘿 这么说可不公平 
Hey, that's not fair. 

411
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,144
我一直对你的工作感兴趣
I'm always interested in your work.

412
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,200
慢着 慢着 我不是这意思 好吗?
Hold on, hold on. I didn't mean it like that, all right?

413
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:23,774
我只是说 我的工作会让人感到有压力
All I meant was, is that my job can be stressful,

414
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,954
我希望你这片绿洲可以远离我沙漠般的工作
and I like that you are an oasis away from all that.

415
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:29,014
这样我跟你在一起的时候 
Okay, when I'm with you, 

416
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,041
就可以忘记烦恼开开心心的
I can be happy and just forget about my troubles.

417
00:22:31,076 --> 00:22:33,744
但你知道我关心你的工作啊
But you know that I care about your work.

418
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:35,031
我知道你关心
I know you do.

419
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:36,964
而你又经常什么都不说
And you don't always want to talk about it.

420
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,694
你说得对 我经常闷着 
You're right. I don't. 

421
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:41,545
抱歉 我不应该这样
I'm sorry. It just came out wrong.

422
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:49,199
这是我喝过的最美味的饮料
This is the most delicious drink I think I've ever had.

423
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,025
它 它的味道像... 阳光
It, um... it tastes like... sunshine.

424
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:53,994
- 哇哦 - 确实像！
- Wow. - It does!

425
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,880
好吧 让我试试 给我尝一口
All right, let me see. Give me a sip.

426
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,691
- 怎么样? - 你说得对 阳光的味道
- Hmm? - You're right. Sunshine.

427
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:01,851
别这样 别生气了
Come on, don't be mad.

428
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:04,520
- 我没那意思 - 我知道 我只是...
- I didn't mean anything by it. - I know. I just...

429
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:07,824
你知道我不只能让你忘记烦心事 对吗?
You know I'm not just here to take your mind off things, right?

430
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:10,809
我不希望你对我隐藏
I mean, I don't want you to be hiding your problems from me.

431
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,084
不管你说的是什么 我都可以接受
I can handle it, whatever it is you want to throw at me.

432
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:16,203
我知道 我希望我的生命里你无处不在
I know. I want you to be a part of everything in my life.

433
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:19,213
很好 我也是这么想的
Good, 'cause that's what I want, too.

434
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:22,358
那真是太好了
All right then.

435
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,878
- 嫁给我吧 - 什么?
- So marry me. - What?

436
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,297
我以为你们已经结婚了呢
I thought you guys were already getting married.

437
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,856
看吧? 艾米不愧是博士呢 
See? Amy does have a PhD. 

438
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:31,904
不 不 我们这周末结婚吧
No, no, marry me this weekend.

439
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,942
我们两个在法院结婚
At the courthouse just the two of us.

440
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:37,419
没有麻烦 没有父母 没有客人
All right, no hassle, no mothers-in-law, no guest list.

441
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,295
就我们两个 你们两个可以当见证人
Just us. You two can be the witnesses.

442
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,764
太好了!
Hell, yes!

443
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:51,286
- 好浪漫啊! - 是啊 祝福你们
- That is so romantic! - Yeah. Congratulations.

444
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,077
佩内洛普要高兴死啦
Penelope's gonna lose her shit.

445
00:23:53,111 --> 00:23:54,712
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

446
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,053
酒吧要打烊了！最后一轮！
It's last call, people! One more round!

447
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,055
天哪 想不到都这么晚了
Wow. I can't believe it's already last call.

448
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:05,953
- 我们接着去庆祝吧 - 好啊
- We got to keep this party going. - Yeah.

449
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,308
我们回费尔黑文庆祝吧?
Who wants to go back to Fair Haven and celebrate?

450
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,292
走吧
Let's go.

451
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:09,627
- 就这么办 - 好的
- Let's do this. - Yeah.

452
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,062
干杯
Cheers.

453
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:22,323
我们应该加入他们 我可以去游泳
We should join the others. I could use a swim.

454
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:25,493
我知道 只是有时候我想独占你
I know. I just like having you to myself sometimes.

455
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,412
只要你跟你的家人讲出事实
You can have me whenever you want

456
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:30,360
你随时都可以占有我
as soon as you tell your family the truth.

457
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:34,748
告诉他们你爱我 你愿意做我的妻子
That you love me and you're going to be my wife.

458
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:36,500
他们永远都不会理解
They will never understand.

459
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,651
他们会认为你给我下咒语了 我在受你的摆布
They'll think you spelled me, that I'm under your control.

460
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:43,912
好像我真能控制你似的 你比我更强大
Hmm. As if I could control you. You're more powerful than I am.

461
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:46,447
他们真的知道你有多强大吗?
Do they really not know how strong you are?

462
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:48,278
他们知道 但是他们也相信
They know, but they also believe 

463
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,651
你是一个纯粹的恶魔
you're pure evil.

464
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:52,454
那你是怎么想的呢?
Hmm. And what do you think?

465
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,765
我觉得在没遇到你之前
I believe I was sleepwalking

466
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,101
我一直在梦游 是你把我唤醒的
before I met you, and you woke me up.

467
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:00,353
当时机到来的时候
And when the time is right,

468
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:02,671
我们将会有足够的跟随者
and we have enough followers to our cause,

469
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,641
我们可以回到我们的家乡
we can return to where we came from

470
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:08,611
夺回属于我们的东西
and take back what is rightfully ours.

471
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:12,624
那时我会自豪的以妻子的身份站在你旁边
And I will be proud to stand beside you as your wife,

472
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,898
再也不会感到羞耻
and I will not be ashamed.

473
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,856
英格丽德 我们两个一起
Together, Ingrid,

474
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:23,910
没有什么是做不到的
there's nothing we can't do.

475
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:28,581
伊丽莎白出事了!
Something's wrong with Elizabeth!

476
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,969
她不停地抖动 然后...
She just started shaking, and then...

477
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,189
然后就开始吐血了!
and then, all this blood started pouring out!

478
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,431
我不知道出什么事了！ 
I don't know what happened!  

479
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:37,222
我们要想想办法
We need to do something.

480
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:39,340
我妈妈可以帮忙 她是个出色的医生
My mother can help. She's an excellent healer.

481
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,089
我们什么也做不了 她已经死了
There's nothing to be done. She's dead.

482
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:43,012
可怜的女人
Oh, poor woman.

483
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:46,795
这就是帮助一个劣等生物的结果
This is what we get for trying to help an inferior creature.

484
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:50,853
他们会怪罪我们 这会毁了我们的
They'll blame us. This could ruin everything.

485
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:52,572
要赶紧处理掉她的尸体
We need to get rid of her body.

486
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:55,241
可以把她埋在地下墓穴里
We can bury her down in the catacombs.

487
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:58,578
那些不理解我们的人 他们很快会找来的
They'll be after us now, the ones who don't understand,

488
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,729
但是我们可以把这看成新的开始
but we can make this a new beginning.

489
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:04,042
- 今晚 我们今晚结婚吧 - 好的
- Tonight. Let's marry tonight. - Yes.

490
00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:07,113
伊丽莎白在哪儿?
Where is Elizabeth?!

491
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,178
伊丽莎白?
Elizabeth?

492
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:12,629
伊丽莎白?!
Elizabeth?!

493
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:13,897
你怎么进来的?  
How did you get in?  

494
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,132
你们对她做了什么?
What have you done with her?

495
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,851
你没权利来这儿 走吧 你妹妹很好
You have no right to be here. Be gone. Your sister is fine.

496
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,346
那就让我见她  
Then show her to me.  

497
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:21,355
你妹妹有权单独留下来
You sister has a right to be left alone.

498
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:25,275
这个镇的好人们在盯着你的一举一动
Oh. The good people of this town are on to you.

499
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,277
我们知道你做些恶毒的事
We know you're doing the devil's work.

500
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:29,879
你根本不知道你在说什么 赶紧走吧
You have no idea what you're talking about. You need to leave.

501
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,365
好啊
Fine.

502
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,367
我要带着我妹妹一起走
Then I will take my sister with me,

503
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:37,233
否则我就带二十个人来这里 强行把她带走
or I will return with 20 men, and we will take her ourselves.

504
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:38,546
伊丽莎白已经死了
Elizabeth is dead.

505
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,325
她想变年轻
She wanted to be young.

506
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,877
我满足了她的愿望 但是出问题了
I granted her wish. It didn't work out.

507
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,528
你杀了她?!
You killed her?!

508
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:49,399
那是一场不幸的转变事故
It was an unfortunate turn of events.

509
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,337
你现在要杀了我吗?
And now you're going to kill me?

510
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,006
我没有要杀你的想法
I have no intention of killing you.

511
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:59,693
我未来的妻子会杀了你
My soon-to-be-wife will do it.

512
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:02,229
阿奇博尔德?
Archibald?

513
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:05,882
就当是结婚礼物吧
Think of it as a wedding gift.

514
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:08,279
我...
I...

515
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,304
求你了
Please.

516
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:16,064
你让我失望了 英格丽德
You disappoint me, Ingrid.

517
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:31,157
天哪! 好冷啊
Ooh, wow. Whoa! It's freezing.

518
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,027
液体升温
Calor Aqua.

519
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,351
我感觉有点暖呢
Feels kind of warm to me.

520
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,489
温度肯定快达到零点了
Huh. Must have been in a cold spot or something.

521
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,986
那饮料让我感觉不对劲
Oh! That drink really did a number on me.

522
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,313
- 我有点耳鸣 - 我也是
- My ears are ringing. - Me, too.

523
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,769
我也是 很好 那证明起作用了
Me, too. That's good. It means it's working.

524
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,114
- 你在说什么? - 没什么啦
- What are you talking about? - Nothing.

525
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:53,632
我喜欢这间房子 真是...
I love this room. It's so...

526
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:54,998
吓人吗?
Creepy?

527
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:57,307
- 你认为呢? - 绝对吓人
- You think? - Oh, definitely creepy.

528
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,910
他们以前在这举行邪恶的性仪式
They used to have Satanic sex rituals here, you know.

529
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,108
好吧 说点更吓人的 工人们
All right, you want creepy. You know, the workers

530
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,644
在这个房子下面发现了去地下墓室的入口
just found an entrance to some catacombs underneath the house.

531
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,389
我还没验证过呢  
I haven't even checked that out yet.  

532
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,101
刺激 我们去看看吧
Oh, cool. Let's go.

533
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,509
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

534
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,562
- 我不知道你在这儿 - 别这样
- I didn't think you were here. - Don't do this.

535
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,197
别干什么? 我只是拿点东西
Don't do what? I'm just getting some things.

536
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:47,734
我要去趟旧金山 去看弗雷娅
I'm taking a trip to visit Freya in San Francisco.

537
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:48,723
你穿着婚纱 
You're wearing a wedding dress.  

538
00:28:48,724 --> 00:28:51,030
是的 但这不是你看起来的那样
Yes, but it's not what it looks like.

539
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,103
英格丽德 别这样 
Ingrid, stop. 

540
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,533
我知道你和阿奇博尔德的事
I know about you and Archibald.

541
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:55,602
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

542
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,589
我以为你们只是一时冲动 
I thought it was a phase. 

543
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,066
没想到你陷得这么深
I had no idea you were in so deep.

544
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:02,025
英格丽德 他一点都不关心你 他在利用你
Ingrid, he doesn't care about you. He's using you.

545
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:05,245
他之前追过我 我没上当 你也不应该
He went after me first, and I didn't fall for it. You shouldn't, either.

546
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,635
你怎么撒这种谎?
Why are you lying like this?

547
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,066
英格丽德 你不能跟他结婚 他不爱你!
Ingrid, you can't marry him. He doesn't love you!

548
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:11,659
仅仅因为你利用男人
Just because you use men,

549
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,341
你只关心你自己
and just because you only care about yourself

550
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:15,024
并不意味着每个人跟你一样
doesn't mean everybody is like you.

551
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:17,353
你说的对 他不喜欢我 他是个魔鬼
You're right, he's not like me. He's evil.

552
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:19,514
他关心我们这类人
He cares about our kind.

553
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:23,017
他不想我们再躲躲藏藏了 他为我们感到自豪
He doesn't want us to have to hide anymore. He's proud of what we are.

554
00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,546
我们要去一个没人能伤害我们的地方
So we're going to a place where nobody can hurt us.

555
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,345
那种地方根本不存在!
Such a place doesn't exist!

556
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:28,924
如果他们知道我们是什么人 
If they find out what we are, 

557
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:30,017
他们总会伤害我们的
they will always hurt us.

558
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,103
如果我们回到我们的家乡就不会!
Not if we go back to where we came from!

559
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:34,440
阿奇博尔德找到一种回去的方式 
Archibald has found a way through. 

560
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,062
他在说谎
He's lying.

561
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,999
今晚我们结婚后就离开
We're leaving tonight after we're married.

562
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,535
抱歉 温迪
I'm sorry, Wendy.

563
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:48,543
工人们说这个地方自建好后基本没变过
Yeah, the workmen say this place is basically unchanged since it was built.

564
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:50,523
我不喜欢这个地方
Well, I don't like it.

565
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,513
你是怕我们见到鬼吗?
What, are you afraid we'll see a ghost?

566
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,415
我确定我们会见到老鼠
I'm pretty sure we're gonna see a rat.

567
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,100
我讨厌老鼠
I hate rats.

568
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,276
- 你还好吗? - 我觉得我有点醉了
- You all right? - Yeah. I think I'm a little drunk.

569
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,778
我知道你喝醉了
I know you're drunk.

570
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,929
但是我喜欢喝醉的弗雷娅... 她很有趣
But I like drunk Freya... she's fun.

571
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:10,698
是啊 但是喝醉的弗雷娅有个癖好
Yeah, but drunk Freya has a tendency

572
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,785
就是做很多蠢事第二天又后悔
to do stupid things she regrets the next day.

573
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:16,160
你在说那个订婚派对吗?
You talking about the engagement party?

574
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:18,729
我觉得那天你没喝醉
Cause I don't think you were drunk then.

575
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:21,064
是啊 也许没
Yeah, probably not.

576
00:30:22,784 --> 00:30:24,585
那么...
So...

577
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:28,238
那天晚上你遇到我之前真的有梦到过我吗?
So, did you really have a dream about me before you met me that night?

578
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,875
这很诡异 是吗?
That's weird, right?

579
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,044
在遇到彼此之前都梦到过对方
We both have dreams about each other before we met.

580
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:36,536
为什么我们从来没聊过这个?
Why have we never talked about that?

581
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,872
有很多事情我们都没聊过
There are a lot of things we don't talk about.

582
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:45,697
如果我伤害过你 我很抱歉  
I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.  

583
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:47,137
没有 别担心我
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.

584
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:50,473
- 我很好 - 好吧
- We're good. - Okay.

585
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:52,025
很好
Good.

586
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:55,757
刚才说到要结婚的事...
And congratulations on the whole...

587
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,860
恭喜你啊... 我觉得那很好
eloping thing... I think that's great.

588
00:30:57,894 --> 00:31:02,115
- 祝你们幸福 - 嗯 谢谢
- I hope you guys are really happy. - Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

589
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:08,307
好啦 我要去看看艾米 
Anyway, I'm gonna go check on Amy, 

590
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,966
万一她碰到...
in case she runs into any of those...

591
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,667
可怕的老鼠
Rogue rodents.

592
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,800
淡定点 你没事吧?
Whoa. Slow down. Are you okay?

593
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:57,503
没事 抱歉 我只是有点幽闭恐惧
Yeah. Sorry, I'm just feeling a little claustrophobic.

594
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:00,016
我们出去吧
Let's get out of here.

595
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,833
求求你... 求你让我走吧
Please... please let me go.

596
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,064
不行 我不能让你走 不会有好结果的
I can't. I can't let you go. It's not gonna end well.

597
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:21,763
- 我心意已决 - 让她走
- My mind is made up. - Let her pass.

598
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:25,447
你也许骗得了她 阿奇博尔德 
You may have fooled her, Archibald, 

599
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:26,927
但我很清楚你想干嘛
but I know exactly what you're up to.

600
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:29,008
我只想找一个安全的地方 
All I'm up to is finding a safe haven, 

601
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,867
这样我们就能平静地生活
so we can live in peace.

602
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,171
我曾经希望你能加入
I was hoping you would join our cause.

603
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:35,789
我宁愿去死
I'd sooner die.

604
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,545
那好吧
Very well, then.

605
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,408
这下想好好招待我了吗?  
Care to do the honors this time?  

606
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:48,101
为什么我们不离开这儿呢?
Wh-Why don't we just go?

607
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:51,023
她会跟来的 杀了她
She will follow. Kill her.

608
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,789
- 阿奇博尔德 我不能 - 你答应过的
- Archibald, I can't. - You promised.

609
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,733
- 我知道 但是... - 你爱我吗?
- I know, but... - Do you love me?

610
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:58,694
- 我当然爱你 - 那就杀了她...
- Of course I love you. - Then kill her...

611
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:00,829
不然我会杀了她
Or I will.

612
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,283
妈咪嘛咪哄
Pila metalli.

613
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,868
妈咪嘛咪哄
Pila metalli.

614
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,953
妈咪嘛咪哄!
Pila metalli!

615
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:08,188
雅典娜!
Athena!

616
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:20,314
亲爱的...? 怎么了?
Sweetie...? What's happening?

617
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,433
我刚才死了
I just died.

618
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,888
温迪杀了我
Wendy killed me.

619
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,277
哇 我们这个周末要结婚了
Wow, we are getting married this weekend.

620
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:37,770
是啊
I guess we are.

621
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:39,467
当然啦 我第一次遇见你 
Of course, the first time I met you, 

622
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:40,709
我就知道我们会结婚
I knew we'd get married.

623
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:42,683
- 你才没有呢 - 你在开玩笑吧?
- Y-You did not. - Are you kidding?

624
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:45,666
我真的知道 真的
No, I-I did. I did.

625
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:48,949
我走进弯曲手肘
I walked into the Bent Elbow.

626
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,739
我记得那是个星期二 
I think it was a Tuesday, 

627
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,677
我来到小镇大概一星期了 然后...
I'd been in town maybe a week, and...

628
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:57,197
你出现了 在吧台后面调酒
There you were, mixing a drink behind the bar.

629
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:58,777
然后 我...
And I...

630
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,118
我说不清楚 我就是有这个感觉
I don't know, I just had this feeling.

631
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,619
就像...
It was...

632
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:05,809
就像电波扫过我的大脑 我知道
Like a wave crashing over my head, and I knew.

633
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,710
这样的事一辈子只会发生一次
It's the only time that's ever happened to me in my entire life.

634
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,743
我用尽... 用尽全力才控制住自己
It took... all my strength not to just walk over to you

635
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:16,878
没有当场走到你面前向你求婚
and ask you to marry me right then and there.

636
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:19,536
你从没跟我说过这些呢
You never told me that.

637
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:23,307
我... 不想让你觉得我是个怪胎
I-I... didn't want you to think I was a freak.

638
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,745
你是我的怪胎 我喜欢你这个怪胎
Well, you are my freak, and I like it.

639
00:34:27,262 --> 00:34:28,713
我也是
Me, too.

640
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:41,550
我从噩梦中醒来 梦里你有危险
I woke up from a nightmare that you were in danger,

641
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:44,202
我知道那不是梦 那是预示
and I knew it wasn't a dream, it was a vision.

642
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:47,394
所以我很快赶到店里
So I got to the shop as fast as I could.

643
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,821
但是太晚了
I was too late.

644
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:56,108
怎么了?
What happened?

645
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:59,461
你对我女儿做了什么?
What did you do to my daughter?

646
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:01,497
问你妹妹吧
Ask your sister.

647
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,117
这是个意外
It was an accident.

648
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,637
你杀了我的爱人
You killed my love.

649
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:13,058
你应该去死 我要把你千刀万剐!
You deserve to die. I'll kill you as many times as it takes!

650
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,055
妈咪嘛咪哄
Cultrum incalescere.

651
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:20,977
- 爸爸! - 走开!
- Daddy! - Get out of the way!

652
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,988
妈咪嘛咪哄
Cinis Cineris.

653
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:34,846
发生了什么? 他去哪儿了?
What happened? Where did he go?

654
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:39,098
- 对不起 - 你杀了我爸爸
- I'm sorry. - You killed my father.

655
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:44,052
不要想了 让它过去吧 嘘
Let it go, let it go. Shh.

656
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:48,290
深呼吸 嘘
Breathe. Shh...

657
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,048
早晨之前弗雷娅就会死
Freya will be dead by morning.

658
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,810
她们总是同一天死去
They always die on the same day.

659
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:04,270
这是意外
It was an accident.

660
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:07,657
我是想保护她 她想跟他一起走
I was trying to protect her. She was gonna run away with him.

661
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:10,743
你知道她爱他吗?
Did you know that she was in love with him?

662
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:14,330
对不起
I'm sorry.

663
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:16,499
如果你早点告诉我...
If you had told me...

664
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:20,786
她爱他 那我们就能一起救她了
she was in love with him, then together we could have saved her.

665
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,999
但是 你把他们都杀了
And instead, you've killed them both.

666
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:27,409
你知道我从没想过伤害她们
You know I would never hurt the girls on purpose.

667
00:36:27,427 --> 00:36:31,047
但是你确实伤害了她们 因为你又鲁莽又危险
But you did hurt them, because you're reckless and dangerous

668
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,082
你总是做事不经过大脑
and you act without thinking.

669
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,590
滚出去
Get out.

670
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:46,679
我再也不想见到你
I never want to see you again.

671
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,255
就这样
And... that was it.

672
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,153
我再也没见过温迪 
I didn't see Wendy again 

673
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:02,968
直到一个月前她出现在我们门廊上
until she turned up on our porch a month ago.

674
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,637
那... 雅典娜怎么样了?
And... what happened to Athena?

675
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:09,764
她和阿奇博尔德女巫大会里的两个女人
She left town with two women 

676
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:10,674
离开了小镇
from Archibald's coven.

677
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:14,574
我下了咒 因此她们再也找不到东区了
I spelled them so they could never find East End again.

678
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:17,127
我跟踪了她很多年
I tracked her for years.

679
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,884
她在1960年初死了
And she died in the early 1960s.

680
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,218
我很爱那个小女孩
I loved that little girl.

681
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:27,574
我也爱阿奇博尔德
I loved Archibald, too.

682
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:30,393
那个咒语好真实
That spell was so real.

683
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:35,365
就像在几个小时里我把所有事情都经历了一遍
It was like I lived through it all again in a matter of hours.

684
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,252
我能闻到感受到所有东西 我就在那儿
I could smell and taste everything. I was there.

685
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:45,616
但我还是不懂 我为什么这么失控?
But I still can't understand it. How could I have gotten so out of control?

686
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,203
我们内心都有阴暗面 英格丽德 
We all have darkness inside of us, Ingrid, 

687
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,765
即使是我们中最善良的人
even the best of us.

688
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:53,934
即使是你
Even you.

689
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:59,975
伙计们 又有麻烦了
Guys, we have a problem. 

690
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:01,897
这些麻烦还不够?
Besides all the other problems?

691
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:05,428
避风港的墓穴里有一面墙挂满了枝毒
There's an entire wall of ramus mortium in the catacombs of Fair Haven.

692
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:09,032
- 一整面墙? - 枝毒是什么?
- An entire wall? - What the hell is ramus mortium?

693
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,252
- 我们该怎么办? - 有其他人见过吗?
- What are we gonna do? - Has anyone else seen it?

694
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:12,494
没有
No.

695
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,956
我们得抢在别人之前行动
Then we need to do something about it before somebody does.

696
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:58,092
嘿 宝贝 要吃早餐吗?
Hey, sweetie, want to grab some breakfast?

697
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:01,461
不用了 谢谢 我得去工作了
No. Uh, thanks. I should get to work.

698
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:04,465
- 你没事吧? - 没事
- Are you okay? - Yes, fine.

699
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:06,834
待会儿见
I'll see you later.

700
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,027
- 嘿 - 嘿 宝贝
- Hey. - Hey, babe.

701
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:20,413
- 你也宿醉没醒么? - 我比你严重多了
- Are you as hungover as I am? - So much more.

702
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,351
- 疯狂的一晚 是吧? - 非常疯狂
- Crazy night, huh? - Very crazy.

703
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:28,739
嘿 宝贝 我想跟你谈谈结婚这事
Hey. Babe, I kind of want to talk to you about the whole elopement thing.

704
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,399
嗯 我觉得我们应该再等等  
Yeah. Yeah, I think we should wait.  

705
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,627
我也这么觉得
Me, too.

706
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:34,929
是啊 如果我们要结婚 那就好好结
Yeah, if we're gonna do it, let's do it right.

707
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,074
我们要办一个真正的婚礼 有家人和朋友陪伴
We'll have a real wedding, with family and friends.

708
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,957
我就是想说这个
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

709
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,743
你看吧? 就说我们是天生一对了
You see? That's why we're made for each other.

710
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:46,467
弗雷娅?
Freya?

711
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,333
我听到你们要私下结婚?
What's this I hear about an elopement?

712
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:51,113
事实上 我们会等一段时间
Well, actually, we're gonna wait.

713
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,549
我们会在这里结婚 办一个盛大隆重的婚礼
We're gonna do it here, make it big and splashy.

714
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,751
告诉世界我们对彼此的感觉
Tell the world how we feel about each other.

715
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:58,283
很好 我很高兴你们选择了正确的方式
Oh, good. I'm glad you're gonna do it right.

716
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,196
你和你的家人对我来说很重要 弗雷娅
You and your family mean so much to me, Freya.

717
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:05,915
我有一个大计划
I have big plans for you.

718
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:09,519
一定会很棒的
It's going to be wonderful.

719
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:11,154
我好激动
I am so excited.
