00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,770
这里是911  你有什么紧急情况
911 operator. What's your emergency?

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,120
我在天景旅馆
I'm at the Sky View Motel.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,900
我就是来送个东西  你们赶紧派人来
I was making a delivery. You have to send someone.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,690
我觉得他们已经死了
I think they're dead.

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,160
-请慢一点  先生  -我不确定  但是...
- Slow down, sir. - I don't know for sure, but... 

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,550
你先告诉我发生了什么事
You need to tell me what happened.

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,350
有人受伤了吗
Are there people injured?

17
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,330
都是血  到处都是血
There's blood. There's blood everywhere.

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,290
这次的现场一塌糊涂
Well, it's a messy one.

19
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,080
要是不信  可以问问那个
If you don't believe me, ask the pizza

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,750
-送披萨的小伙子  -我知道
- delivery guy there. - Yeah, is he the one

21
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,850
-就是他报的警吧  -没错  他给这里一个房间
- who called it in? - Yeah, he was delivering pizzas

22
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,800
送披萨的外卖
to, uh, one of the rooms nearby.

23
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,740
114号房门半掩着  他就往里望了一眼
The door to 114 was ajar, so he looked in.

24
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,120
-现场怎样  -两名死者
- What do we have? - Two victims.

25
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,450
-史密斯夫妇  -真有创意[调侃已有电影《史密斯夫妇》]
- Mr. And Mrs. Smith. - Oh, that's original.

26
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,900
有人认识他们吗
Anybody know who they really are?

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,650
没有
No.

28
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,190
我也不明白他们到底作了什么孽
And I don't know what they did to deserve this.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,190
...63... 64... 65...

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,510
66, 67...

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,180
68... 69... 70...

32
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,940
-71  72  -你在干嘛  大卫
- 71, 72... - Talk to me, David.

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,280
我想确定到底有多少处刺伤
I'm trying to determine the number of stab wounds.

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,670
说实话  实在是数不过来
But, frankly, there are just too many to count.

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,210
这场景真是令人惴惴
This is disturbing.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,710
等等
Hey, wait a minute.

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,940
不是骗你们  我觉得我来过这儿
You know something? I've been here.

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,940
没错  之前我们也来这条街上处理过一起过量吸毒的案子
Yeah, we had that OD out on the street a while back.

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,550
也是在旅馆里  但我是说这间房间
In the motel, but I mean, in this room-- this exact one.

40
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,760
我来过这儿
I-I've been here.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,200
114号房间
Room 114.

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,530
我记得从这个窗户看出去的霓虹灯
I remember the view of the neon from that window.

43
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,550
-就是这个  -没错
- This is it. - You're right.

44
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,700
我们来过这儿  是桩肢解案
We have been here before. Yeah, it was a

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,060
被害男性二十出头的样子
dismemberment murder; victim was in his 20s.It was about, 

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,530
-大概是两个月前  -不  我觉得是最近的事儿
- uh, two months ago. - No, I think it was more recent.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,160
是另一对夫妇  妻子在睡梦中
It was another couple, but the woman was bludgeoned...

48
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,150
被袭击那次
in her sleep.

49
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,880
我很确定是肢解那次
I am pretty sure it was the dismemberment.

50
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,730
抱歉打断你们  可我觉得你们都是对的
I'm sorry, but-but you're both right.

51
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,230
我来过这儿两次了
I've been here twice before,

52
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,270
第一次是肢解  然后是那对夫妻
once for the dismemberment and again for the couple.

53
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,240
现在是第三次
And now this.

54
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,750
不觉得这间房有股异样的感觉吗
Anybody else getting a really bad feeling about this place?

55
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,540
是啊  绝对是世界上最不详的客房了
Yeah... yeah, this the world's most unlucky motel room.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,220
《犯罪现场调查》  第十四季第九集

57
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,630
三起案子都发生在
All right, that's three murder scenes

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,030
同一个现场
all in the same spot.

59
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,450
肯定有联系  你觉得呢
They got to be related, don't you think?

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,890
也许被害人之间有某些相通之处
Maybe there's a connection between the victims

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,650
又或者凶手有某种病态的偏好
or the killer has a weird fixation of some kind.

62
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,300
我暂时没法回想之前的案子
I don't think I'm ready to talk about past crimes yet.

63
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,550
得先把精力放在这个上
Have to focus on this one first.

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,430
我明白
Yeah, I hear you.

65
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,760
我来处理浴室
I'll take the bathroom.

66
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,490
你管理这里多少时间
So, how long have you been manager here?

67
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,550
从我会走路时我就在管了
Uh, since about the time I learned to walk.

68
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,580
我父母造的这家宾馆  我就在这儿长大的
My parents built this place, so... I grew up here.

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,180
现在都是我的了
All mine now.

70
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,060
你觉得谁比较可疑  可能是凶手
Do you have any idea who might've done this?

71
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
这不是你们的活吗
Isn't that your business to figure that out?

72
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,450
虽然我们不是百乐宫[维加斯著名酒店赌场]  但是...
I mean, I know we're not the Bellagio, but...

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,930
如果我不得不还要因此降价
if I have to drop the rates any lower,

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,460
那我还不如把这地方封起来算了
I might as well just board the place up.

75
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,060
也是  所以你这里大概有二十间屋子
So, you got about, what, uh, 20 rooms here?

76
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,210
说说都什么样的人住在这里
Tell me about the people who stay in them.

77
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,470
就跟价格牌上写的那样  有人过夜就走
It's like the sign says. I mean, by the night,

78
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,830
有人一待一周或者一个月
by the week and by the month.

79
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,580
我需要住客名单
I'm gonna need a list of names.

80
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,110
恐怕不行
Well, that could be a problem.

81
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,480
不是我不愿意给你  只是...
Not that I wouldn't give it, it's just...

82
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,420
我根本就没有
I don't have it.

83
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,010
你也不看看这儿是什么地
Come on, man.

84
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,280
才三十九块钱一晚
The place is 39 bucks a night.

85
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,540
只要有人给现金
If people have cash,

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,190
我又何必管他们叫什么
what do I care about their names?

87
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,820
他们不可能是凶手的  相信我
Look, none of 'em are killers, though-- trust me.

88
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,330
你又怎么知道他们不是
How do you know that?

89
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,590
因为他们都没这个能耐
Well, there's no one here that interesting.

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
芬恩
Hey, Finn!

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
看起来史密斯夫妇昨晚有客人
Looks like the Smiths had a guest last night.

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,450
毛巾是潮的  我还在浴室下水道口
The towels are damp, and I found

93
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,390
找到一根红头发
a red hair in the shower drain.

94
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,670
那跟两个被害者的都不一样
Hmm, that doesn't match either of our victims.

95
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,880
而且水池边上有三支牙刷
And there were three toothbrushes around the sink.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,560
我找到了其中一支的收据
Uh, I found a receipt for one.

97
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,790
是昨晚在街角的药店买的
It's from the drugstore around the corner-- last night.

98
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,510
所以是个不速之客
So a guest they didn't plan on.

99
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,710
还有别的  他们还买了洗发水
There's more. They also bought shampoo

100
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,230
和一把剪刀
and a pair of scissors,

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
剪刀已经不见了
which have since disappeared.

102
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,390
可能就是凶器
Could be the murder weapon.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,210
所以在杀戮开始之前
So there was someone in here

104
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,500
有人在这里  对  那人洗了澡
before the killing started. Yeah, who showered

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,430
而且  我不明白  从牙刷来看
and-- I don't know-- judging from the toothbrush,

106
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,200
那人可能还打算在这里过夜
might've been planning on staying the night.

107
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,550
到底出了什么事儿呢
So what went wrong?

108
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,490
我干这行已经够久了  没什么能再让我震惊的
I've been doing this long enough that nothing

109
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,440
如果一定要说有的话...
shocks me, but if a case could...

110
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,550
就是这案子里纯粹的野蛮和残暴
Just the sheer savagery involved.

111
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,620
每个受害者身上都有超过一百个伤口
More than a hundred stab wounds in each victim.

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,010
完全没必要捅这么多下...
Certainly beyond what was necessary...

113
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,740
如果只是想杀了他们的话
if the goal was to simply kill them.

114
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,480
我能看看吗
Can I see that?

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,020
这远远超出了我们平时看到的
It's, uh, way beyond what we sometimes see

116
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,300
因冲动或极度愤怒而犯罪的程度
with crimes of passion or extreme anger.

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,710
这是精神错乱
This was madness.

118
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,270
他们真的姓史密斯
Their names really were Smith.

119
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,580
理查德和安
Richard and Ann.

120
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,320
据家人说  他们是从弗拉格斯塔夫[亚利桑那州]
According to family, they were in from Flagstaff

121
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,820
为一个古董玩具收集展而来的
for an antique toy and collectibles convention.

122
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,970
这可以解释屋子里的玩偶们
That would explain the dolls in the room.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,920
听起来他们是正经人
Sounds like they were solid people.

124
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,930
她免费在一家养老院做宠物治疗师
She volunteered, ran pet therapy at an old folks home.

125
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,370
他为流浪汉提供帮助
He worked with the homeless.

126
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,730
背景很清白
Squeaky clean.

127
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,710
当然  这也不是第一次清清白白的人
Course, that wouldn't be the first time the...

128
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,970
在拉斯维加斯放纵自己的阴暗面
squeaky-clean have indulged their dark side here in Vegas.

129
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,840
他们可能邀请某个人回了房间
They could've invited somebody back to the room,

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,560
为他们的生活增加一些乐趣
spice up their life a little bit.

131
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,440
如果是这样...
If so...

132
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,940
他们得到的一定比想要的多
certainly got more than they bargained for.

133
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,330
我调出了...
Hey. So, I... pulled the files

134
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,690
另两起旅馆谋杀案的现场资料
for the other two motel murder scenes.

135
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,920
这很奇怪  你不觉得吗
It's weird, don't you think?

136
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,710
一个凶手执着于一间屋子
That a killer would fixate on one room?

137
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,380
你觉得意义是什么呢
What do you think the significance is?

138
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,320
为什么他一定要在那里杀人呢
Why does he feel the need to kill there?

139
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,910
你是在假设
Well, that's assuming

140
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,460
这都是一个凶手做的案
that these are all the work of one killer.

141
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,100
也有可能这些案子没有联系
It could be that there's no connection.

142
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,230
你在寻找根本不存在的作案模式
That you're looking for patterns where there are none.

143
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,740
所以这只是三个完全不相干的凶手
So it's a coincidence that three totally unrelated killers

144
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,930
选了同一间屋子的巧合吗
chose this one room?

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,090
我只是说  我们还不知道
I'm just saying, we don't know yet.

146
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,400
好吧
All right,

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,310
第一起是马克·贝尔
first one Mark Bell.

148
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,650
十一周之前  在他女朋友
11 weeks ago, he stayed

149
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,780
把他赶出家门之后他住在114号房
in Room 114 after his girlfriend kicked him out.

150
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,360
对  我记得  我和芬恩办的这个案子
Yeah, I remember. I worked this case with Finn.

151
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,510
服务员发现他被绑在床上
The maid found him tied to the bed,

152
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,900
{\an8}十一周前

153
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,000
腿被严重划伤  差不多都切断了
severe lacerations to his legs. They were nearly cut off.

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,060
他生生地流血过多而死
He bled to death.

155
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,340
地板上有一把带血的刀
There was a bloody knife found on the floor.

156
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,580
血污太严重没法找到有用的指纹
Too smeared to yield any viable prints.

157
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,150
那时候警探们认为
Detectives, at the time,

158
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,420
那次袭击跟毒品债务有关
thought the attack was related to a drug debt.

159
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,010
他们认为毒贩子在传达某种信息
They thought the dealer was sending a message.

160
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,720
四周前...
Four weeks ago...

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,340
屋子里的第二起袭击
second attack in the room.

162
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,710
艾利克斯和蒂娜·加内兹夫妇俩
Alex and Tina Garnez.

163
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,040
我和尼克处理的这个案子
Nick and I handled this one.

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,970
他们的房子被收去抵债了
Their house had been foreclosed on.

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,000
{\an8}四周前

166
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,890
他们在车里住了好几个月
They were living in their car for months.

167
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,820
加内兹先生终于找到了工作
Mr. Garnez finally got a job.

168
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,580
搬到汽车旅馆也算是生活终于有了起色
Moving to the motel was supposed to be a step up.

169
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,100
那天晚上  他在厕所偷偷抽烟
That night, he was sneaking a cigarette in the bathroom

170
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,030
当时他妻子在睡觉
while his wife slept.

171
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,460
凶手先杀了他妻子
The killer started with his wife...

172
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,000
趁她睡着了  打死了她
...clubbing her while she was sleeping.

173
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,480
他一定是突然发现了加内兹先生居然在厕所里
Then he must've surprised Mr. Garnez in the bathroom...

174
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,220
于是也对他下了毒手
Overpowered him.

175
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,220
但他活下来了
He survived.

176
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,070
现在仍在医院接受治疗
He's still in the hospital recovering.

177
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,290
接着是昨晚
Then last night...

178
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,020
史密斯夫妇
the Smiths.

179
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,370
还觉得这些案子
Still think we're...

180
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,820
只是偶然  没有任何联系吗
dealing with random, unrelated events?

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,390
好吧  芬恩
All right, Finn,

182
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,930
回头到实验室再见
I'll see you back at the lab.

183
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,930
出来吧  把门打开  我知道你在里面
Come on now. Open up. I saw you in there.

184
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,190
我昨晚睡着了
I was asleep last night.

185
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,830
跟我没关系  我已经都告诉警察了
I was not involved. I already told the cops.

186
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,280
好好  没事  我不是...
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's cool. I'm not, uh...

187
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,550
我不是来拷问你的
I'm not here to grill you.

188
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,300
看起来这个地方就是你的家啊
Kind of looks like you like to call this place home.

189
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,490
我猜附近的事你无所不知吧
I'm guessing you see everything that goes on in here.

190
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,600
你没见到什么奇怪的事吗
You...didn't see anything weird?

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,340
最近有没有什么可疑的人出没
Anybody suspicious running around here lately?

192
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,060
我没资格去评价他人的人品
It's not my place to judge another man in that way.

193
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,210
只有上帝有资格
Only God can judge.

194
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,040
那好吧  上帝也会希望你
Right...well, God would want you

195
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,390
帮我找到杀人凶手  不是吗
to help me catch a killer, wouldn't he?

196
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,500
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,050
先生  拜托  拜托  听我说
Sir, please, please, hey, come on, now.

198
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,370
昨晚一对夫妻被残忍地杀害了
A couple was violently murdered last night.

199
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,870
几个星期前是一位女士
A woman a few weeks ago.

200
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,230
在那之前是一位年轻小伙
A young man before that.

201
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,750
全在同一个屋里  他们都是无辜的
All in the same room, all innocent victims.

202
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,290
无辜  这世界上没有谁是无辜的
Innocent? There's no one on this planet who's innocent.

203
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,850
我们都是罪人
We're all sinners.

204
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,570
好吧  不过
Yeah, yeah, well, that-that

205
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,140
这跟我的工作无关
doesn't really help me do my job.

206
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,350
上帝把他们召回了
They were called to God.

207
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,160
这是上帝的计划
That's God's plan.

208
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,730
你的任务已经完成了
Your job is done.

209
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,760
我只是...
Yeah, I just...

210
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,190
最让我后悔从事现场调查这个工作的事儿
Might be my biggest regret about this job --

211
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,360
大概就是因此而知酒店被单有多脏了
I know way too much about hotel bedspreads.

212
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,890
酒店地毯也是  一定不要光脚进门
And hotel carpets. Don't go barefoot.

213
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,220
这里是三个不同犯罪现场的
So, we have three different bedspreads from our...

214
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,500
三床不同的被单
three different crime scenes.

215
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,370
我查了DNA
I ran the DNA.

216
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,970
最左边的被单来自
The bedspread on the left is

217
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,090
第一个犯罪现场
from the very first murder scene.

218
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,790
我敢说这床被单一定在那屋里很长时间了
I'm guessing it lived in that room for who knows how long.

219
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,450
长得我都能从上面找出
Long enough that I was able to identify

220
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,050
二十六组不同的DNA
26 individual DNA profiles.

221
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,490
替代了这床的被单只在这间房里
The replacement bedspread there was only in the room

222
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,000
-呆了七周  -所以DNA少一些
- for seven weeks. - So fewer contributions.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,980
只有十六组
16 of them.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,870
来自昨晚的犯罪现场的第三床被单
And the third bedspread, from last night's crime scene.

225
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,740
只有九组不同的DNA
Yielded only nine contributors.

226
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,480
可是问题是  三床被单上
But here's the thing: one of them, a male,

227
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,490
都有同一位男性的DNA
is common to all three bedspreads.

228
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,670
同一个人  在三起凶杀案发生前
One person, the same person was in the room

229
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,990
这人都进过那件屋
before each of the murders?

230
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,610
你有在DNA索引系统上查到匹配吗
Have you run the samples through CODIS?

231
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,600
现在正在检索
It's running right now.

232
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,300
查到了
Here we go.

233
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,280
兰德尔·威克斯  二十二岁  他的信息
Randall Wicks, 22. He must have

234
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,770
一定是刚刚才被加进系统
just been added to the system.

235
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,020
他两周前被控性侵及殴打罪
There's why -- sexual battery charge two weeks ago.

236
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,520
瞧他在哪里被逮捕的
Look where he was arrested.

237
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,020
{\an8}天景旅馆  114房

238
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,280
同一家旅馆  同一间房间
That same motel. The same room!

239
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,990
我给布拉斯打个电话
I'll call Brass,

240
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,140
叫他发出通缉
get out a broadcast.

241
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,770
英雄也会失势啊  对吧  兰德尔
Oh, how the mighty have fallen, huh, Randall?

242
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,920
你曾经是丹吉尔赌场的男侍夜总会的
You used to be the featured dancer in the Tangiers

243
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,030
首席舞者
All Male Review.

244
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,650
你怎么会把那个工作弄丢了呢
How'd you let that gig slip away?

245
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,350
我不知道
I don't know.

246
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,430
觉得无聊  就辞职了
I got bored, so I quit.

247
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,830
或许你找到了更有意思的活呢
Oh, well, maybe you found something more interesting to do, huh?

248
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,300
-搞什么啊  -在天景旅馆的同一间屋里
- Oh, hey, man, what the hell? - Three separate murders

249
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,400
发生了三件凶杀案
in the same room at the Sky View Motel.

250
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,460
每起案件发生后
Your DNA was found in the room

251
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,850
你的DNA都会出现在那个房间
after each of the crimes.

252
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,530
什么  等等  你是说天景旅馆吗
What? Wait a minute-- Sky View Motel?

253
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,630
是那个114号房间吗
Was that in room 114?

254
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,850
我经常用那个房间
I use that room, frequently.

255
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,940
有业务在身
For business.

256
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,660
这么说  你是牛郎
So... you're a prostitute?

257
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,810
伙计  我可是匹种马
Dude, I'm a stud,

258
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,630
我是让那些沮丧的家庭主妇尝尝
letting frustrated housewives get a taste of something

259
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,290
她们原本想都别想的好滋味
they wouldn't even get close to otherwise.

260
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,180
行了  种马  在114号房
Okay, stud, what about

261
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,590
被你打的那个家庭主妇是怎么回事
the housewife you beat up in room 114?

262
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,240
你不是被指控性侵犯吗
The sexual battery charge.

263
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,640
还是说你们正玩骑马[性交姿势]呢
Or was that just part of the pony ride experience?

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,400
我那是自卫
That was self-defense.

265
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,730
真的
I'm serious.

266
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,140
我是为了保命
I was in fear for my life.

267
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,580
好吧
Okay...

268
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,170
我跟那女的约在那儿见面
I meet this woman there, right?

269
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,260
一开始很正常
Totally normal at first.

270
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,240
正当我们渐入佳境的时候
Then we start getting into it, and...

271
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,780
不知怎么  她突然发起疯来
I don't know, she goes all crazy.

272
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,770
像是产生幻觉一样
Starts hallucinating or something,

273
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,020
对着墙大喊大叫
screaming at the walls.

274
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,830
-太恐怖了  -怎么回事
- Pure freak show. - And why?

275
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,270
是什么引起的
What would make her do that?

276
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,020
我又不是医生  不过...
Well, I ain't a doctor or nothing, but...

277
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,870
肯定是我的床上功夫把她震撼了
must be the sex just blew her mind.

278
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,540
那是  肯定是这么回事
Yeah, that must have been it.

279
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,980
就是个废物  你还有其他想法吗
Well... aside from being a complete tool, what do you think?

280
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,410
他是凶手的可能性还是有的
Well, he still could be our killer.

281
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,760
问题是  我们只掌握了DNA
Well, the problem is, all we have is DNA evidence,

282
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,550
他说了他的DNA怎么会在那个房间的
and we can't disprove his story

283
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,810
我们没法推翻这种说法
of how it got in that room.

284
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,690
不过我们有个目击证人  可以指认兰德尔
Well, we do have an eyewitness who could possibly I.D. Randall.

285
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,460
艾利克斯·加内兹  四周前他妻子被打死了
Alex Garnez, the husband who survived his wife being bludgeoned

286
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,960
他活了下来
four weeks ago.

287
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,450
他有严重的颅脑损伤
He has massive head injuries.

288
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,300
他还在医院呢
He's still in the hospital--

289
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,860
都不知道他现在什么情况
we don't even know what condition he's in.

290
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,170
我找过他的医生了
Well, I talked to his doctor.

291
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,310
她说他心理状况不佳
She said he's struggling psychologically.

292
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,790
自从他有次自杀未遂  他们就一直看着他
They have him on suicide watch after one failed attempt,

293
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,540
不过从生理上来说
but... physically...

294
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,570
他已经恢复了  我们可以去问话
she said he's strong enough to talk to us.

295
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,260
加内兹先生
Mr. Garnez.

296
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,690
我是犯罪现场调查员布洛迪
I'm CSI Brody,

297
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,480
这位是犯罪现场调查员桑德斯
and this is CSI Sanders.

298
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,190
不好意思  我们得跟你谈谈
I'm sorry, but we need to talk to you

299
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,420
有关你和你妻子遇袭那晚的事
about the night that you and your wife were attacked.

300
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,560
你还记得多少
How much do you remember?

301
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,450
我不知道
I don't know.

302
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,730
我…我…
I... I...

303
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,200
我记得她就躺在那儿
I remember her just lying there,

304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,520
就那样躺着
just lying there.

305
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,230
身上周围都是血
And all the... blood around her...

306
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,380
我们是高中情侣
We were high school sweethearts.

307
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,950
你有没有看见伤害你和你妻子的人
Did you see the person who hurt you and your wife?

308
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,830
记得他的长相吗
Do you remember his face?

309
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,000
我能看见他
I can see him...

310
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,340
站在她身旁
standing over her,

311
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,430
一直打她
hitting her over...

312
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,370
一直打她
and over...

313
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,250
可是...
and...

314
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,090
可是我无能为力
and I'm powerless.

315
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,400
我没法制止他
I... I can't stop him.

316
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,720
就像我们之间隔着一堵墙一样
Like there's a wall between us. I...

317
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:05,190
可我还是能听到那恐怖的声音
Yet I can still hear the sickening sound of...

318
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,430
一下
blow...

319
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,700
又一下
after blow.

320
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,830
加内兹先生
Mr. Garnez...

321
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,250
我们想给你看几张照片
we want to... we want to show you some photographs

322
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,040
是人像照
of some faces.

323
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,180
请你告诉我们其中哪个
We need you to tell us if any one of these men

324
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,550
像是你刚刚说的那个人
looks like the man that we've been talking about, okay?

325
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,910
不在这里面
He's not there.

326
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,050
你确定吗
Are you sure?

327
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,440
这些人...
None of these...

328
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,990
都不是杀害我家蒂娜的人
is the man that killed my Tina.

329
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,480
霍奇斯  你给我发了条"911"
Hodges, you texted me "911"?

330
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,770
没错
I did.

331
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,030
什么事儿这么急
What is the 911?

332
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,830
抱歉  是你的嫌犯
Sorry. Your suspect.

333
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,960
他光着脚从汽车旅馆跑出来  对吧
He ran from the motel room barefoot, correct?

334
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,890
但是他的鞋没留下
Yet he left no shoes behind.

335
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,180
有可能他拿走了
He could have been carrying his shoes.

336
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,080
他来不及穿上它们了
He was in too much of a hurry to put them on.

337
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,700
也许吧  但是尼克在浴室
Mm, maybe. But there was a bottle of shampoo

338
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,290
找到了瓶洗发水
that Nick found in the bathroom.

339
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,240
它含有1%的苄氯菊酯
It contained one percent permethrin,

340
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,440
是去虱的配方
formulated to combat head lice.

341
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,080
我已经和医生确认过了
Now, I've checked with Doc.

342
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,380
史密斯夫妇俩谁都没有头虱
Neither of the Smiths were head lice sufferers.

343
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,240
这么说洗发水是给客人准备的
So the shampoo was for the guest.

344
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,440
没错  很有可能就是凶手
Yes. Presumably the killer.

345
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,980
尼克在淋浴间的墙上发现了残留物
Nick found residue on the wall of the shower.

346
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,710
我检测过了  它含有5%的苄氯菊酯
I've tested it; it contained five percent permethrin.

347
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,680
-苄氯菊酯  治头虱的  -不是
- Permethrin, for the head lice. - No.

348
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,970
它的含量是5%  在沐浴乳里
This is five percent, in a body cream.

349
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,240
这是处方药的剂量  用来治疗疥疮
It's prescription strength, used to treat scabies.

350
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,850
我不想表现得不近人情  但是…
I don't want to seem insensitive, but...

351
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,170
不穿鞋  头虱
shoeless, head lice,

352
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,390
还有疥疮  我觉得他是个流浪汉
and scabies-- that all sounds like homeless to me.

353
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,050
理查德·史密斯在弗拉格斯塔夫
Richard Smith worked with the homeless

354
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,440
帮助流浪汉
back in Flagstaff.

355
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,170
他可能是想救济他
He could have been doing

356
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,270
想帮助某个流浪汉
some sort of outreach, wanted to help somebody,

357
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,150
从街上把他们带回来
brought them in off the street.

358
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,430
我已经打听过了
I've already called around.

359
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,440
那边有个收容所叫"街道救星"
There's a local shelter called Street Saviors

360
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,110
上周爆发了一场疥疮
who had a scabies outbreak last week,

361
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,090
他们发的正是同样的处方沐浴乳
where they distributed this very same prescription cream.

362
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,080
太棒了  霍奇斯
Way to bury the lead, Hodges.

363
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,570
这不过是苍海一瓢
That's part of my charm.

364
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,680
哥就是个传说
It's all in the telling.

365
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,950
老样子
The regular.

366
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,410
对  水果味的
Yeah. Fruity.

367
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,630
好  非常感谢
Okay, thanks so much.

368
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,600
我和一对从事
Hey. So I talked to a couple

369
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,730
救济工作的夫妻谈过了
of the outreach workers.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,350
他们之前见过一个人  他叫鲁迪
They saw a guy earlier, a guy named Rudy.

371
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,530
他是这儿的常客了
He's a regular here.

372
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,230
他光着脚  衣服上有血迹
He was barefoot, had bloodstained clothes.

373
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,020
听起来像我们要找的人
Sounds like our boy.

374
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,470
没错  据当地的居民说
Yeah. According to the locals,

375
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,190
他喜欢在这边闲逛  就在桥底下
he likes to hang out here, under the bridge.

376
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,850
有人看见鲁迪了吗
Anybody seen Rudy?

377
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,470
你看见鲁迪了吗
You seen Rudy?

378
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,370
你认识鲁迪吗
You know who Rudy is?

379
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,340
鲁迪在哪儿呢
Hey, where does Rudy stay?

380
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,260
老前辈  您好
Hey, old-timer. Hey, man.

381
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,390
看见鲁迪在哪儿了吗
You seen Rudy anywhere?

382
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,400
鲁迪
Rudy!

383
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,260
怎么了
What's wrong?

384
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,260
你都干了什么啊  老兄
What have you been doing, man?

385
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,600
鲁迪  你得跟我们走一趟
Rudy, you're gonna have to come with us.

386
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,080
鲁迪  你的档案里提到
Rudy, it says here in my files

387
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,210
你在州立医院住过一段时间
that you spent some time in the state hospital.

388
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,630
因为精神问题吗
Had a few psych holds?

389
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,590
是  我是有些问题
Yeah, I have some problems.

390
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,450
你的医生说你是什么病
What did the doctors diagnose you with?

391
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,950
精神分裂症  躁郁症
Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

392
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,240
广泛性焦虑症
generalized anxiety,

393
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,890
-妄想症  -够了
- paranoia... - Well, that's okay.

394
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,870
我们明白了
We get the idea.

395
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,510
你认识这两个人吗  理查德和安
Do you recognize these two? Richard and Ann?

396
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,390
他们是天使
They're angels.

397
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,850
-你什么意思  -他们救了我
- What do you mean? - They rescued me.

398
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,370
-怎么救的  -我在街上  在克雷默街
- How? - I was on the street, out front

399
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,680
一家药店前
of a drugstore on Cramer.

400
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,440
那就在天景旅馆附近
Oh, that's right near the Sky View Motel.

401
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
有时候我去那儿去换零钱  然后我...
I go there sometimes to ask for change, you know, and-and I...

402
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,210
那些人
These guys,

403
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,810
他们抢我钱  还…还…
they jumped me and-and...

404
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,730
还打我
and they beat me,

405
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,990
然后他们拿走了我的零钱和鞋子
and they took my change and they took my shoes.

406
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,810
如果不是理查德和安
And-and it probably would have been worse,

407
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,660
从天而降
except that Richard and Ann came along

408
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,670
赶走了他们
out of nowhere and...

409
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,890
情况可能会更糟
and chased them away.

410
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,910
鲁迪  后来发生了什么
Rudy, what happened next?

411
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,790
我告诉过你们了  他们是天使
I told you, they're angels.

412
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
他们  他们...
They-they-they...

413
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,410
他们问我是否想留在他们的房间  
they asked me if I wanted to stay in their room with them, 

414
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,470
还给我买了牙刷和其他的东西  
and they got me a toothbrush and stuff, 

415
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,830
他们让我洗个澡  清洗一下
and they let me get a shower and get all cleaned up.

416
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,940
洗完澡后发生了什么
Did something happen after the shower?

417
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,890
发生了一些事情  不是吗
Something happened, didn't it?

418
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,270
我不记得了
I don't remember.

419
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,520
得了吧  鲁迪  想想  
Come on, Rudy, think.

420
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,780
用力想想
Think real hard.

421
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,560
不  不
No! No!

422
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,820
有很多娃娃...
There were these dolls...

423
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,320
而且很多很多
a-and there were a whole bunch of them,

424
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,190
它们开始跟我说话  它们都看着我
and they started talking to me and they were looking at me.

425
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
它们在说些什么  鲁迪
What were they saying, Rudy? 

426
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,150
他们说了什么
What did they say?

427
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,800
是娃娃们让你这么做的吗
Did the dolls tell you to do this?

428
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,150
我...
I...

429
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,270
是我干的  不是吗  我用剪刀干的
I did that, didn't I? I did that with the scissors.

430
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,090
我伤害了他们
I hurt them.

431
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,860
那这些人呢
What about these people?

432
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,660
你是不是也伤害了他们呢
Did you hurt them, too?

433
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,290
我不知道
I don't know.

434
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,200
有时候我会想
You know, sometimes I think we forget

435
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,970
我们都忘了人类是既脆弱又复杂的机器
what delicate, complex machines we are.

436
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,740
只要一些神经突触传输不畅
You know, all it takes are a few short-circuiting synapses,

437
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,070
或者髓鞘断裂[均为精神疾病可能的生理原因]
or a breakdown in myelination,

438
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,190
一切就运转失常了
and everything gets thrown out of whack.

439
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,380
朱尔斯  你刚抓住了一个凶手
Jules, you just captured a killer.

440
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,100
我知道  但我为什么感觉很不好呢
I know. Then why do I feel so bad?

441
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,150
因为他看上去是个好人
Because he seems like a nice guy

442
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,510
却无奈命运不公
who got dealt a lousy hand in life.

443
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,450
所以是他杀了史密斯夫妇的  对吗
So we have him for killing the Smiths, right?

444
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,020
那之前两次袭击呢
What about the other two attacks?

445
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,160
我可以仔细检查所有的证据  提出论据
Well, I could go over all the evidence and make a case.

446
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,120
他明显是我们的首要嫌疑犯
He's obviously our prime suspect.

447
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,540
他经常出现在那个区域  
He frequented the area, 

448
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,360
而且他明显很不稳定
and he's obviously unstable.

449
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,680
做得好
Good work.

450
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,730
你花了很多时间在这个案子上
You put some long hours in on this.

451
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,970
为什么不回个家
Why-why don't you go home,

452
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,580
休息一下呢
get yourself some rest.

453
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,580
{\an8}一周后

454
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
冷静  冷静点
Take it, take it easy!

455
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,110
一加一等于二  一个给我一个给你
One plus one is two. One for me and one for you.

456
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,780
二加二等于四
Two plus two is four.

457
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,590
还有更多的  三加三等于六
That's a couple more. Three plus three is six.

458
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,810
直棍和曲棍
Straight and crooked sticks!

459
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,730
走开
Get away!

460
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,460
一加一等于二
One plus one is two.

461
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,700
一个给我一个给你
One for me and one for you.

462
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
二加二等于四  还有更多的
Two plus two is four, and that's a couple more.

463
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,790
一加一等于二  一个给我一个给你
One plus one is two. One for me and one for you.

464
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,280
二加二等于四  还有更多的
Two plus two is four. That's a couple more.

465
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,800
-三加三等于六  -女士
- Three plus three is six. - Ma'am.

466
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,720
直棍和曲棍
Straight and crooked sticks.

467
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,360
放下那个瓶子  听到了吗
You need to drop that bottle, do you hear me?

468
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,750
四加四等于八  海鸥在门上
Four plus four is eight. Seagulls on the gate!

469
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,850
五加五等于十
Five plus five is ten.

470
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,160
你听到我说的了吗
Do you hear what I'm saying?!

471
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,460
放下瓶子
Drop the bottle!

472
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,790
里奇就是不听指令
Ricky doesn't follow directions!

473
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,420
他从来都不听从指令
He never follows directions!

474
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,550
谢谢你  兄弟
Thanks, man.

475
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,310
郑重表示感谢
Seriously, thanks.

476
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,720
-谢谢  -没关系
- Thanks. - All right.

477
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,660
她住在这吗  就这家旅馆吗
Was she staying here? In the motel?

478
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,480
是的  今晚入住的
Uh, yeah, just since tonight.

479
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,070
哪间房
What room?

480
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,080
又来了
It's happened again.

481
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,340
到底怎么回事
How the hell can this be?

482
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,990
我以为我们抓到凶手了
I thought we had our killer.

483
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,770
是我们搞错了吗  朱尔斯
Did we mess up, Jules?

484
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,020
错怪那个流浪汉了吗
Did we make a mistake with our-our homeless guy?

485
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,760
不  鲁迪是有罪的  也许另两件案子不是他  
No, Rudy's guilty, maybe not of all three,

486
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,410
但肯定是他杀的史密斯夫妇
but he definitely killed the Smiths.

487
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,710
那我们怎么解释这个
Then how do we explain this?

488
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,350
我不知道
I don't know.

489
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,830
这可能...没有关联
It has to be... unrelated.

490
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,620
没有关联吗
Unrelated?

491
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,240
过去三个月在同一间房里
Four murders in the same room

492
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,530
发生了四起谋杀
over a three-month period.

493
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,650
那肯定是有关联的  你不觉得吗
That's got to be connected, don't you think?

494
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,950
好吧  很抱歉
All right, I'm sorry.

495
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,580
今晚的主角又是是谁
Look, all right, who are our players tonight?

496
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,210
谁杀了谁
Who are we talking about here?

497
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,300
嫌疑人是名女性
Suspect is a woman,

498
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,770
二十八岁的高中数学教师
28-year-old high school math teacher.

499
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,210
受害者是她的一名学生
Victim was one of her students.

500
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,850
一同待在三十九块钱一晚的脏兮兮的旅馆
Together in a sleazy, $39-a-night motel room.

501
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,190
还有这些内衣  避孕套  性玩具和酒
With lingerie, condoms, sex toys and alcohol.

502
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,000
很好奇在这里发生了什么  对吧
Wonder what was going on here, right?

503
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,740
根据学校的网站显示
Yeah, according to the school website,

504
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,670
她才刚刚被评为年度最佳教师
she was just named Teacher of the Year.

505
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,480
真是当之无愧
I'll bet she was.

506
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,310
这听起来也许很疯狂
So, this may sound crazy,

507
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,240
但是我觉得事情并不是像看起来那样的
but I'm thinking that this isn't what it looks like.

508
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
我可不信这老师睡了她学生
I don't believe that the teacher was sleeping with her student.

509
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,300
没错  你是对的  是很疯狂
Yeah, you're right, that sounds crazy.

510
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,730
听听我在她手机上找到的语音留言
Well, listen to this voice mail I found on her phone.

511
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,900
斯通老师  我是马修
Ms. Stone, it's Matthew.

512
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,960
我不知道该怎么办了
I don't know what to do,

513
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,400
我父母喝醉了在打架
but my parents have been drinking and fighting,

514
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,740
我回不了家
and I can't go home;

515
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,830
我在一家旅馆
I'm at a motel.

516
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,290
但是我很害怕
But I'm scared.

517
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,190
我也不知道还能打给谁
I don't know who else to call.

518
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,850
很抱歉  但是你得帮帮我  拜托了
I'm sorry, but you have to help me, please.

519
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,800
斯通老师  我们很想弄明白
Ms. Stone, we are trying to make sense

520
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,630
在那房间里发生了什么
out of what happened in that room.

521
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,710
但是我们需要你的帮助
But we need your help to do that.

522
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,720
小男生马修一定跟你说了很悲惨的故事
Boy Matthew must have told you a really sad story

523
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,010
才把你诱骗到那家旅馆吧
to lure you to that motel room.

524
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,420
很显然  从他带的那些东西就能看出
Now, obviously, from the items he brought along,

525
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,540
他想跟你发生点什么
he had ideas of getting romantic with you.

526
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,140
房间里还有很多空酒瓶
Now, there were a lot of empty liquor bottles in the room.

527
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,010
他当时喝醉了吗
Was the young man drunk?

528
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,020
他一点酒也没喝
There wasn't any drinking.

529
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,790
我一到那儿就把所有酒都倒洗手池里了
First thing I did was dump all the alcohol down the sink.

530
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,330
我想让马修清楚什么也不会发生
I wanted it clear to Matthew that nothing was going to happen.

531
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,440
他失控了吗
Did he get upset?

532
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,580
是那时他开始胁迫你的吗
Is that when he threatened you?

533
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,970
他永远不会那么做的
He would never.

534
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,220
马修是个...马修是个很好的孩子
Matthew's a... Matthew's a great kid.

535
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,660
他只不过失手敲碎了一个瓶子
He just had a harmless crush, that's all.

536
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,430
他永远不会伤害我的
He would never hurt me.

537
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,010
那你为什么杀了她
Then why did you kill him?

538
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,420
不是我干的
It wasn't me.

539
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,200
真的吗  不是你吗
Really? Wasn't you?

540
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,620
斯通老师  看  看这个
Ms. Stone, look, look at this.

541
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,670
那不是我
That's not me.

542
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,050
这是我  是我的身体  但是我...
I mean, it's me, it's my body, but I...

543
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,560
我无法控制自己
I had no control.

544
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,730
就好像被什么附身了一样
It was like there was something inside me.

545
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,410
我当时
I was...

546
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,330
着魔了...
...possessed.

547
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,710
你当时怎么了
You were what?

548
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,610
着魔了...
...possessed.

549
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,050
我也不知道  我还真有点想要相信她
I don't know. Part of me really wants to believe her.

550
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,240
昨晚视频里咆哮尖叫的女人
I mean, the woman ranting and screaming on that video

551
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,800
跟今天我看到的她完全不一样
from last night was nothing like the woman I met today.

552
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,810
她们完全就是两个人
They were two totally different people.

553
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,060
所以她昨晚的行为是完全反常的
So, her behavior last night was completely out of character.

554
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,700
医院做了毒检吗
Did the hospital do a tox screen?

555
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,840
做了  她是干净的  甚至连一点酒精都没有
Yeah, it was clean. Not even alcohol.

556
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,870
那肯定是那房间了
Then it's got to be the room.

557
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,340
房间让她那么做的
The room made her do it.

558
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,230
像《闪灵》里面[史蒂芬·金小说  后改编成电影]
What, like, The Shining?

559
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,410
"远眺酒店"一样吗[《闪灵》故事发生的酒店]
The Overlook Hotel?

560
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,520
这是联系所有这些谋杀的事物
It's the one thing connecting all of the murders.

561
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,430
而且现在也是唯一的
Right now, it's the only thing.

562
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,740
好吧  那我们让霍奇斯和亨利把仪器弄过去
Okay, so, let's have Hodges and Henry drag their equipment out there

563
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,990
检查下那间房  看他们怎么说吧
and test the room, see what they have to say.

564
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,030
我在空调里检测到了一些高挥发性有机物
I've got some elevated VOCs in the air conditioner,

565
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,570
但都不能解释那些奇怪的行为中的任何一种
but nothing that would explain any of the bizarre behavior.

566
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,330
你那边呢
What about you?

567
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,770
发现什么了吗
You got anything yet?

568
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,260
能给我几分钟先看看吗
Could I have five minutes to look first?

569
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,290
我可真喜欢这脏死了的卫生间
Oh, and I'm very much enjoying the dirty bathroom.

570
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,730
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

571
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,600
很好  今天我肯定浑身水果味了
Great. Now I can smell like a fruit bowl for the rest of the day.

572
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,240
壁橱的内壁上好像发霉了
It looks like they've got mold inside the walls of the closet.

573
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,300
我会取个样
I'm going to have to get a sample.

574
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,990
你那儿有撬杆吗
Do you have the pry bar in there?

575
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,720
我要撬开石膏板
Hey, I have to open some drywall.

576
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,510
你工具箱里面有撬杆吗
Do you have the pry bar in your kit?

577
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,900
霍奇斯
Hodges!

578
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,610
玩我呢
Seriously?

579
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,370
霍奇斯  你在干嘛
Hodges, what are you doing?

580
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,700
我叫你呢
I was calling you.

581
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,410
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

582
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,010
怎么...你怎么了
What, what's going on with you?

583
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,070
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

584
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,910
好吧  要不要在马桶上坐会儿
Okay, look, w-why don't you have a seat on the toilet...

585
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,870
我来带你出去  来
I'm gonna help you out, come here.

586
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,880
我知道你是个什么东西
I can see what you are!

587
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,390
霍奇斯  放开我  疼死了
Hodges, let go of me! That hurts!

588
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,040
不要  霍奇斯
No... Hodges!

589
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,720
不  不
No, no...!

590
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,430
我是亨利·安德鲁斯
This is Henry Andrews.

591
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,520
我现在在天景旅馆114号房
I'm at the Sky View Motel, room 114,

592
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,820
有紧急情况
and I have an emergency.

593
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,560
请马上派警员和医护人员过来
I need police and EMS immediately.

594
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,780
-请让一让  -亨利
- Excuse me... - Hey! Henry!

595
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,410
亨利
Henry?

596
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,450
哥们  你还好吗
Hey, man, you all right?

597
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,870
这儿发生什么事了
What's going on out here?

598
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,110
我也不太清楚
I don't know exactly.

599
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,540
他突然发疯
He just flipped out.

600
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,580
尼克  老实说我真的觉得他要杀了我
Nick, I honestly think he would have killed me.

601
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,680
-霍奇斯  -对  但又不是霍奇斯
- Hodges? - Yeah, but it wasn't Hodges.

602
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,350
我是说  如果你当时有看到他的眼神
I mean, if you would've seen the look in his eyes,

603
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,810
他在里面一定发生了什么
something must have happened to him in there,

604
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,140
发生了使他变成这样的事情
something to trigger this.

605
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,880
-他和你说了什么  -什么都没说
- What'd he say to you? - Nothing.

606
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,620
他的话完全不知所云
Everything that came out of him was unintelligible.

607
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,570
只有咕哝声和咆哮声
It was grunts and growls.

608
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,300
医护人员给他注射了镇定剂
Hey, so paramedics hit him with a sedative.

609
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,770
一旦他们把他带到了医院
Once they get him to the hospital,

610
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,790
我们或许就会知道发生了什么
maybe we'll figure out what's going on.

611
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,860
等  等下  带走他之前  我需要根棉签
Wait, wait, before he goes, I-I need a-a... a swab.

612
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,050
背心里说不定有
Check your vest.

613
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,560
停一下
Hold up.

614
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,180
哥们
Hey, buddy,

615
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,320
我需要取点唾液样本
I just need to get some saliva.

616
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,310
你能帮我吗
Can you help me out?

617
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,810
你能张开嘴吗
Can you open up?

618
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,330
来  张开嘴
Come on, just open up.

619
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,400
这就对了  配合我一下
There you go, help me out.

620
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,870
很好
Good.

621
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,710
带他离开这吧
Yeah, get him out of here.

622
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,820
生命体征正常...
Vitals are good...

623
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,260
-谢谢  医生  我很感激  -不客气
- Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. - You're welcome.

624
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,530
他有说什么吗  他怎么样了
What did he say? How's he doing?

625
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,730
他会好起来的
He's gonna be okay.

626
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,030
他的生命体征都在正常范围
I mean, his vitals are all in the normal range.

627
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,370
也不像有什么身体不适
He doesn't seem to be in any physical distress.

628
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,550
显然那间汽车旅馆的房间有问题
Well, obviously there is something going on in that motel room.

629
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,800
现在霍奇斯也成了在那间房里
Now we need to add Hodges to the list

630
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,720
发疯的一员了  对吧
of people that went nuts in there, right?

631
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,440
流浪汉  老师
Homeless guy, the teacher--

632
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,090
让我对第一位死者好奇起来  马克·贝尔
Makes me wonder about our first victim, Mark Bell.

633
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,650
说不定他也是发了疯
Who's to say he didn't go crazy, too,

634
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,920
狠狠地切了自己的腿
and stab himself in his legs.

635
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,780
如果这些都是真的
If all of this is true,

636
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,080
那个痛失爱妻的人  又怎么说呢
what's it say about the man who lost his wife?

637
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,300
各位
Hey, guys,

638
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,680
你们一定不会相信的
you are not gonna believe this one.

639
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,170
霍奇斯被下药了
Hodges was drugged.

640
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,150
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

641
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,300
迷幻药  我用他的唾液做了酶联测试
LSD-- I did an ELISA test on his saliva.

642
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,450
方式未知  但一定是
Somehow, he must've been dosed

643
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,180
我们在房间里工作的时候给下药了
while we were in the room working.

644
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,520
等下  医院不是给老师和鲁迪都做了
Wait a minute, didn't the hospital do a tox screen

645
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,030
毒理检测吗  检测结果不是阴性吗
on the teacher and on Rudy, and it came back negative?

646
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,550
常规毒检是不会检测迷幻药的
The standard tox panel doesn't test for LSD,

647
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,990
所以他们很可能也被下药了
so they were probably dosed, too--

648
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,530
只是我们无从得知
we just had no way to know it.

649
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,830
但是为什么会有暴力行为
But wh-why the violence?

650
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,540
我发现的分子中混合了很多杂质
The molecules I found were highly adulterated,

651
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,190
混有类似五氯酚的苯甲嗪
and cut with a cyclidine similar to PCP.

652
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,430
可能来自于某个厨房洗涤槽
Probably came out of somebody's kitchen sink.

653
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,440
好的
Okay.

654
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,450
现在我们知道了有致幻物
Now we know what.

655
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,920
去弄清楚它如何到受害者体内的吧
Let's go find out how.

656
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,870
根据亨利所说  这种迷幻药会发蓝光
So, according to Henry, this lysergic acid glows blue.

657
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,920
而且药效很强
And the stuff's potent.

658
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,660
我们要找的也许就是一点点痕迹
We may not be looking for much.

659
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,060
等等  这儿有发现
Wait a minute-- got something over here.

660
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,590
极小的液滴滴
These are tiny drops.

661
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,560
像是喷出来的
It looks like they might've been aerosolized.

662
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,700
看看  发蓝光的液体
Check it out-- covered in blue.

663
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,840
原来就在这儿
This is our source right here.

664
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,800
如果霍奇斯被它喷中的话
If Hodges got sprayed by that,

665
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,890
只可能喷在他的嘴唇或眼睛上
it would only have to land on his lips or in his eye,

666
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,040
然后被迅速吸收
and it would be instantly absorbed.

667
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,470
这儿  让我装进袋里
Here, let me bag it.

668
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,520
等等
Hold on here.

669
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,460
我不认为致幻剂来自那只喷筒
I don't think the LSD was coming from that cartridge.

670
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,710
这里有只软管
There's a hose in here.

671
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,210
没错  它是从隔壁房间的墙壁穿过来
Yeah, and it's coming through the wall from the next room.

672
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,820
奥斯卡  能借用下你的卫生间吗
Hey, Oscar, can we use your bathroom for a second?

673
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,360
你们可不能就这么闯进来
Hey! You can't come in here like this!

674
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,210
当然可以  仔细检查  格雷格
Sure we can. Check it out, Greg.

675
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,930
{\an8}相当理由: 合理确信犯罪嫌疑

676
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,930
这叫"相当理由"  奥斯卡
It's called probable cause, Oscar.

677
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,510
你发现了什么
What do you got?

678
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,550
我找到了喷剂的源头
Found the source.

679
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,480
奥斯卡  我还记得我曾站在那儿
Oscar, I remember standing right there

680
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,620
听你跟我扯上帝的意愿
and listening to you preach to me about God's will.

681
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,740
你所说的就是这个吗
Is this what you meant? Huh?

682
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,270
杀死六个人
Killing six people?

683
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,390
我可没杀任何人
I didn't kill anyone.

684
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,870
你一直在向隔壁的卫生间喷洒致幻剂
You've been spraying LSD all over the bathroom next door.

685
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,760
你该为他们的死负责
You're responsible!

686
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,380
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

687
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,520
上帝知道真相
God sees the truth.

688
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,760
-是啊  -上帝知道我是清白的
- Yes, sir! - God knows my heart!

689
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,120
你知道吗  我不想再听你扯什么上帝
You know what? I'm tired of hearing that.

690
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,710
给我坐下  我会亲自送你去警察局
Sit down, relax. I'm gonna get you a ride.

691
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,040
尼克  看看这个
Nick, take a look at this.

692
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,980
把电视放在衣柜里也太诡异了
That's an odd place for a TV.

693
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,050
是隔壁房间  114号房
That's the room next door-- room 114.

694
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,800
所以不仅给隔壁旅客下药
So not only have you been dosing the people next door,

695
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,570
你还全程录下来了吗
you've been recording it, too?

696
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,630
尼克  我找不到任何录像设备
Hey, Nick, I don't see any recording device.

697
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,510
但这里装有发射机
But there's this transmitter

698
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,500
向别处发射信号
set up to send a signal someplace else.

699
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,780
-那这里的录像是怎么回事  -不知道
- So what's with all the video stuff? - I don't know.

700
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,350
我只知道我不能碰它
I just know I'm not supposed to touch it.

701
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,720
是吗  谁跟你这么说的
Yeah? Who told you that?

702
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,660
特伦特  旅馆经理
Trent, the manager.

703
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,320
他说如果我敢动  他就赶我出去
He said if I did, he'd kick me out.

704
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,550
特伦特·雷格  拿好拘捕令  警察局见
Trent Raeger, got a warrant. See you downtown.

705
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,960
尼克
Hey, Nick,

706
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,800
你快过来看看这个
you gotta come and see this.

707
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,940
这个偷窥狂在偷窥所有房间
Our peeper has been looking at all the rooms,

708
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,020
不只是114号房
not just room 114.

709
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,880
没错  他一直在这享受偷窥的乐趣
Yeah, he's been spending some quality time in here.

710
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,540
这些纪念物...
Hmm. These are all souvenirs...

711
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,670
全是从他喜爱的旅客那里偷来的
from his favorite guests.

712
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,060
你已经偷窥114号房很久了
You've been peeping on room 114 for a long time,

713
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,300
是不是  特伦特
haven't you, Trent?

714
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,480
何时起你决定不再只当一名偷窥狂
At what point did you decide that it wasn't enough to just be a voyeur?

715
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,320
我的意思是  何时起你决定杀人
I mean, when did you decide that you needed to kill people?

716
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,840
不是那样的
It isn't like that.

717
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,240
好吧  那你告诉我究竟是怎样
Okay, then tell me what it's like.

718
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,730
那只是...
Well, it's just about...

719
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,590
观察  你知道吗
watching, you know?

720
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,770
所有入住旅馆的旅客
All the people coming through the motel.

721
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,800
在我小时候  我们一家人很想出外旅行
When I was a kid, we'd get a family on vacation,

722
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,110
我很好奇因为我们从未外出度假过
and I was curious because we never took vacations.

723
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,730
我们从未离开过
We never left.

724
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,940
所以...
So...

725
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,170
我打造了这些能隔墙观看的特别之地
I had these special places where I could look through the walls

726
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,820
来观察他们
watch them.

727
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,970
特别之地
Special places.

728
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,330
录像时代就这么到来
Then the video age came

729
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,590
接着你又升级了你的小爱好  对吗
and you upgraded your little hobby, right?

730
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
那真的很酷
That was pretty cool, too.

731
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,540
尤其是当旅馆每况愈下时  你知道吗
I mean, especially when the motel kind of went downhill, you know?

732
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,340
各种各样疯狂的事接踵而至
That brought all kinds of crazy stuff.

733
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,660
那些超赞的妓女  那些酒鬼
The crack whores, drunk dudes,

734
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,540
打自己的老婆  他们
beating their wives, they...

735
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,830
相信我  这可是场表演
That is a show, believe me.

736
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,690
但是这些也逐渐变得无趣
But even that got a little old and dull,

737
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,750
所以你就给房客喷药来增添乐趣
so you spiced it up by dosing people with drugs?

738
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,110
几个月前
A few months ago,

739
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,500
我在第三大街看到一个服用了迷幻药的人
I saw this guy out on Third, tripping on acid.

740
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,080
感觉他就像疯了一样
He was, like, out of his mind,

741
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,210
真是太...
and it was just so...

742
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,230
太奇怪了
so weird.

743
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,120
我就是那时想到给浴室装那个喷雾器的
And that is when I came up with that rig for the bathroom.

744
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,650
你必须得承认  这相当聪明
You have to admit... it is pretty clever.

745
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,870
真聪明
Clever.

746
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,090
有五个人死了  还有个在医院
Five people are dead, one is in the hospital.

747
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,700
我只是把油洒在了车上
Hey, I just put the gas in the car... okay?

748
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,040
是他们自己撞上的
They're the ones that crashed it.

749
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
老兄
Come on...

750
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,810
你拿到我的带子了  你也看到了
you've got my tapes. You've seen 'em.

751
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,550
第一个家伙  把自己退剁下来那个
That first dude, hacking his legs off.

752
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,160
还有那个老师  还有那个流浪汉
Or that teacher... oh, and the homeless guy.

753
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,920
他本来就邋里邋遢
I mean, the dude is already a total mess,

754
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,970
收留他的那位女士又带那么多玩偶
and then the lady has all those dolls!

755
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,050
这是送上门来的一份大礼啊
I mean, that was a gift.

756
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,400
还有那个可怜的墨西哥人
Or the poor Mexican guy...

757
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,410
杀了自己的老婆
killing his wife.

758
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,670
说实话  我不知道他会那么做
Honestly, I didn't see that coming.

759
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,610
那件事...
I mean, that...

760
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,340
真是...
that...

761
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,650
真是太棒了
...that was awesome.

762
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,570
太棒了
Awesome.

763
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,960
你为什么这么看着我
What are you looking at me like that for?

764
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,850
大家每天上网看的东西
Come on, people go online every day to look at stuff

765
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,510
不就是这样的么
that's just like that.

766
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,950
但你操纵了这一切
But you manipulated this.

767
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,540
是你让这些事发生
You made this happen.

768
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,480
是你让那些人  那些无辜的人
You made these people, these innocent people,

769
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,380
做这些事
do these things.

770
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,500
那又怎样
So what?

771
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,540
有什么区别吗
What's the difference?

772
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,850
你有二十五年的时间来想想有什么区别
Well, you'll have 25 years to life to figure that out.

773
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,500
不过  你得呆在一个小房间
And the weird thing is you're gonna be in a little room

774
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,180
还有人每天二十四小时看着你
with people watching you 24/7.

775
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,830
我听说你很快就可以出院了
I, uh, heard they're going to be discharging you soon.

776
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,770
是的
Yeah.

777
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,170
我觉得我已经好得差不多了
I guess I've healed as much as I'm going to.

778
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,790
我  我过来是想告诉你
Well, I... I came 'cause I wanted you to know

779
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,600
我们已经抓到了那个应该为发生在
that we arrested the man responsible

780
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,510
你和你妻子身上的事负责的人
for what happened to you and to your wife.

781
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,360
他没有亲手杀人
He didn't physically do the killings,

782
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,630
但事情是他一手造成的
but he is responsible.

783
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,570
不好意思  我有点糊涂了
Well, I-I... I'm sorry, I'm a little confused here.

784
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,320
我们逮捕的那个人
The man we arrested...

785
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,810
住在旅馆里
lived in the motel,

786
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,130
给他的几个房客下了药
and he drugged several of his guests.

787
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,410
那天晚上  你妻子睡觉的时候
That night, when your wife went to sleep,

788
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,020
你进了浴室偷着抽了根烟
you went into the bathroom and you snuck a cigarette.

789
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,660
当你在浴室的时候
While you were in the bathroom,

790
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,430
你被喷了一种强劲的致幻药
you were dosed with a very potent psychedelic drug,

791
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:45,280
导致你在性格和行为上大变
and it caused a violent change in your personality and your behavior.

792
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,930
你看到的...那张脸
That face... that you saw...

793
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,520
袭击你妻子的那个人
the man who was hitting your wife...

794
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,540
过一会儿
Uh... in a little while,

795
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,270
警察会过来
there's going to be some police officers coming here,

796
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,800
你得跟他们走一趟  好吗
and you're going to need to go with them, okay?

797
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,950
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,000
我想为我不是"我"的时候说过的话道歉
I want to apologize for anything I may have said while I wasn't myself.

799
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,570
那其实都不是你自己的话或者行为
It wasn't your words so much as your actions, really.

800
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,090
很显然
And, obviously...

801
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,970
我也为我的行为道歉
I apologize for those, too.

802
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,760
接受我的道歉吗
Apology accepted?

803
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,620
是的
Yes.

804
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,030
接受道歉
Apology accepted.

805
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,160
那就好
Good.

806
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,100
那你应该不会想着报复我了吧
Then you won't be trying to get back at me in some way?

807
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,190
当然不会
No, of course not.

808
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,700
但是换了我的话  我就不会喝那杯咖啡
But I wouldn't drink that coffee, if I were you.
