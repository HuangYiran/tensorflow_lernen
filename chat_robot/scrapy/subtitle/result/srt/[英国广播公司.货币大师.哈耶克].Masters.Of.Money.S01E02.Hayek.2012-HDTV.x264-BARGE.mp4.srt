104
0:05:46.34 --> 0:05:50.05
{\pos(192,275)}乍一看  哈耶克关于危机的观点
{\pos(192,288)}At first glance, the Hayek view of the crisis

105
0:05:50.06 --> 0:05:52.09
{\pos(192,275)}看上去有点熟悉
{\pos(192,288)}looks a bit familiar.

106
0:05:52.09 --> 0:05:53.78
{\pos(192,275)}但是别被耍了
{\pos(192,288)}But don't be fooled.

107
0:05:54.78 --> 0:05:57.81
{\pos(192,275)}你可能觉得你以前听过同样的论点
{\pos(192,288)}You probably feel like you've heard this argument before,

108
0:05:57.82 --> 0:06:00.40
{\pos(192,275)}危机部分归因于美联储
{\pos(192,288)}that the Federal Reserve partly caused the crisis

109
0:06:00.42 --> 0:06:02.26
{\pos(192,275)}通过把利率设定在低水平
{\pos(192,288)}by setting interest rates too low,

110
0:06:02.26 --> 0:06:05.77
{\pos(192,275)}鼓励人们过度借款并做蠢事
{\pos(192,288)}encouraging everyone to borrow too much and generally do silly things.

111
0:06:05.78 --> 0:06:07.89
{\pos(192,275)}但是哈耶克和其追随者的论点
{\pos(192,288)}But the argument of Hayek and his followers

112
0:06:07.90 --> 0:06:09.49
{\pos(192,275)}实际上比这更深刻
{\pos(192,288)}actually runs deeper than that.

113
0:06:09.50 --> 0:06:11.53
{\pos(192,275)}他们不仅仅把注入经济中的货币总量弄错了
{\pos(192,288)}It's not just that they got their sums wrong

114
0:06:11.53 --> 0:06:13.65
{\pos(192,275)}以及没有设定合理的利率
{\pos(192,288)}and they didn't set the right interest rate.

115
0:06:13.65 --> 0:06:16.06
{\pos(192,275)}更重要的是  他们压根就不应该
{\pos(192,288)}It's that they shouldn't have been in the business

116
0:06:16.06 --> 0:06:17.69
{\pos(192,275)}介入利率设定这档子事
{\pos(192,288)}of setting interest rates at all.

117
0:06:17.70 --> 0:06:20.25
{\pos(192,275)}这是对国家职能的强烈抗议
{\pos(192,288)}It's this radical rejection of the state's role

118
0:06:20.26 --> 0:06:23.05
{\pos(192,275)}国家调控市场的职能
{\pos(192,288)}in regulating the market

119
0:06:23.06 --> 0:06:26.58
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克和其他自由市场思想家的区别就在于此
{\pos(192,288)}that sets Hayek apart from other free-market thinkers.

120
0:06:27.62 --> 0:06:32.25
{\pos(192,275)}他相信市场的自我调节机制比通常所认为的更好
{\pos(192,288)}He believed the market would do a far better job regulating itself,

121
0:06:32.26 --> 0:06:35.33
{\pos(192,275)}如果政府不予干涉的话
{\pos(192,288)}if only governments would just leave it alone.

122
0:06:35.34 --> 0:06:40.28
{\pos(192,275)}自由市场不会把利率设定在格林斯潘的1%
{\pos(192,288)}Free market did not set interest rates at 1% under Greenspan.

123
0:06:40.30 --> 0:06:43.72
{\pos(192,275)}是政府将其设定在那个水平  这是价格操纵
{\pos(192,288)}That's the government that is doing that. That is price-fixing.

124
0:06:43.74 --> 0:06:46.05
{\pos(192,275)}类似前苏联
{\pos(192,288)}It's kind of the way the old Soviet Union

125
0:06:46.06 --> 0:06:48.65
{\pos(192,275)}操纵面包和天然气的价格
{\pos(192,288)}used to fix the price of bread or gasoline.

126
0:06:48.65 --> 0:06:52.09
{\pos(192,275)}美国政府用同样的方法操纵利率
{\pos(192,288)}The US government fixes interest rates the same way.

127
0:06:52.09 --> 0:06:55.25
{\pos(192,275)}我们需要市场而非政府设定利率
{\pos(192,288)}We need the market to set interest rates, not the government.

128
0:06:55.26 --> 0:06:58.28
{\pos(192,275)}如果市场决定利率  那么利率水平将会更高
{\pos(192,288)}If the market set interest rates they would've been much higher,

129
0:06:58.30 --> 0:07:00.26
{\pos(192,275)}也就不会有现在这些麻烦了
{\pos(192,288)}and we wouldn't have had these problems.

130
0:07:01.30 --> 0:07:05.72
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克对完全自由市场优势的信任
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's belief in the positive power of the unbridled free market

131
0:07:05.74 --> 0:07:08.72
{\pos(192,275)}源于其童年在奥地利的经历
{\pos(192,288)}stems from his childhood in Austria.

132
0:07:08.74 --> 0:07:11.49
{\pos(192,275)}他1899年生于维也纳
{\pos(192,288)}He was born in Vienna in 1899.

133
0:07:11.50 --> 0:07:14.09
{\pos(192,275)}当时维也纳聚集了很多天才
{\pos(192,288)}Then, the city was packed full of intellectuals

134
0:07:14.09 --> 0:07:18.78
{\pos(192,275)}如弗洛伊德和维特根斯坦  哈耶克认识其中很多人
{\pos(192,288)}like Freud and Wittgenstein, many of whom Hayek came to know.

135
0:07:20.18 --> 0:07:23.09
{\pos(192,275)}这些家庭照片并不常见
{\pos(192,288)}These family photographs have not been widely seen.

136
0:07:26.86 --> 0:07:29.84
{\pos(192,275)}他成长的过程伴随着现代世界的形成
{\pos(192,288)}Growing up, he had a keen desire to make sense

137
0:07:29.86 --> 0:07:32.94
{\pos(192,275)}对于这个世界  哈耶克充满了学习的渴望
{\pos(192,288)}of the modern world taking shape around him.

138
0:07:35.42 --> 0:07:37.45
{\pos(192,275)}大概13或14岁的时候
{\pos(192,288)}I must have been 13 or 14

139
0:07:37.46 --> 0:07:39.96
{\pos(192,275)}我开始纠缠认识的所有神父
{\pos(192,288)}when I began pestering all the priests I knew

140
0:07:39.97 --> 0:07:42.61
{\pos(192,275)}让他们给我解释所谓的上帝
{\pos(192,288)}to explain to me what they meant by the word "God",

141
0:07:42.62 --> 0:07:44.14
{\pos(192,275)}但他们都不能很好的解释
{\pos(192,288)}and none of them could.

142
0:07:45.14 --> 0:07:47.57
{\pos(192,275)}于是我不再纠结这事
{\pos(192,288)}That was the end for me of it.

143
0:07:47.58 --> 0:07:50.49
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克成长于一个科学家家庭
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek grew up in a family of scientists.

144
0:07:50.50 --> 0:07:53.57
{\pos(192,275)}像维也纳当时的许多其他天才
{\pos(192,288)}Like many other intellectuals in Vienna at that time

145
0:07:53.58 --> 0:07:56.28
{\pos(192,275)}他们乐于自认为正在承担
{\pos(192,288)}they liked to think they were on a grand quest

146

{\pos(192,275)}揭开宇宙奥秘的伟大使命
{\pos(192,288)}to unwrap the secrets of the universe.

{\pos(192,275)}16岁的时候  他的兴趣转向人类
{\pos(192,288)}By the time he was 16 and he was more interested in people,

{\pos(192,275)}整个社会的发展 而不再是植物
{\pos(192,288)}the development of whole societies, not plants.

154

{\pos(192,275)}但达尔文的进化论已经深入他的脑海
{\pos(192,288)}But Darwin's theory of evolution stuck in his head.

{\pos(192,275)}他认为他看到了新经济学的基本模式
{\pos(192,288)}he thought he saw what a new science of the economy might look like.

{\pos(192,275)}但这对于理解社会如何运转来说
{\pos(192,288)}is not a good model

167
0:09:01.17 --> 0:09:03.69
{\pos(192,275)}不是一个好的模式
{\pos(192,288)}for understanding how social phenomena work.

168
0:09:03.70 --> 0:09:07.64
{\pos(192,275)}我认为这是进化论对他产生吸引的基础

171
0:09:12.98 --> 0:09:16.16
{\pos(192,275)}或者也没有他众多反对者所提到的控制力

172
0:09:16.17 --> 0:09:19.73
{\pos(192,275)}反对者声称的是  "如果经济学是一门科学

{\pos(192,275)}达尔文的进化论也帮助哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}Darwin's theory of evolution also helped forge Hayek's vision

175
0:09:27.10 --> 0:09:28.76
{\pos(192,275)}形成了他对资本主义本身的构想

{\pos(192,275)}对哈耶克来说  市场越自由  其运转就越佳
{\pos(192,288)}And to Hayek the market does most good when it's most free.

{\pos(192,275)}通常是因为我们意图控制市场才导致了市场与我们的期望相反
{\pos(192,288)}It's our desire to control it that most often turns it against us.

{\pos(192,275)}这里的打印机日夜不停的工作
{\pos(192,288)}and its printing presses that were rolling night and day

205
0:11:47.17 --> 0:11:50.33
{\pos(192,275)}批量印制新的钞票
{\pos(192,288)}churning out millions of new bank notes.

206
0:11:50.34 --> 0:11:53.33
{\pos(192,275)}战争留给奥地利政府的是巨额债务
{\pos(192,288)}The war had left the Austrian government with huge bills

207
0:11:53.34 --> 0:11:55.01
{\pos(192,275)}以及低水平的税收收入
{\pos(192,288)}and low tax revenues.

208
0:11:55.01 --> 0:11:58.92
{\pos(192,275)}所以政府命令国家银行印制其所需钞票
{\pos(192,288)}So it ordered the national bank to simply print the money it needed

209
0:11:58.94 --> 0:12:01.53
{\pos(192,275)}用于偿还债券和欠条
{\pos(192,288)}in exchange for bonds or IOUs.

{\pos(192,288)}What the people manning these printing presses,

211
0:12:07.77 --> 0:12:11.21
{\pos(192,275)}以及他们的政治老板此时还不知道
{\pos(192,288)}and their political masters, had yet to really grasp

212
0:12:11.22 --> 0:12:13.85
{\pos(192,275)}他们不仅仅是在印制钞票
{\pos(192,288)}was they weren't just producing money here,

213
0:12:13.86 --> 0:12:15.80
{\pos(192,275)}他们同时也在制造通胀
{\pos(192,288)}they were producing inflation.

214
0:12:15.82 --> 0:12:18.57
{\pos(192,275)}经济中的货币总量上升
{\pos(192,288)}The amount of money in the economy was going up,

215
0:12:18.58 --> 0:12:21.28
{\pos(192,275)}人们有更多的钱可支配
{\pos(192,288)}so people had more money to spend, but of course,

216
0:12:21.29 --> 0:12:24.40
{\pos(192,275)}但是他们所能购买的商品却保持在原来的水平
{\pos(192,288)}the amount of things they could buy had stayed more or less the same.

217
0:12:24.41 --> 0:12:28.80
{\pos(192,275)}因而推高每样商品的价格  产生通胀
{\pos(192,288)}That forced up the price of everything. Inflation took off.

218
0:12:28.82 --> 0:12:31.28
{\pos(192,275)}事实上  奥地利的情况如此糟糕
{\pos(192,288)}In fact, the situation got so bad in Austria,

219
0:12:31.29 --> 0:12:35.05
{\pos(192,275)}通胀率甚至高达10,000%
{\pos(192,288)}the inflation rate hit 10,000%.

0:12:42.26 --> 0:12:45.76
{\pos(192,275)}继续从事工作但仍然负担不起支出
{\pos(192,288)}continued to have them but they could no longer afford,

223
0:12:45.77 --> 0:12:48.49
{\pos(192,275)}例如  女仆和服务员
{\pos(192,288)}for instance, to have maids and servants.

224
0:12:48.50 --> 0:12:52.05
{\pos(192,275)}我们看到这些人  突然间都失业了
{\pos(192,288)}We saw all of these people, all of a sudden, ended up being out of work.

225
0:12:53.13 --> 0:12:56.40
{\pos(192,275)}奥地利经济崩溃  而他们的央行行长
{\pos(192,288)}With their economy going up in smoke, Austria's central bankers

226
0:12:56.41 --> 0:12:59.65
{\pos(192,275)}还在试图饮鸩止渴
{\pos(192,288)}tried to fight fire with fire.

227
0:13:02.41 --> 0:13:06.57
{\pos(192,275)}1922年夏天  物价每月翻番
{\pos(192,288)}By the summer of 1922, prices were doubling every month,

228
0:13:06.58 --> 0:13:09.16
{\pos(192,275)}央行也在用同样的速度
{\pos(192,288)}and the central bank was playing catch up,

229
0:13:09.17 --> 0:13:11.69
{\pos(192,275)}印制越来越大额的钞票
{\pos(192,288)}printing higher and higher denomination bank notes,

230
0:13:11.70 --> 0:13:14.33
{\pos(192,275)}可想而知商店会发生什么了
{\pos(192,288)}just to reflect what was going on in the shops.

231
0:13:14.34 --> 0:13:20.28
{\pos(192,275)}最后  50万克朗仅仅购买一条面包
{\pos(192,288)}In the end, this 500,000 Krone note could maybe buy you a loaf of bread.

232
0:13:20.29 --> 0:13:23.01
{\pos(192,275)}当然  向经济注入越来越多的货币
{\pos(192,288)}And of course, by pumping more and more money into the economy

233
0:13:23.01 --> 0:13:26.61
{\pos(192,275)}只是使事态更加恶化
{\pos(192,288)}they were only making the problem worse.

234
0:13:26.62 --> 0:13:31.40
{\pos(192,275)}对奥地利政府来说  这是一个由他们一手造成的危机
{\pos(192,288)}For Austria's politicians it was all a crisis of their own making.

235
0:13:31.41 --> 0:13:35.01
{\pos(192,275)}一战刚开始 他们就通过加印货币
{\pos(192,288)}They'd been printing money to pay their bills since the start

236
0:13:35.01 --> 0:13:37.49
{\pos(192,275)}偿还债务
{\pos(192,288)}of the First World War,

237
0:13:37.50 --> 0:13:40.97
{\pos(192,275)}他们不理解这样做会导致通胀
{\pos(192,288)}and they didn't understand that that could lead to inflation.

238
0:13:40.98 --> 0:13:43.86
{\pos(192,275)}这是一场由无知引发的危机
{\pos(192,288)}It was a crisis caused by ignorance.

239
0:13:46.01 --> 0:13:49.01
{\pos(192,275)}亲眼目睹奥地利瘫痪
{\pos(192,288)}Having seen Austria brought to its knees,

240
0:13:49.01 --> 0:13:52.76
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克终其一生都对通胀有着本能的恐惧
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek had an almost visceral fear of inflation all of his life.

241
0:13:52.77 --> 0:13:56.33
{\pos(192,275)}通胀仍令当今所有央行恐惧
{\pos(192,288)}It's a fear that central bankers still share today.

242
0:13:56.34 --> 0:14:00.28
{\pos(192,275)}我感兴趣的是  从这段经历里他获得了什么
{\pos(192,288)}What's interesting to me is the lesson he drew from that experience.

243
0:14:00.29 --> 0:14:03.73
{\pos(192,275)}绝大多数人关注政治层面的事实
{\pos(192,288)}Most people focus on the politics, on the fact that the winners of

244
0:14:03.74 --> 0:14:08.57
{\pos(192,275)}一战的战胜国要求奥地利高额赔款
{\pos(192,288)}World War I had imposed impossibly high reparations on Austria.

245
0:14:08.58 --> 0:14:11.04
{\pos(192,275)}但是哈耶克更感兴趣经济层面
{\pos(192,288)}But Hayek was interested in the economics,

246
0:14:11.05 --> 0:14:14.49
{\pos(192,275)}以及奥地利政府所不理解的
{\pos(192,288)}and the fact that the Austrian government simply hadn't understood

247
0:14:14.50 --> 0:14:16.17
{\pos(192,275)}货币的威力
{\pos(192,288)}the power of money.

248
0:14:19.13 --> 0:14:22.16
{\pos(192,275)}而其后发生在美国的事件则让哈耶克得出结论
{\pos(192,288)}What happened next in America led Hayek to conclude

249
0:14:22.17 --> 0:14:25.76
{\pos(192,275)}还有比政府无知更坏的事情 - 傲慢
{\pos(192,288)}there can be something worse than government ignorance - hubris.

250
0:14:25.77 --> 0:14:29.25
{\pos(192,275)}他认为  纵观整个经济危机就能发现
{\pos(192,288)}He thought that entire period showed the calamity that can come

251
0:14:29.26 --> 0:14:33.73
{\pos(192,275)}灾难源自于政府试图用货币的威力来调控经济
{\pos(192,288)}when governments try to use the power of money to shape the economy.

252
0:14:33.74 --> 0:14:35.45

253
0:14:35.46 --> 0:14:40.04
{\pos(192,275)}正步入有史以来最繁荣的时期
{\pos(192,288)}the greatest boom the world had ever seen was taking off.

254
0:14:40.05 --> 0:14:42.92

{\pos(192,288)}telephones and record players.

258
0:14:53.77 --> 0:14:57.05
{\pos(192,275)}开始相信繁荣不会结束
{\pos(192,288)}came to believe the boom would never end.

259
0:15:01.70 --> 0:15:05.97
{\pos(192,275)}回到奥地利 1929年初
{\pos(192,288)}Back in Austria, in early 1929, Hayek was convinced

260
0:15:05.98 --> 0:15:08.01
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克认为政府把一起搞砸了
{\pos(192,288)}they'd got it all wrong.

261
0:15:09.41 --> 0:15:12.16
{\pos(192,275)}他成为了新成立的
{\pos(192,288)}He'd become the director of the recently founded

{\pos(192,275)}不断从繁荣到衰退交替更迭  循环往复
{\pos(192,288)}lurching from one boom and bust cycle to another.

265
0:15:21.74 --> 0:15:24.69
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克称之为"19世纪模式"
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek called it "The 19th Century Pattern",

266
0:15:24.70 --> 0:15:26.94
{\pos(192,275)}尽管这一现象从未成为过去式
{\pos(192,288)}though it was hardly a thing of the past.

267
0:15:30.13 --> 0:15:33.28
{\pos(192,275)}研究中心设在商会
{\pos(192,288)}The Institute was based here at the Chamber of Commerce,

268
0:15:33.29 --> 0:15:36.85
{\pos(192,275)}在这里  哈耶克发展了关于繁荣和衰退的一个新理论
{\pos(192,288)}where Hayek had been developing a new theory of boom and bust,

269
0:15:36.86 --> 0:15:39.29
{\pos(192,275)}以及关于市场的新观点
{\pos(192,288)}along with new thinking about the market.

{\pos(192,275)}他在这里的工作将永久的改变人们

{\pos(192,275)}关于经济的思考方式 - 繁荣然后衰退
{\pos(192,288)}about the economy forever - its ups, and its downs.

272
0:15:58.86 --> 0:16:01.57
{\pos(192,275)}对许多人来说  衰退是无法预测的
{\pos(192,288)}To many, the downs were unpredictable...

273
0:16:01.58 --> 0:16:06.52
{\pos(192,275)}是一种无法预警  就能摧毁经济的自然力量
{\pos(192,288)}a kind of force of nature that might destroy an economy without warning.

274
0:16:06.53 --> 0:16:10.76
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克发展了一个新理论 - 衰退的种子
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek had been working on a new idea - that the seeds of busts

275
0:16:10.77 --> 0:16:13.37
{\pos(192,275)}早在繁荣的时候已经埋下
{\pos(192,288)}were sown during booms.

276
0:16:13.38 --> 0:16:16.40
{\pos(192,275)}因为世界已经越来越相互关联
{\pos(192,288)}Because the world had become increasingly interconnected,

277
0:16:16.41 --> 0:16:19.21
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克开始研究美国的繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek had been studying the American boom to help him

278
0:16:19.22 --> 0:16:22.26
{\pos(192,275)}以助于他预测奥地利经济的潜在走向
{\pos(192,288)}forecast what would happen to the Austrian economy.

279
0:16:24.38 --> 0:16:28.28
{\pos(192,275)}他开始制作关于欧洲经济状况的

{\pos(192,288)}of the European economy.

281
0:16:30.29 --> 0:16:32.33
{\pos(192,275)}大部分都是一些无趣的东西
{\pos(192,288)}Most of it is pretty dry stuff.

282
0:16:32.34 --> 0:16:38.25
{\pos(192,275)}例如纸张产量或月度钢铁出口额
{\pos(192,288)}It's things like paper production or that month's steel exports.

283
0:16:38.26 --> 0:16:41.16
{\pos(192,275)}但是他被公认
{\pos(192,288)}But he is credited with making a rather striking prediction

284
0:16:41.17 --> 0:16:43.16
{\pos(192,275)}在1929年初做出了一个惊人的预测
{\pos(192,288)}in early 1929,

285
0:16:43.17 --> 0:16:47.13
{\pos(192,275)}因为他认为美国股市的繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}because he thought the American stock market boom

286
0:16:47.13 --> 0:16:49.76
{\pos(192,275)}将在短短几个月内结束
{\pos(192,288)}would end in a few months time.

287
0:16:49.77 --> 0:16:51.21
{\pos(192,275)}他是对的

{\pos(192,275)}20年代的喧画上了一个痛苦的句号
{\pos(192,288)}and the '20s roared to an anguished end.

290
0:17:03.13 --> 0:17:06.52
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的预测源于

294
0:17:17.09 --> 0:17:20.80

{\pos(192,288)}by offering them a reliable source of credit.

295
0:17:20.81 --> 0:17:25.84
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的洞见是  经济的大起大落
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's big idea was that the great ups and downs in the economy

296
0:17:25.85 --> 0:17:29.17
{\pos(192,275)}几乎都是从设立这类机构开始
{\pos(192,288)}nearly all started in buildings like this one.

299
0:17:35.50 --> 0:17:39.36
{\pos(192,275)}导致了不可持续的繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}that caused unsustainable booms to develop,

300
0:17:39.38 --> 0:17:42.09
{\pos(192,275)}同时也不可避免会引发衰退
{\pos(192,288)}and cause the inevitable busts.

{\pos(192,288)}which did have the effect of raising the amount of money in the economy.

309
0:18:12.02 --> 0:18:16.81
{\pos(192,275)}但是与倒霉的奥地利央行不同  斯特朗有一个策略
{\pos(192,288)}But unlike Austria's hapless central bankers, Strong had a strategy.

310
0:18:16.82 --> 0:18:19.84
{\pos(192,275)}两者不同之处在于  美联储不是通过购买
{\pos(192,288)}The difference with Austria was that the Fed wasn't buying

311
0:18:19.85 --> 0:18:22.89

{\pos(192,288)}It was doing it to get money into the market

313
0:18:25.14 --> 0:18:26.73

{\pos(192,275)}央行希望鼓励每个人

{\pos(192,288)}was sowing the seeds of an eventual bust.

{\pos(192,288)}The low interest rate told them that America was saving more,

332
0:19:21.09 --> 0:19:23.89

{\pos(192,288)}The crash came when interest rates rose

341
0:19:48.22 --> 0:19:51.57

{\pos(192,288)}and investors started to realise the banks didn't have money

342
0:19:51.57 --> 0:19:53.81

{\pos(192,288)}wailing and crying as they watched their life savings go up in smoke.

346
0:20:04.02 --> 0:20:08.25
{\pos(192,275)}爵士乐时代已经结束了 所有都结束了
{\pos(192,288)}'The Jazz Age is over, all over.'

347
0:20:08.26 --> 0:20:10.29
{\pos(192,275)}对哈耶克来时  教训是显而易见的
{\pos(192,288)}To Hayek the lesson was clear...

0:20:10.30 --> 0:20:13.32
{\pos(192,275)}美联储通过低贷款成本刺激繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}by feeding the boom with cheap credit the Federal Reserve

{\pos(192,275)}你可以讲同样一个故事
{\pos(192,288)}and you could tell a similar story.

352
0:20:25.61 --> 0:20:28.65
{\pos(192,275)}我们当然注意到了英国和美国许多的低息贷款
{\pos(192,288)}We certainly saw a lot of cheap credit in Britain and America

353
0:20:28.66 --> 0:20:31.93
{\pos(192,275)}在崩溃之前的10年内

359
0:20:51.42 --> 0:20:54.73
{\pos(192,275)}这是灾难来临的信号
{\pos(192,288)}It was a sign of the disaster to come.

362
0:21:02.14 --> 0:21:05.81
{\pos(192,275)}还能掌控局面  使其重回正轨
{\pos(192,288)}back down again through, you know, interest rate monetary policy.

363
0:21:05.82 --> 0:21:11.08
{\pos(192,275)}银行系统大规模的暴露在风险下
{\pos(192,288)}As it was the banking system which was massively exposed to this

364
0:21:11.09 --> 0:21:14.41
{\pos(192,275)}以至于人们突然意识到
{\pos(192,288)}and reached a situation where suddenly, people realised

365
0:21:14.42 --> 0:21:16.97
{\pos(192,275)}发生了什么  他们彼此都失去了信任
{\pos(192,288)}what had happened, they lost confidence in each other,

366
0:21:16.98 --> 0:21:20.05
{\pos(192,275)}整个大厦倾倒
{\pos(192,288)}and the entire edifice came crashing down.

{\pos(192,288)}light years ahead of anything dreamt up by Benjamin Strong.

369
0:21:27.06 --> 0:21:30.21
{\pos(192,275)}尽管如此  哈耶克的追随者指责美联储
{\pos(192,288)}But even so, Hayek's followers  say the Federal Reserve

370
0:21:30.22 --> 0:21:35.13
{\pos(192,275)}没有从上世纪20年代的错误中吸取任何教训
{\pos(192,288)}had learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the 1920s.

371
0:21:35.14 --> 0:21:39.53
{\pos(192,275)}本世纪初  美联储在很长一段时期内保持了过低的利率
{\pos(192,288)}In the early 2000s it had kept interest rates too low for too long.

372
0:21:39.54 --> 0:21:43.60
{\pos(192,275)}但是无论是彼时还是此时  都有很多反对声
{\pos(192,288)}But then and now there are plenty who would disagree.

373
0:21:43.61 --> 0:21:47.45
{\pos(192,275)}美联储主席的职责是为了使酒会继续
{\pos(192,288)}The job of the Fed chairman is to keep the party going,

374
0:21:47.46 --> 0:21:49.84

{\pos(192,288)}to spike the punch bowl at all costs.

375
0:21:49.85 --> 0:21:53.17
{\pos(192,275)}但拿开酒杯才是他真正的职责
{\pos(192,288)}Not to take the punch bowl away, which really should be the job.

376
0:21:53.18 --> 0:21:56.73
{\pos(192,275)}我的意思是  美联储应该独立  但实际上它不是
{\pos(192,288)}I mean, the Federal Reserve should be independent, but it's not.

377
0:21:56.74 --> 0:22:00.89
{\pos(192,275)}它的行为始终是在为政府背书
{\pos(192,288)}It acts in concert with the government to try to maintain

378
0:22:00.90 --> 0:22:02.21
{\pos(192,275)}以维持虚假的繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}a phony prosperity.

379
0:22:02.22 --> 0:22:07.21
{\pos(192,275)}利率非常低  一定程度上
{\pos(192,288)}Interest rates are very low, and that was partly promoted

380
0:22:07.22 --> 0:22:12.69
{\pos(192,275)}贸易顺差的国家  特别是中国
{\pos(192,288)}by the fact that the surplus countries, notably China,

381
0:22:12.70 --> 0:22:13.78
{\pos(192,275)}也包括其他国家  促成了这一事实
{\pos(192,288)}but others as well,

382
0:22:13.78 --> 0:22:17.21
{\pos(192,275)}他们持有大量的货币  他们乐于出口
{\pos(192,288)}had a lot of money, they were perfectly happy with exporting.

383
0:22:17.22 --> 0:22:20.69
{\pos(192,275)}在这一大背景下  美国很难调高利率
{\pos(192,288)}It would have been hard to force American interest rates higher

384
0:22:20.70 --> 0:22:23.49
{\pos(192,275)}因为有如此多的货币
{\pos(192,288)}in that environment because there was so much money

385
0:22:23.50 --> 0:22:26.29
{\pos(192,275)}在低利率下流入
{\pos(192,288)}flowing in at low interest rates.

386
0:22:26.30 --> 0:22:30.01
{\pos(192,275)}如果这都是美联储的错误  那欧洲为何
{\pos(192,288)}If it was all the Feds' fault how come Europe had

387
0:22:30.02 --> 0:22:32.29
{\pos(192,275)}也有几乎同样的经历?
{\pos(192,288)}the exact same experience?

388
0:22:32.30 --> 0:22:35.65
{\pos(192,275)}虽然我不能确定 但要说
{\pos(192,288)}It's not the fact of the interest rate policy maybe having been wrong,

389
0:22:35.66 --> 0:22:37.73
{\pos(192,275)}利率政策错了  这不对
{\pos(192,288)}although I'm not even sure I agree on that,

390
0:22:37.74 --> 0:22:40.29
{\pos(192,275)}事实是  西方广泛地解除对金融市场的管制
{\pos(192,288)}but it's the fact that we had these deregulated Wild West

391
0:22:40.30 --> 0:22:43.42
{\pos(192,275)}使我们深陷危机的泥沼
{\pos(192,288)}financial markets that allowed us to get into the crisis we're in.

392
0:22:44.70 --> 0:22:46.73
{\pos(192,275)}如同我们这次的金融危机
{\pos(192,288)}Like our own financial collapse,

{\pos(192,275)}全世界都感受到了1929年危机的后果
{\pos(192,288)}the consequences of the 1929 crash were felt across the world.

{\pos(192,288)}A string of banking crises followed,

395
0:22:53.61 --> 0:22:58.01
{\pos(192,275)}美国和大部分欧洲国家发生恐怖的大衰退
{\pos(192,288)}and a terrible depression in America and much of Europe.

396
0:22:58.02 --> 0:22:59.65
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克坚持说这都是
{\pos(192,288)}Again, Hayek said it was all down

397
0:22:59.66 --> 0:23:02.21
{\pos(192,275)}由于在繁荣年代利率太低所导致的

{\pos(192,275)}米尔顿·弗里德曼持完全相反的观点
{\pos(192,288)}came along who argued the exact opposite - Milton Friedman.

400
0:23:10.22 --> 0:23:11.93
{\pos(192,275)}他认为美联储
{\pos(192,288)}He said the Federal Reserve

401
0:23:11.94 --> 0:23:15.73
{\pos(192,275)}没有为经济系统注入足够多的货币
{\pos(192,288)}had not pumped too much money into the system, but too little.

{\pos(192,275)}至今  大部分政治家和经济学家
{\pos(192,288)}That's the version of history that most politicians

403
0:23:19.38 --> 0:23:21.85
{\pos(192,275)}还相信这一历史理论
{\pos(192,288)}and economists still believe.

404
0:23:23.94 --> 0:23:28.81
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克完全错了
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek was absolutely wrong to think that in the catastrophic depths

405
0:23:28.82 --> 0:23:34.60
{\pos(192,275)}他认为上世纪30年代世界经济陷入危机深渊
{\pos(192,288)}of the Great Depression of the 1930s that all that was happening

406
0:23:34.61 --> 0:23:37.05
{\pos(192,275)}是一次清理
{\pos(192,288)}was an unwinding of the malinvestments

407
0:23:37.06 --> 0:23:39.08
{\pos(192,275)}以纠正之前因于鼓励贷款而导致的不当投资
{\pos(192,288)}that had come from a credit boom.

408
0:23:39.09 --> 0:23:43.77
{\pos(192,275)}显然  银行业经历的灾难式崩溃
{\pos(192,288)}Clearly, there had been a calamitous collapse of the banking sector

409
0:23:43.78 --> 0:23:48.06
{\pos(192,275)}也和之前所谓的不当投资行为没有任何关系
{\pos(192,288)}that had nothing to do with the earlier so-called malinvestment.

410
0:23:51.57 --> 0:23:55.01
{\pos(192,275)}面对世界上最糟糕的金融危机  经济学家的问题
{\pos(192,288)}Facing the world's worst financial meltdown, the issue for economists

411
0:23:55.02 --> 0:23:58.57
{\pos(192,275)}和政治家的问题是一致的
{\pos(192,288)}and politicians was the same as it is today...

412
0:23:58.57 --> 0:24:00.60
{\pos(192,275)}我们如何才能赶走衰退?
{\pos(192,288)}how do we make it go away?

413
0:24:00.61 --> 0:24:03.21
{\pos(192,275)}大衰退开始后  哈耶克被邀请
{\pos(192,288)}As the Great Depression began, Hayek was invited to give

414
0:24:03.22 --> 0:24:06.82
{\pos(192,275)}在伦敦经济学院举办一系列的演讲
{\pos(192,288)}a series of lectures here at the London School of Economics.

415
0:24:09.57 --> 0:24:13.32
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克很激动 他一生都希望来这里
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek was thrilled. He'd wanted to come here all his life.

416
0:24:13.33 --> 0:24:16.32
{\pos(192,275)}但是邀请函后附了一个不算隐秘的行程表
{\pos(192,288)}But there was a not very hidden agenda attached to the invitation.

417
0:24:16.33 --> 0:24:18.89
{\pos(192,275)}伦敦经济学院希望借助哈耶克发起反击
{\pos(192,288)}LSE wanted him as part of their fight back

418
0:24:18.90 --> 0:24:22.93
{\pos(192,275)}因为他当时正与其最主要竞争对手剑桥竞争
{\pos(192,288)}against a new, very different strand of economic thinking

419
0:24:22.94 --> 0:24:24.93
{\pos(192,275)}后者发展出一套全新的  非常特别的经济理论
{\pos(192,288)}from their arch rivals Cambridge

420
0:24:24.94 --> 0:24:27.36
{\pos(192,275)}在当时备受关注
{\pos(192,288)}that had been getting a lot of attention.

421
0:24:27.38 --> 0:24:32.36
{\pos(192,275)}提出这套思想的正是凯恩斯
{\pos(192,288)}The man driving that new approach was John Maynard Keynes.

422
0:24:32.38 --> 0:24:36.77
{\pos(192,275)}上世纪30年代 哈耶克与凯恩斯的大辩论
{\pos(192,288)}The grand dispute between Keynes and Hayek in the 1930s

423
0:24:36.78 --> 0:24:41.22
{\pos(192,275)}在今天仍有重大意义 - 它在网络上引起了轰动
{\pos(192,288)}seems so relevant to us today - it's become an internet sensation.

424
0:24:42.94 --> 0:24:47.17
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯先生  哇  太荣幸了
{\pos(192,288)}Lord Keynes, wow, it's, it... it's such an honour.

425
0:24:47.18 --> 0:24:48.73
{\pos(192,275)}确实  先生  请进
{\pos(192,288)}Indeed, sir. Please, just go.

426
0:24:48.74 --> 0:24:51.53
{\pos(192,275)}他们之间思想交锋的超现实再现
{\pos(192,288)}This surreal reinvention of their battle of ideas

427
0:24:51.54 --> 0:24:53.82
{\pos(192,275)}被在线观看了将近200万人次
{\pos(192,288)}has been watched nearly two million times online.

428
0:24:55.14 --> 0:24:56.49
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克?
{\pos(192,288)}Hay-ek?

429
0:24:56.50 --> 0:25:00.94
{\pos(192,275)}不  高人  就像引发爆炸性思考的高人
{\pos(192,288)}No, High-ek, like um, high explosives.

430
0:25:12.85 --> 0:25:16.69
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的对手  凯恩斯是一个重量级的思想家
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's opponent, Keynes, was a heavyweight thinker.

431
0:25:16.70 --> 0:25:20.60
{\pos(192,275)}经济学上看上去有永不停歇的新势力
{\pos(192,288)}The seemingly unstoppable new force in economics.

432
0:25:20.61 --> 0:25:23.09
{\pos(192,275)}他们的争论有点像大卫与歌利亚
{\pos(192,288)}The clash felt a bit like David and Goliath.

433
0:25:25.26 --> 0:25:27.77
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯聪明 成就显赫
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes had two brains.

434
0:25:27.78 --> 0:25:30.84
{\pos(192,275)}他的存在
{\pos(192,288)}It was said of him that he caused more inferiority complexes

435
0:25:30.85 --> 0:25:35.29
{\pos(192,275)}让同龄人感到瑜亮之卑
{\pos(192,288)}with justification than anyone else in his generation.

436
0:25:35.30 --> 0:25:39.60
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克还寂寂无闻 他比凯恩斯年轻16岁
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek was not known. He was 16 years younger than Keynes.

437
0:25:39.61 --> 0:25:42.49
{\pos(192,275)}他们初次见面的时候就发生了争论
{\pos(192,288)}They fell out with each other on first meeting

438
0:25:42.50 --> 0:25:45.05
{\pos(192,275)}且争论终其一生都没有停止过
{\pos(192,288)}and continued to fight for the rest of their lives.

439
0:25:45.06 --> 0:25:48.60
{\pos(192,275)}随着危机加深  赌注已经不能再高
{\pos(192,288)}As the Depression deepened the stakes could not have been higher.

440
0:25:48.61 --> 0:25:52.45
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克开始给出一些令人不安的警示
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek began with some awkward jabs.

441
0:25:52.46 --> 0:25:58.17
{\pos(192,275)}在后面的黑板上画一些非常复杂的图表
{\pos(192,288)}Drawing in rather confused diagrams on a blackboard behind him,

442
0:25:58.18 --> 0:26:00.60
{\pos(192,275)}他称其为波动
{\pos(192,288)}he described what he called "fluctuations",

443
0:26:00.61 --> 0:26:07.69
{\pos(192,275)}反映了市场每天的变化过程
{\pos(192,288)}which were how the market changed from day to day over time,

444
0:26:07.70 --> 0:26:10.65
{\pos(192,275)}以及  一旦市场被干扰
{\pos(192,288)}and how, if you started interfering with it,

445
0:26:10.66 --> 0:26:13.69
{\pos(192,275)}事情会如何迅速恶化
{\pos(192,288)}how things would go wrong pretty quickly.

446
0:26:13.70 --> 0:26:17.17
{\pos(192,275)}由此开始了宏伟的经济学辩论
{\pos(192,288)}The big economic argument that started here

447
0:26:17.18 --> 0:26:21.29
{\pos(192,275)}从1931年的这个房间  一致持续至今
{\pos(192,288)}in this room in 1931 is still going on today.

448
0:26:21.30 --> 0:26:23.13
{\pos(192,275)}如果一个经济体陷入困境
{\pos(192,288)}If an economy gets into trouble,

449
0:26:23.14 --> 0:26:26.17
{\pos(192,275)}政府是否应该插手干涉?
{\pos(192,288)}should the government step in and try and fix it?

450
0:26:26.18 --> 0:26:31.36
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯说是  哈耶克站在那儿说不是
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes was saying yes. Hayek stood up there and said no.

451
0:26:31.38 --> 0:26:34.60
{\pos(192,275)}这个问题一度如此简单
{\pos(192,288)}For once, it really was that simple.

452
0:26:34.61 --> 0:26:37.13
{\pos(192,275)}对凯恩斯来说  这是一个道德问题
{\pos(192,288)}For Keynes it was a moral problem.

453
0:26:37.14 --> 0:26:39.65
{\pos(192,275)}事实是  失业者
{\pos(192,288)}The fact was there were people unemployed

454
0:26:39.66 --> 0:26:41.89
{\pos(192,275)}理应找回工作
{\pos(192,288)}and therefore they should be put back to work,

455
0:26:41.90 --> 0:26:44.01
{\pos(192,275)}至于怎么找回  并不重要
{\pos(192,288)}and it didn't really matter how you did it.

456
0:26:44.02 --> 0:26:47.21
{\pos(192,275)}对哈耶克来说  则是一件完全不同的事情
{\pos(192,288)}For Hayek, it was a different thing.

457
0:26:47.22 --> 0:26:51.29
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克认为我们对经济的理解不够
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek concluded that we really didn't know enough about economics

458
0:26:51.30 --> 0:26:53.57
{\pos(192,275)}以至于像凯恩斯等人的任何尝试
{\pos(192,288)}and that any attempt by people like Keynes

459
0:26:53.57 --> 0:26:55.29
{\pos(192,275)}干涉经济
{\pos(192,288)}to start fooling around with it

460
0:26:55.30 --> 0:26:58.53
{\pos(192,275)}将只会导致非预期的结果
{\pos(192,288)}would only end up with unintended consequences,

461
0:26:58.54 --> 0:27:01.65
{\pos(192,275)}而哈耶克认为这些非预期的结果
{\pos(192,288)}and those unintended consequences, according to Hayek,

462
0:27:01.66 --> 0:27:06.53
{\pos(192,275)}将比问题本身更糟糕
{\pos(192,288)}could be even worse than the problems that were solved.

463
0:27:06.54 --> 0:27:10.73
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克和凯恩斯之间的巨大差异
{\pos(192,288)}The bitter argument between Hayek and Keynes embodied a fault line

464
0:27:10.74 --> 0:27:12.85
{\pos(192,275)}为经济学分出的流派至今仍存在
{\pos(192,288)}in economics that exists to this day.

465
0:27:17.18 --> 0:27:20.81
{\pos(192,275)}这是历史上最伟大的
{\pos(192,288)}It's one of the great academic disputes in the history

466
0:27:20.82 --> 0:27:22.49
{\pos(192,275)}学术辩论之一
{\pos(192,288)}of intellectual thought.

467
0:27:22.50 --> 0:27:25.57
{\pos(192,275)}为今天的左翼和右翼之间的差异定下了基调
{\pos(192,288)}It set the tone for the difference between left and right today,

468
0:27:25.57 --> 0:27:27.77
{\pos(192,275)}也为那些想干预经济的人
{\pos(192,288)}between those who want to intervene in the economy,

469
0:27:27.77 --> 0:27:30.09
{\pos(192,275)}和那些更愿意让经济自行发展的人之间的差异定下了基调
{\pos(192,288)}and those who would prefer to leave the economy alone.

470
0:27:35.18 --> 0:27:38.53
{\pos(192,275)}这是20世纪最重要的学术斗争之一
{\pos(192,288)}It was one of the most important intellectual battles

471
0:27:38.54 --> 0:27:41.73
{\pos(192,275)}当时看来谁获胜是显而易见的
{\pos(192,288)}of the 20th Century, and at the time it was pretty clear who won...

472
0:27:41.74 --> 0:27:43.49
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes.

473
0:27:43.50 --> 0:27:46.13
{\pos(192,275)}1933年  大衰退没有任何结束的征兆
{\pos(192,288)}In 1933, as the Depression showed no sign of ending,

474
0:27:46.14 --> 0:27:48.73
{\pos(192,275)}罗斯福总统策划了一个巨大的公共支出计划
{\pos(192,288)}President Roosevelt instigated a massive public spending programme

475
0:27:48.74 --> 0:27:52.08
{\pos(192,275)}看上去非常凯恩斯主义
{\pos(192,288)}that looked very Keynesian.

476
0:27:52.09 --> 0:27:56.05
{\pos(192,275)}在罗斯福新政下  美国各类基础设施被修建
{\pos(192,288)}Under the New Deal, all kinds of new infrastructure was built

477
0:27:56.06 --> 0:28:02.01
{\pos(192,275)}例如纽约中心的这条高架铁路
{\pos(192,288)}across America, like this elevated railway in the heart of New York.

478
0:28:02.02 --> 0:28:05.77
{\pos(192,275)}罗斯福新政载入史册是因为这是史上第一次
{\pos(192,288)}The New Deal's gone down in history as the first time a country

479
0:28:05.78 --> 0:28:08.49
{\pos(192,275)}正式试图通过政府支出将经济带出困境
{\pos(192,288)}seriously tried to spend its way out of recession,

480
0:28:08.50 --> 0:28:11.97
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克当时就认为这是错的
{\pos(192,288)}but even at the time, Hayek thought that was a mistake.

481
0:28:11.98 --> 0:28:15.73
{\pos(192,275)}他认为经济所需要的是一个清理期间
{\pos(192,288)}He thought what the economy needed was a period of cleansing.

482
0:28:15.74 --> 0:28:18.65
{\pos(192,275)}淘汰繁荣时期的错误投资
{\pos(192,288)}Get past all that bad investment from the boom,

483
0:28:18.66 --> 0:28:22.46
{\pos(192,275)}摆脱孱弱的企业  留下最健康的
{\pos(192,288)}get rid of all the weak businesses, let the fittest survive.

484
0:28:24.06 --> 0:28:26.89
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克认为罗斯福新政是一种人工兴奋剂
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek saw the New Deal as an artificial stimulant

485
0:28:26.90 --> 0:28:31.69
{\pos(192,275)}妨碍了市场原本具有的系统自愈能力
{\pos(192,288)}preventing the market naturally healing its damaged ecosystem.

486
0:28:31.70 --> 0:28:35.32
{\pos(192,275)}政府与其干预市场不如退出
{\pos(192,288)}Rather than stepping in, government should step back

487
0:28:35.33 --> 0:28:37.42
{\pos(192,275)}让经济衰退自行其道
{\pos(192,288)}and let the recession do its job.

488
0:28:39.38 --> 0:28:44.13
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克认为衰退才是回归正常
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek thought that the recession was the return to normalcy.

489
0:28:44.14 --> 0:28:48.36
{\pos(192,275)}繁荣是由于糟糕的政策导致  一旦衰退开始
{\pos(192,288)}That the boom was caused by bad policy, but once the recession

490
0:28:48.38 --> 0:28:51.69
{\pos(192,275)}经济开始回归常态
{\pos(192,288)}started that was the return of the economy to normalcy.

491
0:28:51.70 --> 0:28:55.21
{\pos(192,275)}它将导致部分项目的清算
{\pos(192,288)}It would involve liquidation of certain projects

492
0:28:55.22 --> 0:28:58.09
{\pos(192,275)}这些项目已经启动却无法持续
{\pos(192,288)}that had been starting that were not sustainable.

493
0:28:59.85 --> 0:29:02.49
{\pos(192,275)}但深陷资本主义有史以来最严重危机之中
{\pos(192,288)}But in the depths of capitalism's worst ever crisis,

494
0:29:02.50 --> 0:29:07.05
{\pos(192,275)}政治家们无法理解哈耶克的警世危言
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's tough message was too much for most politicians to swallow.

495
0:29:07.06 --> 0:29:09.14
{\pos(192,275)}他被忽视了
{\pos(192,288)}He was ignored.

496
0:29:12.26 --> 0:29:14.93
{\pos(192,275)}一个世纪中反反复复
{\pos(192,288)}? Going back and forth for a century

497
0:29:14.94 --> 0:29:16.73
{\pos(192,275)}我希望引导市场运行
{\pos(192,288)}? I want to steer markets

498
0:29:16.74 --> 0:29:18.73
{\pos(192,275)}我希望市场自由运行
{\pos(192,288)}? I want them set free

499
0:29:18.74 --> 0:29:21.69
{\pos(192,275)}繁荣和衰退交替始终存在  令人惧怕
{\pos(192,288)}? There's a boom and bust cycle and good reason to fear it

500
0:29:21.70 --> 0:29:23.36
{\pos(192,275)}谴责低利率
{\pos(192,288)}? Blame low interest rates

501
0:29:23.38 --> 0:29:25.01
{\pos(192,275)}不  是野兽精神
{\pos(192,288)}? No, it's the animal spirits... ?

502

{\pos(192,275)}《通往奴役之路》很符合
{\pos(192,288)}The Road to Serfdom really fitted in with the notions

626
0:36:33.77 --> 0:36:37.49
{\pos(192,275)}美国的个人主义观念
{\pos(192,288)}of American individualism and the sense that anybody

628
0:36:41.14 --> 0:36:45.21

{\pos(192,288)}what had gone wrong was going wrong.

{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克提出了另一番愿景  在我看来是非常有说服力的
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek gave an alternative vision which seemed to me to be very cogent.

637

{\pos(192,275)}一言以蔽之  即法制范围内的自由
{\pos(192,288)}What it boiled down to was freedom within the rule of law.

638
0:37:24.02 --> 0:37:26.33
{\pos(192,275)}他想说的
{\pos(192,288)}What he was read to say

639
0:37:26.33 --> 0:37:31.97
{\pos(192,275)}事实上  至上世纪60年代他才表露出
{\pos(192,288)}and actually himself moved to say by the 1960s,

640
0:37:31.98 --> 0:37:37.89
{\pos(192,275)}社会福利制度会把
{\pos(192,288)}was that moving to a social welfare society would eat away

{\pos(192,288)}at the health of democracy.

642
0:37:40.06 --> 0:37:44.60
{\pos(192,275)}我认为这是他的一个失误预测 严重失误
{\pos(192,288)}I think it's one of his failed predictions, badly failed,

643
0:37:44.62 --> 0:37:48.45
{\pos(192,275)}尽管这仍是他思想中一个非常有影响力的论点
{\pos(192,288)}even though it remains an influential part of his thinking now

644
0:37:48.46 --> 0:37:51.81
{\pos(192,275)}仍有大量自由主义者追随

{\pos(192,288)}If you think about the people that would have been

653
0:38:14.33 --> 0:38:18.21
{\pos(192,275)}有时会被定义为茶党
{\pos(192,288)}part of Glenn Beck's audience, sometimes defined as the Tea Party.

654
0:38:18.22 --> 0:38:19.89
{\pos(192,275)}看看我们所做的
{\pos(192,288)}'Look at what we're doing!

{\pos(192,275)}对政府的嘲讽蔓延很广
{\pos(192,288)}There is cynicism about government and it's quite widespread,

658
0:38:30.66 --> 0:38:31.77
{\pos(192,275)}还有许多愤怒
{\pos(192,288)}there's a lot of anger.

659
0:38:31.77 --> 0:38:33.89
{\pos(192,275)}无疑会导致...
{\pos(192,288)}That certainly would feed into...

660
0:38:33.89 --> 0:38:37.08
{\pos(192,275)}刚好  这又有一个大谈特谈大政府危害的人
{\pos(192,288)}Well, here's a guy who talked about the dangers of big government.

661
0:38:37.10 --> 0:38:40.89
{\pos(192,275)}事实上  哈耶克赞同政府
{\pos(192,288)}In fact, Hayek was in favour of governments

662
0:38:40.89 --> 0:38:43.00
{\pos(192,275)}提供一定程度的安全网络
{\pos(192,288)}providing some kind of safety net.

663
0:38:43.02 --> 0:38:46.33
{\pos(192,275)}但是  他的现代追随者不愿意深究这个观点
{\pos(192,288)}But his modern supporters don't like to dwell on that.

664
0:38:46.33 --> 0:38:49.52
{\pos(192,275)}现在比他写书的时候更盛行社会主义
{\pos(192,288)}Well, we have a lot more socialism now than when he wrote it.

665
0:38:49.54 --> 0:38:53.21
{\pos(192,275)}由于长时间以来社会主义悄然而缓慢地体现于经济中
{\pos(192,288)}As socialism creeps in the economy slowly over time,

666
0:38:53.22 --> 0:38:55.25
{\pos(192,275)}许多人才没有注意到它
{\pos(192,288)}a lot of people don't notice it.

667
0:38:55.25 --> 0:38:58.56
{\pos(192,275)}而最终  你将发现你不是在通往奴役的路上
{\pos(192,288)}And eventually, you know, you're not on the road to serfdom,

668
0:38:58.58 --> 0:39:00.12
{\pos(192,275)}你已经被奴役了
{\pos(192,288)}you've arrived at serfdom.

669
0:39:00.14 --> 0:39:03.25
{\pos(192,275)}想想维多利亚时期的英国

670
0:39:03.25 --> 0:39:06.08
{\pos(192,275)}一个无可争议的自由市场
{\pos(192,288)}That was certainly a very free market,

671
0:39:06.10 --> 0:39:09.60
{\pos(192,275)}政府干预少之又少
{\pos(192,288)}there was a minimum government intervention.

672
0:39:09.62 --> 0:39:13.21
{\pos(192,275)}我们是否认为英国的普通市民
{\pos(192,288)}Do we think that the average citizen of England

673
0:39:13.22 --> 0:39:17.16
{\pos(192,275)}在1870年感受到了更大的个人自由呢?
{\pos(192,288)}in 1870 felt a great deal of personal freedom?

674
0:39:17.18 --> 0:39:20.89
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  大量的奴性和阶级屈从
{\pos(192,288)}I think there was a great deal of servility and class deference

675
0:39:20.89 --> 0:39:23.68
{\pos(192,275)}导致这样的事实
{\pos(192,288)}coming out of the fact that the lives of the poor

676
0:39:23.70 --> 0:39:29.97
{\pos(192,275)}穷人完全没有安全感  只有不断讨好富人
{\pos(192,288)}were incredibly insecure and only by constantly flattering their betters

677
0:39:29.98 --> 0:39:33.04
{\pos(192,275)}才能在一定程度上保证生存
{\pos(192,288)}could they have any reasonable assurance of survival.

678
0:39:33.06 --> 0:39:36.49
{\pos(192,275)}所以不 我认为更多的自由和尊严
{\pos(192,288)}So no, I think there's more freedom and dignity

679
0:39:36.50 --> 0:39:40.04
{\pos(192,275)}存在于一个强度适当的福利社会
{\pos(192,288)}in a moderately strong welfare state than there is

680
0:39:40.06 --> 0:39:41.98
{\pos(192,275)}而不是哈耶克幻想中的自由市场天堂
{\pos(192,288)}in the Hayekian paradise of free markets.

681
0:39:47.85 --> 0:39:50.89
{\pos(192,275)}尽管通往奴役之路大获成功
{\pos(192,288)}Despite the success of The Road to Serfdom,

682
0:39:50.89 --> 0:39:55.33
{\pos(192,275)}上世纪五六十年代  哈耶克认为自己被弃之于政治荒原
{\pos(192,288)}in the 1950s and '60s Hayek found himself in the political wilderness.

683
0:39:55.33 --> 0:39:58.56
{\pos(192,275)}西方政府热切拥抱凯恩斯主义
{\pos(192,288)}Governments across the Western world were enthusiastically embracing

{\pos(192,288)}the ideas of Hayek's nemesis from the dark days of the 1930s...

{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯是哈耶克无可避免的魔咒
{\pos(192,288)}John Maynard Keynes.

686
0:40:06.81 --> 0:40:10.04
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯主义成为资本主义新的正统
{\pos(192,288)}It became the new capitalist orthodoxy that governments

687
0:40:10.06 --> 0:40:13.04
{\pos(192,275)}政府藉此成功管控经济
{\pos(192,288)}could successfully manage their economies.

688
0:40:13.06 --> 0:40:15.66
{\pos(192,275)}历史潮流背弃了哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}The tide of history had turned against Hayek.

689
0:40:16.70 --> 0:40:19.21
{\pos(192,275)}他非常抑郁
{\pos(192,288)}He got very depressed.

690
0:40:19.22 --> 0:40:22.64
{\pos(192,275)}人们不再听他的演讲 不再看他的书籍
{\pos(192,288)}People weren't listening to him, they weren't reading his books.

691
0:40:22.66 --> 0:40:27.12
{\pos(192,275)}英国看上去转向左翼
{\pos(192,288)}England seemed to be going left-wing.

692
0:40:27.14 --> 0:40:31.33
{\pos(192,275)}他选择成为英国公民  他发现
{\pos(192,288)}He'd chosen to be British and he looked, from his views

693
0:40:31.33 --> 0:40:37.29
{\pos(192,275)}按照他的经济学观点  一切都错了
{\pos(192,288)}of an economist, and he could see everything going the wrong way.

694

{\pos(192,275)}1974年 哈耶克意外接到了一个电话
{\pos(192,288)}Then in 1974, Esca Hayek got a phone call out of the blue.

695
0:40:43.77 --> 0:40:47.56
{\pos(192,275)}打电话的人正是40年前邀请他去伦敦经济学院演讲
{\pos(192,288)}It was the man who had invited Hayek to the LSE 40 years earlier

696
0:40:47.58 --> 0:40:49.81
{\pos(192,275)}与凯恩斯作对的那位
{\pos(192,288)}to do battle with Keynes.

697
0:40:51.74 --> 0:40:56.81
{\pos(192,275)}莱纳·罗宾斯打电话给我然后问  "你坐稳了么?"
{\pos(192,288)}It was Lionel Robbins who rang me and said, "Are you sitting down?"

698
0:40:56.81 --> 0:40:58.68
{\pos(192,275)}我说  "是的"
{\pos(192,288)}I said, "Yes."

699

{\pos(192,275)}这就像被授予了骑士爵位
{\pos(192,288)}That was like being given a knighthood of the world.

702
0:41:12.54 --> 0:41:15.10
{\pos(192,275)}那是诺贝尔奖的颁奖辞
{\pos(192,288)}That's the Nobel citation.

703
0:41:17.77 --> 0:41:20.56
{\pos(192,275)}斯德哥尔摩  1974年12月10日
{\pos(192,288)}Stockholm the 10th of December 1974,

704
0:41:20.58 --> 0:41:27.68
{\pos(192,275)}诺贝尔奖被授予哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}Alfred Nobel given to Friedrich von Hayek.

705
0:41:27.70 --> 0:41:31.93
{\pos(192,275)}他的生活重新开始了
{\pos(192,288)}His life started off completely again.

706
0:41:31.93 --> 0:41:34.77
{\pos(192,275)}他一直很抑郁  正准备退休
{\pos(192,288)}He'd been depressed, he was coming up to retirement

707
0:41:34.77 --> 0:41:37.25
{\pos(192,275)}突然一切可以重新开始了  这是一个新生
{\pos(192,288)}and suddenly everything started, it was a new life.

708
0:41:37.25 --> 0:41:40.37
{\pos(192,275)}绝对的  一切又重新开始了
{\pos(192,288)}Absolutely... everything took off for him.

709
0:41:50.70 --> 0:41:53.49
{\pos(192,275)}当关于哈耶克的一切重新开始时
{\pos(192,288)}While everything began taking off for Hayek,

710
0:41:53.50 --> 0:41:56.08
{\pos(192,275)}英国陷入了经济下滑
{\pos(192,288)}Britain was sinking into economic decline.

711
0:41:56.10 --> 0:41:58.73
{\pos(192,275)}罢工成为无法改变的事实
{\pos(192,288)}Strikes had become a fact of life.

712
0:41:58.74 --> 0:42:01.89
{\pos(192,275)}战后凯恩斯主义共识已经破裂
{\pos(192,288)}The post-war Keynesian consensus was crumbling.

713
0:42:06.10 --> 0:42:09.08
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克获奖后几个月
{\pos(192,288)}A few months after Hayek won the Nobel Prize,

714
0:42:09.10 --> 0:42:12.60
{\pos(192,275)}保守党选举了一个新领袖
{\pos(192,288)}the Conservative Party turned to a new leader.

715
0:42:12.62 --> 0:42:16.08
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人的上台使得哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}The rise of Margaret Thatcher brought Hayek

716
0:42:16.10 --> 0:42:19.41
{\pos(192,275)}首次站到了主流政治舞台
{\pos(192,288)}into the political mainstream for the first time.

717
0:42:19.41 --> 0:42:22.04
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人一直
{\pos(192,288)}Margaret Thatcher would, from time to time,

718
0:42:22.06 --> 0:42:24.41
{\pos(192,275)}携带将一些写有引言的小纸条
{\pos(192,288)}pull little bits of paper with quotations on them

719
0:42:24.41 --> 0:42:28.00
{\pos(192,275)}放在手袋中  哈耶克就是被引用的其中一位
{\pos(192,288)}out of her handbag and Hayek would be one of them.

720
0:42:28.02 --> 0:42:32.81
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克在20世纪的绝大部分时间都是政治的旁观者
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek had spent most of the 20th century as a political outsider.

721
0:42:32.81 --> 0:42:35.12
{\pos(192,275)}现在他得到了撒切尔夫人的倾听
{\pos(192,288)}Now he had the ear of the woman

722
0:42:35.14 --> 0:42:37.73
{\pos(192,275)}她即将出任英国首相
{\pos(192,288)}who would be Britain's next Prime Minister.

723
0:42:37.74 --> 0:42:39.37
{\pos(192,275)}我认为这是一个巨大的错误
{\pos(192,288)}I think it would be a great mistake

724
0:42:39.37 --> 0:42:43.37
{\pos(192,275)}认为撒切尔夫人像学生一样学习哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}to think of her as studying Hayek like a student would.

725
0:42:43.37 --> 0:42:47.64
{\pos(192,275)}她更像是从哈耶克哪儿获得灵感
{\pos(192,288)}It's more trying to get inspiration from Hayek and casting around,

726
0:42:47.66 --> 0:42:49.64
{\pos(192,275)}带着疑问遍览伟人思想
{\pos(192,288)}ransacking the minds of great men,

727
0:42:49.66 --> 0:42:51.93
{\pos(192,275)}这个伟人正是当时最杰出的人物之一
{\pos(192,288)}of whom he was one of the most prominent,

728
0:42:51.93 --> 0:42:54.85
{\pos(192,275)}所以在某种程度上她淘到了金子
{\pos(192,288)}so that she could somehow get the gold.

729
0:42:54.85 --> 0:42:59.12
{\pos(192,275)}1979年  撒切尔夫人当选首相
{\pos(192,288)}In 1979 Margaret Thatcher was swept to power,

730
0:42:59.14 --> 0:43:01.64
{\pos(192,275)}决定构建一个新英国
{\pos(192,288)}determined to build a new Britain.

731
0:43:01.66 --> 0:43:03.60
{\pos(192,275)}这是方向上的重大变革
{\pos(192,288)}It was a bold change of direction

732
0:43:03.62 --> 0:43:06.64
{\pos(192,275)}从而创建了我们今天生活的世界
{\pos(192,288)}that really did create the world we live in today.

733
0:43:06.66 --> 0:43:12.25
{\pos(192,275)}我们经历了一个政治方向上的重大转变
{\pos(192,288)}We did institute a radical change of policy direction,

734
0:43:12.25 --> 0:43:15.64
{\pos(192,275)}从未真正被逆转
{\pos(192,288)}which has not really been reversed.

735
0:43:15.66 --> 0:43:19.85
{\pos(192,275)}它可能限于泥淖  但从未被逆转
{\pos(192,288)}It may have been muddied, but it hasn't been reversed.

736
0:43:19.85 --> 0:43:25.52
{\pos(192,275)}这和哈耶克在上世纪40年代发表的观点是一致的
{\pos(192,288)}It does chime in with Hayek right back in the 1940s

737
0:43:25.54 --> 0:43:29.49
{\pos(192,275)}说我们现在所走的路
{\pos(192,288)}saying that the path we're on at the moment

738
0:43:29.50 --> 0:43:34.33
{\pos(192,275)}是通向奴役的路  我们需要走出一条不同的路
{\pos(192,288)}is the road to serfdom, and we need to tread a very different path.

739
0:43:36.54 --> 0:43:37.93
{\pos(192,275)}用当时的语言
{\pos(192,288)}In the language of the time

740
0:43:37.93 --> 0:43:40.21
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人开始淡化国家的作用
{\pos(192,288)}Mrs Thatcher began rolling back the state.

741
0:43:40.22 --> 0:43:43.25
{\pos(192,275)}国有企业被私有化
{\pos(192,288)}Government-owned industries were privatised.

742
0:43:43.25 --> 0:43:45.73
{\pos(192,275)}公共支出和税收都在缩减
{\pos(192,288)}Public spending and taxes were cut.

743
0:43:45.74 --> 0:43:48.64
{\pos(192,275)}国家对市场的控制  对价格  工资  股利  汇率的控制
{\pos(192,288)}There was a bonfire of state controls on the market...

744
0:43:48.66 --> 0:43:52.33
{\pos(192,275)}都面临改革
{\pos(192,288)}on prices, wages, dividends and foreign exchange.

745
0:43:52.33 --> 0:43:55.70
{\pos(192,275)}英国开始转向哈耶克的道路
{\pos(192,288)}Britain was moving Hayek's way.

746
0:43:56.70 --> 0:44:00.49
{\pos(192,275)}非常肯定的是  我们跟哈耶克不谋而合
{\pos(192,288)}We were certainly very much on the same wavelength.

747
0:44:00.50 --> 0:44:05.04
{\pos(192,275)}我们没有忙于查阅他的作品  找出我们应该做什么
{\pos(192,288)}We were not busy thumbing his works to find out what we should do,

748
0:44:05.06 --> 0:44:06.81
{\pos(192,275)}因为其作品并不是为政府写的手册
{\pos(192,288)}it was not a handbook for government,

749
0:44:06.81 --> 0:44:09.62
{\pos(192,275)}而是一个普遍的思想
{\pos(192,288)}but it was the same general idea.

750
0:44:12.70 --> 0:44:16.12
{\pos(192,275)}当今世界没有什么比
{\pos(192,288)}Nowhere did today's world emerge more clearly

751
0:44:16.14 --> 0:44:18.93
{\pos(192,275)}保守党和工会的斗争更明显了
{\pos(192,288)}than in the Conservative's battle with the trades' unions.

752
0:44:18.93 --> 0:44:21.29
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人希望
{\pos(192,288)}Margaret Thatcher wanted to put a stop

753
0:44:21.29 --> 0:44:24.08
{\pos(192,275)}停止日益增长的工会权力
{\pos(192,288)}to what she saw as rampant union power.

754
0:44:24.10 --> 0:44:26.52
{\pos(192,275)}但是她面临一个困境
{\pos(192,288)}But she faced a dilemma...

755
0:44:26.54 --> 0:44:30.16
{\pos(192,275)}如何在不引起全体人民反感的情况下做这些?
{\pos(192,288)}"How do you do that without alienating the entire population?"

756
0:44:30.18 --> 0:44:33.25
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的哲学帮助她形成了答案
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's philosophy helped her formulate her answer.

757
0:44:39.93 --> 0:44:43.00
{\pos(192,275)}她希望用自由来包装她的理念
{\pos(192,288)}She wanted to frame the argument in terms of liberty.

758
0:44:43.02 --> 0:44:46.56
{\pos(192,275)}她不愿意说  "工人是可怕的  让我们镇压他们吧"
{\pos(192,288)}She didn't want to say, "The workers are all dreadful, let's squash them."

759
0:44:46.58 --> 0:44:50.18
{\pos(192,275)}她希望说  "工人被他们自己的领导摆平了"
{\pos(192,288)}She wanted to say, "The workers are being squashed by their leaders."

760
0:44:54.77 --> 0:45:00.52
{\pos(192,275)}这跟哈耶克的自由观是完全契合的
{\pos(192,288)}This very much fed into Hayek, and the idea of liberty

761
0:45:00.54 --> 0:45:03.12
{\pos(192,275)}即  你在捍卫劳资关系的同时
{\pos(192,288)}was, you were defending your country here

762
0:45:03.14 --> 0:45:06.02
{\pos(192,275)}也在捍卫这个国家
{\pos(192,288)}as well as the state of labour relations.

763
0:45:07.02 --> 0:45:09.77
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克和撒切尔夫人有许多共同点
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek and Margaret Thatcher agreed on a lot.

764
0:45:09.77 --> 0:45:12.45
{\pos(192,275)}但是也有关键的不同
{\pos(192,288)}But there was one crucial difference between them.

765
0:45:12.46 --> 0:45:15.56
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克认为让市场自由可以阻止
{\pos(192,288)}Whereas Hayek thought you freed the market to prevent power

766
0:45:15.58 --> 0:45:18.41
{\pos(192,275)}权力集中在政治家的手中
{\pos(192,288)}getting too concentrated in the hands of politicians,

767
0:45:18.41 --> 0:45:20.89
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人认为可以采用自由市场政策
{\pos(192,288)}Thatcher thought you could have free market policies

768
0:45:20.89 --> 0:45:24.25
{\pos(192,275)}同时保持中央的一部分权力
{\pos(192,288)}and still keep a lot of power at the centre.

769
0:45:24.25 --> 0:45:27.93
{\pos(192,275)}一边是哈耶克理想  一边是自由市场政治家基于本能的控制欲
{\pos(192,288)}That tension between Hayek's ideal and the controlling instinct

770
0:45:27.93 --> 0:45:32.41
{\pos(192,275)}这中间的鸿沟从未真正消除过
{\pos(192,288)}of even free market politicians never really went away.

771
0:45:33.62 --> 0:45:39.45
{\pos(192,275)}撒切尔夫人有时会忽略
{\pos(192,288)}Where she, I think, missed out sometimes was understanding

772
0:45:39.46 --> 0:45:43.33
{\pos(192,275)}对于机构以及
{\pos(192,288)}the importance of institutions

773
0:45:43.33 --> 0:45:48.41
{\pos(192,275)}社会反抗力量重要性的理解
{\pos(192,288)}and of countervailing power in a society.

774
0:45:48.41 --> 0:45:52.37
{\pos(192,275)}比如哈耶克就会非常了解
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek, for example, was quite understanding about the role

775
0:45:52.37 --> 0:45:55.68
{\pos(192,275)}地方权威  地方市政
{\pos(192,288)}of local authorities and local municipalities

776
0:45:55.70 --> 0:46:00.18
{\pos(192,275)}地方权力中心所扮演的角色，这正是撒切尔夫人所欠缺的
{\pos(192,288)}and local power centres in a way which I don't think Margaret was.

777
0:46:05.54 --> 0:46:08.41
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的政治影响力在1986年达到顶峰
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's political influence reached its height in 1986

778
0:46:08.41 --> 0:46:12.81
{\pos(192,275)}当时撒切尔夫人的政府去除了很多
{\pos(192,288)}when Mrs Thatcher's government swept away much of the regulation

779
0:46:12.81 --> 0:46:15.45
{\pos(192,275)}曾经约束过伦敦的规章制度
{\pos(192,288)}that had constrained the City of London.

780
0:46:15.46 --> 0:46:19.04
{\pos(192,275)}最重大的举措是给予金融市场以自由
{\pos(192,288)}The Big Bang set the financial markets free,

781
0:46:19.06 --> 0:46:20.52
{\pos(192,275)}这使得今天发展出巨大的
{\pos(192,288)}ushering in today's vast

782
0:46:20.54 --> 0:46:23.04
{\pos(192,275)}相互关联的全球金融市场
{\pos(192,288)}interconnected global financial system.

783
0:46:23.06 --> 0:46:27.45
{\pos(192,275)}但是这不是哈耶克真正所期望的自由市场
{\pos(192,288)}But it wasn't really the free market that Hayek wanted.

784
0:46:27.46 --> 0:46:31.21
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的追随者说  脱胎于八九十年代的
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's followers would say the deregulated financial system

785
0:46:31.22 --> 0:46:34.33
{\pos(192,275)}对金融系统的解禁
{\pos(192,288)}that came out of the '80s and '90s played a big role

786
0:46:34.33 --> 0:46:38.81
{\pos(192,275)}在金融危机中起到了重要作用  因为市场只是半自由
{\pos(192,288)}in the financial crisis because it was only ever half free.

787
0:46:38.81 --> 0:46:42.21
{\pos(192,275)}扭曲市场自由的是 所有这些金融机构
{\pos(192,288)}It was distorted by an implicit promise

788
0:46:42.22 --> 0:46:44.37
{\pos(192,275)}背后隐藏的一个隐形承诺
{\pos(192,288)}to all these financial institutions

789
0:46:44.37 --> 0:46:48.21
{\pos(192,275)}出了事  政府会给予救助
{\pos(192,288)}that if things went wrong the government would come to the rescue.

790
0:46:48.22 --> 0:46:51.21
{\pos(192,275)}自上世纪80年代西方开始盛行这样的资本主义
{\pos(192,288)}In the kind of capitalism we've had in the West since the 1980s,

791
0:46:51.22 --> 0:46:56.33
{\pos(192,275)}触发了最近这次危机的金融机构
{\pos(192,288)}the financial institutions that triggered the recent crash

792
0:46:56.33 --> 0:47:00.60
{\pos(192,275)}似乎可以不受任何约束  除了破产
{\pos(192,288)}were free to do anything, it seems, except fail.

793
0:47:00.62 --> 0:47:03.81
{\pos(192,275)}这就是"大到不能倒"
{\pos(192,288)}It was the "Too big to fail problem".

794
0:47:03.81 --> 0:47:07.60
{\pos(192,275)}他们知道这是一个问题
{\pos(192,288)}They knew that it was a question of,

795
0:47:07.62 --> 0:47:11.56
{\pos(192,275)}正面我赢  反面纳税人输
{\pos(192,288)}"Heads I win, tails the tax payer loses."

796
0:47:11.58 --> 0:47:13.77
{\pos(192,275)}如果这是场赌局
{\pos(192,288)}And if that is the bet,

797
0:47:13.77 --> 0:47:18.00
{\pos(192,275)}你参与进来  赌注下得越来越大
{\pos(192,288)}you take the bet and you take it on a bigger and bigger scale.

798
0:47:18.02 --> 0:47:23.00
{\pos(192,275)}他们很清楚  如果他们赌错了
{\pos(192,288)}So they knew pretty well that if they got the gamble wrong

799
0:47:23.02 --> 0:47:26.89
{\pos(192,275)}政府不会眼瞅着他们破产  他们会接管的
{\pos(192,288)}governments couldn't allow them to fail, they'd have to be bailed out.

800
0:47:26.89 --> 0:47:29.49
{\pos(192,275)}这就是错误所在  也是必须被终止的
{\pos(192,288)}That is what is wrong and that is what has to be stopped.

801
0:47:29.50 --> 0:47:31.52
{\pos(192,275)}我们当然发现了
{\pos(192,288)}We certainly have discovered, after the fact

802
0:47:31.54 --> 0:47:33.25
{\pos(192,275)}政府不可能允许银行破产
{\pos(192,288)}that banks are not allowed to fail.

803
0:47:33.25 --> 0:47:36.64
{\pos(192,275)}但这是否就是过度贷款的主要原因呢?
{\pos(192,288)}Was that actually a significant factor in the over-lending?

804
0:47:36.66 --> 0:47:38.73
{\pos(192,275)}我认为证据不足
{\pos(192,288)}I don't think there's much evidence of that.

805
0:47:38.74 --> 0:47:43.93
{\pos(192,275)}现在很明显  大型银行不可能破产
{\pos(192,288)}Now the fact that big banks clearly will not be allowed to fail

806
0:47:43.93 --> 0:47:46.08
{\pos(192,275)}这的确扭曲了我们的系统
{\pos(192,288)}and that is distorting our system.

807
0:47:46.10 --> 0:47:48.54
{\pos(192,275)}但我认为  这不是危机的主要原因
{\pos(192,288)}But I don't think that's the story of the crisis.

808
0:47:48.54 --> 0:47:51.68
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  危机的原因更在于
{\pos(192,288)}I think that the crisis was one more about just a general failure

809
0:47:51.70 --> 0:47:53.18
{\pos(192,275)}在理解风险方面存在一种普遍的错误
{\pos(192,288)}to understand the risks.

810
0:47:55.66 --> 0:48:00.29
{\pos(192,275)}毫无疑问  近30年来 各国政治家
{\pos(192,288)}There's no doubt that in the last 30 years politicians of all stripes

811
0:48:00.29 --> 0:48:04.81
{\pos(192,275)}让市场对社会的影响越来越大
{\pos(192,288)}have let market forces influence more and more parts of society.

812
0:48:04.81 --> 0:48:08.08
{\pos(192,275)}但是  他们和哈耶克最有革命性的观点划清了界限
{\pos(192,288)}But they have drawn the line at Hayek's most revolutionary idea

813
0:48:08.10 --> 0:48:11.25
{\pos(192,275)}-- 将货币本身推向市场
{\pos(192,288)}of turning money itself over to the market.

814
0:48:13.93 --> 0:48:18.41
{\pos(192,275)}想象一个世界  不止一种法定的货币流通
{\pos(192,288)}Imagine a world where we didn't have just one legal currency circulating

815
0:48:18.41 --> 0:48:22.56
{\pos(192,275)}在经济中  不止英格兰银行印发货币
{\pos(192,288)}in the economy, issued by the Bank of England, but dozens of them.

816
0:48:22.58 --> 0:48:26.33
{\pos(192,275)}任何人 一个公司  银行或私人都可以印发
{\pos(192,288)}Anyone - a company, a bank, a private individual could set up

817
0:48:26.33 --> 0:48:29.93
{\pos(192,275)}并拥有英镑的各种版本且自由竞争
{\pos(192,288)}their own version of the pound and they would be free to compete.

818
0:48:29.93 --> 0:48:33.73
{\pos(192,275)}市场决定货币的价值
{\pos(192,288)}The market would determine how much they were worth.

819
0:48:33.74 --> 0:48:37.29
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克知道  哪怕对他自己来说  这都是一个疯狂的建议
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek knew it was a crazy sounding suggestion, even for him.

820
0:48:37.29 --> 0:48:40.00
{\pos(192,275)}但这终将阻止政府
{\pos(192,288)}But it would finally stop governments

821
0:48:40.02 --> 0:48:42.02
{\pos(192,275)}滥用货币的权力
{\pos(192,288)}abusing the power of money.

822
0:48:44.98 --> 0:48:48.70
{\pos(192,275)}在美国  有一个人试图这么做
{\pos(192,288)}In America one man has been trying to do just that.

823
0:48:52.98 --> 0:48:58.74
{\pos(192,275)}他接受了哈耶克革命性的的观点并将其转化为现实
{\pos(192,288)}He's taken Hayek's most explosive idea and turned it in to a reality.

824
0:49:08.37 --> 0:49:12.45
{\pos(192,275)}伯纳德·冯·诺特豪斯自称为货币构建师
{\pos(192,288)}Bernard von Nothaus calls himself a monetary architect.

825
0:49:12.46 --> 0:49:16.14
{\pos(192,275)}美国官方称其为国内恐怖分子
{\pos(192,288)}The American authorities call him a domestic terrorist.

826
0:49:17.81 --> 0:49:21.97
{\pos(192,275)}从某种意义上说 诺特豪斯的遭遇说明了
{\pos(192,288)}For some, what's happened to von Nothaus shows just how seriously

827
0:49:21.98 --> 0:49:26.00
{\pos(192,275)}政府是何等重视  对其垄断货币发行所发起的任何挑战
{\pos(192,288)}governments take any challenge to their monopoly over money.

828
0:49:26.02 --> 0:49:29.49
{\pos(192,275)}经济学是枯燥和无聊的
{\pos(192,288)}Economics is dry and boring.

829
0:49:29.50 --> 0:49:34.16
{\pos(192,275)}但是钱是刺激的  钱的魅力十足
{\pos(192,288)}But money is exciting! Money is sexy.

830
0:49:34.18 --> 0:49:37.52
{\pos(192,275)}你知道  钱是生命力  它关乎人类  关乎梦想
{\pos(192,288)}You know, money's got pizzazz, it's about people and about dreams,

831
0:49:37.54 --> 0:49:39.29
{\pos(192,275)}关乎我们的行为
{\pos(192,288)}about what we do, you know?

832
0:49:39.29 --> 0:49:41.04
{\pos(192,275)}钱是如此美妙
{\pos(192,288)}Money is fantastic!

833
0:49:41.06 --> 0:49:44.81
{\pos(192,275)}这才是我和哈耶克之间真正的联系
{\pos(192,288)}And that's what I really connected with in terms of von Hayek.

834
0:49:44.81 --> 0:49:49.73
{\pos(192,275)}因为他在这里说了人们可以控制
{\pos(192,288)}Because what he said in here was about people taking control

835
0:49:49.74 --> 0:49:52.98
{\pos(192,275)}和印发他们自己的货币
{\pos(192,288)}and people issuing their own money.

836
0:49:54.77 --> 0:49:57.81
{\pos(192,275)}诺特豪斯创造了他自己的货币
{\pos(192,288)}Von Nothaus created his own currency...

837
0:49:57.81 --> 0:50:01.41
{\pos(192,275)}一个称为自由美元的银质硬币  任何人都可以购买
{\pos(192,288)}a silver coin called the Liberty Dollar which anyone could buy.

838
0:50:01.41 --> 0:50:02.93
{\pos(192,275)}许多人已经购买了
{\pos(192,288)}And many have.

839
0:50:02.93 --> 0:50:06.33
{\pos(192,275)}感谢他  价值5千万的硬币
{\pos(192,288)}Thanks to him, coins worth anything up to 50 million

840
0:50:06.33 --> 0:50:09.08
{\pos(192,275)}已经投入到美国的经济中
{\pos(192,288)}have now been sent out in to the US economy.

841
0:50:09.10 --> 0:50:11.49
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克是激发这一灵感的源泉
{\pos(192,288)}And Hayek was a big inspiration.

842
0:50:11.50 --> 0:50:14.81
{\pos(192,275)}他说问题在于政府货币
{\pos(192,288)}He says the problem is government money.

843
0:50:14.81 --> 0:50:16.64
{\pos(192,275)}总是政府的货币
{\pos(192,288)}It's always been government money.

844
0:50:16.66 --> 0:50:20.60
{\pos(192,275)}因为他们滥用其权力  可以从空气中赚钱
{\pos(192,288)}Because they abuse their power. They make money out of thin air.

845
0:50:20.62 --> 0:50:25.25
{\pos(192,275)}他说我们应该废除中央银行
{\pos(192,288)}So he says what we should do is to abolish the central bank.

846
0:50:25.25 --> 0:50:28.22
{\pos(192,275)}关闭美联储  这注意太棒了
{\pos(192,288)}The end of the Federal Reserve, that was fantastic!

847
0:50:29.85 --> 0:50:34.12
{\pos(192,275)}自上世纪20年代  本杰明斯·特朗经营新的美联储开始
{\pos(192,288)}Ever since Benjamin Strong was running the New York Federal Reserve

848
0:50:34.14 --> 0:50:37.21
{\pos(192,275)}央行就开始运用其
{\pos(192,288)}in the 1920s, central banks have used their control

849
0:50:37.22 --> 0:50:41.89
{\pos(192,275)}对货币供应量的控制  试图管理经济的上升和下降
{\pos(192,288)}over the supply of money to try to manage the economy's ups and downs.

850
0:50:41.89 --> 0:50:44.68
{\pos(192,275)}但是正如我们所见的 对哈耶克和其追随者来说
{\pos(192,288)}But as we've seen, to Hayek and his fans,

851
0:50:44.70 --> 0:50:48.64
{\pos(192,275)}央行是许多资本主义问题的诱因
{\pos(192,288)}central banks are the cause of many of capitalisms problems,

852
0:50:48.66 --> 0:50:50.02
{\pos(192,275)}而不是解决方案
{\pos(192,288)}not the solution.

853
0:50:51.37 --> 0:50:54.21
{\pos(192,275)}我不会宣称在一天或者短期内关闭美联储
{\pos(192,288)}And I don't argue for closing the Fed down in one day either.

854
0:50:54.22 --> 0:50:56.56
{\pos(192,275)}我希望审计美联储  我希望竞争
{\pos(192,288)}I want to audit the Fed and I want competition,

855
0:50:56.58 --> 0:50:59.73
{\pos(192,275)}即哈耶克关于竞争和货币的观点
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek's ideas of competition and money,

856
0:50:59.74 --> 0:51:03.49
{\pos(192,275)}看谁最终谁能赢得竞争
{\pos(192,288)}and see who can win this argument.

857
0:51:03.50 --> 0:51:06.08
{\pos(192,275)}但是他们要求垄断的权力
{\pos(192,288)}But for them to claim monopoly powers

858
0:51:06.10 --> 0:51:10.04
{\pos(192,275)}禁止我们实施私人市场经济
{\pos(192,288)}and prevent us from practising private market economics

859
0:51:10.06 --> 0:51:12.33
{\pos(192,275)}才是我们面临的真正问题
{\pos(192,288)}is the real problem that we have.

860
0:51:14.14 --> 0:51:18.12
{\pos(192,275)}这很有乌托邦的意味  好比黄金年代
{\pos(192,288)}A lot of this is this Utopian vision, the golden age

861
0:51:18.14 --> 0:51:20.81
{\pos(192,275)}当时  人还是人  货币还是自由的
{\pos(192,288)}when men were men and currency was free.

862
0:51:20.81 --> 0:51:23.60
{\pos(192,275)}美国在很长有一段时间内
{\pos(192,288)}The United States had a long period of no government monopoly

863
0:51:23.62 --> 0:51:25.33
{\pos(192,275)}政府没有对货币进行垄断
{\pos(192,288)}on currency.

864
0:51:25.33 --> 0:51:28.81
{\pos(192,275)}整个系统对银行没有监管
{\pos(192,288)}We had the whole system of unregulated banks

865
0:51:28.81 --> 0:51:30.45
{\pos(192,275)}允许它们印发竞争性的货币
{\pos(192,288)}issuing competing currencies.

866
0:51:30.46 --> 0:51:32.93
{\pos(192,275)}但那个系统极易引发金融危机
{\pos(192,288)}That system was heavily prone to financial crises.

867
0:51:32.93 --> 0:51:35.85
{\pos(192,275)}所以"竞争就是答案"这一理念
{\pos(192,288)}So the idea again that competition is the answer

868
0:51:35.85 --> 0:51:37.58
{\pos(192,275)}是被历史唾弃的
{\pos(192,288)}is flying in the face of history.

869
0:51:39.22 --> 0:51:42.64
{\pos(192,275)}也许这是事实  但是政府努力控制市场
{\pos(192,288)}Perhaps, but the history of government efforts

870
0:51:42.66 --> 0:51:46.16
{\pos(192,275)}的历史也同样不完美
{\pos(192,288)}to control the market hasn't been so pretty either.

871
0:51:46.18 --> 0:51:49.64
{\pos(192,275)}对哈耶克来说  真正的乌托邦是相信央行
{\pos(192,288)}For Hayek, what was really utopian was the belief that central banks,

872
0:51:49.66 --> 0:51:52.10
{\pos(192,275)}或类似的人物能够和
{\pos(192,288)}or anyone else for that matter, could ever be a match

873
0:51:52.10 --> 0:51:55.45
{\pos(192,275)}复杂的现代经济进行比赛
{\pos(192,288)}for the dizzying complexity of our modern economy.

874
0:51:55.46 --> 0:51:59.64
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克会说  他们没有能力做这些  他们必须停止尝试
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek would say since they can't do it they should just stop trying.

875
0:51:59.66 --> 0:52:01.21
{\pos(192,275)}我们应该停止...
{\pos(192,288)}We should stop having...

876
0:52:01.22 --> 0:52:04.45
{\pos(192,275)}停止利用任何货币政策进行干预
{\pos(192,288)}Well, stop having any intervention in monetary policy,

877
0:52:04.46 --> 0:52:07.25
{\pos(192,275)}如果走极端的话就是撤销央行
{\pos(192,288)}or stop having central banks if you go to the extreme.

878
0:52:07.25 --> 0:52:09.89
{\pos(192,275)}我认为这是一个梦想
{\pos(192,288)}Well, that's dreaming, I think.

879
0:52:12.70 --> 0:52:16.00
{\pos(192,275)}冯诺特豪斯试图与美联储竞争
{\pos(192,288)}Von Nothaus's attempt to compete with the Federal Reserve

880
0:52:16.02 --> 0:52:19.58
{\pos(192,275)}最终导致了美国政府的关注
{\pos(192,288)}eventually drew the attention of the American authorities.

881
0:52:20.77 --> 0:52:25.16
{\pos(192,275)}2007年  FBI介入
{\pos(192,288)}In 2007, the FBI moved in.

882
0:52:25.18 --> 0:52:29.77
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  他们开始认为我是一个威胁而不是解决方案
{\pos(192,288)}I think they begin to perceive us as a threat instead of a solution.

{\pos(192,275)}他提到哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}he talked about Hayek.

889
0:52:51.58 --> 0:52:55.12
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克的理论可以为我们辩护
{\pos(192,288)}Well, he was relevant to my defence.

890
0:52:55.14 --> 0:52:58.97
{\pos(192,275)}这不是我自己想出来的轻率观点
{\pos(192,288)}This wasn't some harebrained idea that I had thought up myself.

891
0:52:58.98 --> 0:53:04.33
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克是一个众所周知的诺贝尔获奖者
{\pos(192,288)}I pointed out that here was a well-known Nobel laureate

892
0:53:04.33 --> 0:53:07.50
{\pos(192,275)}他说的正是我现在所做的

{\pos(192,275)}在他生命的尽头  哈耶克获得世人的尊敬
{\pos(192,288)}Towards the end of his life, Hayek was feted by everyone.

{\pos(192,288)}He'd inspired politicians all over the world with his boundless belief

902
0:53:52.93 --> 0:53:55.73
{\pos(192,275)}这激发了全球政治家的灵感
{\pos(192,288)}in the power of the free market.

903
0:53:55.74 --> 0:53:59.81
{\pos(192,275)}这是加拉加斯的天主教大学

{\pos(192,288)}When it came to their actual policies,

905
0:54:03.50 --> 0:54:06.97

{\pos(192,288)}using their power over the supply of money in circulation

909
0:54:16.77 --> 0:54:20.52
{\pos(192,275)}这个信条仍是各国政府执政的基石
{\pos(192,288)}is still a touchstone for governments everywhere.

910
0:54:20.54 --> 0:54:24.97
{\pos(192,275)}在这种意义上  弗里德曼不像哈耶克  提供了政治家
{\pos(192,288)}In that sense, Friedman, unlike Hayek, did offer politicians

911

913

{\pos(192,275)}这是一个科技进步前所未有的时代
{\pos(192,288)}an era of unprecedented scientific progress...

914
0:54:38.25 --> 0:54:42.64
{\pos(192,275)}这是个人的一小步
{\pos(192,288)}'It's one small step for man,

915
0:54:42.66 --> 0:54:46.41
{\pos(192,275)}却是人类的一大步
{\pos(192,288)}'one giant leap for mankind.'

916
0:54:46.41 --> 0:54:52.16
{\pos(192,275)}也是经济灾难前所未有的年代
{\pos(192,288)}but also unprecedented economic disasters.

{\pos(192,288)}Living in the shadow of both,

918
0:54:54.18 --> 0:54:57.52
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克意识到  政治家错误地认为经济学是门科学
{\pos(192,288)}Hayek came to see the great crises of capitalism as the result

919

{\pos(192,275)}导致了资本主义的巨大危机
{\pos(192,288)}of politicians mistaking economics for a science.

920
0:55:02.37 --> 0:55:06.45
{\pos(192,275)}这是一个着手解决所有重大问题的世纪
{\pos(192,288)}It was a century for taking on all the big questions.

921
0:55:06.46 --> 0:55:08.68
{\pos(192,275)}经济学上的重大问题
{\pos(192,288)}And the big question for economists

922
0:55:08.70 --> 0:55:12.97
{\pos(192,275)}就是如何驯服这个非凡的现代经济
{\pos(192,288)}was how they were going to tame this extraordinary modern economy.

923
0:55:12.98 --> 0:55:16.49
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯和哈耶克都认为其面临不可置信的困难
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes and Hayek both thought that would be incredibly difficult,

924
0:55:16.50 --> 0:55:18.56
{\pos(192,275)}甚至是危险
{\pos(192,288)}dangerous even.

925
0:55:18.58 --> 0:55:21.41
{\pos(192,275)}但是凯恩斯的观点取悦了统治阶级
{\pos(192,288)}But Keynes flattered governments with the idea

926
0:55:21.41 --> 0:55:24.60
{\pos(192,275)}他们可以按其意愿调整人类发展进程
{\pos(192,288)}that they could tilt the course of human history their way.

927
0:55:24.62 --> 0:55:29.04
{\pos(192,275)}而哈耶克却说  他们甚至不应该尝试
{\pos(192,288)}It was Hayek who said they shouldn't even try.

928
0:55:29.06 --> 0:55:31.37
{\pos(192,275)}我们可能发现宇宙的规则
{\pos(192,288)}We might uncover the laws of the universe...

929
0:55:31.37 --> 0:55:35.02
{\pos(192,275)}我们不可能掌握人性的复杂
{\pos(192,288)}we were never going to master the complexities of human nature.

930
0:55:36.89 --> 0:55:39.16
{\pos(192,275)}他称之为  伪知识
{\pos(192,288)}"Pretence of knowledge", he called it...

931
0:55:39.18 --> 0:55:42.33
{\pos(192,275)}不懂装懂
{\pos(192,288)}pretending they know something that they don't know.

932
0:55:42.33 --> 0:55:44.37
{\pos(192,275)}他们现在正这样做...
{\pos(192,288)}Well, they've been doing it now...

933
0:55:44.37 --> 0:55:47.00
{\pos(192,275)}我们现在有大量的经济学家
{\pos(192,288)}We've given the current crop of economists,

934
0:55:47.02 --> 0:55:49.41
{\pos(192,275)}让我想想  多少年才发展至此
{\pos(192,288)}let's see, how many years would that be?

935
0:55:49.41 --> 0:55:52.64
{\pos(192,275)}大约70年  完全失败
{\pos(192,288)}About 70-some years. Total failure.

936
0:55:52.66 --> 0:55:56.21
{\pos(192,275)}许多电脑模型是完全误导
{\pos(192,288)}Many of the computer models have been desperately misleading

937
0:55:56.22 --> 0:55:59.29
{\pos(192,275)}假装我们知道经济如何运行
{\pos(192,288)}in pretending that we understand how the economy works.

938
0:55:59.29 --> 0:56:02.33
{\pos(192,275)}我们其实并不知道  我们不能预测经济
{\pos(192,288)}We don't. We can't forecast the economy.

939
0:56:02.33 --> 0:56:05.21
{\pos(192,275)}我们可以尝试思考重大问题
{\pos(192,288)}But we can try to think about the big questions.

940
0:56:05.22 --> 0:56:07.21
{\pos(192,275)}我们是否能走出大衰退?
{\pos(192,288)}Can we get out of a deep slump?

941
0:56:07.22 --> 0:56:09.45
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  和其他国家合作
{\pos(192,288)}And I think by working with other countries,

942
0:56:09.46 --> 0:56:12.04
{\pos(192,275)}我们能逐步找到出路
{\pos(192,288)}we can gradually find our way out of this.

943
0:56:12.06 --> 0:56:14.33
{\pos(192,275)}我们需要不同的观点交汇
{\pos(192,288)}So you need the different insights together,

944
0:56:14.33 --> 0:56:16.08
{\pos(192,275)}但是哈耶克是一个
{\pos(192,288)}but Hayek is a...

945
0:56:16.10 --> 0:56:20.73
{\pos(192,275)}哈耶克道德层面的主张是  避免傲慢自大的经济政策
{\pos(192,288)}The moral of Hayek is - avoid hubris in economic policy,

946
0:56:20.74 --> 0:56:24.37
{\pos(192,275)}正如我们也应避免  自大傲慢的认为市场能
{\pos(192,288)}just as we should avoid hubris in thinking that markets

947
0:56:24.37 --> 0:56:27.66
{\pos(192,275)}以其自身机制引领我们走向天堂
{\pos(192,288)}left to their own devices will lead us to Nirvana.

948
0:56:30.37 --> 0:56:34.73
{\pos(192,275)}毫无疑问  哈耶克改变了世界历史的进程
{\pos(192,288)}There's no doubt Hayek helped change the course of world history,

949
0:56:34.74 --> 0:56:38.85
{\pos(192,275)}决定性的将其从政府主导转向市场主导
{\pos(192,288)}shifting it decisively away from the state and towards the market.

{\pos(192,288)}of a market free from state intervention.

960

{\pos(192,275)}当资本主义面临其1930年代以来最大的考验时
{\pos(192,288)}And when capitalism faced its biggest test since the 1930s,

961

{\pos(192,288)}politicians rushed to save the market from itself.

{\pos(192,288)}In fact, the biggest debate in Britain today is not about

963
0:57:28.41 --> 0:57:31.52
{\pos(192,275)}不在于政府为了提振经济是否干涉过多

964
0:57:31.54 --> 0:57:32.93
{\pos(192,275)}而在与是否干预不足
{\pos(192,288)}but whether it's doing enough.
