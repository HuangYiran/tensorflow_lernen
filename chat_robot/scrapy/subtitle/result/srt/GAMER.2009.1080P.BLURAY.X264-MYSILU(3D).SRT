972
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,458
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}可那次投票的真实性令人怀疑
In an election tainted by a suspected digital fraud.

973

With a set of pre programmed actions, with no one controlling them,

976
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:12,667

And no way to react, their chances of survival next to nil?

977
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,750
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}监狱中那么多人做不了杀戮者
There's plenty of men and women in prison who can never cut it to slayers

Shouldn't they be given the same chance, roll the dice for a ticket out?

979
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,625
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}而且他们只需通关一轮

00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,958
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}没错
Right.

981
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,167
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}那么  卡斯特先生
So Mr. Castle,

982
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,083
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}这究竟是怎么运作的
how the hell does it work?

983
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,875
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}这一切始于植入大脑运动皮层中的
It begins with a single nano cell

984
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,125
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}单个纳米级细胞
Planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

985
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,458
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}它能不断复制
This cell can replicate,

986
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,750
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}完美复制到周围细胞
Replacing the cells around it with perfect copies.

987
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,042
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}复制的细胞便拥有远程存取功能性
And these copied cells contain remote access functionality.

988
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,542
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}因此纳米细胞加大脑皮层
Therefore nano plus cortex,

989
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,042
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}等于"纳米皮层"

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}拿"社会"举例子
You take "society" for instance.

996
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,167
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}只要离开游戏  那些被控制的人
Once our cast member has left the workplace they're completely free,

997
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,542
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}就会完全自由
From the control and monitoring of their player.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}那可真是放松
Oh well that's a relief!

999
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,250
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}对一些人可能是这样
For some, maybe.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你有没有想过  有些人其实不介意
Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't mind a bit of controlling?

No tough choices, no responsibilities?

1004
