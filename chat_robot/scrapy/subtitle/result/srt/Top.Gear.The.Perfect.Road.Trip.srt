8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,920
大英帝国的星期二
It's a normal Tuesday in Britain.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,480
山雨欲来风满楼 漫漫车龙几时休
There's a hint of drizzle in the air and traffic is at a standstill.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,200
我们认为 驾驶不该如此乏味
We know that driving is meant to be more fun than this.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,960
车也不该如此无聊
We know that cars are meant to be more fun than this.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
所以我们决定 帮你逃离这一切
So we decided what we'd do is give you an hour or so of escapism,

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
给你一个小时亲近好车 亲近完美之路
of perfect roads and perfect cars.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
我们接下来
Yeah. So, what we're going to do is

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,440
要将所有会产生烦恼的东西抹去
strip away all the things that drive us mad,

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,760
道路施工 小标致 测速探头
roadworks, Peugeots, speed cameras...

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,200
-詹姆斯·梅 -对 我们不能带上他
- James May.
- Yeah, we'll get rid of him.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,680
他会拖我们后腿
He's always holding us up.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,560
然后开始我们的完美公路之旅
And then we will end up with the perfect road trip.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,240
奇怪的是 杰里米坚持要从威尼斯
Strangely, Jeremy insisted we should start here, in Venice,

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,360
这个没有街道只有水道的地方出发
where all the streets are full of water.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,040
我们为什么要来威尼斯
Why are we in Venice?

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
因为我想驾驶这台Riva Aquarama号
Because I wanted to drive the Riva Aquarama.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,720
为什么
Why?

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
因为它是有史以来最曼妙的小艇
Because it's the most beautiful thing ever made

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
而且还拥有一对V8发动机
and because it's got two V8s.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,680
很好 我们来威尼斯 是因为他想开 啥来着
Okay, we are starting in Venice because he wanted to drive a... What is it?

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,680
- Riva Aquarama号
- Riva Aquarama.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,920
这世界上最美的东西
- The most beautiful thing ever made

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,080
而且有 两台V8
and it's got... Two V8s?

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
两台
- Two V8s!

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,640
我们将由此出发 穿越
And we're going to set off from here on a journey across Italy,

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,160
意大利 法国 直抵 哪里
across France, to... Where are we going?

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,400
-波城 -波城 是哪里
- Pau. - To Pau... Pau?

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,080
为什么要去波城
Why are we going to Pau?

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,760
因为那是第一届格兰披治大赛的举办地
Because that is where the first ever Grand Prix was held.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
-波城 -没错
- Pau? - Yeah.

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
-闻所未闻 -当年的赛道还在呢
- Never heard of it. - The track's still there.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
我们将在史上首条格兰披治赛道上飞驰
We're going to drive the very first Grand Prix track.

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,880
话说回来 在起点和终点间 我们将途径
Whatever. Between here and there, we're going to be on motorways,

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,200
高速 山路 拉力赛道 场地赛道和城市
mountain roads, rally stages, racetracks and cities.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
在每个点 我们都会使用
And in every place, we are both going to pick what we believe

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,640
自认为最棒的交通工具
is the perfect mode of transport.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,520
这将会是美好的一周
It's going to be the perfect week.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,240
蓝天白云 游艇美景 万事俱备
Perfect weather, perfect start,
perfect boat, perfect everything!

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,000
-爽 -而且詹姆斯不在
- Perfect.
- And no James May.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,240
不能要求 再多
That's better than perfect.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,440
接下来的七天 我们的完美之旅
Over the next seven days, our quest for perfection

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,720
将带我们从威尼斯前往意大利湖区
would take us from Venice towards the Italian Lakes.

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,120
然后从那里往南 奔赴地中海
From there we'd head south to the Mediterranean,

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
沿着法国里维埃拉沿岸 到达圣特罗佩
for a drive along the French Riviera to Saint-Tropez.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,960
并再次向内陆进发 到达终点波城
Then we'd swing inland again towards the finishing point at Pau.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,160
我们是不是看上去有点像美帝警探
Do we look like Tubbs and Crockett?

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
或者天朝城管
Or Tubby and Crotchety?

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,360
-不 说真的 太爽了 -天朝城管
- No, seriously. That's perfect, though.
- Tubby and Crotchety.

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,840
大威尼斯
Venice Vice.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,680
靠泊好20万英镑的快艇后
Having docked the £200,000 speedboat,

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,160
我选择了一台价格更贵的跑车
I switched to an even more expensive car.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,520
全新成熟版 不甩尾版 黑版 SLS
The new, grown-up, less tail-happy Black edition of the SLS.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,880
维多利亚时期 人们会在周游列国时
In Victorian times, people would come through Venice

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,040
路过威尼斯
on what was called "the grand tour",

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,600
我为此钦点奔驰到场
so that's why I've gone for the Mercedes,

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,760
因为它是绝对的终极自驾游神器
because it is the ultimate grand tourer.

64
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,080
它当然不是 因为你忘记了法拉利F12
Mmm-hmm. Except, it isn't the ultimate because this is, the Ferrari F12.

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,880
不对 那车动力太强了
No, no. That's too powerful.

66
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
-动力太强 -是啊
- Too powerful?
- It is too powerful.

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
我之前就说过
I said that... It is!

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,920
你是节目里说过 然后我就呵呵了
You did say it on the programme and I thought then...

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
你看 我有能力驾驭它的全部动力
You see this? I will be able to use all of the power.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
然后
Yes?

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
而你根本没办法榨干那台F12
In that, you will not be able to use all of the power

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
不然你会在半途撞上电线杆
because you'll end up halfway up a telegraph pole.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,880
不 我绝对可以尽在掌握
No, I'll be able to all of the power

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,160
肯定还会剩余那么一点点 就是这样
but there will be more power than you've got, that's all that's about.

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,760
一台GT必须
A grand tourer should be powerful

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
够快 够强 够狠
- and creamy and grunty and... - Uh...

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,920
一台622匹马力的四轮车
Six hundred and twenty-two horsepower,
it's not a wheelbarrow.

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,720
-730匹 比你还多 -我知道
- Seven hundred and thirty! It's more.
- I know.

79
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
哈蒙德
Hammond!

80
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,240
我们能开着GT上路了么
Let's just go across Italy, shall we, in our grand tourers?

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,280
走 走
Yes. Yes.

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,000
我会狂飙的 小样
I'LL go quickly, you big girl.

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
欧 我的天
Oh, God!

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,440
动力太凶猛了
Oh, that's a lot of power!

85
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,640
确实多了点 不 一点也不
Maybe that's too much! No, it's not too much.

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,080
杰里米个胆小鬼 动力正合适
Jeremy's being a wuss. It's just enough.

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
只是我目前用不了这么多
It's just I don't need to use all of it right now.

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
我要控制一些 就这么一点
I'm going to use a bit Less. Maybe this much of it.

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,680
变速箱的换挡速度太惊人了
The changes from that gearbox are incredible.

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,840
这是台双离合变速箱 其实
It's a double clutch gear box. In actual fact,

91
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,400
它和杰里米SLS里的那台一模一样
it's exactly the same unit as in Jeremy's Mercedes SLS.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,680
但法拉利进行了独门调教
It's just Ferrari have put their own mapping,

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,040
用法拉利的电脑控制它
their own computer control on this particular one.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,640
能在你换挡的时候
And it's set up so that when you change,

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,160
它能同步匹配转速 并进行补油
it spikes the engine revs so it surges when you change.

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,960
阿弥陀佛
Dear God!

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,560
这台车不只是绣花枕头
This body isn't just pretty,

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
它的设计能够最大程度地利用气流
it's been sculpted to maximise the air flowing over it

99
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
产生下压力
to generate down force

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,470
把车死死地摁在路上
to stick it to the road

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,080
奔驰制造过好几款黑色系列
There have been a number of Black Special Edition Mercs in the past

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,680
而且他们基本都很 无聊 真的 难以操控
and almost all of them have been, well, dreadful, really. Undriveable.

103
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,240
他们会产生过多扭矩 每当你踩下油门
They generated too much torque. So every time you put your foot down,

104
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,720
就会感觉车要自杀
it felt like they were trying to tear themselves apart.

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,040
你一路狂奔 它一路把小鸟
You'd be going along and it'd be sucking birds

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,360
大树 松鼠统统吸进发动机
and trees and squirrels into the engine

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,800
把蜿蜒的道路抛诸身后
and then ripping up the road and hurling chunks of tarmac out of the back

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,720
真的非常 扯淡
and it was just... They were ridiculous.

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,320
而在它身上 奔驰变聪明了
This, though, Mercedes has been clever

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,280
因为 虽然它比普通版的SLS的动力更强
because, yes, it generates more power than a standard SLS

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,240
但扭矩要小14Nm 所以现在
but 11 fewer torques. So now...

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,120
你踩下油门 它能将你的动作转化成速度
You put your foot down, it translates that action into speed,

113
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
而不是事故
not destructions.

114
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,160
欧 V8简直所向披靡
Oh, but you can't beat a V8!

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,800
我承认 V12确实很棒 但V8更赞
I mean, yes, a V12 is nice. But a V8 is nicer.

116
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
就这么简单
It just is.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,640
我刚才说V8无懈可击
I'm just saying you can't beat a V8.

118
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,280
但我依然喜欢更强 更凶悍的V12
Oh, I like a 12, I do like a big powerful, slightly angry 12.

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
这车真不错
That's a great car, that.

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
就像 你轻轻戳它一下
It's......You just give it a little poke,

121
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,840
"对不起 请..."
"Excuse me, could you..."

122
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
太不可思议了
That is insane!

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
我乐翻了
I was very happy.

124
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,520
可就在此时 杰里米突然调转车头
And therefore a bit surprised when Jeremy suddenly veered off

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,920
来到了一个古老的意大利小镇
toward some old Italian town.

126
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
就是这里
There it is.

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
-什么 就这个 -是啊
- What? That? - Yeah.

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,440
这就是 罗密欧与朱丽叶里描写的那个阳台
That is the actual balcony from Romeo and Juliet.

129
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
-听我说 -干嘛
- Yeah. Couple of points. - What?

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,120
我开了台法拉利 晴空万里 身处意大利
I've got a Ferrari, it's a beautiful day, I'm in Italy.

131
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,920
你却来围观爱情故事里的阳台
You're looking at a balcony that was in a story... Story!

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
而且你说过自己讨厌这个故事的作者
Made up by a man who you said you don't like.

133
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
我讨厌莎翁 但你想...
I hate William Shakespeare but it's...Come on!

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,680
这是假的 只是个传说 编出来的
It's not real, it's a story. It was pretend.

135
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,240
你在畅游欧洲 要欣赏沿途名胜古迹
You're on a tour of Europe, you need to see stuff.

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,480
我开着法拉利游欧洲
I'm on a tour of Europe, in a Ferrari,

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
但现在却不在车里
except I'm not in a Ferrari,

138
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
站在一栋破房子外面瞻仰
I'm standing here Looking at an old building.

139
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,880
庆幸的是 一大波TG粉围观
Happily, a big crowd of Italian Top Gear fans then stopped him

140
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
于是我们放弃参观旧剧院 继续上路
from getting into some old theatre so we could get back on the motorway.

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,480
如果他接下来还停车看破房
If he's going to ruin this road trip

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,800
毁我的好心情 我就...
by stopping off to look at old things that don't move, I'll...

143
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,280
我早该记得
I should've remembered, of course,

144
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,480
哈蒙德是个没文化的粗人
Hammond isn't going to want to do anything cultural

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,080
而且还不懂得吃货的心理
and he isn't going to want to eat anything interesting.

146
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,760
感觉就像跟一个小板凳一起旅游一样
It's like travelling around with a garden chair.

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,680
我于是决定再耍他一下
I therefore decided to annoy him some more.

148
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,480
-哈蒙德 -怎么了
- Hammond? - What?

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
我们能从这里出去么
Shall we turn off here?

150
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,200
现在 为什么
What, now? Why would we?

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,000
因为我开腻了高速 想换个口味
Well, because I'm bored of driving on motorways, I want to go on other roads.

152
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
路边是不是又有一对破石头
Is there an old pile of bricks

153
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,160
或者门口供着一个仙女
or a gate that once featured in a fairy tale down here?

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
当然不是 只是开更有意思的路
No, no. It's driving but just on nice roads.

155
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,480
我绝不会去看韩塞尔与葛雷特的拎包
We're not going to look at Hansel and Gretel's handbag or something?

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,960
其实 我们正驶向意大利湖区
In fact, we were heading for the Italian Lakes,

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,520
我们此次行程皇冠上的明珠
a sparkling jewel in the golden crown of our perfect journey.

158
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,040
很快我发现 这些车和景
And soon I realised that cars like these on days like these

159
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,520
之前好像也拍过 DVD意大利任务的片头
have been used before, at the beginning of. The Italian job.

160
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,280
我知道这段路应该配什么音乐
I know just the music we need for this bit of our drive.

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
来一首蒙罗
Cue the Monro.

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,760
所有这些都很给力
Ooh, this is pretty,

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,240
开着我的意大利产超级GT 欣赏意大利美景
Looking at all of these Italian things from my Italian grand touring supercar.

164
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,320
我们唯一需要注意的是 进隧道时
We just have to be careful that if we go into a tunnel,

165
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,280
不要撞上推土机
we don't hit a bulldozer.

166
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
欧 这简直 欧
Oh, that's just... Oh!

167
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,400
爽歪歪
This is just magnificent.

168
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,320
但很快 我发现选择这里非常明智
But soon the real reason for turning off became apparent.

169
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,720
因为当道路越弯曲
As the roads became more twisty,

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
法拉利也越难以操控
the Ferrari was becoming more of a handful.

171
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,280
欧
Oh-ho! Oh!

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,640
你释放那730匹马力的时候需要谨慎一些
Uh, just need to be a bit careful about unleashing 730 brake horsepower.

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,240
它比F1赛车更强劲 我必须格外小心
It's actually more than an F1 car and I'm conscious of that right now.

174
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
救命啊
Help! Oh!

175
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
好险
Oh! Yeah.

176
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
我才不怕呢
I wasn't scared

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,000
法拉利比奔驰快这一点 我不置可否
I have no doubt that the Ferrari is faster than this

178
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,400
但奔驰更适合驾驶 因为它没那么恐怖
but this is just nicer to drive'cause it's less frightening.

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
在F12上 法拉利提供了所有你想要的
With the F12, Ferrari have given you everything you need

180
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,840
完美的操控
to have an incredible drive

181
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,600
或者给你一场严重车祸
or get yourself into a very great deal of trouble.

182
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,160
让一个赛车手来驾驶 他会说
Get a racing driver in this car and he will tell you,

183
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,480
"对 这才是一台车"
"Yes, that is a real car."

184
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,000
它不是用来停在高球停车场
It's not been tamed for people to park at the golf course

185
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,720
或者街边酒吧
and talk about in the bar.

186
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,000
你简直不敢相信它和普通SLS的差距
It's amazing how different this is to the standard SLS,

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,880
那车会动不动就甩尾
which would be wobbling its bottom all over everywhere.

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,600
但它不会 因为有电子差速器
This isn't because of its electronic differential.

189
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,960
你可以把它想象成保时捷GT3
You can think of it really like a Porsche GT3,

190
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,400
更轻 更硬 更专注 为赛道而生
lightened, hard, focused, on it, built for this.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,440
这样一台SLS就像是
The SLS behaving like this is like

192
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,320
艾迪·伊扎德出演理查德三世
Eddie Izzard doing Richard III, it's...

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,800
想象一下 看一个哑剧演员扮演
It's almost weird to watch a pantomime character

194
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,480
心直口快 聪明伶俐的角色
become so straight.

195
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,160
诡异但不失智慧
Weird and yet brilliant.

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
最后 我们来到了旅店
Eventually, we reached our overnight halt

197
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,600
和我低调奢华有内涵的同事共进晚餐
and I went for supper with my cultured colleague.

198
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,680
你为什么说自己喜欢湖区
What do you mean you prefer the Lake District?

199
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,920
这里美得没边
Well, this is beautiful It is.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,280
-而且我觉得... -比德文特湖还漂亮
- And to be honest, for me...
- More beautiful than Derwentwater.

201
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,080
加尔达湖都望尘莫及
Garda's not even the prettiest lake and look at it!

202
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,160
它太迷人 把镜头缩小到整个画面的75%
It's very lovely. Just scale it down to 75% of that

203
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,320
然后配上些雨水
and then introduce a bit of drizzle and...

204
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,920
-Keswick在湖区么 -当然
- Is Keswick in the Lake District? - Ooh, yeah.

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,640
但你在Keswick可吃不到这些 尝过没
What you don't get in Keswick are these. Have you had one?

206
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,560
-没 -吃个辣椒 来
- No. - Have a pepper. Eat.

207
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
快点 尝尝 你会喜欢的
Eat. Eat it. Go on, you'll like it.

208
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
真难吃
I don't like it.

209
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,680
后来 我们决定玩个老的游戏
Then we thought we'd play our favourite game.

210
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,120
他手里有一张法拉利的选配表
He's got the Ferrari options pricelist there

211
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
我来猜配件的报价
and I'm going to guess how much they cost.

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
这纸上有好多好多选装件
There are quite a Lot of options available.

213
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
比如
Pick some.

214
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,320
听好 碳纤维赛车座椅
Okay. Racing seats with carbon fibre.

215
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,640
不知道 600镑
I don't know, 600 quid?

216
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,240
5148镑
£5,184.

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
-我猜的有点低 -是啊
- I was a bit under. - Yeah.

218
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,640
轮胎上的碳纤维轮毂盖 就是 你懂的
But carbon fibre wheel caps, on the tyres, you know, on the...

219
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,320
-那个防尘盖 -对
- What, dust caps? - Yeah.

220
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,440
-碳纤维防尘盖 几个钱
Carbon fibre dust caps? Tenner.

221
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,080
480镑 挺便宜的
£480. I thought that was cheap.

222
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,080
-只是四个防尘盖 -是啊
- What, for four dust caps? - Yeah.

223
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,000
要480镑
£480?

224
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,480
杯架是不是标配
Are the cup holders standard?

225
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,800
你可以买一个碳纤维杯架
There is a carbon fibre cup holder you can get.

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,840
-杯架也碳纤维 -对啊 就是插杯子的地方
- A carbon fibre cup holder? - Yeah, you know, it pops in...

227
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,480
那个时候兰博基尼盖拉多的卖600镑
Well, they were £600 on a Lamborghini Gallardo a while back,

228
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,280
所以我猜一千左右
so I'LL go a thousand.

229
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,120
2112镑 你看 吓死你
£2,112. Yeah, this is amazing.

230
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
老实说 车本身算是最便宜的选择了
Really, the car is the cheapest option.

231
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,560
第二天 我们查了一下地图发现
The next day, we consulted a map and realised

232
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,120
自己差点赶上了F1赛历中最高速的比赛
we were just a spit from the fastest Grand Prix track on the calendar...

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,520
蒙扎
Monza.

234
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,320
速度圣殿
The Cathedral of Speed.

235
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
因为它的高速
Because it's so fast,

236
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,040
迫使我丢下了法拉利 鸟枪换炮
I've ditched the Ferrari and upped the ante

237
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,200
找来了帕加尼Huayra
to this Pagani Huayra,

238
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,520
也有一台V12 但加了两颗涡轮
still a V12 but now with two turbos.

239
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,640
在这里 你需要的是一颗导弹
Cause what you need here is a missile.

240
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,440
我选择了保时捷Cayman S
I've gone for a Porsche Cayman S.

241
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,800
-你疯了 -没有
- You're just being obtuse. - I'm not.

242
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,200
肯定疯了 搞了一台保时捷
You are. You've gone for a Porsche

243
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,640
却不是911 太气人了
so you can not go for a 911. It's just annoying.

244
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
它明显比911更厉害
This is better than a 911.

245
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
-怎么可能 当然911更快 -当然不是
- It isn't! A 911 is better than that. - It isn't.

246
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,560
-911的发动机在这里 -是的
- Because the 911 has its engine here. - Yes.

247
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,720
-但它是中置 -因为它不是911
- This is mid-engine. - Because it isn't a 911.

248
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,880
-不对 -它更好
- No! - It's better!

249
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,440
听着 如果我们在Cadwell公园或Lydden山
Listen, if we were driving around Cadwell Park, Lydden Hill...

250
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,560
-然后 -道路蜿蜒曲折 没错
- Yeah. - Nippy and fizzy, yes!

251
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,000
但这是在蒙扎 你需要动力
But not here at Monza. You need power.

252
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,520
你只是冲着这条
You're just hung up on this

253
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,760
-直得不能再直的直路来的 -当然
- great big long straight. - Yes.

254
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,920
但那后面一定会出现一个弯角
But there must be a corner down there somewhere,

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
否则你不可能从那里绕回来
otherwise you wouldn't be able to get down there again.

256
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,360
而且至少有两个弯角
There has to be......In fact there've got to be two corners.

257
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
-没错 至少有两个 -对
- Yes, genius, that's two corners. - Yeah.

258
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,680
有你的 但你可否知道
Brilliant. Do you know what?

259
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,360
帕加尼Huayra过弯能力非常非常强
The Pagani Huayra goes around corners really incredibly well.

260
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,120
你一定不敢相信它的攻弯速度
You will not believe how fast this goes around corners.

261
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
-Ok -灰常灰常牛逼
- Okay. - It's a lot better.

262
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
我确实不喜欢保时捷
It's true, I don't like Porches

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,960
也不喜欢开保时捷的人
and I don't much like the people who drive them,

264
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,160
尤其是那两个叫詹姆斯和理查德的
especially the ones called James and Richard.

265
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,280
我也不喜欢老款的Cayman
I didn't much like the original Cayman, either,

266
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,760
我称之为保时鸡
I called it the Cockster.

267
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,000
这台车也有一些不讨我喜欢的地方
And there are one or two things that I don't much like about this.

268
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,680
比如外形 我觉得它看上去太像911
The styling, for example, I think it looks too like a 911.

269
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,280
还有座椅 肩部空间太窄
And then there's the seats, the shoulder bolsters are too narrow.

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
如果你像我一样膀大腰圆
So, if you're broad-shouldered and hunky, like me,

271
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,640
会一直感觉空间狭小
you're getting sort of squashed all the time.

272
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,560
但剩下的一切绝对顶尖
However, the rest of it is absolutely sublime.

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,840
配上自适应悬架 整个驾乘
You've got these adaptive dampers, which means that it rides

274
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,600
操控 转向 都非常接近超级跑车
and handles and steers like the very best supercars.

275
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,640
但最棒的还是3.4升水平对置六缸发动机
But the best thing is the engine. A 3.4-litre flat six.

276
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,720
不会出现任何差错
There's just no thing about it that's wrong.

277
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,880
而且每时每刻 你都能听到
And all the time it makes this... You can hear that

278
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,600
深沉 喜人的声音
deep, reassuring noise,

279
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,440
像是把理查德·伯顿塞进了机舱里
it's like having Richard Burton in the boot,

280
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,040
无休止地抱怨你的发型
endlessly complimenting you on your hair

281
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
穿着 和驾驶风格
and your clothes and your driving style.

282
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,040
我的天 它太快了
Oh, my God! That is so fast!

283
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,080
我去
Oh, my God!

284
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,560
230, 240, 250,

285
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,920
每小时260公里
260 kilometres an hour.

286
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,920
270 妈呀
270! Oh, dear God.

287
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,560
简直吓尿了
Oh! I scared the crap out of myself then.

288
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,240
我勒个...
Holy sh...

289
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,040
太爽了
Oh, my God!

290
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,520
神车一台
What a machine!

291
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,200
蒙扎就是速度的象征
Monza is all about speed

292
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,360
而帕加尼Huayra则为风代言
and a Pagani Huayra is about that and very little else.

293
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
6.3升 V12 双涡轮
6.3-litre, v12, twin turbos.

294
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,760
超级强劲的动力
Truly, enormously powerful.

295
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,520
转向时宽胎产生巨大的抓地力
Turning in, immense grip from those fat tyres.

296
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,160
我有主动空气动力学 帮我紧贴赛道
I have aero, active aero keeping me planted on the track.

297
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
这些翼片都有着自己的作用
These things are built to work as well,

298
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
而不是单纯的装饰品
they're not some fragile trailer queen.

299
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,520
我驾驶的这台车跑了86,000公里
This car I'm in has done 86,000 kilometres.

300
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,760
而且我猜 这车可不好对付
And I'm guessing not many of them were gentle.

301
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,600
法拉利也许同样优秀 但还是不及Huayra
The Ferrari would've been good at this but not as good as the Huayra.

302
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,560
问题在于 哈蒙德快过头了
The problem is Hammond is going too fast,

303
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,600
没机会品味这条史诗般荣耀的赛道
he's not savouring this glorious, historical tracks.

304
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,560
他只能走马观花 狼吞虎咽
He's just wolfing it down, like a dog wolfs down a steak.

305
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
啊呜
(GOBBLES)

306
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,840
而我在做的则是细细咀嚼 享受着每一口
What I'm doing is masticating,
enjoying every mouthful.

307
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,280
杰瑞米开着错误的车在赛道上爬来爬去的时候
HAMMOND: As Jeremy crawled
round in his wrong car,

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,400
我在等着他回P房
I was waiting for him
to get back to the pits.

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,640
他要有好一会才能回来 是吧
He's going to be a while, isn't he?

310
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,280
趁他不在 来看看帕加尼的内饰
While he's gone, let me show you
the interior of the Pagani.

311
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,760
这绝对值得一看
It's worth seeing.

312
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,680
设计师们想让内饰很特别 我觉得他们做到了
They want it to feel special in here
and I think they've succeeded.

313
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,600
他们的确为此动了脑筋
They've really put thought into this,
making it feel special.

314
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,680
换档杆这里 所有的这些部分
This gear linkage here,
all these parts,

315
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,280
总共有67个组成零件
there's 67 components have gone
into making that

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,320
因而你能看见它是怎样工作的
in that skeleton form,
so you can see it working.

317
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
而用料方面也很实在
And the materials, too,
it's all genuine,

318
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,840
用了一大堆碳纤维 真皮 和铝制品
a lot of real carbon fibre,
real leather. And the aluminium,

319
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,880
你眼前的每一个铝制部件都不是铸造的
every single aluminium component
you can see in here isn't cast,

320
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,160
而是用一整块毛坯打磨而来
it's milled from a single piece,
a single billet, a lump of aluminium.

321
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,440
这些都让人感觉它值这个价
All of which means it feels
as expensive as it is.

322
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,960
我喜欢这车 那家伙还没回来呢吧
I like this car.
He's not back yet, is he?

323
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,120
这里是世界上唯一拥有两个lesbos弯的赛道
第一个很窄
This is the only track in the world with
two lesbos, the first one's quite tight,

324
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,320
而第二个 你可以尽情把车尾甩出
second one, though,
you can really hang your arse out

325
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
这里
There it is.

326
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,400
总共十二个气缸 咱们来数一数好消磨时光
It's 12 cylinders in total.
Let's count them, it'll pass the time.

327
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,960
一 二 我数的有点快了 不妨慢一点
One, two... Oh, I'm going too quickly,
might as well make it last.

328
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,200
三 哦等等
Three... Oh, hang on. Oh!

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
你现在一定觉得
You must be feeling now...

330
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,280
啥 你选错车了
- What?
- ...that you brought the wrong car.

331
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,800
恕我给你读点关于这车的评价
Let me read you something, if I may.
Talking about this.

332
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,120
这辆车在弯道里的平衡性接近完美
"The car's cornering balance
is near perfect,

333
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,800
油门的预见性很中立而且正确
"neutral but unerringly predictable
on a balanced throttle

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,120
它会稍稍转向不足
"and biased ever so slightly
towards understeer

335
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,760
若你是在前轮横向负载减轻前
"if you throttle up
before you begin easing

336
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,320
大脚给油的话
"the lateral load
out of the front tyres.

337
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,840
不是我说的 是Autocar杂志上写的
Not my words, the words of
Autocar magazine.

338
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,280
哇偶 可这到底什么意思啊
Wow! What do those words actually mean?

339
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,480
-我不知道 -我也是
-I've no idea.
-Me, neither.

340
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,520
不过我要再去跑跑
But I'm going to go back
out there now and throttle up

341
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,840
在出弯前猛然加速 看会发生什么
before I've eased the lateral load out
of the front tyres and see what happens.

342
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,560
好啊 我这就去
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm going to do.

343
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,120
我完全不懂那都啥意思
I have no idea what any of that means.
I haven't a clue.

344
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
来了 大脚油
Right! Throttle up.

345
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,040
噢 看见了没
Oh, now you see?

346
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
只是打个转而已
Now, that's just a spin.

347
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,360
看见了没 Autocar 这明明是转向过度
Now, you see, Autocar, that's oversteer.

348
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,560
有时候你读路试的文章会想 你丫到底在说啥
Sometime you read road tests and you
do think, "What are you on about?"

349
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,200
这是辆好车啊 你可以尽情的甩屁股
It's a really nice car
and you can get the arse out.

350
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
终于回来了
HAMMOND: Finally.

351
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,160
还装作玩得很开心吗 是的
-Still pretending to have fun?
-Yeah.

352
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,680
-额 屎粑粑会跟这差不多吗 -什么
- Will, uh, will Poo be like this?- Will what?

353
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,160
屎粑粑 当我们到那儿的时候
Poo, when we go there.

354
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,480
哦你是说Pau啊
Oh, Pau?

355
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,520
知道我最喜欢哪一段吗
Do you know my favourite bit?

356
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,840
恩恩
你可以
- HAMMOND: Yes. Yes.
- You could...

357
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,800
保时捷能像一条闪电一样划过那里
The Porsche through there,
it's just a streak of lightning.

358
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,160
没有车能比它更快
Nothing is faster than that.

359
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,600
没有车可以 那个弯也是
Nothing is.
Nothing's faster... Or through there.

360
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,480
你丫有点忘乎所以了吧 这辆小车是挺快
Yes, you're getting a bit carried away.
It's fast. It's a quick little car.

361
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,440
说实话它在这块跑更合适点
To be honest,
it's more at home in this bit here.

362
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,080
你能从商店门口飞奔过去
You could "Oh, look!" past the shops

363
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,080
然后喊 那有个学校还有个超市
and "Oh, there's a school
and a supermarket."

364
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,560
这才是你的车该出现的地方 不是这里
And that's really where it belongs.
Not here.

365
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,920
你错了 我没错
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

366
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,200
哈蒙德我可以跟你赌任何东西 保时捷在这开得更快
Hammond, I bet you anything you like
that around here the Porsche is faster.

367
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
杰瑞米这也太
Jeremy, that's...

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,880
好吧好吧
输的人要这样说
- Okay!
- Whoever loses has to say,

369
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
我爱詹姆斯梅
"I love James May."

370
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,840
必须要对着镜头说
They have to say that
on television to a camera.

371
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
好啊
Fine.

372
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
肯定会是你对着镜头说 我爱詹姆斯梅的
You actually have to go up to the camera
and go, "I love James May."

373
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,600
好啊我倒希望看着你这么说
All right. Well, I look forward
to hearing you say it.

374
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,240
哦这原来叫lesmos
Oh, they're lesmos.

375
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,200
我以为这里是lesbo 其实是lesmo
I thought there was lesbo one and...
It's lesmo...

376
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,160
Martin Brundle念的时候一定是感冒了
Martin Brundle must have had a cold.

377
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520
走你
Right.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,560
3 2 1 出发(意大利语）

379
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
出发
And we are away.

380
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
打哈欠中


381
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,640
天哪这简直太尴尬了
Oh, God! This is just embarrassing

382
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,600
这样虐他连点成就感都没有
because where's going to be my sense of
achievement when I thrash him?

383
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,600
对车来说有个问题
CLARKSON: There is a point with cars

384
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,120
当他们变得马力很强 跑得很快的时候
where they become
so powerful and so fast

385
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,320
他们也会很疯狂很吓人
they become too hectic
and too frightening.

386
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,480
这也是怀亚所存在的问题
That's the problem with the.Huayra.

387
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,600
正在过第一个lesmo弯
Through the first of the lesmo corners,
as it turns out.

388
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
我知道这听起来很二
CLARKSON: I know it sounds silly
but once you go

389
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,160
但是当你开一辆五百多匹的车时 你反而会更慢
beyond 500-550 horsepower,
you end up driving the car more slowly.

390
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
很奇怪不过真的是这样的
It's weird but it's true.

391
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,760
用拎着刀去跟枪斗来形容这场比赛
Never has there beem
a more stark example of

392
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,880
真是再合适不过了
bringing a knife to a gunfight.

393
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,160
而开保时捷 我在任何地方都可以全油门
The Porsche, around here,
I'm absolutely pinning it everywhere.

394
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,120
这难不倒我 一点也不吓人 简单得很
It doesn't worry me,
it's not frightening, it's easy.

395
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,280
而那辆车
That thing, though...

396
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
我们会见证的
Well, we shall see.

397
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,560
我说的会被证实 他则会说 我爱詹姆斯梅
My case will be proven and he will be
saying, "I love James May."

398
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
我看到了那里显示着270KM/H
That's 270 I saw there.

399
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
他不会看到这个数字的
He won't see anything like that.

400
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
哦
Oh.

401
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,400
我听到了一个小矮人正在接近
I hear the sound of
an approaching midget.

402
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,960
马力全开
Fully on the power.

403
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,040
准备
Ready, steady...

404
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,840
冲线啦
And across the line!

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
2分14秒8
Two minutes, 14.8.

406
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
我们称之为2分15
We'll call it 2:15.

407
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,560
接下来轮到卡门了
Then it was the Cayman's turn.

408
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,640
意大利语
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

409
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,200
说实话 这样比一点意思都没有
Really, I am taking no pleasure in this.

410
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
但是他需要好好地上一课
But he does need to learn a lesson,

411
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
你不能仅仅因为你喜欢这辆车
that you can't just go making
stupid claims about a car

412
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,800
就大放厥词
just 'cause you like it.

413
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,560
说实话 那玩意儿的圈速
我甚至可以用煮蛋计时器来测
No, seriously, that thing round...
I could be using an egg timer.

414
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,600
他难道觉得能靠技术把时间补回来
How does he imagine he can
possibly make up enough time?

415
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,960
无论他觉得自己有多厉害
No matter how good
he thinks he is in it.

416
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,000
很明显 绝对不会赢的 管他呢
Clearly, it's not going to... Anyway.

417
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
说啥呢
老大
- You what?
- Mate!

418
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
你你你怎么不
Where... Why aren't you...

419
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,280
我没说是我开啊
I didn't say I'd be driving it.

420
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,400
我靠 那是谁
Well, who is?

421
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,600
有人说是试替哥 确实是他
Well, some say it's The Stig, and it is.

422
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,920
你有说过必须是我开吗 没说过
Did you at any point say
I had to drive it? No.

423
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,200
你有说过你要用试替哥吗
Did you at any point say
you were going to use The Stig?

424
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
你为啥不用呢
Why would you not?

425
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,520
因为我认为 在每条定义
Because I think
in every possible definition,

426
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,040
每项规则里 这都算作弊
in every set of rules, it's cheating.

427
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
他回来了
Oh, here he is.

428
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
2分13秒2
HAMMOND: 2:13:2.

429
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,000
2分13秒2
是的
- 2:13:2.
- Yes.

430
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,760
你跑了2分14秒8 差了一秒
You were 2:14:8. So he's one point...

431
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
这么说来 女士们先生们 保时捷正如我所说
So, there you are, ladies and gentlemen,
the Porsche is, as I said,

432
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,000
比怀亚更快
faster than the, uh...Huayra.

433
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,680
因此它才是更明智的选择
And therefore was a more
sensible choice of car.

434
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
-不不不 是试替哥比我快 -咋了
- No. The Stig is faster than me.
- What?

435
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,160
而试替哥比谁都快 这是他存在的意义
But The Stig is faster than everyone,
that's the point of The Stig,

436
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,120
否则他会炸掉的
if he wasn't he'd explode.

437
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,800
我们开着奔驰和法拉利离开蒙扎的时候
CLARKSON: As we left Monza
in the Mercedes and the Ferrari,

438
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,760
气氛有点阴沉
the mood was glum.

439
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,360
这是作弊
It's cheating.

440
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,760
然而第二天早上看到过夜的小镇的名字时
CLARKSON: The next morning, however,
Hammond cheered up

441
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,920
哈蒙德就开心起来了
when he discovered the name of the town
where we'd stayed the night.

442
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,400
偷笑中


443
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,800
从胸罩镇前往法国的路上
From Bra to the French Riviera,

444
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,680
我们本可以走高速公路
we could've used the motorway.

445
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,400
但是我们决定要改走一条
But we decided instead

446
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,080
世界上最美妙的
to use the finest switchback roads

447
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
曲折的小路
in the world.

448
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,320
这意味着要扔掉奔驰
This meant ditching the Mercedes

449
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
和法拉利
and the Ferrari

450
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,720
而选这两个小家伙来代替
and opting for these instead.

451
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,240
在这样子的路上
On a road like this,

452
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,720
你需要一辆小车 一辆掀背小钢炮
you need something small,
you need a hot hatchback.

453
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,760
如果你想要一辆掀背小钢炮的话
And if you're going to get
a hot hatchback,

454
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,080
为什么不选钢炮之王 就这辆
why not get the king? This one.

455
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,720
高尔夫GTI
The Golf GTI.

456
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,160
我很爱第1代
I loved the Mk1

457
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,160
16气门的第2代也不赖
and the 16-valve Mk2 wasn't bad, either.

458
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,520
但是后来的版本 它们虽然也不错
But since then...
I mean, they weren't bad

459
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,040
但是仿佛失去了魔力一般
but the magic went missing.

460
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,920
而在这辆第七代上 魔力又回来了
With this one, though, the Mk7,
it is back.

461
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,920
这辆车是全能型的
This car can do everything.

462
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,080
装配质量不错 价格合理
It's well made, it's sensibly priced.

463
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,920
很经济环保 配置也不错
It's economical, it's well-equipped.

464
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,520
能坐五个人 有个大后备箱
It seats five, it's got a big boot.

465
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,120
但是抛开这些不谈
But strip all that away and underneath,

466
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,800
本质上它就是一辆小钢炮
its DNA is hot hatchery.

467
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,600
2升涡轮增压引擎 220匹
Two-litre turbo engine, 220 horsepower

468
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,400
没有任何扭矩转向
and no torque steer.

469
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,160
瞧着 大脚油过这个发卡弯
Now, watch this. Foot hard down,
going around a hairpin bend.

470
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
太让人惊讶了
It's just astonishing.

471
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,560
这车的前差速器好的让人难以置信
The front diff on this is beyond belief.

472
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,040
哇偶 天哪太棒了
Whoa! God, this is good.

473
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,520
他又选错车了
He's got it wrong again.

474
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,440
高尔夫GTI 确实不错
The Golf GTI, it's a brilliant car,

475
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,160
它或许是最好的全能型车
it's probably the best all-rounder
in the world.

476
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,560
但是 重点就在这
But that's... That's the point,

477
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,240
你不需要全能型车
an all-rounder is exactly
what you don't need.

478
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,800
全能不可避免的意味着要处处妥协
An all-rounder
is inevitably compromised.

479
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,680
我只需要掀背钢炮的本质
I just want pure distilled
essence of hot hatch.

480
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,640
那就只有一个选择了
And that means only one thing right now.

481
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
嘉年华ST
The Fiesta ST.

482
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,920
当福特设计这辆车的时候 他们只是把零件拼到一起
When Ford put this car together,
they assembled all the right bits

483
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
然后想 恩 我估计这样挺好
and thought, "Yeah, I reckon
that would be good."

484
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
我觉得他们恐怕估计不到
I don't think they could
possibly have known

485
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,960
这车到底有多好
quite how good
it was going to turn out to be,

486
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,120
因为这车太出乎人意料了
because it's astonishing.

487
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,120
这车的确不如高尔夫马力大
It's down on power
compared to the Golf, yes.

488
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,720
但是它更小 更钢炮
But it's smaller, that's more hot hatch.

489
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,920
更轻
And it's lighter,

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,680
意味着马力重量比基本上和高尔夫一样了
which means the power-to-weight ratio
is pretty much the same.

491
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
另外这辆车还敏捷的很
And it's beyond nimble.

492
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,600
过弯时如果随意一点的话
You start to just take
liberties with it.

493
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,240
走线故意放宽一点
Deliberately running a line
a little bit wide,

494
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,760
你就能享受把它拉回来的乐趣了
so you get the pleasure
of turning it back in.

495
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200


496
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,480
太美妙了
It's superb.

497
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,800
这是世界上最棒的开心方向盘
It's the biggest grin-maker
I think the world has ever seen.

498
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,640
到达下一个村子的时候 不可避免的
In the next village, though, inevitably

499
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,760
杰瑞米决定我们应该吃点什么
Jeremy decided we should
get something to eat.

500
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,000
你咋不吃饭呢
Why aren't you eating your lunch?

501
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,200
我不喜欢意面
I don't like pesto.

502
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,360
什么 我不喜欢吃意面
- What?
- I don't like pesto.

503
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,040
为啥不喜欢 就是不喜欢
- Why not?
- It's just bits.

504
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,720
还有另一个停下来的理由
CLARKSON: There was, however,
a very good reason why we'd stopped.

505
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,800
你得说出来 你打赌输了 必须说出来
You've got to say it.
You lost the bet, you've got to say it.

506
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
我才不说
I'm not saying it.

507
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,360
你必须说
You've got to say it.

508
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
我正大光明的打败了你 保时捷就是更快
I beat you fair and square.
The Porsche was faster.

509
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,480
-一点也不公平 你丫作弊 -快说
- It wasn't fair. You cheated.
- Say it.

510
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,360
啥
What?

511
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,560
James May
...James May.

512
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,040
-这样行了吧 -不 要说清楚
-There.
-No. Say it so it's audible.

513
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,880
我爱James May
I... love James May.

514
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,040
这事办妥了以后我们又上路了
CLARKSON: With that done,
we got back in our cars.

515
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,760
当提到美国公路旅行的时候你会想到
纪念碑谷地
When you think of an American road trip,
you think of Monument Valley,

516
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,640
那条路笔直通向远方
that road spearing off
into the distance.

517
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,600
这条路就相当于欧洲的纪念碑谷
Well, this is Europe's equivalent
of Monument Valley.

518
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,880
这可能是目前这趟旅途中我最喜欢的一段了
This might just be my favourite bit
of our trip so far.

519
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
好车配美景
The car, the place.

520
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
怎一个完美了得
This is perfect.

521
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,120
上帝创造这边地方的目的
When God was making
this part of the world,

522
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,120
就是为了小钢炮
这条路就是为小钢炮量身定制的
it was for hot hatchbacks.
That's what it's for.

523
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
然而很不幸
Unfortunately, however,

524
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
我们激情的下山之旅被迫停止
our headlong charge down the Alps

525
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,040
因为我们已经无路可走
was halted because we ran out of land.

526
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,160
-嗯 -啥
- Mmm, that.
- What?

527
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,640
那就是传说中的蒙地卡罗
如果在那里开着大众和福特
Well, it's Monte-Carlo.
If we drive into there

528
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,640
我们会被当作流浪汉被抓起来
in a Volkswagen and a Ford,
they'll arrest us for vagrancy.

529
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,400
有道理哦
That's a good point.

530
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,800
-你可以是个军火贩子 -是
- I mean, you can be an arms dealer...
- Yeah.

531
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,280
但你不能开着一辆嘉年华在里面转悠
...but you can't drive around
in a Fiesta.

532
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,960
-这是底线 -我们得换车了
- There's a limit.
- We're going to need to switch.

533
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,840
这是我们为了显摆而换的车
For posing,
these were the cars we selected.

534
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,880
哈蒙德的兰博基尼 Aventador Roadster
A Lamborghini Aventador Roadster
for Hammond

535
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,920
和我的布加迪威龙
and a Bugatti Veyron for me.

536
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,040
这可不是一般的威龙
Now, this is no ordinary Veyron,

537
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,320
这可是 Grand Sport Vitesse 版本的
this is the Grand Sport Vitesse.

538
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,520
8升 4凸轮轴 W16发动机
Eight-litre, quad-cam W16.

539
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,040
极速404km/h
Top speed 251 miles an hour

540
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,600
还是没车顶的
with no roof.

541
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,560
这里就是这车该待的地方
Here it is in its natural habitat.

542
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,760
现在是2档
出发后第一次
I'm in second gear.
I'm now using second gear

543
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,320
上2档
for, well, the first time
since I set off.

544
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,800
又回到1档了
And back down to first.

545
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,520
很奇妙的一点是这里的人们在十点钟
It is extraordinary that here men get up

546
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,920
从单身公寓中醒来
from their bachelor pads at about 10:00,

547
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,400
然后开着用逃税的钱买的车
get into their cars that they bought
using money they should have paid in tax

548
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,640
花上一整天的时间
and then spend all day

549
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,000
在这里一圈一圈地转
driving round and round
and round in circles.

550
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,760
真是难以理解
Why?

551
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,720
人们看着我开着橙色的兰博基尼 Aventador Roadster
People see me in my orange
Lamborghini Aventador Roadster

552
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,600
觉得我肯定是个有钱有势的土豪
and think, "Yes.
There's a man of potency and wealth."

553
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,720
但是两秒钟之后
当他们看到那辆布加迪
And then two seconds later,
they see that Bugatti Veyron

554
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,600
他们肯定会想 来了一个更大的土豪
and think, "There's a richer,
more powerful man."

555
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
伙计很抱歉
I'm sorry about this, mate,

556
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,520
你又一次选错车了
but once again,
you're in the wrong car.

557
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,760
我对 再一次 表示异议
I take issue with the "once again"

558
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,720
只不过 这是有史以来第一次 我选错了车
but, yes, for the first time,
I've got the wrong car.

559
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,840
压根没人在看你 一个都没有
Nobody is looking at you,
nobody.

560
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,720
如果我花了29万英镑买了辆兰博基尼
If I had spent 290,000

561
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,040
在摩纳哥里面开
on a Lamborghini to drive around Monaco

562
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,600
而你却开着那玩意
and you turned up in that,

563
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,560
我恨不得开车撞墙
I'd just drive this into a wall.

564
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,560
这是世界上最势利的地方了
This is the snobbiest place on earth.

565
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,520
这里使
It makes...

566
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,400
这里让洛杉矶看上去如同朝鲜
It makes Los Angeles
look like North Korea.

567
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,960
当你要让别人代客泊车的时候
And this snobbery is an issue

568
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,760
这种势利就变成了个问题
when you try to
get your car valet parked.

569
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,600
现在的问题是
这哥们开着最便宜的法拉利
The problem is that chap has just
turned up outside the Hotel de Paris

570
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,240
加利福尼亚
in a Ferrari California.

571
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,080
来到巴黎大饭店门口
The cheapest Ferrari there is.

572
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,560
尽管如此 他依然很喜欢他的车
Nevertheless, he likes it very much.

573
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,080
是啊 这车确实不错
所以它就停在酒店门口了
Yeah, and it's nice.
And as a result, it's there.

574
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,400
-就因为这是辆好车 -是的
- Okay? 'Cause it looks good.
- Yeah.

575
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,760
但是一分钟内
But in a minute,

576
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,520
一个哈萨克斯坦的军火贩子
就会开着一辆更好的车停到这里
a Kazakhstani arms dealer
is going to arrive in a nicer car

577
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,960
然后这辆法拉利就会被开走
and the Ferrari
is going to be taken away

578
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,880
被停到城市另一头的立体停车场里
and put in a multi-storey
on the other side of Monaco.

579
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
但是我们
HAMMOND: But we pull up there

580
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,320
开着布加迪威龙和Aventador
in a Bugatti Veyron and
a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster,

581
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,280
你是说会有比这俩还牛的车出现
are you're saying something better
is going to come along than that?

582
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,720
我保证在蒙地卡罗
In Monte-Carlo, I promise you,

583
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,720
有人会开着企业号飞船出现
someone would turn up
in the USS Enterprise

584
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,040
然后我们的车就会被扔进立体停车场
and our cars would be
in the multi-storey.

585
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,080
车有多好一点也不重要
It doesn't matter how good your car is,

586
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,920
停车员总会把车开走的
the valet parkers will ultimately
take it away

587
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,960
因为没有最好只有更好
because something better always arrives.

588
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,440
一定会有解决方案的
这是一次完美的公路旅行
There's got to be a way around this.
This is the perfect motoring trip.

589
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,720
所以我们的目标是
在这次完美公路之旅中
So we go and check in there, in a car,

590
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,520
-开着一辆车到这酒店并入住 -嗯
- on our perfect road trip...
- Yeah.

591
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,160
要求我们第二天早上出来的时候
车还停在原地不动
...we come out in the morning,
it's still there.

592
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
这就是我们的挑战
That's our challenge.

593
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
一定会相当特别
It's going to have to be pretty special.

594
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

595
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,880
然而哈蒙德却选择了
Hammond, however, opted to go

596
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,480
世界上销量最好的车型之一
with one of the best-selling cars
the world has ever seen.

597
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,520
福特T型车
A Model T Ford.

598
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,560
但却有个棘手的问题
And straightaway there was a problem.

599
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
我们不会开这辆车
We didn't know how it worked.

600
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,640
好 等一下
Right, now, look.

601
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,920
让我们把东西理清楚
Let's list the things.

602
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,320
这有三个踏板
There are... There's three pedals.

603
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
你怎么 换挡杆在哪 这是换挡杆吗
How do you... Where's the gear?
Is this the gear? That's...

604
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
哦 如果 我踩的这个不是离合器
HAMMOND: Oh, if it's......
I haven't got my foot on the clutch.

605
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,880
-那不是离合器-好吧
- That isn't the clutch.
- Well, then...

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,720
哪个是油门
Which one's the accelerator?

607
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,480
这是油门
我们确定油门不是在踏板上
That's the accelerator.
It isn't a pedal, I'm sure...

608
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,000
这我怎么踩得到
How am I going to get my foot up there?

609
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
额 那是干啥的
好吧 让我们来启动发动机
- Um... What's that do?
- Right, well, start it.

610
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,360
这才不是启动按钮呢
- That's not the starter!

611
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,920
最终哈蒙德成功发动了
Eventually,
Hammond did make it begin.

612
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,760
但是那时我们才发现他不知道如何刹车
But then we learned
he didn't know how to make it stop.

613
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,160
看看这个是干啥的
Oh, now what have I done?

614
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,960
我们越开越快了
We're going faster!

615
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
那不是手刹
快停下
That's not the handbrake.
Stop it. Stop it.

616
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,440
快停下来
- Stop it now!

617
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,200
好的 向前开
Right, forwards.

618
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,680
-等等 准备好了 -向前开
- Hang on. Now, ready.
- Forwards.

619
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,160
-这可不是向前啊 -完全不是
- That's not forwards.
- No, it's not at all, is it?

620
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
快停下了
Stop it. Make it stop.

621
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
你造吗 这车一点也不想停下来
It doesn't really want to, do you know?

622
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,160
快停下
Make it stop!

623
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,040
额 杰里米 我们阻碍了整个摩纳哥的交通
Uh, Jeremy, we've held up Monaco.

624
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,600
-是吗 -你自己看
- Have we?
- Look.

625
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,720
额滴神啊
Oh, God.

626
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,480
然而很快我就接近目的地了
Soon, however,
we were nearing our destination.

627
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,120
哈蒙德啊 我一般很少这样说
It's not often I say this, Hammond,

628
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,760
但你真是太天才了
but you have been a genius.

629
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
你从没这样夸过我
You have never said that.

630
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,720
因为如果我们都不会开这个车
Because if we can't drive this,

631
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,440
巴黎大饭店的停车员
又有多大几率能开走这车呢
what chance do the valet parkers
at the Hotel de Paris have?

632
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,240
不可能开走
这是我干过最难的事情了
None, it's the hardest thing
I've ever done.

633
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,800
他们会想移走这辆车却无能为力
They'll want to move this
but they won't be able to.

634
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,400
你好 先生
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Hello, sir.

635
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,840
熄火
Shut it down.

636
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,520
交给你了
All yours.

637
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,720
你好
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

638
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,160
你好
Bonjour.

639
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,880
那么停车员们能成功吗
So, would the valet staff
be successful?

640
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,400
很显然他们失败了
No.

641
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,840
论如何打败专职停车员
So, there we go.
That is how to beat the valet parkers.

642
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,760
买一辆他们不会开的车
Buy a car they can't drive.

643
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,680
嗯 但是问题是
Yes, but the problem is

644
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,360
今天我们要驾车
today we are going

645
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,920
从蔚蓝海岸到Saint-Tropez
down the French Riviera to Saint-Tropez

646
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,200
我可不想
and I'm not sure

647
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
开着这车去那里
I want to go in that.

648
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,240
我到哪也不想开这车
I'm not sure
I'd actually go anywhere in It.

649
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,400
这是一辆捷豹E-Type
This is a Jaguar E-Type.

650
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
1962年I系列敞篷版
It's a 1962 Series 1 Roadster

651
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,720
配有美妙的3.8升直六发动机
with the proper 3.8-litre straight six.

652
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,200
而且这可不是一般的1962年E-Type
And it's not just any 1962 E-Type.

653
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,200
这辆车就是我的
It's mine.

654
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,760
我找不到有比这车
And I can think of no car

655
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,360
更加适合这样完美的一天
more perfect for a day like today.

656
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,280
谁说的 我可以
Oh, I can.

657
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,200
因为我开的是一辆V8的F-Type
Because I am in a V8 F-Type.

658
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,880
这比哈蒙德的E-Type更快
This is faster than Hammond's E-Type.

659
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,000
更舒适 更经济 更可靠
It's more comfortable,
more economical, more reliable,

660
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,640
还有空调哦
more air-conditioned

661
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,040
即使要价86,000英镑
And even though it costs Ј86,000,

662
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,440
也比E-Type便宜
it's cheaper.

663
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,040
法国佬 起床啦
Wake up, Frenchies.

664
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,440
哦 这浪声
Oh, that's a racket.

665
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
你能听见这后面的浪声吗
Can you hear the exhausts
from back there?

666
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,720
声音大的在威尼斯都听得到
They can hear them back in Venice.

667
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,680
此时此地开着这辆车
Never has a car been more
perfectly tailored to its environment

668
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,160
我想不到有比这更完美的组合了
than this is here.

669
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,120
这就是土豪阶层的发源地
This is where the jetset was invented.

670
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,440
我能感受到我们身处一个捷豹的世界
We are in Jag country, I can feel it.

671
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,040
餐厅的账单上不可能几十年不被结账
Not a restaurant bill will have been
paid around here for decades.

672
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,960
只有捷豹的轮胎印能够证明他们的去处
Just Jaguar tyre marks
where they've screeched away.

673
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,160
对不起 我开回去拿我的钱包
"I'm sorry.
I'll pop off and get my wallet."

674
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,120
在70年代有个电视剧
There used to be
a TV series in the '70s

675
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,160
叫做The Persuaders
由Roger Moore和Tony Curtis饰演
called The Persuaders!
with Roger Moore and Tony Curtis.

676
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,720
我正在听这电视剧的主题曲
And I'm hearing that music now.

677
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,280
Roger Moore和Tony Curtis
Roger Moore, Tony Curtis,

678
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,880
开着法拉利Dino和阿斯通马丁DBS在这里穿梭
whizzing about down here
in a Ferrari Dino

679
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,000
在这里来回穿梭
and an Aston Martin DBS,

680
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,680
解决各式各样的问题
solving many things,

681
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,120
比如英雄救美
punching men and saving womens.

682
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,400
我也正在享受这个美妙的时刻 直到
I was enjoying it too.
Until...

683
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,440
哈蒙德 毕加索博物馆就在前面
Hammond, the Picasso museum's
along here.

684
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,880
我们可以停下来进去瞧瞧
We could stop and have a look.

685
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,240
有必要吗 我可开着一辆捷豹呢
Really? I'm in a Jaguar,

686
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,600
在法国南部开着我的E-Type
my E-Type, in the south of France,

687
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
你却要我停下来参观一个
and you want me stop driving
to look at a man

688
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,600
耳朵长错地方的男人
whose ears are in the wrong place?

689
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,200
错了 你说的是梵高
No, that was Van Gogh.

690
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,360
毕加索是那个
Picasso's the one who puts eyes

691
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,480
把眼睛放错边的人
on the wrong side of somebody's head.

692
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,920
来嘛 这是趟公路旅行
我们来看点画作
Come on, it's a road trip.
Let's look at some pictures.

693
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,920
你自己听听你刚才说了啥
Did you not hear
what you just said?

694
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,480
这是一场公路之旅 我们去看画画吧
"It's a road trip.
Let's look at some pictures."

695
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,600
不能这样！
No!

696
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,920
你为什么如此没文化？
Oh, why are you so uncultured?

697
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,000
在朱昂莱班 一个所有女孩
In Juan-les-Pins,
where all the girls have

698
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
都特意穿着裸胸泳衣
carefully designed topless swimsuits

699
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,760
圈养赛马也是仅供娱乐 的地方
and racehorses they keep just for fun,

700
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,280
为博一笑 哈哈哈
for a laugh, a-ha-ha.

701
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,760
我们停了下来 让哈蒙德能看点吃的
we pulled over so Hammond could look at some food.

702
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,320
-现在又咋了？ -我不喜欢章鱼
- What now?
- I don't like octopus.

703
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,280
章鱼怎么惹你了？
What's the matter with it?

704
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,480
-额.. -你想试试我的松露煎蛋卷吗？
- Well...
- Do you want my truffles on an omelette?

705
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,880
不喜欢松露 你毁了我的旅行
Don't like truffles.
You are ruining this trip for me.

706
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,760
-继续 -每次我们停下来吃饭
- Go on.
- Every time we stop for food,

707
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
-你就逼我吃章鱼 -很好吃！
- you make me eat octopus...
- It's nice!

708
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,720
或是螃蟹眼睛 蜗牛腿
...or crab's eyes or snail's legs.

709
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
而每次我们一上路 你就又想停下来
And then every time we get going again,
you make us stop again

710
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,600
看一堆砖头还有什么故事里的阳台
to Look at a pile of bricks
and then that balcony from a story.

711
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,760
这是一场公路之旅
It's a road trip.

712
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,120
我们要看风景 瞧瞧我带你来的地方
We're supposed to be seeing...
Look what I've brought you to.

713
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,480
在路上
On the road.

714
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,400
我带你来的是我最喜欢的餐厅之一
I've brought you to one of my favourite restaurants.

715
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,040
-海边的双人餐桌 -不是..
- A table for two by the waterside...
- It's not...

716
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,440
吃了它
Eat it.

717
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,920
-这可不是舌尖上的旅行啊 -快吃
- Not an eating trip, is it?
- Eat it.

718
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,920
-把章鱼吃掉 -它刚动了
- Eat the octopus.
- It moved.

719
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,680
不会的 这只是它其中的一只腿
It didn't. It's only one of its legs.

720
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,120
我..
I...

721
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,680
难道你想在服务区
Would you like to stop
at a service station

722
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,280
吃薯片？
and get some crisps?

723
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,120
午餐后 我们去了海滨散步
After lunch, we went
for a stroll along the seafront

724
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
看风景
to look at the sights.

725
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
但因为这是一档老少咸宜的节目
But because this is a family show,

726
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
我们不能展示看的是何种风景
we can't show you
what those sights were.

727
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,320
然而最终 我们手里的冰激凌化得一点不剩
Eventually, though,our ice creams melted completely

728
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,840
所以我们继续上路
so we set off.

729
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,000
你知道 我们在讨论完美公路之旅
You know we were talking about the perfect road trip?

730
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,360
幸好没有开兰博基尼和布加迪来这里
How wrong would the Lamborghini
and Bugatti have been here?

731
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,400
也没有开福特嘉年华
Or the Ford Fiesta.

732
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,040
是呀
Yeah.

733
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,560
问题在于 当我们到达圣特拉斐
The problem is that when we arrived in Saint-Raphael,

734
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,480
交通状况正如预期
the traffic was predictable.

735
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,200
E-Type也是
And so was the E-Type.

736
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,560
哈蒙德的车听上去很虚弱
Hammond's car is sounding poorly.

737
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,600
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

738
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,800
它能挺过圣特鲁佩斯的堵车吗？
Will it be able to do the traffic jam into Saint-Tropez?

739
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
嗯..
Um...

740
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,560
老实讲 我真的
I'm honestly... I'm really...

741
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,480
我真的很担心它 我说真的
I am worried about her,
actually, I really am.

742
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,800
是吗？
Are you?

743
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,760
哦天啊 听起来真不咋地
Oh, God, that doesn't sound right.

744
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,800
60年代的英国好声音
The sound of Britain in the '60s.

745
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,200
嘠叽嘎叽嘎叽
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding...

746
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,640
为中部的制造业而自豪
"Made in the Midlands with pride.

747
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,760
是我们造出了这么漂亮的车
"Ah, we've really put this together
very nicely, we have, very nice.

748
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,480
我们的E-Type做的很好
"Done a good job with that E-Type, we have."

749
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,680
量油尺太烫了 不能摸
Ow, dipstick's too hot, can't touch that.

750
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,320
-噢 -理查德
- Oh. - Richard.

751
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,840
-干嘛 -我带了点东西给你
- What?
- I've bought you something

752
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
让你高兴起来
to cheer you up.

753
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,920
-是吗？ -一个小礼物
- Have you?
- It's a little present.

754
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,040
呵呵
Is it?

755
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,160
一个渔网
It's a fishing net.

756
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,160
我知道这不是E-Type的作风
I know it's not the same as an E-Type

757
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,680
但现在它不行了 你可以用这个
but now this doesn't work any more,
you can have that.

758
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,360
谢谢你的渔网
Thank you for my fishing net.

759
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,960
只要3欧元 比这车值钱
It's three Euros,which is more than this is worth.

760
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,120
对现在来说
Now.

761
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,160
我有一个主意
I then had an idea.

762
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,960
我们从这里到圣特鲁佩斯来一场比赛
We'll have a race from here to Saint-Tropez

763
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,400
但我们要过夜的 对吧？
but we'll stay the night, yes?

764
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,880
-比赛 -什么意思..
- A race. - What...

765
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,120
不
No.

766
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,640
-别管这些车了 -丢弃捷豹
- Ditch these. - Ditch the Jags.

767
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,760
你也没得选
You've got no choice.

768
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,560
新酒店叫什么名字？巴黎大饭店
What's that new hotel called?Hotel de Paris.

769
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,480
-那有一个天台露天酒吧 -好的
- It's got a rooftop bar.
- Okay.

770
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,160
后到的人
Last one there

771
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,160
要穿一件写着"我爱龟速船长"的衬衫
has to wear an "I love James May" T-shirt

772
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,360
明天一整天
tomorrow, all day.

773
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,200
真是不小的一个处罚啊 但是..
That's quite a forfeit but, um...

774
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
好呀
Yeah.

775
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
我有一条妙计
I have had such a brilliant idea

776
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,240
克拉克森必输无疑
that Clarkson has had it.

777
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,200
因为我将驾驶这车去往圣特鲁佩斯
Because I am going to Saint-Tropez on this.

778
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,000
杜卡迪
The Ducati Diavel.

779
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,480
暗黑
Dark.

780
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,720
-准备就绪 哈蒙德？ -随时待命
- Are you ready, Hammond?
- Yeah.

781
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,320
倒计时 三
In three,

782
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,160
二  一
two, one...

783
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,480
出发！
Go!

784
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,200
好了
All right.

785
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,800
我有很好的理由选这车
I chose this bike for a very good reason.

786
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,000
引擎1200cc V型双缸
The engine, 1200cc V-twin,

787
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,200
源自杜卡迪赛车1198
taken from a Ducati sports bike,the 1198.

788
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,160
相信我 杜卡迪知道如何制造快车
And Ducati, trust me, know a thing
or two about making fast bikes.

789
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,720
162匹马力 英国版本
162 brake horsepower, the UK edition.

790
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,400
在法国 被限制在100
Restricted in France to 100.

791
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,640
但是你知道吗?
But you know what?

792
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,200
但对付我今天的任务是绰绰有余了
That's still going to be plenty
for what I want to do today.

793
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,680
极速170
Top speed about 170,

794
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
0到60mph加速2.5秒
0-60 about two and a half,

795
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,520
你懂的 和布加迪威龙一样
you know, the same as a Bugatti Veyron.

796
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,080
又堵了 你看
Traffic, you see?

797
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,960
他怎么可能摆平这一切?
How's he going to get to even this?

798
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,920
他永远都开不出去
He's never even going to
get out of town.

799
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,360
我看起来很帅 车又是风驰电掣
I Look cooL. It goes Like the clappers.

800
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,400
克拉克森就在这了
Clarkson's had it here.

801
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,480
好了 看到没 没车了
There you go. See that? Clear!

802
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,480
你好
Hello.

803
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,760
你看到的是一辆菲尔兰 Squadron78游艇
You join me on a Fairline Squadron 78.

804
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,560
就是说78英尺长
That's 78 feet long.

805
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,240
这台机器的引擎让人难以置信
The engines in this thing are unbelievable,

806
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,200
32升 两只涡轮增压的V12
32-litre, twin turbocharged V12s.

807
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,240
走起
Here we go.

808
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,720
你可以这么开
And you can drive it like this.

809
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,440
或这样
Or like that.

810
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,600
因为这是一艘船
And because it's a boat

811
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,400
我可以横穿海湾抵达圣特鲁佩斯
I could get to Saint- Tropez across the bay.

812
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,920
然而哈蒙德不得不绕过海湾
Whereas Hammond had to go all the way round it.

813
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,240
穿行在车流中
Sneaking through,sneaking through, just.

814
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,600
每一辆车
Every car counts.

815
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,080
任何一辆都可能是克拉克森
Any one of these could be Clarkson.

816
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,480
他在哪？
Where is he?

817
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,360
如果我超过了他
If I have been past him,

818
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,160
他只能看我裹在皮衣里的屁屁感叹
he would have been looking at my bottom in leather, going,

819
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,760
"哦 看 穿皮裤的男人屁屁" 他就好这口
"Oh, look, a man's bottom in leather."
He's obsessed with it.

820
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,040
我不知道理查德哈蒙德在开什么
I don't know what Richard Hammond is using,

821
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,560
但我猜
but I'm guessing

822
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
是一辆摩托车之类的
it's a motorcycle of some sort.

823
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,080
所以他会从头到脚都是裹着牛皮
So he'll be dressed from head to foot in leather,

824
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,680
恼火于交通堵塞
furious at the traffic,

825
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,160
屁股这样..
with his bottom...

826
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,600
看看我啊 我在开摩托车
"Look at me, I'm on a motorbike.

827
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,760
跨下一个震动的机器
"I'm straddling a throbbing machine!"

828
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,280
我才不会那么做
I'm not doing any of that.

829
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,080
导航带我们驶向圣特鲁佩斯
Got the satnav down here to bring us
onto the bearing of Saint-Tropez.

830
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,320
我还想再快一点
I'm just going to take it up
a little bit more,

831
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,720
2300转
2,300 rpm a side.

832
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,640
你瞧呀 看看这个！
Look at this. Look at this now!

833
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,880
吃我的柴油吧 哈蒙德
Eat my diesel, Hammond!

834
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,840
我只想弯过一个转角
I just want to come round
one of these corners

835
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,360
看见一辆迈凯轮12C
and see a McLaren 12C.

836
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,200
或者 SLS黑色系
Or an SLS Black.

837
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,960
而且被堵的死死的 然后我超过他
And he will be stuck. And I will pass him.

838
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,760
我要问问他 "摩托车
And I will ask him, "Mmm, bikes.

839
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,680
还不够好?"
"Still no good?"

840
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,800
你们有人要喝点吗？
Anyone fancy a drink in the crew?

841
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,600
-要不要？ -好
- Yeah? - Yeah.

842
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,240
不好意思
Excuse me.

843
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,800
非常谢谢
Thanks very much.

844
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,360
又堵车了 又堵车了
Standing traffic. Standing traffic.

845
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,920
来吧 克拉克森 你在哪?
Come on, Clarkson, where are you?

846
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,480
这要没人突然打开门或者左转
As long as nobody opens their door
or suddenly turns left,

847
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,720
我就可以一直这样飚下去
I can just keep hacking through it like this.

848
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,960
你瞧 这就有个开门的
Oh, there you go. That's the door open.

849
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,080
就这一个
That's the one.

850
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,040
总有人会这样 总有一个
That's the fella. There's always one.

851
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,600
他会在任何这些车里 我随时都可能看见他
He's going to be in any one of these. Any minute now I'm going to see him.

852
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,440
这肯定是他了
This has got to be him.

853
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,960
女士们先生们 你好 杰里米·克拉克森
Ladies and gentlemen, hello, Jeremy Clarkson.

854
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,960
不对 不是他
No. That's not him.

855
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
当Squadron正卯足了劲前进
With the Squadron at full chat

856
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,120
圣特鲁佩斯近在咫尺
and Saint-Tropez very close indeed,

857
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,520
船上的时光也美好极了
life on the boat was good.

858
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,920
咕噜噜！
Grunt!

859
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,320
这让它更像一辆杜卡迪了
This is more like it.

860
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,240
不断地前行中
Getting a proper move on.

861
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,600
解决了最差劲的圣拉斐尔的交通
Having cleared the worst of the Saint-Raphael traffic,

862
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,120
我现在正飞速行驶在开阔的道路上
I was now on the open road
and closing fast.

863
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,880
好吧 老实讲
Okay, there is, I'll be honest,

864
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,680
只有很小很小的可能性
a tiny, tiny chance

865
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,960
他从堵塞的交通中开出城市
he got through all of that traffic and out of town

866
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,200
然后在这里横扫千军万马
and then caned it along here

867
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,120
而我还没赶上他
and I simply haven't caught him yet.

868
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,040
但我有理由相信
But I've got a good suspicion

869
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,880
等我们到达圣特鲁佩斯
when we get to Saint-Tropez,

870
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,600
那儿交通会更糟 我就能找到他了
there'll be more traffic
and that is where I'll find him.

871
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,560
我要将78英尺长的船泊入圣特鲁佩斯港口
I'm about to park my 78-foot boat in Saint-Tropez harbour.

872
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,600
这是我唯一的劣势
This is the only slow bit,

873
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,560
进港太慢
the wobbling about
in Saint-Tropez harbour.

874
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,560
因为他们有个傻X的限速
'Cause they've got some stupid speed limit.

875
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,640
哦 天啊 看哪
Oh, good God, Look at this.

876
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,800
堵得水泄不通
Traffic. That's a big jam.

877
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,120
喔!
Oh!

878
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,960
见缝插针 过过过
Squeezing through, coming through,
coming through.

879
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,800
当哈蒙德还在
As Hammond weaved his way

880
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,400
圣特鲁佩斯常年的堵车中挣扎
through the annual Saint-Tropez traffic jam...

881
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,360
哦 我天啊
Oh, my God.

882
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,000
我正在等待被安排一个泊位
I was still waiting to be given a parking space.

883
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,640
过了 过了
Through, coming through, coming through.

884
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,720
巴黎大饭店 谢谢你
Hotel de Paris, I thank you.

885
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,600
兄弟!
Mate!

886
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,280
你怎么样?
How are you?

887
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,080
你怎么...
How...

888
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,080
天啊 你流了好多汗
God, you look sticky.

889
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,080
怎么特么可能?
How the bloody hell?

890
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,040
我没看见你啊 我一次都没有看到你
I didn't see you.I didn't see you once.

891
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,120
我看到了一台F12 我以为是你
I saw a Ferrari F12,I thought it was you.

892
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,040
问题是
Thing is

893
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,280
你只有摩托车驾照
you've got a motorcycle licence.

894
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,080
-是 -而哥手里
- Yes. - Well, now, I have

895
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,720
有游艇驾照
a boat Licence.

896
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,240
当然这就意味着明天嘛
And what this means, of course,is tomorrow,

897
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,920
你会穿上一件很酷的T恤
while you'll be wearing a T-shirt
and that'll be cooler...

898
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,040
天啊 我忘了还有这
Ah, I forgot about that.

899
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,600
上面写着"我爱龟速船长"
...it will say "I love James May" on it.

900
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,560
第二天早上 哈蒙德一点也不急于
The next morning,Hammond was in no hurry

901
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,320
离开酒店
to leave the hotel.

902
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,120
-哈蒙德 -干啥?
- Hammond.- What?

903
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,080
-出来啊哈蒙德 -不要
- Hammond, come out. - No.

904
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,680
内什么 我还在收拾行装
No, I'm a bit...I haven't... I'm just packing my bag.

905
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,440
-已经8点45了 -我还在收拾
- It's quarter to 9:00.
- Yeah, I'm just packing my bag.

906
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,760
我在收拾
I'm packing.

907
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,240
事实上 我身体不太舒服
Actually, no, I'm not very well.

908
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,480
外面没什么人啊
There's nobody here.

909
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,240
-我感觉很糟糕 -哈蒙德!
- I'm poorly.- Hammond!

910
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,280
好吧 我要出来了
Right. I'm coming out.

911
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,560
啧啧啧啧
Ooh.

912
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,880
哦 看啊
Now, look.

913
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,640
-这太糟糕了 -是啊
- This is bad. - Yes.

914
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,080
不过我认为接下来的消息是更糟糕的
But I'm afraid the news gets even worse.

915
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,560
不会更糟了吧
It can't be any worse.

916
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,440
我们被选择了同样的车
We've both chosen the same car.

917
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,080
但是并不糟糕啊 不是么?
Well, that's not so bad, is it?

918
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,760
-你说只有一台车? -是啊
- You mean there's only one?- Yes.

919
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,680
所以 圣特罗佩街头
So, Saint-Tropez,

920
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,480
二男 一敞篷宾利
convertible Bentley, two men.

921
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,760
哦 我们看上去有点
Oh, we are looking...

922
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,320
我才意识到
Just realised.

923
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,200
两个男人坐在一台宾利里面
Two men in a Bentley.

924
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,600
并不只是宾利让我们很显眼
It isn't just the Bentley,
we ought to make that plain.

925
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,000
而是敞篷的问题
It's any convertible.

926
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,040
任何两个男人坐进一部敞篷车
Put two men in a convertible car,

927
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,320
打开车顶之后 问题立刻就出现了
take the roof off and instantly, questions are raised.

928
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,080
好吧 至少在车里 别人看不见我的T恤
Still, at least in the car, they couldn't see my T-shirt.

929
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
直到
Until...

930
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,960
我为什么在这停车?
Why are you pulling over here?

931
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
我想看点东西
I just want to have a look at something.

932
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,000
-看啥? -就是一些东西嘛
-What? -Just stuff.

933
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,880
-什么东西 -呃 我想看看那些船
- What stuff? -Just... I want to look at the boats.

934
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
你到底要干什么
What are you doing?

935
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,800
-这地方不错啊 -我不想停下来
- It's a nice place.
- I don't want to stop.

936
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,960
-这么多人... -出来啊
- There's people......- Just get out.

937
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,200
-不要 -要
-No. -Yes.

938
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,400
-不要! -要!
-No! -Yes.

939
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,960
不要 我要躲起来
No, I'm going to hide.

940
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,880
我不要出去 我就钻进去
I'm not getting out.
I'm getting in here.

941
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,400
就剩下我自己了
I'm on my own.

942
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,480
额滴神啊
Oh, God.

943
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,600
我打算走远点丢下他
I'm just going to go for a walk and leave him.

944
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,080
快结束这一切吧
Make this end.

945
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,480
我就是打赌输了嘛
I Lost a bet.

946
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,840
天啊
Oh, God.

947
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,760
大猩猩我们可以走了么?
Jeremy, can we go now?

948
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,440
不行
No.

949
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,560
这些游艇哪个有螺旋桨
Do any of these boats have propellers

950
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,920
还有哪个现在就可以启动离开的?
and are any of them likely
to be running right now?

951
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,720
又是拍照的 这里八卦围观群众还真多
Paparazzi again.There's quite a lot of paps here.

952
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,520
是啊 我们赶紧走吧
Yeah. So let's go.

953
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,920
但是出现了一个小问题
There was, however,a small problem.

954
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
-是在这里么
-本来就是在这个地方吧
-Was it... -Is this where it was?

955
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,000
-是啊 -显然现在不在了
- Yes. - Well, it's not, is it?

956
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,120
我来告诉你原因吧
I tell you why it's not.

957
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
这里是不能停车的
You can't park here, can you?

958
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,880
你能在这里停车么? 被允许的么...什么?
Can you park here?Are you allowed to... What?

959
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,960
你不能在这停啊 旁边画了一个车被拖走的图
No, you can't park here or that's a picture of a car being towed.

960
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,160
-你知道 我真的是 -车被拖走了?
- Do you know, I genuinely...
- Has the car been towed away?

961
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,760
是的
Well, yes.

962
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,240
你在这等我
Just you wait here

963
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,320
我去取车
and I'll go get it.

964
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,240
-放松点 -好吧
- Just relax. - Yeah.

965
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,520
并没有多远啊 我会在一个小时之内回来
It's not far, actually, I'll be back in an hour.

966
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,320
我相信此时此刻应该会有一个人比我更悲催
I'm sure somebody somewhere at some time has been unhappier.

967
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,790
两小时后

968
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,600
求你了 求你了 求你了 求你了
Please, please, please, please.

969
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,080
这一点也没意思 一点也没意思
No, not funny. Not even halfway funny.

970
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,960
杰瑞米把这该死的车门打开
Open the damn door.
Jeremy, open the door.

971
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,360
你怎么做到的?
How do you do that?

972
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,800
我进来了
I'm getting in.

973
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,240
现在你也许会疑惑
Now, at this point you may be wondering

974
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,640
为什么我们两人都选择了宾利
why both of us chose a Bentley.

975
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,080
一部分原因是我们认为现在的宾利很漂亮
Well, partly it's because we think that these days, it looks good.

976
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,720
最重要的是 现在还装备了一台
But mostly it's because it's now available

977
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,760
更轻量化 而且声浪更棒的4升V8发动机
with a brilliant lighter, louder 4-litre V8.

978
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,680
但哈蒙德脑中最惦记的却不是这个
Not that this was foremost in Hammond's mind.

979
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,280
-杰瑞米克拉克森 -到
- Jeremy Clarkson. - Yes.

980
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,720
你是不是把我的座椅加热开到最大了?
Have you put my seat heater on full?

981
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,920
是啊
Yes, I have.

982
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
哦 老兄这实在是
Oh, mate, that's...

983
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,280
-哦耶! 整到你了 -哦!
- Yes! Result. - Oh!

984
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,640
太糟糕了
Just horrific.

985
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,760
-这就是我想要的结果 -哦!
- That's a result right there. - Oh!

986
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,480
然后我得到了另外一个期待的结果
Then I got another result.

987
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,680
一条干净的 开放公路
A clear, open road.

988
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,560
可能会有一点颠
"It's got a bit of poke."

989
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,640
-哦哦 -这就是本来就该有的声音
- Whoa! - Oh, that's how it should sound.

990
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,840
你知道这是怎样的感觉么?
Do you know what it feels like?

991
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,080
-一台跑车应有的感觉 -是啊
- An sportscar. - It does.

992
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,640
你把我的座椅加热打开了么?
Have you put my seat heater on?

993
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,040
是啊
Yes, I have.

994
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,480
我实在是对不...
I'm really sor...

995
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,160
绝对是一台很棒的车
It's a machine, this.

996
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,120
你好 靓车!
Hello, machine!

997
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,400
这款车让我喜欢的一个主要原因就是
One of the reasons why I like this car so much,

998
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,720
与宾利的徽章无关
you know it isn't just a Bentley badge,

999
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,440
这款车克服了众多的工程难题
there's some properly difficult
engineering that's gone into this car.

1000
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,280
杰瑞米 你是不是又把我的座椅加热打开了
Jeremy, have you put my seat heater on again? You...

1001
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,920
这一点也不
That's not... I...

1002
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,280
哦
Oh.

1003
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,080
如果我坐的高一点
别人就能把我的T恤看的更清楚
And if I lift myself up,they can see my T-shirt better

1004
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,960
如果我坐下去就被烤焦了  上帝啊!
and if I sit down, I cook. God!

1005
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,400
聪明的引擎
So, clever engine,

1006
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,280
智能的四驱系统
clever four-wheel-drive system,

1007
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,240
最近越来越漂亮的外观
looks a lot better these days.

1008
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,400
美妙的声浪
Great noise.

1009
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,600
美妙的声浪
Great noise.

1010
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,080
一台伟大的车子
It's a great car.

1011
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,760
问题是 这车仍然有鲁尼的味道
The problem it has still is that Rooney flavour.

1012
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,160
我说鲁尼的味道是指
The whiff of Wayne means

1013
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,480
开着它出现 你会感觉不好意思
you do feel embarrassed to turn up in it.

1014
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,360
哈蒙德!
Hammond!

1015
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,640
不要再打开我的座椅加热了
Stop putting my seat heater on.

1016
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,000
尽管座椅和车辆与日头一样热辣
Soon, despite the hot seats,
the hot car and the hot sun,

1017
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,800
但是气氛开始变得冷凝了
the atmosphere became frosty.

1018
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,960
因此我们决定分开
So we decided to split up.

1019
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,480
我决定去看一座现在已经大部分坍塌的建筑
And then I decided to look at a building that had mostly fallen over.

1020
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,120
看啊
Look at this.

1021
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,360
这里面有头野猪 看啊
Yes, look, there's a wild boar,there we are.

1022
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,120
这是一幅狩猎图
This is a hunting scene.

1023
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,280
哈蒙德 这有一幅狩猎图!
Hammond, there's a hunting scene!

1024
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,160
哈蒙德!
Hammond!

1025
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,760
这应该是一座陵寝
It's like there's a mausoleum

1026
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,160
-有类似于凯旋门的拱门
-别跟我说话 我不在乎
- and a sort of triumphal arch.
- Don't talk to me, I don't care.

1027
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,680
我不想听 我也不想知道 我真的不想!
I don't want to hear about it.
I don't want to know, I really don't!

1028
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,760
我受够了
I'm sick of it.

1029
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,800
太荒唐了 我吃了螃蟹的眼睛
This is ridiculous. I've eaten crab's eyes,

1030
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,800
我看了一座来自于故事当中的阳台
说真的 现在开始 我要做主了
I've looked at a balcony from a story.
No, seriously, it's my turn.

1031
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,960
轮到我决定下一步要做什么了
It's my turn to decide what we do next.

1032
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,520
我们接下来要做的就是去跑拉力赛
And what we're doing next is going rally driving.

1033
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,040
-什么 开总裁去跑拉力? -不是
- What, in a Maserati Quattroporte?- No.

1034
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,760
-那就是用幻影? -也不是
- And a Rolls-Royce Phantom?- No.

1035
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
我有个好主意
I've had a good idea.

1036
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,440
这里是桑布尔赛道
This is the circuit Sambre,

1037
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,400
充满了法国拉力赛的残酷考验
endless kilometres of unrelenting French rally stage.

1038
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,560
试替哥对这里了如指掌
And a place The Stig knows well.

1039
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,560
-要怎样 -这个嘛
- What? - Well,

1040
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,440
这就是试替哥的避暑山庄啊
this is The Stig's summer retreat, yeah?

1041
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,600
每年夏天他都来这边 干这个
He comes here every year and does that.

1042
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,080
-而且他说... -你说干这个是什么意思
- And he says... - What do you mean, he does that?

1043
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,640
在冬天 他去开雪地赛道
夏天一到 他就来这儿
Well, in winter he goes ice racing.
Summer, he comes here.

1044
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,000
三个礼拜 不停的干这个
Three weeks of that he does.

1045
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,120
-什么 都不带休息? -对 钻进汽车 三个礼拜
- What, non-stop? -Yeah, gets in the car, three weeks,

1046
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,840
三礼拜后 钻出汽车 回家
and then three weeks later,
gets out, goes home.

1047
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,640
这就是他的假日
不管怎样 他说我们可以用这个赛道
That's his holiday. Anyway, he says we could use it

1048
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,920
来开拉力
to do our rally driving.

1049
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,280
-天太热了 -啊哈
- It's too hot. - Dah!

1050
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,840
我正好也想到这个问题了
I have actually thought of that.

1051
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,280
-你喜欢敞篷车不是么 -没错
- You like a convertible, don't you? - Yeah.

1052
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,840
那我们干嘛不用敞篷车来开拉力呢
Why don't we rally-drive convertibles?

1053
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,280
-灰尘太多 -拜托 就帮我这一次忙
- It's too dusty. - Now, do one thing for me,

1054
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,080
我们出去弄两辆敞篷车
we're going to go and get
some convertibles,

1055
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,600
把他们改装成拉力车 然后干这个!
turn them into rally cars and do that!

1056
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,480
我不会开拉力赛啊
I can't do rally driving.

1057
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,640
-很简单啊 你只要... -我干不来啊!
- It's easy, just... - I can't!

1058
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,080
我在没抓地力的路面上不会...
I can't drive on loose surfaces...

1059
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,180
过了很久

1060
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,520
这是我的选择
This is what I've got.

1061
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,840
尼桑 350Z
Nissan 350Z.

1062
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,600
3.5升V6
Three-and-a-half-litre V6,

1063
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,760
276匹马力 后轮驱动
276 brake horsepower, rear-wheel drive.

1064
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,600
你可能看着它 心想
Now, you might be looking
at it, thinking, "Well,

1065
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,880
它看上去不太像拉力车啊
"it doesn't look much like a rally car."

1066
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,000
但别急 这车可是Datsun 240Z的
But hold on,this car is a direct descendant

1067
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,720
直系后代
of the Datsun 240Z,

1068
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,440
那可是曾经统治过国际拉力赛场的赛车
a car that owned world rallying.

1069
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,880
所以这车可谓血统纯正
So this has got history.

1070
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,960
它必定会表现得很棒
It's going to be brilliant.

1071
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,880
我选了一辆宝马
I've got a BMW.

1072
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,080
完全没有半点拉力血统
这也是我喜欢它的原因
No history of rallying at all,
it's one of the reasons I like it.

1073
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,000
别这样 给我们说说它多大排量
Well, come on, tell us about it,
what engine has it got?

1074
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,680
2.5升直6
Two-and-a-half-litre straight 6.

1075
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,920
比尼桑少了一升 马力呢?
1000cc less than the Nissan. Power?

1076
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,280
192?

1077
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,520
大概少了80 扭矩呢？
That's about 80 horsepower less. Torque?

1078
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,080
180
180.

1079
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,480
-大概也少了80 -很好!
- That's about 80 torques less. - Good!

1080
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,880
-很好是什么意思 -就是很好
-What do you mean, "good"? -Good!

1081
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,000
杰瑞米 你在这事上还没进入竞争状态啊
Jeremy, you're not really getting into the competitive spirit of this.

1082
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,040
我不喜欢在没有摩擦力的地方开车
I don't like driving without friction!

1083
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,560
敞篷拉力赛会马上成为下一个热点
Open-top rally is going to be the next big thing.

1084
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,080
我们赶紧把这些车改装成拉力车去
Let's go and convert these into rally cars.

1085
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,080
这意味着我们要找到个车间 然后放音乐
This meant finding a workshop and cueing the music.

1086
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
搞定
Got it.

1087
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,520
唔 赞
Oh, yes.

1088
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
天啊 我真厉害
God, I'm good.

1089
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,280
这就应该能把我和理查德在马力上
That will make up for the horsepower deficit

1090
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,800
的差距补回来了
that I have on Richard's car.

1091
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,120
手写"涡轮"
TURBO

1092
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,880
八月先生
This is August.

1093
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,040
四月先生
Now Mr April.

1094
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,400
我的防滚架搞定了
My roll-cage is complete.

1095
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,040
第二天 我们的战车蓄势待发
The next day,
our cars were ready.

1096
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,480
天气也一样
- And so was the sky.

1097
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,200
这真是太棒了
This is all just fantastic.

1098
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,720
突然间 就变成了完美的拉力天气
Suddenly, perfect rallying
weather is coming.

1099
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,760
一点小雨 泥泞 山上还有点雾气
Bit of rain, mud, mist on the hills,

1100
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,080
我的车也状态完美
and my car is now perfect.

1101
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
我并没有改得过头
Haven't gone over the top
with the modifications.

1102
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,640
新轮毂 新轮胎 防滚架
New wheels, new tyres, roll-cage,

1103
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,000
赞助商贴纸 BBC要求不能用真的
sponsorship stickers,
can't have real ones,

1104
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,640
但我们伪造了赞助商 让你感受赛车的氛围
BBC objects, but we've made 'em up
to put you in the mood.

1105
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,720
车内 赛车座椅 四点式安全带 足够了
Inside, racing seat,
full harness, that's enough.

1106
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,640
这应该是完美的一天
This is going to be amazing.

1107
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
我就照他抄了
I just copied him.

1108
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,160
而现在他就要在泥地里开他的达特桑了
And now he's going to drive about
in his Datsun in the mud.

1109
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,720
他说的没错 我等不及了
He was right I couldn't wait.

1110
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,080
啊 爽
Oh, yes!

1111
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,200
天上下雨 我在跑拉力赛 真是完美啊
It's actually raining, I'm in a rally.
This is perfect!

1112
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,240
在吃了一路这么多傻缺食物 看了那么多石头后
After all the stupid food
and looking at rocks.

1113
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,200
能够在这里干这样一件由衷让人激动
而且如此真实的事情
to come out and do something
genuinely exciting and real and...

1114
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,520
我觉得我复活了
I've come alive.

1115
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
嗷 爽
Oh, yes!

1116
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,720
理查德 现在 还在外面
Hammond is out now in that.

1117
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,320
那个人已经疯了!
The man is insane!

1118
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,840
来吧 让我再爽爽 来啊
Bring it on, let's have more. Come on!

1119
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
这还叫下雨?
You call that rain?

1120
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,440
喔吼吼吼
Oh!

1121
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,520
这是当下全世界我最喜欢的地方
This is my favourite place
in the world now.

1122
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,640
啊
Ah!

1123
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,920
不好意思 理查德 给我解释一下
I'm sorry, Hammond,
do try to explain it to me,

1124
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,080
我怎么也弄不明白
'cause I'm struggling to get it.

1125
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,800
这是好一阵子以来 我最欢乐的时光
It's about the most fun
I've had in a very long time.

1126
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,440
我理解为什么试替哥会来这儿了
I can see why The Stig comes here.

1127
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,400
-你浑身都是泥啊 -没错
- You're covered in mud.
- Yeah.

1128
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,960
-天上还打着响雷啊 -没错我知道
- There's a massive thunderstorm raging.
- Yeah, I know.

1129
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,000
我知道 就连天气也比前几天要好 完美极了
I know, even the weather's better here.
It's perfect.

1130
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,200
你说比前几天要好是什么意思
What do you mean, it's better?

1131
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,240
-理查德 我真必须要这么干么 -没错
- Hammond, do I have to do this?
- Yep.

1132
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,400
今天听我的 这就是我们今天要做的事情
It's my thing today,
and this is what we're doing.

1133
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,520
所以 为了表明我多么的有肚量
And so, to show
what a good sport I am,

1134
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,320
我满足他
I obliged.

1135
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,760
哦老天爷
Oh, God's truth!

1136
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,640
哦疼疼疼
Oh! That hurt.

1137
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,000
恩 不舒服
So, discomfort...

1138
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,800
嗷这简直太让人不爽了
Oh! That's just horrible!

1139
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,080
危险
Danger.

1140
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,400
凄惨 冷
Misery, cold.

1141
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,880
以30km/h的时速滑行
Slithering around at 21 miles an hour.

1142
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,240
哦哦去他娘的...
Oh, no! Bloody...

1143
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,600
我被淋了一身屎黄浆水
I've just had a brown shower.

1144
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,520
这真的是最后一根稻草
That really was the final straw.

1145
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,640
然后我发现这居然不是
And then it turned out it wasn't.

1146
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,640
好了 我们跑过了 熟悉了这个赛道
So, we got the hang of it,
we now know the course, yeah?

1147
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,920
下面是计时赛
Time for timed laps.

1148
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,040
-什么 -那 接下来开始计时
- What?
- Well, we do timed laps now,

1149
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,440
我们这样来 如果我们各开十圈
that's what we do.
I reckon if we do 10 each

1150
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,640
就能看出我们的稳定性如何
and then we can just work out
how consistent we are,

1151
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,320
究竟在哪里能快上个几秒 没错吧
where we can just
shave those extra seconds out, yeah?

1152
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,920
明天 你要被我逼着吃
Tomorrow, you are going to eat

1153
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,160
獾的左蛋蛋
a badger's left teste.

1154
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,840
所以 无视常识的我们
And so, flying
in the face of common sense,

1155
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,720
又回到了赛道上
we got back out there.

1156
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,280
计时赛 所以真的是非常关键
Timed laps now, so it's really critical

1157
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,240
你需要足够勇敢 持续踩下油门
to just be brave enough
to keep that power in.

1158
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,960
计时赛 那有什么意义啊
What's the point
of timed laps?

1159
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,040
他比我多了80 嗷... 多了80bhp
He's got 80 more horsepower...
Oh! ...more than I have.

1160
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,360
他开拉力比我厉害
He's better at it than I am.

1161
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,120
他还有一套限滑差速器
And he's got
a limited-slip differential.

1162
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,520
我没有那东西
I haven't got one of those.

1163
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,280
因此 在过弯的时候 根本控制不了
一个轮子在不停空转
So, when I go round the corner,
one wheel spins and that's It.

1164
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,760
喔吼吼吼 操控正确的时候感觉真是太爽了
Woo-hoo! God, it feels
good when you get it right.

1165
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
哇!
Whoa!

1166
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,400
嗷 嗷 天啊
Oh! Oh, my!

1167
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
他会被...哈哈哈哈
He will have been...

1168
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,360
哦他开过来了 我从这就能看到他的牙齿
Oh, here he comes,
I can see his teeth from here.

1169
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,080
好了 在拉力赛道上超车 这可不多见
Right, overtaking on a rally stage.
This is interesting.

1170
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,320
哦他要超过去了
Oh, he's coming through!

1171
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,120
哦不 那个小不点伯明翰人超过去了
Oh, no! The hideous little Brummie
has torn past!

1172
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,320
啊哈 套你一圈
A-ha! Got you!

1173
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,840
哦他过去了 他把各种情况...
Oh, he's done it......
Oh, he's just made everything

1174
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,440
变得更糟了 我啥都看不见了
much worse now, I can't see a thing.

1175
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
眼镜上全是泥
Muddy goggles.

1176
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,160
我想弄断他胯下的所有骨头
Every bone in his crotch,
that is what I'm going to break.

1177
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,480
嗷 呸
Oh!

1178
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,520
没过多久 天气变得更坏了
Soon, the weather got so bad,

1179
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,000
连理查德也看不清赛道了
even Hammond couldn't
see where he was going.

1180
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,160
操 操 嗷
Shit! Shit! Oh!

1181
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,240
所以 他建议我们休息 来一顿特制的拉力午餐
So, he suggested we stop
for one of his special rallying lunches.

1182
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,560
恩 赞 大吃一顿
Mmm. Okay, tuck in.

1183
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,840
-真的? -嗯嗯
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1184
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,000
吃这个是因为当地以热狗出名的么
'Cause this part of France
is famous for its hotdogs.

1185
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,960
它上面可是有法国芥末
It's got French mustard on it.

1186
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,520
-是啊 -等一下
- Yeah...
- Wait a minute.

1187
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,600
怎么
What?

1188
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,800
你知道这个香肠里有什么吧
You do know what's
in that sausage, don't you?

1189
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,520
-香肠啊 -猪的指甲
- Sausage.
- Pigs' toenails,

1190
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
眼睫毛
eyelashes...

1191
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,160
闭嘴给我好好享受 不管怎样
在你享受的时候 我拿到了我们的圈速
Shut up and enjoy it. And, anyway, while
you enjoy it, I've got the timings here.

1192
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,960
我大约在1分16 1分13这个水平
I'm around the 1:16, 1:13,
that kind of mark.

1193
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,800
-嗯哼 -你在1分53 1分46
- Mmm-hmm.
- You're 1:53, 1:46...

1194
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,680
我耳朵里都进泥了
I've got soil in my ears!

1195
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,920
1分35 1分40 所以基本上很明确
135, 140... Basically, what this
is showing is that I am clearly

1196
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
我比你强太多了
a lot better at this than you.

1197
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,440
-我和你做个交易 -什么
-I'll do you a deal.
-What?

1198
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,360
我们再开一圈
We will do one more lap.

1199
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,560
决一死战的一圈
Do-or-die lap.

1200
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,120
如果我开得比你快的话 我们立刻走人
If I'm faster, we leave immediately.

1201
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,400
-如果你比我快 -对
-If you're faster than me?
-Yes.

1202
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,080
好 如果我比你快 我们一直开到天黑
All right, well, if I'm faster,
we carry on till dark.

1203
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,240
-你觉得怎样 -嗯嗯
- You'll do that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1204
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
-真的? -嗯嗯
- Seriously?
- Mmm-hmm.

1205
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,040
好啊
All right.

1206
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,080
我先出发
I went first.

1207
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,000
法语 3 2 1 出发

1208
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,280
出发了
And we're off.

1209
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,680
其实我不光想要赢他 我还想羞辱他
Right, now, I don't want to just
beat him, I want to humiliate him.

1210
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,760
哦耶 就应该这样
Oh, yes! That was correct.

1211
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,320
喔!
Oh!

1212
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,040
刚才下面有一个巨大的坑啊
That was a monstrous dump
from below there.

1213
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,920
大自然也加入了我们
Nature is joining in with us now.

1214
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,720
这真是欢乐无比啊
Oh, this is just epically good fun.

1215
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,760
好了杰里米 我觉得你要是只比我慢1分以内
All right, Jeremy, I reckon if you get
within a minute of that,

1216
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,080
我会很惊讶的 你没机会了
I'll be staggered. Not a chance.

1217
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,200
我自信满满
Filled with determination,

1218
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,240
策"马"阵前 准备出击
I lined up the BMW on the start line.

1219
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,960
3 2 1 出发

1220
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,360
恩 我绝对会赢
Right, I am going to win this

1221
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,720
然后我们就不用再干这个了
and then we can stop doing it.

1222
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,440
这会是...噢慢着
That's... Oh! Hang on a minute.

1223
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,000
耶
Yes!

1224
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,560
你觉得怎么样
What do you think of that?

1225
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,440
悄悄的干活 打枪的不要
Sneaky beaky. Yes!

1226
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,840
耶!
Yes!

1227
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,560
连老天爷都站在我这边
The gods are on my side.

1228
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,400
这回的圈速绝对慢不了
This is going to be one hell of a Lap!

1229
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,280
随后我们一起去看我们跑的怎么样
We then met up to see how we'd done.

1230
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,840
哈蒙德 你的成绩是1分17秒3
Richard Hammond, you did
it in one minute, 17.3.

1231
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,320
虽然比不上我的最快圈速 但也不算慢
已经是个很高的起点了
- Not my fastest but not bad.
- Well, it was a standing start.

1232
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,320
-那是 绝对的 -继续 然后呢
It was, yes, of course it was.
Yes, go on, them.

1233
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,920
-我是 28秒 -多少
- Me, 28 seconds...
- Yes?

1234
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,960
一分多少
One minute what?

1235
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,320
没有一分 就是28秒
28 seconds.

1236
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,320
你怎么可能连一分钟都不到
How did you find a minute in the...

1237
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,960
-不可能吧 -只能说我是终极驾驶机器
- I mean...
- Ultimate driving machine.

1238
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,000
还有宝马Z4的功劳
And a BMW Z4.

1239
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,520
是吗
Really?

1240
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,640
我立马开溜
I left immediately.

1241
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,800
然后踏上了前往波城的最后350英里
And set off on the 350-mile drive to Pau

1242
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,040
驾驶着一辆V12阿斯顿马丁
in a V12 Aston Martin.

1243
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,240
而哈蒙德开着一辆大众甲壳虫
Hammond, meanwhile,
was in a Volkswagen Beetle

1244
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,240
和往常一样抱怨着
and moaning, as usual.

1245
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,080
他这个作弊已经无法无天了
His cheating is getting out of control.

1246
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,400
这样的话还有什么意思
要是他动不动就用Stig做替身
There's no point doing anything
if he's just going to borrow The Stig

1247
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,680
或者抄近路 这是我能想到的唯一可能性
or cut a corner, which I can only
imagine is what he did in that instance.

1248
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,480
他肯定抄了一条相当近的路 这也太明显了吧
It must have been one hell
of a corner, he can't even cheat well!

1249
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,480
我承认我那近路抄的有点夸张
I admit my shortcut was a bit short.

1250
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,360
而且耗时有点短得离谱 不过看看好的一面
And the time was a bit implausible.
But look,

1251
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,040
不仅天气好多了
我现在还开上了阿斯顿马丁Vanquish
the weather is improving and now
I'm in an Aston Martin Vanquish.

1252
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,240
这车真心了不起
This is a truly magnificent car.

1253
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,800
算是这么长时间以来最好的一辆马丁
Best Aston yet by a long way.

1254
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,400
它是介于狂野的DBS和温和的Virage
It's a blend of the hardcore DBS

1255
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,640
之间的一种调和
and the slightly softer Virage.

1256
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,320
简直是太完美了
It's just tremendous.

1257
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,320
下面我就要请出哈蒙德
And now I shall hand you
over to Richard Hammond,

1258
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,600
来向你解释为什么他那辆保时捷911
who shall try to explain
why the Porsche 911

1259
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,480
在某些鬼知道的方面
that he's driving
is in some way different

1260
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,240
跟所有老款的911有什么不同
to all the Porsche 911s
that have gone before.

1261
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,880
他居然还有脸说911都长一个样
How can he go on about 911s
all being the same?

1262
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,640
那咱们来看看所谓的阿斯顿马丁 系列
Let me talk you through
the Aston Martin range.

1263
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,560
Vantage V8, V12 Vantage,

1264
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,160
DB9  DBS  Virage 还有前面那货
DB9, DBS, Virage, that.

1265
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,080
那才叫一个模子里刻出来的吧
they're all exactly the same.

1266
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,240
阿斯顿马丁设计了这个造型
Aston Martin came up with the design.

1267
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,760
他们觉得 哎 这看起来不错
thought, "Oh, that looks pretty.

1268
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,120
不如给它起不同的名字吧
这样就会有更多的人来买了
"Let's call it lots of different things
and then more people will buy it."

1269
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,960
眼前就是个例子
It's just another one.

1270
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,640
同一辆车取名为C2 C2S C4 C4S
C2, C2S, C4, C4S,

1271
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:32,720
还可以叫GT2 GT3 Turbo 997 996 993
GT2, GT3, Turbo, 997, 996, 993...

1272
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,120
新911的型号叫991
The new 911 is called the 991,

1273
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,160
车身比上一代要更宽更长
it's longer and wider
than the previous 911.

1274
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,840
新引擎 新变速箱 新内饰和新的转向系统
It's got a new engine, new gear box,
new interior and new steering.

1275
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,320
这是最关键的地方 911第一次
This is the critical point,
for the first time,

1276
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,760
使用了电子转向而不是液压转向
the steering is electric
rather than purely hydraulic.

1277
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,680
就当我刚刚找着状态的时候
Just as I was getting into the groove,

1278
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,200
杰里米又找了个地方停下了
Jeremy pulled off again.

1279
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,280
你又干嘛啊
What now?

1280
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,280
既然我们明天就要到波城了
Well, I thought it would be a good idea,
since we're at Pau tomorrow,

1281
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,640
我觉得我们应该重新熟悉一下
to reacquaint ourselves with the concept

1282
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,520
在摩擦力作用下驾驶的概念
of driving while under
the influence of friction.

1283
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,840
我不喜欢摩擦力
I don't like friction.

1284
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,040
波城啊哥们 那可是波城
Pau, mate. It's Pau.

1285
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,800
人家从1901年就开始赛车了
They've been racing there since 1901.

1286
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,800
Fangio曾经在那里比过赛
Fangio has raced there,

1287
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,160
还有Jim Clark Jackie Stewart
那可不是一个随便的地方
Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart.
This is a big deal.

1288
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,360
那可是 好比所有汽车爱好者的伯利恒圣城
This is... It's Bethlehem
for any motoring enthusiast.

1289
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,960
可那跟这个赛道有什么关系
So, what's it got to do with that?

1290
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,680
我们得找到比赛的状态才行
We've got to get match fit.

1291
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,760
这样等我们明天到了波城
And then when we get to Pau tomorrow...

1292
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,840
-我们就能值回票钱 -没错
- We'll be worthy of it.
- Mmm-hmm.

1293
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,600
一上赛道 我顿时就开心了起来
Straightaway,I was very happy.

1294
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,120
没有湿乎乎的赛道 没有泥巴
No wet track, no mud,

1295
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,480
没有下不停的雨 也没有得白喉的可能
no rain, no diphtheria.

1296
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,800
这真是一条紧凑蜿蜒的赛道
This is one
tight and twisty little track.

1297
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,400
好的 下面我们就让这辆阿斯顿
Right, now, let's turn the Aston

1298
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,520
从公路车变的更赛道化一点
from a road car into something
more track-based.

1299
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,520
按下这个让悬挂变得更硬的按钮
We'll push this button here,
that firms up the suspension.

1300
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,720
再按这个S按钮 我猜它的意思是 傻缺模式
and then push this one, S,
I think it stands for "silly".

1301
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,440
因为当你按下它的时候 准备好了吗
'Cause when you push it... Ready?

1302
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,830
整辆车好似瞬间变身 "嗯 要干嘛？"
好比向狗狗下达"朝前走" 的命令一样
The whole car goes, "Hmm, what?"
It's like saying "walkies" to a dog.

1303
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,220
"真的 主人？ 向前走？"
"Oh, really? WaIkies?"

1304
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,200
这辆车所用的引擎跟老版Vanquish一样
This has the same basic engine that
was fitted to the original Vanquish.

1305
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,440
这在当时是能够比肩法拉利550的引擎
And that was comparable
at the time to the Ferrari 550

1306
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,040
或者是575
or 575.

1307
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,640
但从那以后 法拉利继续发展
人家都生产出F12那样的车了
Since then, Ferrari have moved on,
they're at the F12 now.

1308
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,120
这车的变速器甚至都不是双离合
This doesn't even have
a double-clutch gearbox.

1309
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,000
而是老式的七速顺序变速器
It's an old 7-speed slushmatic.

1310
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,920
每次换挡都像是一个年长的男仆完成的
Each gear is delivered
by an elderly butler.

1311
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,960
-我想换三档了 吉夫斯 -没问题先生
"I'd like third now, Jeeves."
"Certainly, sir, I'll just

1312
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,760
我就去拿 应该放在餐具室了
"pop off and get it.
I think it's in my pantry.

1313
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,200
给您拿来了 先生
"There you are, sir."

1314
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,160
换挡非常顺畅 应付公路绰绰有余
但在赛道上就不合适了
Very smooth,
lovely on the road, not brilliant here.

1315
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,840
这车开起来有点像方舟
It's a bit of an ark, this.

1316
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,560
而且是非常 非常漂亮的方舟
It's a very pretty ark.

1317
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,920
不过每当在赛道上攻入一个弯的时候
But when you stick it into
a corner on a track...

1318
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,800
你能够感觉到在这副碳纤维的身躯下
you know that beneath
the carbon fibre body,

1319
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,440
每个零件都感觉有点年事已高
everything's a bit old.

1320
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,280
不过如你所见 倒不是说老就一定不好
Not that theres much
wrong with old, as you can see.

1321
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,600
与此同时 在落后我很多的地方
Mean while, far behind...

1322
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,280
哈蒙德在新911强大的抓地力下撒着欢儿
Hammond was
revelling in the new 917's grip.

1323
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,240
天呐 这玩意就和长在地上似的
God, this thing is planted.

1324
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,040
依旧是3.8升的水平对置六缸引擎
Still a 3.8-litre flat six,

1325
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,960
依旧位居车尾 依然那么紧凑
it's still mounted at the back
of the car, it's still compact.

1326
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,120
不过最大的问题 还是电子转向
The big issue, though,
is that electric steering.

1327
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,680
它根本没有向我沟通 没有
它本应该反馈给我各种信息
It's not talking to me. It's not...
It should be telling me everything

1328
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,520
比如加速过弯的时候前面切弯稍浅
by going slightly
light at the front under power.

1329
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,720
这意味着前轮比于普通的车
It means the front wheels can move
around a little bit more

1330
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,520
可以再多打一点方向
than they would in an ordinary car.

1331
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,600
而方向盘本应该告诉我这一切
And the steering wheel
should be telling me about that,

1332
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,040
这才能让我知道它是911
that's what lets me know it is a 911

1333
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,360
而不是R8或者捷豹什么的
and not an R8 or a Jaguar.

1334
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,520
你要问我这车有没有那种911韵味
Does it feel like a 911?

1335
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,920
我还真不觉得有
I don't think it does.

1336
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,800
要是为波城选战车的话
我想要比它跟纯一点的
And for Pau, I want something
that's more of a 911.

1337
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,240
而我已经有了个很好的想法
And I've had a very good idea for that.

1338
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,400
我应该用这车
I shall be using this,

1339
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,080
全新的保时捷911GT3
the brand-new Porsche 991 GT3.

1340
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,800
我太想开这车了
I am desperate to drive it.

1341
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,160
更轻 更强 更快
It's lighter, lower, faster.

1342
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,840
它就是我的独角兽
This is my unicorn,

1343
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,960
我的女神
my Helena.

1344
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,480
GT3或许在赛道方面更专业
Track-focused the GT3 may be,

1345
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,920
但是在波城 它跟我的选择根本没得比
but at Pau, it would be no
match for my choice.

1346
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,520
单座的BAC Mono
The single-seater BACMono.

1347
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,880
我们测试赛道上有史以来最快的车之一
One of the fastest cars ever
to take on the Top Gear test track.

1348
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,720
极致的简洁 轻盈 灵动 平衡
Purity simplified,
light, agile, balanced.

1349
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,440
完美
Perfect.

1350
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,280
当工作人员正为明天的大日子准备车子时
As men set about fettling our cars
for the big day...

1351
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,000
我们俩回顾了在这段旅程中我们所驾驶的
we ruminated on all the boats
and bikes and cars

1352
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,520
所有摩托车 汽车 船
that we 'd used on our journey.

1353
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,200
哈蒙德!
- Hammond!

1354
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,360
试图找出我们最喜欢的那一个
And we tried to work out
which one we 'd liked the best.

1355
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,080
我大爱那辆小嘉年华ST 真心的
I loved that little Fiesta ST,
I really did.

1356
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,520
虽然听着很疯狂 但那辆福特T型我也喜欢
I actually loved driving the Model-T,
crazy though that is.

1357
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,760
杜卡迪也令人十分享受
I enjoyed the Ducati.

1358
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,120
但是不知为何 法拉利F12确实让我倾心
But for some reason, the Ferrari F12
has really stayed with me.

1359
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,640
我觉得它有那种韵味和戏剧性
更不用说它的速度!
I thought it had presence and drama
and it's fast!

1360
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,480
我不会选SLS 因为日常开着有点过了
I wouldn't have the SLS 'cause
that's too much to use every day.

1361
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,360
高尔夫GTI会有点不够用
Golf GTI isn't quite enough.

1362
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,080
布加迪威龙的话就完全不是一个级别了
Bugatti Veyron, I mean it's
the other end of the scale, then.

1363
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,880
也太过了 宾利的话
Too much. Bentley...

1364
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,160
虽然是辆好车但是...
我知道究竟喜欢哪个了
Oh, it's a great car but...
I've worked out what I'd have.

1365
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,680
Riva Aquarama那条船
The Riva Aquarama.

1366
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,280
-那是你最喜欢的 车 -是的
- That's your favourite car?
- Yes.

1367
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,280
要是让我天天用 我会选那个
不过那样我就得搬家喽
That's what I'd use every day.
I'd have to move house.

1368
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,160
选出我们最喜欢的那辆
我们重新坐上了自己的公路车
With that decided,
we climbed back into our road cars

1369
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,480
驶上前往波城的最后一段路
for the final push to Pau.

1370
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,080
即将到达波城 我俩十分激动
We were very excited by what lay ahead,

1371
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,640
太激动了 以至于我们把摄制组落了很远
so excited that we left
the camera crew far behind.

1372
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,960
当他们终于追上的时候 却出了点小状况
And when they finally caught up with us,
there was a bit of a problem.

1373
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,800
护照是吧
You mean, passports?

1374
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,760
对 坏了
Oh, right

1375
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,280
法国的警察和女警们
The French policemen and lady policemen

1376
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,440
坚持要我们交出所有的钱
insisted that we should give
them all our money.

1377
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,920
而在一段长谈之后
And then after quite a long chat,

1378
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,240
他们不允许我们在法国境内再开车了
they decided it would be best
if we didn't drive in France any more.

1379
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,800
好 没问题
Yeah, okay.

1380
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,200
那么伴随着这个爆炸性新闻 我们该结束了
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

1381
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,480
非常感谢各位的收看 再见
Thank you very much for watching,
goodbye.

1382
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
你个纯种的笨蛋
You total plonker!

1383
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,720
我可不想坐进一辆标志 或者波罗
I don't want to go in a Peugeot or a Polo

1384
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,000
或者是沃克斯豪尔 Zafira
Or this Vauxhall Zafira.

1385
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,000
我们要搭顺风车啊 怎么还能那么挑剔
Can you be picky
when you're a hitchhiker?

1386
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,680
我觉得完全可以啊 反正有那么多选择
I should think so.
There's plenty of choice.

1387
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,040
老子也不想坐雪铁龙
Don't want to go in that Citroen.

1388
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:23,700
不要着急关呦
