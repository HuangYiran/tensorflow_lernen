谢谢你 Tim
Thank you, Tim.

5
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:34,486
可怜的姑娘
You poor dear.

6
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,306
可能根本就没听到车来的声音
Probably didn't even hear it coming.

7
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,526
嘿 Tony在哪儿
Hey, where's Tony?

8
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,977
我不知道
I don't know.

9
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,279
我说我可以载他一程
I offered to give him a lift,

10
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,314
但他说会有人来接他
but he said someone would pick him up.

11
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,815
从华盛顿到匡蒂科吗
From DC to Quantico?

12
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,617
我听着也觉得奇怪
Sounded strange to me, too.

13
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,503
我真不知道 没有车他怎么活
I don't know how he's surviving without a car.

14
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,923
是他吗
Is that him?

15
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,041
不 是Delilah
No. It's Delilah.

16
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,877
我们在计划着如何忙里偷闲度过一个美好的周末
We're talking about sneaking away for a long weekend.

17
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,295
不错嘛
Nice.

18
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:02,213
你们两个小女生要是聊完了
If you hens are finished,

19
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,882
就过来帮我个忙
I could do with some help.

20
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,017
噢 好的
Oh, yes.

21
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,386
她是海军陆战队下士 名叫Jody Ray
Her name's Petty Officer Third Class Jody Ray.

22
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:10,555
巡逻队员在日出后发现了她的尸体
Patrol spotted her body just after sunrise.

23
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:12,006
她在海军基地诊所工作
She works at the base clinic.

24
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,942
昨晚九点打卡下班
Punched out just after 21:00 last night.

25
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:15,443
然后她跑着回去吗
And she went for a run?

26
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,845
同事说她在为马拉松做准备
Coworker said she was training for a marathon.

27
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,398
过去的几个月里她几乎每晚都跑步
Had been running almost every night for the past few months.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,783
通知近亲了吗?
Next of kin been notified?

29
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,368
伤亡援助电话处正在处理 先生

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,686

32
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,577
抱歉 来迟了

33
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,213
嗨 Jimmy
Hey, Jimmy.

34
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,300
所以我错过了什么
So, what did I miss?

35
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,428
谁开车送你过来的
Who was it that drove you all the way over here?

36
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,223
噢
Oh.

37
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,673
一个朋友
A friend.

00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,375
认真点儿
No, seriously.

39
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:48,709
我是认真的
Seriously.

40
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,562
我该干什么 拍照吗
What should I do, photograph?

41
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:51,879
不 我已经拍过了
No, I already did it.

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,816
呃 好吧
Egh. All right.

43
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:57,218
Duck
Duck?

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,771
昨晚
Last night, 22:00 hours,

45
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,056
十点左右
or thereabouts.

46
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:16,237
嗨 Abbs
Hey, Abbs.

47
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,738
有什么发现
Come up with anything?

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,290
有进展
Making progress.

49
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,509
你看
Look, okay, this is a part

50
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,962
这是这辆车车头灯装置的一部分
of the vehicle's headlight assembly.

51
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,246
它的制造商和型号是什么
What's the make and model?

52
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,632
在美国
There are 47 manufacturers

53
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,968
有47家小汽车和货车的制造商
of cars and trucks in the United States.

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,937
每家生产的汽车 型号和外形都多种多样
Each one of those produces multiple models and body styles.

55
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,806
并且零件和外包装每隔几年就会被重新设计
And the parts and the trim are redesigned every few years.

56
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,441
因此有无限种可能
There are zillions of possibilities.

57
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,092
为什么每个人都假定
Why would anyone assume that I could take

58
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,261
我能通过这小小的一块塑料
a teeny, tiny piece of plastic

59
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,363
就能轻易识别出它属于哪种车
and easily identify a vehicle?

60
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,598
它的制造商和型号是什么
What's the make and model?

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,102
一辆2003到2005年生产的Dodge牌敞篷载货卡车
A 2003 to a 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

62
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,871
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,439
但是我们不得不把范围缩小
But we're going to have to narrow it down.

64
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,991
那个基地每天都停着数百辆货车
There's hundreds of trucks on that base every day.

65
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,792
这就是你打断我时我正在做的事
That's what I was doing when you interrupted me.

66
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,629
是这样的 Ray下士手表上残留着微量的
So, there was a trace of the vehicle's paint

67
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:59,998
货车油漆
on Petty Officer Ray's watch.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,282
这是我们的颜色选项
These are our color choices.

69
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,967
在最顶层我们得到了胺吸磷红
On the top we have Inferno Red.

70
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,119
在底层我们得到了深莫尔滕红
And the bottom we have Deep Molten Red.

71
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,421
我不知道谁想出了这些名字
I don't know who comes up with these names.

72
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,972
你怎么认为的
What do you think?

73
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,588
我想我会选上面的
I'm going to have to go with the top one.

74
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:10,593
同意
Agreed.

75
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:15,513
胺吸磷红在2005到2008年才有
So Inferno Red was only available between 2005 and 2008.

76
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:18,016
因此前灯玻璃和这种颜色的油漆有交集的唯一一年
So the only year in common between the headlight lens

77
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:20,018
是在2005年
and the color is 2005.

78
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,972
因此我们正在寻找一辆红色的2005年制造的Dodge牌敞篷载货卡车
Ergo we are looking for a red 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

79
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,474
Abby 你是最棒的
Abby, you are the best.

80
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,192
这是理所当然的
Still taken for granted.

81
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,029
只是因为我才让它变得简单 并不意味着它原本简单
Just 'cause I make it look easy doesn't mean it is.

82
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,948
为什么你怀疑上士Justin Dunne
Why do you suspect Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne?

83
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,816
Abby研究了肇事逃逸车辆的
Abby I.D.'d the make, model and color

84
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,452
型号和颜色
of the hit-and-run vehicle.

85
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:40,288
在基地注册的车里只有一辆符合条件 它属于 Dunne
Only one registered on base and it belongs to Dunne.

86
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,873
我检查了门卫的摄像头画面
I checked the gate security footage.

87
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,424
他的货车昨晚根本没有离开过匡蒂科
His truck never left Quantico last night.

88
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,710
我们知道他的哪些信息 单身
What do we know about him? Single.

89
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,211
高中一毕业就入伍了
Joined the Corps right out of high school.

90
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,379
他是个直升机机械师
He's a helo mechanic.

91
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,931
本周晚些时候将被部署到
Scheduled to deploy on an LHA

92
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,432
去往地中海的两栖攻击舰服役
to the Med, later this week.

93
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:54,001
还有最相关的
And most pertinent...

94
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,687
他有过酒驾史
he has a DUI in his past.

95
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,338
把他带进来
Bring him in.

96
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,143
我很高兴一切进展得这么快
I love it when it all comes together so quickly.

97
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,145
我不这么认为 反而会很担心
Not me. Makes me nervous.

98
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,530
这也太简单了
Too easy.

99
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,282
走吧
Let's go.

100
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:09,701
你没想过要买辆新车吗
You ever going to get a new car?

101
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,186
第一 我从来不买新车
Well, firstly, I never buy new cars.

102
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,789
第二我需要能点燃我的激情的东西
Secondly, I need something that ignites my passions.

103
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,207
它就像女人
It's like a woman.

104
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,209
在我做出承诺前我要爱上它
I need to be in love before I commit.

105
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,912
你从来没对女人做出过承诺
You've never committed to a woman.

106
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,388
Dunne上士 我们是海军罪案调查处
Sergeant Dunne. NCIS.

107
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,394
Dunne上士
Sergeant Dunne!

108
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,051
别动 海军罪案调查处
Freeze. NCIS.

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,047
是 这是我的货车 但是
Yeah, that's my truck, but

110
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,183
我发誓 我不知道它怎么会跑那去了
I swear, I don't know how it got that way.

111
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,635
你昨晚没开它吗 没有
You didn't drive it last night? No.

112
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,303
我已经好几天没用过那辆车了
I haven't used the truck in a couple of days.

113
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:06,440
那你怎么去上班 我步行去 就当是锻炼
How do you get to work? I walk. Need the exercise.

114
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,709
维修处所在的海湾离我的住处并不远
The maintenance bay isn't that far from my quarters.

115
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,277
昨晚十点你在哪
Where were you last night, 22:00 hours?

116
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,113
我在我的房间里...睡觉
I was in my room... asleep.

117
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,731
经历了艰难的一周
Had a tough week.

118
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,116
我精疲力竭
I was exhausted.

119
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,401
你确定你不是因为喝高了
You sure you weren't drunk

120
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,570
而忘记了自己做了些什么吧
and you just don't remember what you did?

121
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,455
我们知道你曾酒驾
We know about your DUI.

122
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,490
我头脑清醒了13个月了
I've been sober for 13 months.

123
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,358
我每周有三到四次会议
I go to three or four meetings a week.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,911
好吧 如果车不是你开的 你是无辜的
So, if you weren't driving the pickup and you're innocent,

125
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,963
为什么你要爬窗户逃走
why were you climbing out a window?

126
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,002
我知道我的权利
I know my rights.

127
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,767
在我的律师来之前我什么也不会说的
I'm not saying any more until I have a lawyer.

128
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:37,472
好得
Okay.

129
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,756
接下来你可以自己选一个律师了
Then you can have the lawyer of your choice

130
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:43,043
或者军法处长给你指派一个
or JAG will assign one to you.

131
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,932
嗨 McGee
Hey, McGee.

132
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,684
Dunne上士的右脚上的靴子你带过来了吗
Did you bring me Sergeant Dunne's right boot?

133
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:53,820
抱歉 Abbs 他请了律师 限制了我们的调查
Sorry, Abbs, he lawyered up and didn't give a permissive search.

134
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,857
好吧 那你有没有好好看一看他的右脚
Hmm. Well, did you get a good look at his feet?

135
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,193
啊 犯罪现场留下的脚印
Huh? Well, the footprint that you cast

136
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:02,329
那是海军陆战队标准
at the crime scene, it's a standard-issue Marine Corps

137
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,580
战斗靴 尺码是十英寸半
combat boot, size ten and a half.

138
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:05,582
我猜他可能也穿那个码
Well, I guess he might wear that size.

139
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,251
靴子穿了很久了 在右脚跟
It's well worn and has a very distinctive gash

140
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,869
有一个非常好辨认的切口
in the right heel.

141
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,505
我希望犯罪现场的鞋印能和Dunne上士的靴子相吻合
I'd just really love to match it to Sergeant Dunne.

142
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,073
这样啊 那你就只能等到明天了
Well, you're going to have to wait till morning.

143
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,291
这里有什么发现么
Any luck here?

144
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,044
哦 这绝对是肇事逃逸的那辆货车
Oh, this is definitely the pickup truck.

145
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,713
货车的轮胎符合犯罪现场留下的轮胎印
The tires match the tracks that were in the dirt.

146
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,466
我还在车头找到了头发 血迹和衣服上的纤维
And I got hair, blood and clothing fibers

147
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:24,434
能和被害人的特征相匹配
off the front end that match our victim.

148
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,470
就这样 我明天就能拿到DNA确认单
So, I'll get DNA confirmation in the morning,

149
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,971
我们现在先把这辆车锁起来
and we should have it locked up.

150
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:31,358
很好
Great.

151
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,695
对了 自Tony的车撞毁了后
Hey, have you been giving Tony rides to work

152
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,146
你有没有开车送他上班么
since his car was wrecked?

153
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,764
没有
No.

154
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:38,932
哦
Hmm.

155
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,267
今天早上有人开车
Somebody dropped him off

156
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,269
一路把他送到了匡蒂科
all the way out at Quantico this morning.

157
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:44,037
莫非他在和某人约会
Is he dating someone?

158
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,440
哦 我不这么想
Oh... I don't think so.

159
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:50,043
哦
Hmm.

160
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,798
你的味道总是那么好闻
You always smell so great.

161
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,967
我猜你又一次错过了今年的
Let me guess-- you missed the sexual harassment meeting

162
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,352
"防止职场性骚扰"讲座
again this year.

163
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,587
嘿 伙计们 快看我在休息室里发现了谁
Hey, everybody, look who I found in the lobby.

164
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:01,855

166
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,476
我似乎还没有这个荣幸
I don't think I've had the pleasure.

167
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,460
这位是Mallard医生

the Norfolk side of the Port Authority case

173
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,704
使Fornell脸上大为增光
a few years ago, made Fornell look good.

174
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,855
这可不是个容易的活儿
It was a tough job.

175
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,473
你们帮了不少忙
No, you guys made it easy.

176
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,442
我不记得那个案子了
I don't remember that case.

177
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:23,810
是个巨额财产盗窃案 Ducky
Grand theft, Ducky,

178
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,696
没有尸体 无须尸检 所以你没参与
no autopsy, no body, no you.

179
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:26,913
原来如此
Ah.

180
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,148
是谁把你带到NCIS来的
What brings you to NCIS?

我是来见Dunne上士的

191
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:51,004
你注意到Carrie有什么不同了吗 老大
You notice anything different about Carrie, boss?

192
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,306
婚戒不在了
No wedding ring.

193
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:53,940
跟你说过 她丈夫就是个手提包
Told you the husband was a handbag.

194
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,643
手提包
Handbag?

195
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,812
挎在手臂上的没用的东西
Something useless you hang on your arm.

196
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:01,014
噢
Oh.

197
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,033

Hey, Agent Fornell, it's DiNozzo.

198
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,819
关于那位美丽动人的Carrie Clark
Listen, can you give me the skinny

199
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,071
你能告诉我一些小道消息么
on the ever-fetching Carrie Clark?

200
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,306
你好
Hello.

201
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:27,841
我是Carrie Clark
I'm Carrie Clark.

202
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,593
没想到你长得这么漂亮
Didn't expect you to look like you do.

203
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,645
有什么问题吗
Is that a problem?

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,263
要是你像我表哥说的那么优秀 就没问题
Not if you're as good as my cousin said.

205
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,816
目前还没有任何投诉
Well, I haven't had any complaints.

00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:40,654
你即将因为一些非常严重的指控而被提审
You're about to be arraigned on some very serious charges.

207
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,656
关于这个逃逸事件 我什么都不知道
I don't know anything about a hit-and-run.

208
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,891
如果真是我的皮卡车的话 也不是我在驾驶
If it was my pickup, someone else was driving.

209
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:46,576
你觉得是谁在开车
Any idea who?

210
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:51,615
Justin 我想要相信你 但你看起来非常不安
Justin, I want to believe you, but you seem very nervous.

211
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:55,085
有什么想告诉我的吗
Is there something that you want to tell me?

212
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:00,006
昨晚十点你在哪里
Where were you at 10:00 last night?

213
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:03,076
有什么关系
Doesn't matter.

214
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,261
当然有关系
Of course it does.

215
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:05,962
-我有不在场证明 -好
- I have an alibi. - Okay.

216
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,264
你就需要知道这些
That's all you need to know.

217
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,183
你要告诉我吗
Are you going to tell me?

218
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,258
好吧 如果你是这种态度
All right, if that is going to be your attitude,

219
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,476
我来给你省点钱吧
how about I save you some money?

220
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,027
军法署会为你安排一位免费律师
JAG will assign someone to you for free.

221
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,195
等一下
Hold on.

222
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,598
这间屋子可能被监听吗
Could this room be bugged?

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,868
不 不会的 那是违法的
No, no way-- that would be illegal.

224
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,936
你在录音我们的谈话吗
Are you recording our conversation?

225
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,271
没有
No.

226
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,622
你是我的律师
You're my lawyer.

227
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,108
无论我说了什么 你都不能告诉任何人 是吗
Anything I say, you can't tell anyone?

228
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,827
这叫做"律师-当事人保密特权"
It's called attorney-client privilege.

229
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,611
你所说的一切 我都会保密
Everything that you say is confidential.

230
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:41,448
除非你授权 这些谈话不会被泄露
It doesn't leave this room unless you want it to.

231
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,632
职业道德不允许我
Rules of ethics prohibit me

232
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:45,001
将所讨论的内容告知任何人
from telling anyone what we discuss.

233
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,553
你能保证吗
You sure?

234
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,639
我向你保证 Justin
I promise you, Justin.

235
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,129
那个女孩被杀时
When that girl was killed,

236
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:59,516

【注：维吉尼亚州的一个城市】
I was 35 miles away in Falls Church.

237
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:02,402

238
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,858
捅死一个人
Stabbing a guy to death.

239
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,332
你干嘛要查看航班时刻表
Why are you checking airline schedules?

240
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,284
迈阿密
Miami?

241
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:18,752
你必须要知道所有事情吗
Do you have to know everything?

242
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:21,154
是的 好奇是我的本性
Yes, it's in my DNA.

243
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:24,991
如果我不告诉你的话 你会把我给逼疯的 所以...
Well, you're gonna drive me crazy until I tell you, so...

244
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,827
这里没什么事情了 案子也快结束了
Things are quiet here, this case is wrapping up.

245
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,463

246
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:30,931
Delilah和我商量着

247
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,849
打算离开这里 共度一个长周末
about getting away for a long weekend.

248
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,302
McGee 真让我刮目相看啊
McGee, I'm impressed.

249
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:39,005
迈阿密 南海滩 酒吧 石头蟹
Miami, South Beach, hot clubs, stone crabs.

250
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,857
真不像你的风格
It is unlike you.

251
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:44,010
我就知道我不该告诉你
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

252
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,030
噢
Oh.

253
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,365
没花多长时间啊
That didn't take long.

254
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,649
你的委托人醒悟了吗
Your client come to his senses?

255
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,017
想要坦白吗
Wants to confess?

256
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,319
不
No.

257
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,070
那么是想要做个交易吗
Wants to make a deal, then?

258
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:56,022
Dunne上士说他是无辜的
Sergeant Dunne says he's innocent.

259
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,290
无辜
Innocent?

260
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,876
我们有证据证明 他的皮卡车与受害人相关联
We've forensically tied his pickup to the victim.

261
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,212
我们去问他问题的时候 他试图逃跑
He ran when we tried to question him.

262
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:04,030
他声称他有不在场证明
He claims he has an alibi.

263
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,832
那么证明是什么 我们会确认一下
Well, what is it? We'll check it out.

264
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,084
事情没那么简单 Gibbs 
Well, it is not that simple, Gibbs,

265
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:09,536
他是在保密的情况下告诉我的
he told me in confidence.

266
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,837
这是机密信息
It's privileged.

267
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:11,871
如果他不想自己告诉你的话
If he doesn't want to tell you himself,

268
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,706
我也束手无策
then my hands are tied.

269
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,209
我们有48个小时 来决定是指控他或者释放他
We've got 48 hours to either charge him or let him go.

270
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:20,897
给我们一些信息
Give us something.

271
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,935
这样吧 我自己去调查他的不在场证明
All right, listen, I will go check out his alibi myself

272
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,903
然后我再来找你
and I will get back to you.

273
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:32,242
这家伙面对车祸致人死命罪
The guy's facing vehicular homicide

274
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,910
以及肇事逃逸的指控
and hit-and-run charges.

275
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,445
却不肯提供不在场证明
He won't use an alibi?

276
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:37,664
他疯了吗
Is he crazy?

277
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,956
Abbs
Abbs.

278
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,526
Gibbs 你太了不起了
Gibbs... you're amazing.

279
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,332
你是怎么知道是其他人在开车
How did you know that someone else was driving the truck?

280
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,251
你发现了什么
What'd you find?

281
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,802
是我没发现的那部分更有趣
Well, it's more what I didn't find that's interesting.

282
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:08,838
在你打电话之前 我只是试图
I mean, before you called, I was just trying

283
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,474
将受害者与车辆联系起来 而且我的确做到了
to match the victim to the vehicle, which I did.

284
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,842
-但是 -但是当你问我
- But? - But then, when you asked me

285
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,343
有没有可能
if there's a chance that someone

286
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,762
是非车主的其他人在驾驶时
other than the owner of the truck was driving,

287
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,065
我在整辆车上搜寻指纹 可是什么都没有找到
I dusted the whole thing for prints, I didn't find any.

288
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,267
-所以只有Dunne上士的指纹吗 -不
- Just Staff Sergeant Dunne's? - No.

289
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,820
我是说 无 没 零 空 啥也没有
I mean, like none, nada, zip, zilch, nothing.

290
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,856
基本上这辆车的整个表面
Almost the entire surface of the truck

291
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,607
都被擦去了指纹的痕迹
was wiped clean of fingerprints--

292
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,225
门把手 方向盘 档位
the door handle, the steering wheel, the gearshift,

293
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,662
座椅调节器 所有地方
the seat adjuster, everything.

294
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,500
这让我想起了我的Horace叔叔
Now, I got reminded o-of my Uncle Horace.

295
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:38,901
他总是丢三落四的
He was always losing things

296
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,337
比如他的眼镜 钱包 钥匙
like his glasses and his wallet and his keys.

297
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,955
他好几次都被锁在自己的车外
He got locked out of his own car so many times

298
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,908
所以他在车上藏了一把钥匙
that he, he hid a key on his car.

299
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,712
于是我发现了这个
And then I found... this...

300
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,598
就藏在前轮圈下面
...under the front wheel well.

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,849
被擦干净了么
Wiped clean?

302
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,719
没错 包括其中的钥匙
Oh, yeah, including the key inside.

303
00:13:56,721 --> 00:14:00,272
车主不可能做出这种事情
That is hardly something that the owner would do.

304
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,224
是其他人在驾驶这辆车
Someone else was driving the truck.

305
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,977
对 而且他们还试图掩盖痕迹
Yes, and they tried to make it look like they weren't.

306
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,280
谢了 Abbs
Thanks, Abbs.

307
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,604
我不理解人为什么要跑
I don't understand why people run.

308
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,290
跑步很有疗效
Oh, well, it's therapeutic,

309
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,959
对心血管问题有极大的益处
it has great cardiovascular benefits.

310
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,277
而且还会刺激内啡肽分泌
【注：又称安多芬 有镇痛及保持快乐的功能】
What's more, it gets the old endorphins pumping.

311
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,131
我跟你说 跑步让我十分兴奋
I'll tell you, running gives me a great high.

312
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,583
我是说那个司机 
I was referring to the driver

313
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,835
为什么要从肇事现场逃逸 Palmer先生
running from the scene of the accident, Mr. Palmer.

314
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,837
噢 对 没错 
Oh, yes, yes.

315
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,423
你知道吗 这个国家目前涉及行人的肇事逃逸
Did you know that pedestrian hit-and-runs are

316
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,625
比例前所未有之高
at an epidemic rate in this country?

317
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,260
在美国发生的
Nearly 11%

318
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,679
所有交通事故中 有百分之十一
of all traffic accidents in the United States are

319
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,148
是肇事逃逸
hit-and-runs.

320
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,232
那是Ray下士吗
That Petty Officer Ray?

321
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:44,400
是的
Yes.

322
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:45,985
把这个尸体留得久一点
Hold on to the body for a little while longer,

323
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,019
可以吗 Duck
will you, Duck?

324
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,020
你签署了尸体移交文件
You signed the release.

325
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,104
有什么变化吗
Has something changed?

326
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,490
是的
Yeah.

327
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,476
但我还不知道是什么
But I don't know what.

328
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,496
喂 我是Gibbs
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

329
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,447
Hi 我是Carrie Clark
Hi, it's Carrie Clark.

330
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,665
好的 Carrie 你查到什么
Yeah, Carrie, what do you got?

331
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,167
是这样的 Dunne的不在场证明
Well, Dunne's alibi

332
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,818
查清楚了 非常可靠
checks out, it's solid.

333
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,486
嗯 告诉我 我不能
Mm-hmm, tell me. I can't.

334
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,321
你们得开始寻找
You're going to have to start looking

335
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,040
真正的逃逸肇事司机 因为他不是我的委托人
for the real hit-and-run driver because it's not my client.

336
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,093
Carrie 听着 我不能仅凭你的话来判断 好吗
Carrie, look, I can't just take your word for it, okay?

337
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,595
告诉我一些线索
Give me something here.

338
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,957
你必须自己解决这事 Gibbs
You're gonna have to figure this one out on your own, Gibbs.

339
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,805
Jethro 出什么问题了吗
Jethro, is something wrong?

340
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,481
看起来你今天终究是不能离开我们了
Looks like you won't be leaving us today after all,

341
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,733
亲爱的
my dear.

342
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,189
McGee,
McGee,

343
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,908
追踪最后一通电话 可以吗
trace the last call, will you?

344
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,477
你想要我查出是谁打的
You want me to find out who it was from?

345
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,795
是Carrie Clark打的
It was from Carrie Clark.

346
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,196
通常她的名字都会在屏幕上显示出来
Usually her name comes up on that little window there.

347
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,911
但这一次没有 那里只显示了一个数字
This time it didn't; it was just a number.

348
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:50,952
嗯
Hmm.

349
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,887
她说了什么
What did she say?

350
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,872
说她委托人的不在场证明已经核实
Said her client's alibi checked out.

351
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,257
我不相信
I don't believe it.

352
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,840
好吧 这个数字属于一个投币电话
Well, the number belongs to a pay phone.

353
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:00,894
投币电话
Pay phone?

354
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,144
我还以为它们都销声匿迹了呢
I didn't think there were any left.

355
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:05,097
325 金合欢街 福尔斯彻奇市
325 Acacia Avenue in Falls Church.

356
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,214
就在一个图书馆前面
It's in front of the library.

357
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,549
Carrie有手机
Carrie has a cell.

358
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,101
为什么她要用投币电话
Why would she use a pay phone?

359
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,269
不知道
Not sure.

360
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:13,221
她知道她委托人的不在场证明
She knows her client's alibi.

361
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,908
她也知道她不能告诉我们
She knows she can't tell us.

362
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,993
你认为怎样呢 老大
What are you thinking, boss?

363
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,895
Carrie知道我们会对此感兴趣
Carrie knows we'll be intrigued,

364
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,081
她知道我们会追踪这通电话
she knows that we'll trace the call.

365
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,749
她是不是特地给我们留了条线索
Did she just drop a bread crumb?

366
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,085
是的 去 快过去
Yeah. Go. Go on.

367
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,348
就是那个投币电话
There's the pay phone.

368
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,250
为什么Carrie要从这里打
Why was Carrie calling from here?

369
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,771
图书馆 五金商店
Library, hardware store?

370
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:49,257
哦 就是那了 性用品商品
Oh, there we go, Great Sexpectations.

371
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,527
我对此深表怀疑 Tony
I seriously doubt it, Tony.

372
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,514
嘿 那里有一辆警察巡逻车
Hey, there's a squad car.

373
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,753
是的 让我们过去问问
Yeah, let's check it out.

374
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,575
你可曾查出Carrie是否离婚了
Did you ever find out if Carrie was divorced?

375
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,377
啊 暂时分居
Ah. Trial separation.

376
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:09,578
她没有带结婚戒指
She's not wearing her ring.

377
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,963
你知道这代表什么
You know what that means.

378
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,464
这段感情结束了
It's over.

379
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,918
嘿
Hey.

380
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,670
NCIS

381
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,388
特别探员DiNozzo和McGee
Special Agents DiNozzo and McGee.

382
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,123
Dockry 凶案组
Dockry, Homicide.

383
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,808
凶案组
Homicide?

384
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,143
你们来这里干嘛
What are you guys up to?

385
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:26,294
哦 只是在街头徘徊 枯燥无味
Oh, just pounding the pavement, boring Navy stuff.

386
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,647
是的 不像凶杀案那么严肃认真
Yeah, nothing serious like homicide.

387
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,816
谁死了
Who's dead?

388
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,152
商店的店主――Donny Sullivan
Store owner-- Donny Sullivan.

389
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,570
前天晚上被人刺死
Stabbed to death night before last.

390
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,273
尸体是一个员工昨天早上在楼上的住处发现的
Body was found in the upstairs residence yesterday morning by an employee.

392
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,475
有头绪吗 没有什么具体的
Any leads? Nothing concrete yet.

393
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,810
我能帮你们什么忙吗
Anything I can help you guys with?

394
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,078
哦 不 我们得走了
Ah, no, we got to go.

395
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,246
他很饿了
He gets hungry.

396
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:46,115
没错 回头见
It's true. See you around.

397
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:50,20
嘿 你们认识特别探员Gibbs吗?
Hey, do you guys know a Special Agent Gibbs?

398
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:54,123
哦 是的 我们亲切地称呼他为"老大"
Oh, yeah, we affectionately refer to him as "boss."

399
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,375
告诉他Hickory的儿子向他问好
Tell him Hickory's son said hi.

400
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,492
Hickory
Hickory?

401
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,827
他会明白的
He'll know.

402
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,517
商店店主的谋杀案大致和肇事逃逸发生在同一时间
The storekeeper's murder happened about the same time as the hit-and-run.

404
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,303
你认为这件事情和Dunne的不在场证明有关
Think this has something to do with Dunne's alibi?

405
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,141
如果Dunne参与了这件凶案 那么他是怎么在匡蒂科和这里来回的
If Dunne was involved, then how'd he get from Quantico to here and back?

407
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,809
他的卡车从来没有离开过基地
His truck never left the base.

408
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,695
我觉得你的迈阿密激情周末刚刚跟你说再见了
I think your amorous little weekend in Miami just went bye-bye.

410
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,280
是的 Gibbs 嘿 老大
Yeah. Gibbs. Hey, boss.

411
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,865
我们在Dunne的不在场证明上也许有线索了
We might have a lead on Dunne's alibi.

412
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:23,902
尽可能查出你能查到的--小心行事 DiNozzo
Find out what you can-- discreetly, DiNozzo.

413
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,038
Gibbs Gibbs Gibbs 如之前我告诉过你的那样我想擦拭
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, so I told you that I dusted

414
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,207
整辆卡车便于查找指纹 但是我没有
the entire truck for prints, but I didn't.

415
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,409
我只擦了会被触摸的地方
I only dusted the places that a person would touch,

416
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,044
随后我意识到如果有人想要
and then I realized that if someone's going

417
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,163
调整座位的高低 那样的话  
to adjust the seat lever, which they did,

418
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,032
也很有可能调整后视镜
they would probably also adjust the rearview mirror.

419
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,384
猜猜我发现了什么--
And guess what I found--

420
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,886
在后视镜的后面采集到一枚新鲜的右手拇指指纹
a fresh right thumbprint on its backside.

421
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,054
拇指指纹有名字吗
Thumbprint have a name?

422
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,173
别傻了 Gibbs
Don't be silly, Gibbs,

423
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,475
拇指指纹怎么可能有名字呢
thumbprints don't have names.

424
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,678
人才有
People do.

425
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,715
我第一时间将它和所有在匡蒂科的人的指纹作对比
My first pass was to run it against all the personnel at Quantico.

427
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,718
于是这便是所有我要做的事情了
And that's all I had to do.

428
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,654
二等兵Daniel Cliff
Private Daniel Cliff.

429
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,245
Gibbs很快就会过来
Gibbs will be in, in a minute.

430
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,447
谢谢你
Thank you.

431
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,416
你知道他们为什么带我来这里吗
You know why they brought me over here?

432
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,750
不知道
No.

433
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,369
我告诉他们除非我律师在场 否则我一句话也不会说
I told them I wouldn't say anything else until my lawyer was present.

435
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,422
是的 我核实过你的不在场证明
Well, I checked your alibi.

436
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,340
你没有撒谎
You weren't lying.

437
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,759
嘿 你不知道玻璃的另一边都有谁
Hey, you don't know who's on the other side of that glass.

438
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,410
咱们就不要再讨论这个问题了
Let's not discuss it again.

439
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,763
你知道所有你需要做的
You know all you have to.

440
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:25,931
我是无辜的
I'm innocent.

441
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,968
就不能等到早上吗
Couldn't this have waited till the morning?

442
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,770
不能
Nope.

443
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,107
你认识他吗 是的
You know him? Yeah,

444
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,975
二等兵Cliff--我见过他
Private Cliff-- I see him around.

445
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,393
你们俩关系很好
You two close?

446
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,279
不
No.

447
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,449
我们一起出去喝过几次酒
We hung a couple of times back when I was drinking.

448
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:44,933
那是很久很久以前了
That was a long time ago.

449
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,618
最近你们有见过面吗
Have you seen each other lately?

450
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:51,323
在洗衣店 娱乐室 见过他 就这些 
Run into him in the laundry, rec room, that's it.

451
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,292
你同意让二等兵Cliff
You give Private Cliff permission

452
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:54,660
开你的小型轻便卡车
to drive your pickup truck?

453
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,830
去你的 当然没有
Hell, no.

454
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,298
这是怎么回事
What was that about?

455
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,556
Gibbs 看来你的肇事逃逸案子已经有了一个嫌疑犯
Gibbs? Sounds like you have a suspect for your hit-and-run.

457
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,225
能让我的委托人离开吗？还不行
You gonna let my client go? Not yet.

458
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:11,593
拜托 他在这里仅仅是因为配合你们
Come on. He's due to deploy.

459
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:14,263
还没有把二等兵Cliff带过来问话
Haven't brought Private Cliff in for questioning yet.

461
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,814
好吧 你的48小时时间快到了
Well, your 48-hour clock is ticking.

462
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:16,815
如果你明天之前还不指控我的委托人
If you don't charge my client by tomorrow,

463
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,150
那你就必须让他走
you have to let him go.

464
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:19,852
你知道的 一些有趣的事情刚刚发生
You know, a funny thing happened.

465
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,436
我们得到了一个线索
We got a tip.

466
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,906
指引我们去了一家在福尔斯彻奇市的雪茄店
Sent us to a cigar store in Falls Church.

467
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:25,073
真的吗
Really?

468
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:28,026
是的 那是个犯罪现场 凶杀案
Yeah, it was a crime scene, a homicide.

469
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:33,615
如果你的委托人那晚没有在基地开着他的卡车
If your client wasn't driving his truck on base the other night,

471
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,152
那他会不会在福尔斯彻奇市呢
could he have been in Falls Church?

472
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:43,091
我只关心Dunne上士的权利
My only concern is Sergeant Dunne's rights.

473
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,493
他没有参与这起肇事逃逸案件
He wasn't involved in the hit-and-run.

474
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,185
嗯
Hmm.

475
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,138
非否认的否认
A non-denial denial.

476
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,308
就像Jason Robards在惊天大阴谋里扮演的Ben Bradlee一样
Jason Robards, as Ben Bradlee in All the President's Men.

477
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,676
她没有说"不"
She didn't say "no."

478
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:16,212
哦 你真是疯了
Oh, you're crazy.

479
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:19,048
不 你肯定需要眼镜了
No, you must need glasses.

480
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:22,669
是的是的 好吧 晚点再聊
Yeah, yeah. All right, later.

481
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,839
什么那么好笑
What's so funny?

482
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,557
人力资源部的Hollander
That was Hollander in HR.

483
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,392
她声称今天早上看到你
She claims that she saw you this morning

484
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,811
在一辆公交车的前门下车
at the front gate getting off a city bus.

485
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,379
是的 那是我
Yeah, that was me.

486
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,732
听着 我知道我曾经因为你乘公交车开过你玩笑
Listen, I know I made fun of you in the past for riding the bus,

487
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,768
但我必须承认我错了
but I have to admit I was wrong.

488
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,353
我这段时间一直乘坐公共交通
I've been using public transportation,

489
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:40,654
而且我真的很喜欢
and I really like it.

490
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,523
你在开玩笑 不
You're kidding. No.

491
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,724
那样我可以有时间去读书
I have time to read,

492
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,826
打一些电话 最重要的是...
make some calls and, best of all...

493
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,394
我可以观察人们
I get to watch people.

494
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:48,746
人类是如此地令人神魂颠倒
People are fascinating.

495
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:50,897
好吧 Tony 我...
Okay, Tony, I'm...

496
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,201
就算我不知道我自己现在是什么
I don't even know what I am right now.

497
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,503
但是我懂你 而且我知道这不是你
But I know you, and this is not you.

498
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:59,506
老大 我检查了Dunne上士的所有电子邮件
Boss, I went through Sergeant Dunne's e-mails,

499
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:00,907
电话和信用卡
phone calls and credit cards.

500
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,626
什么都没查到
I came up empty.

501
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,512
他和那个死去的雪茄店老板没有任何关系
There's no connecting him to the dead cigar-store owner.

502
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,582
他杀那人的动机是什么
What would his motive be to kill the guy?

503
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:12,603
但我却发现Dunne给一个马里兰州的电话号码打了很多次
Did find out Dunne exchanged a lot of calls with a Maryland cell phone number.

505
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,254
电话号码属于一个Olivia Chandler的人
Belongs to an Olivia Chandler.

506
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:15,723
是的 好吧 查出她是谁
Yeah, well, find out who she is.

507
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,192
是的
Yup.

508
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:19,860
嗯 我们能否大胆运用福尔斯彻奇市警察局的资料库搜索一下Dunne上士的名字
Hmm. Do we dare run Sergeant Dunne's name by Falls Church PD,

509
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,262
也许我们能够找到他们之间的联系
see if they can make a connection?

510
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:23,480
不能这么做
Can't do that.

511
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,098
我们要保护Carrie Clark
Got to protect Carrie Clark.

512
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,567
你可以暗地里做
You can do it off the record.

513
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:29,119
那个负责凶杀案的警探似乎认识你
The homicide detective in charge seemed to know you.

514
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:32,539
谁 额 他说告诉你
Who? Well, he said to tell you,

515
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,274
"Hickory'的儿子向你问好"
"Hickory's son says hello."

516
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,543
那是Paul Dockry
That's Paul Dockry.

517
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,829
Hickory Dickory Dockry
Hickory Dickory Dockry.

518
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,281
他老爸和我在同一个陆战队
His dad and I were in the Corps together.

519
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,134
快来 DiNozzo 你跟着我
Come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.

520
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:46,920
哈 人类真是令人神魂颠倒
Huh. People are fascinating.

521
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,485
这枚靴子的印记是在犯罪现场找到的
This boot print was found at a crime scene

522
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,487
杀害了一名下士
that killed a petty officer.

523
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:06,306
你的靴子 跟肇事车辆右轮胎上的抠图吻合
This is the same boot, the same cutout at the right heel.

524
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,775
你知道 我们还掌握了什么吗 Cliff？
And you know what else, Cliff?

525
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,743
我们在卡车后视镜上发现了
We got your thumbprint on the rearview mirror

526
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:11,245
你的拇指指纹
of that vehicle.

527
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:13,914
到底发生了什么事情？
What happened?

528
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,784
当时天很黑
It was dark.

529
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,652
等我看到她的时候 一切都晚了
I couldn't see her until it was too late.

530
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:20,587
你开着Dunne上士的卡车干什么？
What were you doing with Staff Sergeant Dunne's truck?

531
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:22,089
我喝了几杯
I had a few drinks.

532
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,507
我认识斯塔福德的这个女孩
I know this girl in Stafford.

533
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,376
我无意间听Dunne在录音室提过
I overheard Dunne in the rec room.

534
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:27,294
他说这星期很累 会早点睡觉
Said he had a rough week and was gonna hit the rack early.

535
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,462
我觉得可以开他的车子 
Figured I'd take his truck and be back

536
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:29,680
在他发现之前 就能赶回来的 屁话
before he even missed it. Bull!

537
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,632
你是怎么知道车子外藏着钥匙？
How'd you know about the hidden key?

538
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:33,350
大概一年前 他当时还在酗酒
About a year ago, when he was still drinking,

539
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,335
他昏昏沉沉 把自己锁在了车子外边
he got wasted, locked himself out of his truck.

540
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:37,337
于是他找到藏着的车钥匙 让我送他回家
Got the hidden key out, had me drive him home.

541
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,447
你就眼睁睁 把一个受伤的女性扔在路边等死？
You left an injured woman to die by the side of the road?

542
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:40,442
不！
No!

543
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:41,675
我停下车了
I stopped.

544
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:43,110
我知道她已经死了
I knew she was dead,

545
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:44,778
然后意识到这一切看起来有多糟
and I realized how bad it all looked.

546
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,531
我当时喝醉了 还开着一辆偷来的车
I was drinking, I was driving a stolen vehicle.

547
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,566
我慌了 然后赶快把车开回停车场
I just panicked and drove back to the parking lot.

548
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,618
你得相信我的话
You got to believe me.

549
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,187
这只是个意外
It was an accident.

550
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,199
我来钉死他 哼
I'll book him. Uh-uh.

551
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,584
如果我们起诉 Private Cliff
If we charge Private Cliff

552
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,053
犯了肇事逃逸罪
with the hit-and-run,

553
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,288
我们就得释放 Dunne上士
we got to let Staff Sergeant Dunne go.

554
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,840
而我并不准备这样做
I'm not ready to do that.

555
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,374
只剩几小时
We only have a few more hours

556
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:15,759
法定羁押Dunne上士的时间就到了
until the clock runs out on Dunne.

557
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:18,479
把他关进牢房
Put him in a holding cell.

558
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,639
-你好 Paul
-你好 Gibbs
Hey, Paul. Hey, Gibbs.

559
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,207
抱歉 等我一会
Sorry. Just give me a sec.

560
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:31,675
我得给女儿发完短信
I got to finish this text to my daughter.

561
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,243
这是她跟我交流的唯一方式
Only way she'll communicate me.

562
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,029
这孩子从来不接电话
The kid never answers her phone.

563
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,064
好久不见
Been a long time.

564
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,833
令尊怎么样了？
How's your dad?

565
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:42,068
老顽固
Stubborn as always.

566
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,872
我以为会在我妹妹的婚礼上碰到你
Thought I might run into you at my kid sister's wedding.

567
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,841
哦 不 我对婚礼不感冒
Oh, no, no. I'm not... I'm not big on weddings.

568
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,460
我理解
I can understand that.

569
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:52,763
谢谢你能见我
Thanks for meeting me.

570
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:56,300
嗯 我在福尔彻奇市碰见了你的探员
Yeah. I ran into your agents in Falls Church.

571
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:58,302
我断定 那可不是巧合
Taking it, that wasn't a coincidence.

572
00:24:58,304 --> 00:24:59,853
哦 不是吧 
Uh, no. So,

573
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,722
你对我的谋杀案有什么兴趣？
what's your interest in my homicide?

574
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,257
呃 说起来复杂了 一团糟
Well, it's complicated, messy.

575
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,809
我们追查线索的时候
Following a lead.

576
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,361
扣押了一个跟罪行无关的人
Holding someone on an unrelated charge.

577
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,446
看似有不在场证明
Seems to have an alibi,

578
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:11,782
但是他貌似跟你的死亡店主有关系
but he may have been involved with your dead storekeeper

579
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,118
-很乐意跟他聊聊 -现在还不行
Like to talk to him. Can't let you, not yet.

580
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,903
我们还在保护信息来源
Still trying to protect a source.

581
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,704
目前你扣押了他
You have him in custody.

582
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,606
对 目前扣押了他
Yeah, for the time being.

583
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,326
关于你的案子 你能跟我分享点什么？
What can you tell me about your case?

584
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,378
我们发现Sullivan是个赌徒
Discovered Sullivan was a bookie.

585
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
用香烟店做幌子
Used the cigar store as a front.

586
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:27,915
你们羁押的人 看上去是个赌徒？
Guy you holding like to gamble?

587
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,082
我会查明白的
I'll find out.

588
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,884
你们现在有嫌疑人吗？
You got any suspects for the murder?

589
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:34,621
有...也没有
Yes... and no.

590
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,891
劣迹斑斑的监狱常客 Wendell Kaiser
Loser with a mile-long rap sheet, Wendell Kaiser.

591
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,643
对Sullivan不满已久了
Into Sullivan big-time.

592
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:40,961
双方公然的争吵过
Very public arguments.

593
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:42,479
Kaiser甚至威胁过死者
Kaiser even makes threats.

594
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:43,647
然而 Kaiser有无懈可击的不在场证明
However, airtight alibi.

595
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,182
谋杀案发生的时候 他正在纽约
In New York at the time of the murder.

596
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,100
今天早上才回来 嗯
Just got back this morning. Hmm.

597
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:49,236
也许现在很流行不在场证明 哈？
Maybe alibis are in season, huh?

598
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,571
好的
Okay.

599
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:51,738
干酪汉堡
Cheeseburger,

600
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,991
不加配料的炸薯条
no dressing, fries.

601
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:58,078
我错过什么了？ 你根本没点菜
Did I miss something? You didn't even order.

602
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,680
哦 他不需要开口点菜
Well, he doesn't have to.

603
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:01,665
谢谢你 Elaine
Thanks, Elaine.

604
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,364
嗯 你能把Kaiser的档案给我吗？
Can you, uh, get me Kaiser's file?

605
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,320
当然可以
Sure.

606
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,455
我会把要点 发到你邮箱
I'll e-mail you the highlights.

607
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:10,424
你们羁押的那个人 不会碰巧就是受雇的职业杀手吧 
Your guy wouldn't happen to be a hit man for hire, would he?

608
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:12,125
不 我觉得不是
No. I don't think so.

609
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:15,963
怎么了？ 需要点什么？
What? Need something?

610
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:19,132
嗯 我需要一把刀来切下汉堡
Yeah, a knife to cut this beast.

611
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,190
不错
That'll work.

612
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:28,775
不 不 不
No, no, no.

613
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,477
你在开玩笑吧
You're not serious.

614
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,945
她怎么可能嫁给他呢
There's no way she's married to him.

615
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,064
他们结婚差不多5年了
Almost five years.

616
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,899
再次诠释了什么叫做花瓶妻子
The very definition of a trophy wife.

617
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:38,118
-你在看什么？-Olivia Chandler
What you looking at? Olivia Chandler.

618
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,404
跟Dunne上士
The woman who Sergeant Dunne

619
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,155
发短信 打电话的女人
has been exchanging texts and calls with.

620
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:43,724
那个糟老头
That little man

621
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,075
肯定非常 
must have a big,

622
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:48,829
-非常有钱 -她嫁给他
big... bank account. She's married to him.

623
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,797
一起住在切维蔡斯村
They live together in Chevy Chase Village.

624
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,216
世界无比精彩
Very la-dee-dah.

625
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,868
她的唯一违规记录是酒后驾车
Only thing on her record is a DUI.

626
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,754
交警发现她的时候 她正开着阿斯顿马丁横冲直撞
She was picked up for driving erratically in her Aston Martin.

627
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:58,872
太搞笑了
So many jokes.

628
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,390
（她那么有钱 ）肯定开的是阿斯顿丁
Of course she drives an Aston Martin.

629
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,593
当我搜索有没有交通摄像头
When I was searching traffic cameras

630
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,978
拍到谋杀案当晚 
to see if I could place Dunne anywhere near the cigar store

631
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,430
Dunne上士在香烟商店附近出现
the night of the murder,

632
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,381
我找到一些有趣的东西
I found something interesting.

633
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,549
我发现了Olivia Chandler的汽车
Olivia Chandler's car.

634
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:12,486
这张照片是在距离香烟店一个街区的地方拍的
Now, this was taken a block from the cigar store.

635
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:13,987
由于车窗颜色
Because of the tinted windows,

636
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:15,555
所以没法确定车里都有谁
you can't make out who's inside.

637
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:16,940
我把照片发给了Abby
I sent it to Abby.

638
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:19,610
距离很远 不过她或许能够增强一下图像
It's a long shot, but maybe she can enhance the image.

639
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:20,727
Sullivan是个赌徒
Sullivan was a bookie.

640
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,080
福尔彻奇市警方有一个嫌疑犯
Falls Church police had a suspect,

641
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:24,581
但是他有不在场证明
but he has an alibi.

642
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,950
Dockry探长说他会把嫌犯的档案发到我邮箱
Detective Dockry said he was going to e-mail the file.

643
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:29,670
他已经发了
He did.

644
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:31,404
Wendell Kaiser McGee 
Wendell Kaiser. McGee--

645
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:33,507
你查一下 Dunne上士有没有赌博的习惯
see if Staff Sergeant Dunne had a gambling problem

646
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,791
或者是跟这个人的任何联系
or any connection to this guy.

647
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:37,344
DiNozzo...
DiNozzo...

648
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:41,765
查一下Olivia Chandler.
check out Olivia Chandler.

649
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,251
很高兴 接受任务
With pleasure.

650
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,770
谢谢你 老大
Thank you, boss.

651
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,283
有什么我能帮你的
May I help you?

652
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,585
噢 我希望你能帮我呢
Oh, I hope so.

653
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,421
NCIS特别探员Anthony DiNozzo 
NCIS Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

654
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:22,839
NCIS
NCIS？

655
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,092
我喜欢这辆车 它真火辣
I love this car. It's smoking hot.


656
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,677
我目前在汽车市场里
I'm in the market myself.

657
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,178
我有选择障碍
Between vehicles right now.

658
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,681
名车耗油量大 但是詹姆斯邦德也开这样的车
Terrible gas mileage, but that's what James Bond drives.
（我总觉得Tony在含沙射影说olivia，你们怎么看）

659
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:31,982
你知道这个事实吗
Did you know that?

660
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:34,935
我不清楚  你来这干什么
I have no idea. What do you want?

661
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:38,304
噢 我们在调查一名海军军官
Oh, we're investigating a Marine. 

662
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:39,906
Justin Dunne上士
Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne.

663
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:40,974
你是怎么认识他的
How do you know him?

664
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:42,442
-我不认识他 -真的吗？  
-I don't. -Really?

665
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,194
你跟他可是打过不少电话
'Cause you exchanged a lot of calls with him,

666
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:45,478
这就说明你认识他啊
and that would suggest otherwise.

667
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,748
我们在一次匿名戒酒会上认识的
【A.A：Alcoholics Anonymous:匿名戒酒会】
We met at an A.A. meeting.

668
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,533
我们彼此相互支持
We talk to each other for support.

669
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:51,484
保持清醒是个持久战
Sobriety is an ongoing battle.

670
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:52,819
那你为什么说不认识他
So why'd you say you didn't know him?

671
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,789
因为 匿名戒酒会的成员对外保持匿名 
The second "A" in A.A. is for "anonymous."

672
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,958
我不应该在这谈论他和其他人
I shouldn't be talking about him or anyone else.

673
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,509
明白了
Gotcha.

674
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,094
所以你这是要出门旅行吗
So you're taking a little trip?

675
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,431
我跟几个女性朋友去牙买加
I'm going to Jamaica with some girlfriends.

676
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,516
噢 牙买加
Yeah, mon. Jamaica.

677
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:09,002
祝你玩得愉快
Well, have yourself a nice time.

678
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:15,392
你找到Dunne上士和死去的赌徒 
Did you connect Staff Sergeant Dunne to the dead bookie

679
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:17,010
或者和福尔斯彻奇案子嫌疑人的联系了吗
or the Falls Church suspect?

680
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,562
还没有
No, not yet.

681
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,280
根据我问过的人所说的来看
Based on the people I've talked to,

682
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:21,681
Dunne似乎并不是一个赌徒
it appears that Dunne's not a gambler.

683
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,233
我还得去跟进其它几条线索
I still have other avenues to pursue,

684
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:25,736
我只是一直没时间把他们全部查完
I just haven't had the time to do it all.

685
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:29,790
-Tony 你有什么发现 -哦 是的
- Tony, you got something? - Oh, yeah.

686
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,958
你绝对不敢相信Olivia Chandler有多火辣
You won't believe how hot Olivia Chandler is.

687
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,460
真人比照片好看多了
Photos don't do her justice.

688
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:35,045
她和Dunne上士是什么关系
What's with her and Staff Sergeant Dunne?

689
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:36,413
她声称她们只是
Well, she claims they're only acquaintances

690
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:37,530
在A.A.会议上相识的
from A.A. meetings.

691
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,132
但我觉得不仅仅是这样
But I think it's more than that.

692
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:41,084
你说你有Dunne的信用卡账单--把它放上来
You said you had Dunne's credit card charges-- put them up.

693
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:43,303
-为什么 -相信我 放上来
-Why? -Trust me, put them up there.

694
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,642
好了 我们在找什么
All right, what are we looking for?

695
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,976
好了 如果真如我所想象的那样
Well, if they're doing what I think they're doing,

696
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,311
他们是不会在她家里做那事的
they're not doing it at her place.

697
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:54,231
我也不相信一个住在切维蔡斯有钱的家庭主妇
And I don't think a rich housewife from Chevy Chase

698
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:56,933
会舍得挪动她尊贵的大腿跑去匡提科
is dragging those long legs all the way down to Quantico.

699
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:58,185
等等 就在这里
Okay, wait. Hold on.

700
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:00,987
切维蔡斯旅馆
Chevy Chase Lodge.

701
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:02,606
那里 那里和那里
There, there and there.

702
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:04,808
三个晚上 或许还有更多
Three nights, probably more.

703
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,695
McGee 撤下来
Take it down, McGee.

704
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,700
48小时的监禁时间到了
Our 48 hours are up.

705
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,502
是的
Yep.

706
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,838
我什么时候能来开走我的车
When do I get my truck back?

707
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,641
我去查一下切维蔡斯旅店
I'm going to check out the Chevy Chase Lodge.

708
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:32,185
以交通肇事罪逮捕二等兵CLIFF
Book Private Cliff for the hit-and-run.

709
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:37,774
这件案子结束了 另一个还不知道结果
That's one case closed, another wide open.

710
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:50,633
是的 亲爱的 我了解
<i>Yes, dear, I understand.</i>

711
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:51,834
你了解吗
<i>Do you?</i>

712
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,469
-你有认真在听吗 -我听着呢
-Do you even hear? -I hear you.

713
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,855
不 不 不 我永远不会
No, no, no. I-I would never...

714
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,142
好吧...这是你妈妈的主意吗
Well... oh, it's your mother's idea?

715
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,476
是的 是她的意思
Yes, it's my mother's idea!

716
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:02,562
为什么我对此一点也不惊讶
Why does that not surprise me?

717
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,848
我得挂了 有客人在等我
I have to go. I have a guest waiting.

718
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:08,518
真的有客人在等我
I do have a guest waiting.

719
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,518
我没有编
I'm not making that up.

720
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,858
额...先生 你能帮助我吗
Uh... could you help me, please, sir?

721
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,160
这是谁 喂
Who is that? Hello?

722
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:18,411
好的 我一会再打给你
Okay. I'll call you later.

723
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,213
好 我宁愿去地狱也不想再打给你
Fine! Like hell I will.

724
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,249
你结婚了
You married?

725
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,917
噢 没有. 额..
Oh. No. Uh...

726
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,552
我是个联邦探员
I'm a federal agent.

727
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,637
DiNozzo.
DiNozzo.

728
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,205
有几个问题要问你
Like to ask a few questions.

729
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,973
好吧 联邦探员 尽管问吧
All right, federal agent, ask away.

730
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:32,391
你见过这个人吗
Have you seen this man?

731
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,375
是的
Yeah.

732
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:34,560
没错
Yeah, sure.

733
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,712
算是个常客
Sort of a regular.

734
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:37,680
嗯
Mmm?

735
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,265
那么，他是一个人来还是...
So, does he come alone or...?

736
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,550
他倒是想让我这么认为
Well, he'd like me to think that.

737
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:44,487
不是 他的朋友从没来过前厅
No, his friend never comes to the lobby.

738
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,856
他停下车 她就直接进房间
He parks the car, and she goes directly to the room.

739
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:50,159
你自己就会去想 你知道 他们或者结了婚 对吧
So you got to figure, you know, one or both are married, right?

740
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:52,445
没错 是的
Right. Yeah.

741
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:54,230
所以你从来没见过她
So you've never seen her?

742
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:56,582
实际上 我有一次装作
Well, actually, I did the old

743
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,584
敲错了门去看过
knock-on-the-wrong-door routine one time.

744
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,286
她长这样吗？
She look like this?

745
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:01,871
是的 这就是她
Yeah, that's her.

746
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,873
这样的女人，你是永远不会忘记的
Woman like that, you do not forget.

747
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,593
对吧 我是说 你能想象跟这样一位女士共度一晚...
Right? I mean, can you imagine what one night with...

748
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:12,048
我发誓 这老太婆绝对有通灵的能力
I swear, the old witch is psychic.

749
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,917
每当我一想起其它的女人
If I have so much as a thought of another woman...

750
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,135
你不必接这个电话
You don't have to answer that.

751
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,270
我必须接 你想
I have to. What...?!

752
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:18,805
干吗？
...do you want?

753
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:19,922
我了解了 好运
I got it. Good luck.

754
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:20,973
你需要..如果..
Just, do you need... if...

755
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:22,108
拿张名片吧 先生
Take a card, sir.

756
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,727
谢谢
Thank you.

757
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,983
给
Here.

758
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:35,922
Duck,跟你一起喝酒总是很享受啊 
Ah, always enjoy having a drink with you, Duck,

759
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:39,091
不过，这回不像是听完交响乐回家路过我这这么简单
but this isn't exactly on your way home from the symphony.

760
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:40,393
你在想什么
What's on your mind?

761
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,995
我正想问你同样的问题 我有些好奇
Well, curiously, I was about to ask you that.

762
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:45,081
你看起来有些困惑不安
You've seemed... troubled

763
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:48,134
自从你昨天在验尸房接了那个电话以后
since you took that call in Autopsy yesterday.

764
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:52,805
你通常都会很好的隐藏自己的感觉
Usually you're a master at hiding your feelings.

765
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:54,123
这是基于你专业的视角吗
That your professional opinion?

766
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,474
跟一个侧写师一起工作的
The occupational hazard

767
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,343
职业风险
of working with a profiler.

768
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:58,811
嗯..
Mmm.

769
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,463
我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

770
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:05,318
有点担心Carrie Clark
A little concerned about Carrie Clark.

771
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,520
律师 是的 她很不错
The lawyer? Yeah, she's good.

772
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:11,140
她帮助她的代理人免于起诉
She got her client released without being charged.

773
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,976
我察觉到你下一句 有个"但是"
I sense a "but."

774
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:17,980
她很有良心和道德感
Well, she does have a conscience.

775
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:19,832
这是件好事 不是吗
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

776
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,319
我们了解到一些关于她的代理人的事情
We learned some things about her client

777
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:27,323
她或多或少指引我们去的
that she may or may not have led us to.

778
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,125
秘密的资料
Privileged information?

779
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:32,295
医生 我必须很小心的处理这件事情
Doc, I got to be careful how I handle this.

780
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:34,830
保护Carrie
For Carrie's sake.

781
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:36,716
不然她会被取消律师资格
She could get disbarred.

782
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,384
我知道你 Jethro
Well, I know you, Jethro.

783
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:42,555
听起来她像在做正确的事 你也是
It sounds as if she's doing the right thing, as you are.

784
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,174
音乐会怎么样
So how was the concert?

785
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:48,477
非常好 柴可夫斯基第二号交响乐
Great. Tchaikovsky's Second.

786
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,898
我从来不知道他还给电影配过音乐
I never realized that he wrote music for the movies.

787
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,794
这是我非常迷恋的车
That's a car I've always had the hots for.

788
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:06,879
也许那才是我该开的
Maybe that's what I should get.

789
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,414
太老土了
It's too old.

790
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,916
你不能开那样的车
You can't drive a car like that.

791
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,217
这不实用
It's not practical.

792
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,335
这就是你的问题 麦古板
That's the problem with you, McGeezer.

793
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:13,419
所有的事都以实用为先
Everything has to be practical.

794
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:15,004
我...
What...

795
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:17,039
我的意思是 我从未见你
What I mean is, I've never known you

796
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,175
做出一点出格的事
to do anything even a little risqué.

797
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:23,545
Tony 你根本不知道我闲暇时在干什么
Tony, you have no idea what I do on my time off.

798
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:24,897
确实如此 我不知道
You know, that's true, I don't.

799
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:25,965
你为什么不跟我说呢
Why don't you tell me?

800
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:30,236
分享下喽  来啊  说啊
Share. Rock me. Sock me.

801
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,859
看  那是Wendell Kaiser
Well, there's Wendell Kaiser.

802
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:39,779
猜猜如果福尔斯彻奇的警察也在跟踪他
Wonder if Falls Church PD is tailing him, too.

803
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,397
Kaiser是他们的嫌犯
Kaiser's their suspect.

804
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,932
Kaiser准备去教堂
Is Kaiser going to church?

805
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,450
不 是一个AA聚会
【注：Alcoholics Anonymous，戒酒互助社】
No. It's an A.A. meeting.

806
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:03,419
他们每天早上都在这个时间见面
They meet here every morning at this time.

807
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,304
等等 你怎么知道的
Wait, how do you know that?

808
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:06,639

809
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,391
你在这儿干嘛呢
What are you doing here?

810
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:09,809
你的聚会应该在晚上啊
Your meeting's not until tonight.

811
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,261
Reverend Miller 我... - 带了个新成员吗
Reverend Miller, I, uh... - Bringing a new member?

812
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,562

He's thinking about it. A little gun-shy.

814

819
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:30,329
你酗酒了吗
Do you have a drinking problem?

820
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,915
不 不 我只是...
No. No, I just...

821
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,251
我加入了这个人的互助小组

每周两晚在教堂大厅聚会

00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:40,456
嗯
Mm-hmm.

825
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,558
我知道 这...
I know, it...

826
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,427
听起来并不像我 但是...
it doesn't sound like me, but...

827
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:47,680
过去这些年 我只是...
with the past year, I just...

828
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,982
只是想振作一下

829
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,633
结识一些新的朋友
Meet some new people.

830
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,302
在健身房 他告诉了我这个组织
This guy at the gym told me about the group,

831
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:55,905
我觉得听起来还不错

觉得...很有趣
And it... it is, it's fun.

833
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:02,578
有一天早上 牧师带我去了匡迪科
The Rev drove me to Quantico the other morning.

834
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,979
真是个有意思的人
Interesting guy.

835
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:05,981
他帮我缓解评头论足的坏毛病
He's helping me be less judgmental.

836
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,503
你知道的 Kaiser一会就要来了
You know, Kaiser's going to be here for a while.

837
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,321
我们得回去
We should get back.

838
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:25,184
Dunne上士 Olivia Chandler以及Wendell Kaiser
Sergeant Dunne, Olivia Chandler and Wendell Kaiser

839
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:27,136
都有一个共同点
all have one thing in common.

840
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,938
他们都参加AA聚会
They all go to A.A. meetings.

841
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,356
他们也许是在那认识的
That's probably where they met.

842
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,025
上士和花瓶妻子是情人关系
The sergeant and the trophy wife are lovers.

843
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,643
Chevy Chase旅馆的前台说
The desk clerk at the Chevy Chase Lodge

844
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,612
他们都是常客
said that they were regulars.

845
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,514
就像那部电影《体热》里的
【体热：赫特是佛罗里达的职业律师，遇上了已婚的社交名媛特纳，与之热恋
并共同密谋杀害她富有的丈夫】
It's just like that movie <i>Body Heat.</i>

846
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,182
威廉姆・赫特和凯瑟琳・特纳
William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.

847
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:42,017
天呐 老大 她确实有问题啊 
God, she was really something, boss.

848
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,402
出乎意料
A head turner.

849
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,822
但我觉得有点离谱
But I digress.

850
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:49,625
不管怎么讲 他们是年轻的恋人 就像这俩人
Anyway, they were young lovers, just like these two,

851
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,710
还图谋富豪丈夫的钱财
and they wanted the rich husband's money

852
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:52,878
他们需要除掉那个富豪
and him out of the way.

853
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,463
另一方面 Wendell Kaiser
On the other hand, you've got

854
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:55,998
输了很大笔钱给他的赌马经纪人
Wendell Kaiser, who's deep in debt to his bookie

855
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,550
他需要除掉那个经纪人
and needs him off his back.

856
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,585
所以他们互相帮助对方杀掉了想杀的人
So they help each other out and switch murders.

857
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,137
当Kaiser在纽约时
While Kaiser was in New York,

858
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:03,472
Dunne在Olivia的帮助下杀了赌马经纪人
Dunne killed the bookie with Olivia's help.

859
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:05,841
她负责开车  她的车就在附近
She drove him. Her car was in the vicinity.

860
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,843
谁又会怀疑他们呢
Who would ever suspect them?

861
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:09,645
我是说 根本没有联系也没有动机
I mean, there's no connection, no motive.

862
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:12,181
第二天Dunne上士开始部署行动
Tomorrow Sergeant Dunne is going to deploy

863
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:14,266
而Olivia Chandler去了牙买加
and Olivia Chandler is off to Jamaica.

864
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,485
我打赌当他们离开时
And I'm betting that while they're away,

865
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,154
她的丈夫将会遭遇
her husband's going to have a terrible accident

866
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:19,822
一起由Kaiser先生策划的严重事故
at the hands of Mr. Kaiser here,

867
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:22,024
一个跟他完全没关系的人
a man with whom he has no connection.

868
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,893
两起谋杀案 三个确凿的不在场证明
Two murders, three solid alibis.

869
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:26,395
真是个有趣的解释
Interesting theory.

870
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:29,198
我们知道这是个很难证明的阴谋
We know it's going to be a hard conspiracy for us to prove.

871
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,233
我们都要仔细些  不仅仅是案件
We got to be careful-- it's not our case.

872
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,923
有一个办法
There's a way.

873
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:43,078
去找一些细微的联系
Find the weak link.

874
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,093
嗨 Kaiser
Hey, Kaiser.

875
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,230
你有时间吗
You got a minute?

876
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,983
Dockry警探
Detective Dockry.

877
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,602
我认为我们之间没什么可说的了
I thought we were done.

878
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:09,488
我把我知道的关于Sullivan的所有事都告诉你了
Look, I told you everything I know about Sullivan.

879
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,073
是的 但是呢 又有一些新情况
Yeah, well, something's come up.

880
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:13,292
我们去警局吧 聊聊新的情况
Let's go to the station. We can talk about it.

881
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,777
呃 我哪也不去
Nah, I'm not going anywhere.

882
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:17,779
听着 我跟Sullivan的谋杀案一点关系都没有
Look, I had nothing to do with Sullivan's murder.

883
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,781
我当时在纽约 亲 你可以查的
I was in New York, man. You checked it out.

884
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:23,636
你真的想在你朋友面前被带走吗
You really want to do this in front of your friends?

885
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,473
我哪也不跟你去
I'm not going anywhere with you.

886
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:32,794
我们了解你的兄弟 Dunne上士
We know about your buddy, Sergeant Dunne,

887
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,648
还有他的女朋友
and his girlfriend.

888
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,803
那就让我来解释下案件是怎么进行的
So let me explain how this works.

889
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:46,408
首先 两方嫌疑人互通情报达成共识
First suspect to flip on the others gets the deal.

890
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,201
Olivia Chandler
Olivia Chandler?

891
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,771
嗨 Gibbs
Hey, Gibbs.

892
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,406
DiNozzo告诉我如果你不在家
DiNozzo told me that if you weren't at home

893
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,725
我没准能在这找到你
I would probably find you here.

894
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,578
坐吧
Have a seat.

895
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,667
有什么问题吗
There a problem?

896
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,286
没有 我...
No, I...

897
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,037
只是听到一个福尔斯彻奇的警察
just heard that Falls Church PD

898
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,790
逮捕了我的前委托人 Dunne上士
arrested my former client, Sergeant Dunne.

899
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,125
是吗
Really?

900
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:27,843
他们对他有多项指控
Yeah, they booked him on multiple charges,

901
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:31,597
包括串通谋杀和杀死一人
including conspiracy to commit murder and murder one.

902
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,881
他们是怎么抓到他的
How'd they get him?

903
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,501
很显然是他的其中一个同谋者
Apparently one of his coconspirators

904
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,252
将证据交给了警方
turned state's evidence.

905
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:41,440
有时候...你挺走运的
Sometimes... you get lucky.

906
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:44,026
这就是走运
Mmm, is that what it was?

907
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:49,198
他们拿到了搜查令
They got a warrant and cinched the case against Dunne

908
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,099
当在马桶水箱里找到了凶器---一把刀
when they found the murder weapon, a knife,

909
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:54,119
也就把这起谋杀案牢牢对准Dunne了
in his bathroom toilet tank.

910
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,422
太棒了
That's great.

911
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,744
你还好吗
You okay?

912
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:04,580
是的
Yeah.

913
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:06,281
为什么不好呢  我完成了我的工作
Why wouldn't I be? I did my job.

914
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:07,966
我在紧急关头抓住了Dunne
I got Dunne off on the hit-and-run.

915
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,385
你做的很好
Yeah, you did it well.

916
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:11,720
是的 不管他之后发生了什么
Yes, and whatever happened to him after that,

917
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:12,588
都跟我没关系
it's not my concern.

918
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,624
正义终被伸张
Justice was served, all around.

919
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:21,013
好了 慢用
Okay. Here you go.

920
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:23,065
介意跟我一起吃顿饭吗
Care to join me for dinner?

921
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:27,736
肉饼和土豆泥
Hmm, meat loaf and mashed potatoes?

922
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:32,358
我的最爱 我很乐意
My favorite. I would be happy to.

923
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,910
马上就好
Coming right up.

924
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,662
谢谢 Elaine
Thanks, Elaine.

925
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:44,169
我觉得我们还是有一些共同点的
I think that you and me have a few things in common.

926
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:57,662
