1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,130
吃晚餐啦
Dinner!

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,500
我超愛國際菜卷餅之夜
I love international taco night.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,540
我們有...
We have...

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,610
法國薯條  希臘奶酪
French fries, Greek Yogurt,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,910
加拿大培根  中國面條
Canadian bacon, Chinese noodles,

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,670
意大利香腸  美國干酪
Italian sausage, American cheese,

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,250
以及智利的特產  紅辣椒
and from the country of Chile, chili.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,590
其實就是把冰箱中那些快要變質的食物
Kind of just seems like we're eating all the food

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,860
一起弄出來搞個大雜燴吧
in the fridge that was about to go bad.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,650
是的  但是是用卷餅包著的哦
Yes, but in a taco shell.

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,810
有點像是在聯合國吃自助餐
This is like the buffet at the United Nations

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,390
只不過沒有混蛋警察
without all the grab-ass.

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,860
喜旺  瞧  這些面條都是中國進口
Hope, look, these noodles were made all the way in China

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,770
是些跟你年紀一樣大的小姑娘做的
by little girls the same age as you.

15
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,460
其實  在中國
You know, in China

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,080
他們吃的面條和我們這的
they actually eat a completely different

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,330
完全不一樣
kind of noodle than we have here.

18
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,500
我不想讓人覺得我搞種族歧視
I don't want to sound racist,

19
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,710
但我真覺得所有中國面條都是一個樣
but I kind of think all Chinese noodles look alike.

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,920
好吧  我只是說說
Yeah. I'm just saying.

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,500
我小時候我們家經常出去旅行
My family used to travel a lot when I was a kid.

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,910
中國  阿根廷  澳大利亞
China, Argentina, Australia...

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,010
我小時候就知道什么時候該閉嘴
When I was a kid, I learned to keep my mouth shut

24
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,190
別喋喋不休  好像自己無所不知似的
and not be such an annoying know-it-all.

25
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,190
我小時候其實也經常出去旅行呢
You know, we went on a lot of trips when I was little, too.

26
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,500
吃完晚飯給你看出游照片
I should, uh, show you the vacation photos after dinner.

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,530
爛主意
Uh, that's a terrible idea.

28
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,830
沒人喜歡看別人家的出游照片
Nobody likes to look at other people's vacation photos.

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
再說  那些照片也早就不在了
Besides, those pictures don't exist anymore.

30
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,280
是啊
Yeah.

31
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,170
它們都熔化在了...
They melted in a...

32
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,060
那場奇怪的只在架子上燃燒的大火中
strangely contained shelf fire?

33
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,170
你們確定嗎
Are you sure?

34
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,980
我好像幾天前還看過呢
I thought I saw them a couple days ago.

35
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,890
這些卷餅到底該是硬的還是軟的啊
Are these supposed to be hard or soft shell tacos?

36
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,170
那是餐巾紙  曾奶奶
That's a napkin, Maw Maw.

37
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,090
那些墨西哥人還會創造出什么美食呢
What will those Mexicans think of next?

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,030
那是我們去湖泊世界時拍的
And that is when we went to Lake World.

39
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,790
天啊  鯰魚秀真是太精彩了
Oh, man, the catfish show was amazing.

40
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,600
瞧瞧你  一副蔫搭搭的樣子
Look at you, all tuckered out.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,270
這是我們去佛蒙特滑雪的時候拍的
Oh, and this is when we went skiing in Vermont.

42
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,700
我們住的大木屋就在本和杰瑞旁邊
We stayed in this big cabin next to Ben and Jerry.

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,040
不  不是生產冰激凌的那兩位
No, not the ice cream guys,

44
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,680
只是一對度假的同志夫夫
just a gay couple on vacation.

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,740
你又是昏睡狀態的
You're asleep again.

46
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,620
是啊  我一出去度假就暈車
Yeah, I always used to get carsick on vacations

47
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,720
所以我爸媽就會讓我吃藥
so my parents would give me medicine

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,950
讓我昏沉沉的
and it would make me kind of drowsy.

49
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,360
我們要么看他吐  要么讓他睡
We had to choose between a puker and a sleeper.

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,740
最終我們選擇讓他睡
We chose sleeper.

51
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,230
嘿  我不是想轉移話題
Hey, not to change the subject,

52
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,850
不過  只有我一個人這么覺得嗎
but is it just me,

53
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,170
好像最近什么東西上都時興加尼龍搭扣了
or is there a lot more Velcro on stuff lately?

54
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,550
天空中那塊棕黃色的印跡是什么
Yeah, what is this brown stain in the sky?

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,110
-是風暴云吧  -我的胃中一陣翻滾難受
- Storm cloud. - I'm starting to get a weird feeling in my stomach.

56
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,400
在山的這邊竟然還有道裂縫
There's a rip in the side of this mountain.

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
當然會有了
Of course there is.

58
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,260
那是裂縫山
That's Rip Mountain.

59
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,650
天啊
Oh, my God.

60
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,050
這些都是假的
These are all fake.

61
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,490
好吧  有些確實是假的
Fine. Some of them are fake.

62
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,940
但第一張是真的
But the first one's real.

63
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,350
你小的時候  其他孩子都炫耀說
When you were little, all the other kids

64
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,710
去湖泊世界玩什么的
were bragging about going to Lake World,

65
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,680
所以我們就帶你去了
so we took you.

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,500
但你暈車了  所以我們就喂你吃了暈車藥
But you got carsick, so we gave you medicine.

67
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,310
那不僅讓你在駕車過程中是昏睡的
Not only did it knock you out for the drive,

68
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,350
你那一整天都睡過去了
you slept through the whole day.

69
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,350
第二天早上
And the next morning,

70
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,300
你就不停地說
all you could talk about

71
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,610
你在湖泊世界玩得有多開心
was what a great time you had at Lake World.

72
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,460
我們就心想  何必止步于此呢
So we figured, why stop there?

73
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,210
不如讓你擁有遍游全國的美好記憶吧
Why not give you great memories of seeing the whole country?

74
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,180
快喝  寶貝
Drink up, honey.

75
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,800
開車去夏威夷很遠呢
It's a long drive to Hawaii.

76
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,830
一旦你進入夢鄉
Once you were in dreamland,

77
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,040
我們就開車穿越小鎮   
we'd just drive across town

78
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,220
去到攝影室后面的垃圾站
to the dumpster behind the photography studio.

79
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,140
我在附近偷瞄著他們
I did landscaping nearby,

80
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,510
所以每次我看到他們扔掉布景
so every time I saw them throw out a backdrop,

81
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,760
我們就知道度假時間來了
we knew it was vacation time.

82
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,130
我們遍游各地
We went everywhere.

83
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,460
我們給了吉米一個孩子能擁有的
We gave Jimmy the greatest

84
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,700
最完美的假想式童年回憶
imaginary childhood a kid could have.

85
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,840
就是說
So you're telling me

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,740
我沒用過那個貓王死在上面的馬桶  是嗎
I never used the toilet that Elvis died on?

87
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,570
我現在還在到處吹噓這事呢
I mean, I still brag about that!

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,880
沒關系的  吉米  沒關系的
Shh. It's okay, Jimmy. It's okay.

89
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,150
反正到最后都會變成布魯克林橋下的河水
It's all water under the Brooklyn Bridge.

90
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,910
現在我們知道你其實從沒見過那橋
Which we now know you never actually saw.

91
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,880
重要的是
The important thing is that

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,530
我們要努力為喜旺創造更美好的回憶
we're gonna work harder for Hope.

93
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,780
我們當年可是努力得很呢
We worked pretty hard.

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,850
我只是說我們要帶她去真正旅行而已
I just mean we're gonna take her on a real vacation.

95
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,970
哇塞  真正的旅行啊
Oh. A "Real" Vacation.

96
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,800
兩個雜貨店打工的  祝你們好運啊
Good luck with that on two grocery baggers' salaries.

97
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,420
其實不必非要奢華啊
It doesn't have to be fancy

98
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,690
只要我們一家人清醒地
as long as we're together.

99
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,500
在一起就好
And awake.

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
根本不值得那樣做
It's not worth it.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,380
家庭旅行只會讓每一個人都失控
Family vacations just get everybody out of sync.

102
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,210
她說得對
She's right.

103
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,240
其實就是整天開車  被太陽曬傷
It's nothing but driving and sunburns

104
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
還有不斷爭吵
and a whole lot of fighting.

105
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,240
你怎么知道  你從沒帶我們去過任何地方
How would you know? You never took us anywhere.

106
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,590
瞧吧  我們已經在吵了
See? We're already fighting.

107
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,090
很快我們就會被太陽曬傷
Pretty soon we're gonna be sunburned.

108
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,640
我們可能是沒有帶吉米真正旅行過
Maybe we didn't give Jimmy real vacations.

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,250
但我們給了他真實的回憶
But we gave him real memories.

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,500
反正小孩子出去旅行的收獲也就是回憶罷了
And that's all kids remember from vacations anyway... is memories.

111
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,380
現在吉米的回憶都被毀了
And now all Jimmy's memories are ruined.

112
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,050
謝謝你  海倫·凱勒[盲人作家]
Thank you, Helen Keller.

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,230
我覺得你想說的應該不是這個人吧
I don't think that's who you think it is.

114
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,490
就那個女警探
Yeah, the girl detective.

115
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,290
你想的是阿米莉亞·艾哈特[女權運動者]
You're thinking of Amelia Earhart.

116
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,200
南茜·德魯  你想說的是神探南茜
Nancy Drew. You're thinking of Nancy Drew.

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,250
我完全不記得有這號人物
Doesn't ring a bell.

118
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,540
那不重要
It's not important.

119
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,510
事實是  吉米之前很開心  
The fact is, Jimmy was happy,

120
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,980
很無知  以為自己遍游各地
well-traveled and ignorant,

121
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,080
因為你  他現在知道了真相了
and you just took away two of those things.

122
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,850
我真不愿意承認你媽是對的
I hate to think your mother is right,

123
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,190
但這里的所有旅行路線都要好幾千美元
but all the vacations in here cost thousands of dollars.

124
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,510
你查看美洲獅油輪路線了嗎
Have you looked into a cougar cruise?

125
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,510
美洲獅也指如狼似虎的饑渴中年婦女

126
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,110
加勒比海灘三夜之旅
It's three nights on the Caribbean.

127
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,180
非常狂野哦
It's pretty wild.

128
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,230
弗蘭克  我們在計劃家庭旅行
Frank, we're trying to plan a family vacation,

129
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,250
而不是和老女人亂搞
not have sex with older women.

130
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,080
不  是真正的美洲獅哦
No, these are actual live cougars.

131
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,540
你和它們一起飄洋過海
You sail the high seas with them.

132
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,090
差不多就是根據那部搞笑片《少年派》設計的
It's loosely based off that hilarious movie Life of Pi.

133
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,620
但這是游艇游
But it is a cruise,

134
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,360
所以  如果你愛熟女的話
so... there are a lot of older women,

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,520
那里有很多哦
if you're into that.

136
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,710
看看這個
Check this out.

137
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,770
我是說  雖然這不是美洲獅游艇游
I mean, it's no cougar cruise,

138
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,310
但這至少還算是乘船游了
but at least it's still a boat trip.

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,710
邊度假邊掙錢
"Travel and make money."

140
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,150
聽起來很棒啊
Oh, that sounds cool.

141
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,470
你知道還有什么事很棒嗎
You know what else is cool?

142
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,400
別在你們沒邀請的人面前談論
Not talking about the awesome trips you're gonna take

143
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,620
你們即將開始的美妙旅程
in front of someone you haven't invited.

144
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,580
你們還有機會噢
Yet.

145
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,900
猜猜怎么著
Guess what.

146
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,110
你們錯了
You guys were wrong.

147
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,880
塞布麗娜給我們找到一個很棒的度假計劃
Sabrina found us a great vacation.

148
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,820
你沒看到我們在給曾奶奶洗牙嗎
Can't you see we're doing a teeth cleaning?

149
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,390
如果你把她弄醒了
If you startle Maw Maw awake,

150
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,000
我跟你媽中有個人得掉根指頭
one of us could lose a finger.

151
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,890
嘿  你看
Hey, look.

152
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,790
這是大富翁游戲的那個小鐵片
It's the little iron from the Monopoly set.

153
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,580
我們有一年多沒玩了
We haven't played in over a year.

154
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,520
我們得更經常給她洗洗牙
We should really floss her more often.

155
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,170
我們是來邀請你們
We came over here to invite you guys

156
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,820
來一次真正的家庭度假
on a real family vacation.

157
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,500
不是在小巷外或者是
One that will take place outside of an alley

158
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,460
垃圾車邊上
and nowhere near a Dumpster.

159
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,870
我得看下我的行程表
Let me check my calendar.

160
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,930
沒空不去
Pass.

161
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,950
你們玩得開心
You guys have fun.

162
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,740
這兒就是我們的天堂
We got our paradise right here.

163
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,810
看  這是個棋盤游戲的幸運符
Look, it's a game board bonanza.

164
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,730
我估計是馬斯塔德上校的燭臺
Think I found Colonel Mustard's candlestick.

165
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,730
馬斯塔德上校  推理棋牌游戲Cluedo的角色

166
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,450
不  只是個牙齒填充物罷了
No. That's just a filling.

167
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,430
你們倆真的不跟
You guys sure you don't want to go

168
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,520
我們去度假嗎
on this vacation with us?

169
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,470
聽著  這個富裕的瓦德克拉姆家庭
Look, this rich Vanderklam family

170
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,350
花500美金請我們幫忙把船順流而下
is paying us 500 bucks to go sail their boat

171
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,900
開到富爾頓碼頭
down the river to the Fulton Marina.

172
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,580
然后我們就能用
Then we're gonna use

173
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,060
用那筆錢在那住兩晚
that money on two nights at a hotel

174
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,750
并乘火車回納什維爾
and train tickets back to Natesville.

175
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,690
你知道我在想什么嗎
You thinking what I'm thinking?

176
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,720
游艇性愛
Boat sex?

177
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,490
什么
Excuse me?

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,350
你剛剛是說"游艇性愛"嗎
Did you just say "Boat sex"?

179
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,450
我們有一張"交通工具性愛"待辦表
We've got this whole "Transportation sex" Checklist

180
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,390
我們正在努力實現中
we're plowing through.

181
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,310
對了  犁
Ooh, a plow!

182
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,110
這玩意有在表上嗎
Is that even on the list?

183
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,480
剛剛加上了
It is now.

184
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,740
這從數年前
This all started years ago

185
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,700
我跟你媽藏在行李艙里蹭車時就開始了
when your mom and I snuck a ride on a bus.

186
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,270
我們應該等到比較顛簸的路段再辦事
We should wait for a bumpy section of highway

187
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,130
那樣咱倆不用動就能爽了
and let the road do all the work.

188
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,990
你太聰明了
You're so smart.

189
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,560
謝了  戴爾
Thanks, Dale.

190
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,300
嗯  那個
Well, uh...

191
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,790
我希望你們一起去
I was hoping that you'd want to come with

192
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,350
這樣就是我們全家共同的回憶了
to be part of our family memories.

193
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,990
當然  我們去
Oh, definitely. We're in.

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,510
我們要坐前排
We are gonna have front-row seats

195
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,360
來迎接這場度假災難
for this vacation disaster.

196
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,570
好  就這樣了
Okay, that's it.

197
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,860
把腌黃瓜拿來
Get the pickle.

198
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,210
曾爺爺以前就是這樣弄醒我的
That's how Paw Paw used to wake me up.

199
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,230
當然
Of course,

200
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,110
他那根比這小點  味道還不好聞
his pickle was smaller and smelled a lot worse.

201
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,670
你好  我們是來這把瓦德克拉姆家的船開到
Uh, we're here to take the Vanderklams' boat

202
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,230
富爾頓碼頭的
to the Fulton Marina.

203
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,550
我喜歡你們的穿著
I like how you dressed the part.

204
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,590
很少人開車拖船時
It's not often you see folks get so decked out

205
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,410
會如此盛裝打扮
just to tow a boat down the highway.

206
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,620
我們是要拖過去
We're towing it?

207
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,680
你在搞笑嗎
We... Are you kidding me?

208
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
我還以為要把游艇開過去
I thought we were gonna take it out on the water.

209
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,930
我還以為吉米·巴菲特[歌手]是個好榜樣呢
And I thought Jimmy Buffett was a good role model.

210
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,930
玩得開心點
Have a great trip.

211
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,000
搞毛啊
Aw, man.

212
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,320
看來暈車藥派上用場了
Bet carsick medicine sounds real good now.

213
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,770
你們倆只要給個訊號
You two just give the signal

214
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,670
這玩意還是99%純果汁呢
and it's nighty-night juice all around.

215
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,160
你看宣傳單上  這船明顯不在拖車上的嘛
Now, on the flyer, the boat is clearly not on a trailer.

216
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,540
這太容易誤解了
It's highly misleading.

217
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,290
嗯  我們帶吉米度假時
Well, nothing like this ever happened

218
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,880
從沒發生過這種事
when we took Jimmy on vacations.

219
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,150
沒事發生  是因為一直昏迷壓根就不是度假
Nothing happened because being unconscious is not a vacation.

220
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,460
我不敢茍同
I beg to differ.

221
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,520
這樣吧  沿途好像有家
Now, it looks like there's

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
填充毛絨玩具博物館
a Stuffed Animal Museum right on the way,

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,450
那里應該會給喜旺美好的回憶
and that'd be a great memory for Hope.

224
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,830
我跟伯特要在游艇里面
Burt and I will ride on the boat.

225
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,400
讓你們倆有點私人空間
Just to give you two some privacy.

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,650
我去后備箱
I'll grab the champagne and the boombox

227
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,540
拿香檳跟音響
out of the back of the car,

228
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,080
我們啟航吧  
we'll set sail.

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,300
喂  喂  喂
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,260
別想太多
No, no.

231
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,180
誰也不能進船
No one is allowed in the boat.

232
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,740
你看過合同沒啊
Didn't you read the contract?

233
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,000
當然 每個字都看了
Oh, yeah, I read every word.

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,460
結果我女兒穿的像蛙人一樣  去公路旅行
That's why my daughter's wearing a snorkel on a road trip.

235
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,030
還有我不知道的事嗎
Is there anything else I might've missed?

236
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,450
如果你下午4點前送不到那碼頭的話
If you don't get the boat there by 4:00 P.M.,

237
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,970
你只能拿一半錢
you forfeit half the money.

238
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,470
哦
Right.

239
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,150
這么說我們得在   
So that means we had to leave, what?

240
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,770
30分鐘前出發 
30 minutes ago?

241
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,860
大家趕緊上車
Everyone get in the car.

242
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,530
趕緊的
Go, go, go, go, go!

243
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,240
對不起對不起對不起
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

244
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,060
抱歉
Sorry.

245
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,490
可以停車嗎  塞布麗娜
Can we please stop the car, Sabrina?

246
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,900
我們已經憋了五個小時了
We've been holding it for five hours.

247
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,760
原來我們得憋著啊
We're supposed to be holding it?

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,570
今天才知道
That's news to me.

249
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,610
我也是
Me, too.

250
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,210
我們下個加油站停車
We're gonna stop at the next gas station.

251
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,290
之前的五個加油站你也是這么說的
That's what you said about the last five gas stations.

252
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,580
下個加油站比較大
The next gas station that has room

253
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,550
船進得去出得來
for a boat to go in and out of it.

254
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,500
再堅持會
Just hang in there.

255
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,080
看著好像還有一英里就到了
It looks like there's one coming up in about a mile.

256
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,310
填充毛絨玩具博物館也還有
Hey, the Stuffed Animal Museum's

257
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,490
一英里就要到了
coming up in about a mile.

258
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,620
我們順便去一下
We're gonna be stopped right by it.

259
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,300
吉米  咱現在得先把船送到
Okay, Jimmy, delivering the boat is our priority right now.

260
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,110
只是想提醒你  別忘了那博物館
Just wanted to make sure you didn't forget about the museum.

261
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,990
你這么一直念叨我還真忘不掉
It's hard to forget about it when you mention it ten times.

262
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,790
聽起來有人像是要失控了
Sounds like somebody's getting a little out of sync.

263
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,040
我們沒失控
We're not out of sync!

264
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,370
別再說"水槽"了[諧音失控]
Please don't say "Sink."

265
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,890
或者是其他我以前尿過的東西
Or the name of anything else I have ever peed in.

266
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,970
趕緊去  我們只有十分鐘
Go quickly. We only have ten minutes.

267
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:51,200
加油站兼食品店

268
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,920
五分鐘后

269
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,800
好了
Okay.

270
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,810
快
Come on.

271
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,340
搞毛
What...?

272
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,370
車去哪了
Where the hell is the car?

273
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,230
偷偷說一句
Hey, between you and me?

274
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,180
咱的假期開始有意思了
This vacation's starting to get interesting.

275
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
搞毛
Wha...?

276
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,120
這不科學
What?This doesn't make any sense.

277
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,380
怎么會有人放著游艇不要去偷車
Why would somebody take the car but leave the boat?

278
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,180
因為沒有人想拖游艇
Because nobody wants to tow a boat?

279
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,070
以前我們去裂縫山時  從沒發生過這種事
Nothing like this ever happened to us at Rip Mountain.

280
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,990
這是個災難征兆
It's a sign.

281
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,610
先把每種動物都收集雌雄兩只
First we gather two of every kind of animal.

282
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,740
接著我們等著就好[暗示諾亞方舟典故]
Then we wait.

283
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,390
動物標本博物館

284
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,390
stuffed animial又有填充毛絨玩具的意思

285
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,970
沒事  我能搞定
Okay, I got this.

286
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,240
吉米  你帶喜旺和曾奶奶
Jimmy, I just want you to take Hope and Maw Maw

287
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,900
去毛絨玩具博物館
and go into the Stuffed Animal Museum, okay?

288
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,150
我去報警
I'm gonna call the cops.

289
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,380
大家別著急
Don't worry, everybody.

290
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,500
時間還很充裕
There's still plenty of time

291
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,420
夠咱們制造美好的家庭回憶
to make some happy family memories, okay?

292
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,780
咱的車才被偷了
Our car was just stolen.

293
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,890
我不想讓你一個人處理這堆爛事
I don't want to leave you on your own to deal with this.

294
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,820
吉米  我們是來找樂子的
Jimmy... we came here to have fun,

295
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,100
我們一定會很歡樂的  靠
and we are gonna have fun, damn it.

296
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,410
趕緊帶上孩子
So take the kid

297
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,500
還有這瘋老婆子
and take the crazy old lady,

298
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,630
給我進去
and go in there

299
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,710
制造一些美好的回憶
and make some happy memories!

300
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,710
能做到嗎
Okay?

301
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
能
All right.

302
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,900
咱們制造回憶去
Let's go make some memories!

303
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,090
制造回憶去咯
Let's make some memories.

304
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,760
看著游艇
Watch the boat.

305
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,450
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

306
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,050
我絕不會讓偷車的小毛賊破壞我的假期
No punk car thief is gonna take down my vacation.

307
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,450
如果我五分鐘內沒回來  就去地獄找我吧
If I'm not back in five minutes, forward my mail to Hell.

308
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,070
開玩笑啦
I'm just kidding.

309
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,440
如果我五分鐘內沒回來  一定記得叫救護車啊
If I'm not back in five minutes, please call an ambulance.

310
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,130
我盡力了
Tried to warn her.

311
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,400
就跟她說度假煩事多嘛
Vacations are a disaster.

312
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,900
現在游艇是咱倆的了
Hey, we have that boat all to ourselves.

313
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,340
她叫咱倆看著游艇
She said watch the boat.

314
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,140
又沒叫咱站在外面看著
Didn't say watch it from outside.

315
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,410
來吧
Come on... whoa!

316
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,510
這對吉米的嬰兒床管用  游艇也應該沒問題
Good enough for Jimmy's crib, good enough for a boat.

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,590
歡迎來到動物標本博物館
Welcome to the Stuffed Animal Museum.

318
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,500
暢享奇觀  老少咸宜
A menagerie of wonders and merriment for all ages.

319
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
成人票  兒童票  老人票各一張
All right, well, one adult, one child and one senior, please.

320
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,310
老年人免票
seniors are free.

321
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,250
必須的嘛
Of course.

322
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,240
因為咱已經不是真正的人了
'Cause we're not real people anymore,

323
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,770
這衣服和皮膚都是靠屁撐著
just clothes and skin holding in farts.

324
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,100
你真是個開心果
Aren't you delightful!

325
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,250
你看起來絕對不超過85歲
You don't look a day over 85.

326
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,050
你也是喲
Likewise.

327
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,300
等你參觀完出來
Once you've gone through the tour,

328
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,420
我們不如
why don't we just, uh,

329
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,360
把假牙摘了  看看會發生什么
take our teeth out and see what happens.

330
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,690
實在不忍心打斷你們令人作嘔的對話
Not to interrupt this disgusting interaction,

331
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,870
但我四歲的閨女
but my four-year-old is real anxious

332
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,190
焦急地等著看毛絨玩具呢
to go see the stuffed animals.

333
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,750
你的意思應該是激動吧
I believe you mean to say "Excited."

334
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,290
焦急的意思是很焦慮
"Anxious" Means "Filled with anxiety."

335
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,950
現在這些年輕人都不講究語法啊
These kids today and their grammar.

336
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,770
進去以后
Okay, once inside,

337
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,260
跟著地上黃色的爪印走就行
just follow the yellow paw prints on the floor to guide you through.

338
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,730
好好享受哦
Enjoy.

339
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,510
明白
All right.

340
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,080
旅程即將開啟
We're gonna go through...

341
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,860
準備好了嗎  喜旺
You ready, Hope?

342
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,780
絕對是美妙的神奇之旅
This is gonna be awesome.

343
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,720
這不是我們說的那種可愛毛絨玩具啊
Not the cute kind of stuffed animals!

344
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
不可愛
Not cute!

345
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,280
轉不動
It won't spin this way.

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,250
救命啊
Help!

347
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,570
我們搞錯了
There's been some kind of misunderstanding.

348
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,900
放我們出去
Would you let us out!

349
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,540
跟著黃色爪印走
Please follow the yellow paw prints.

350
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,490
謝謝配合  好好享受
Thank you and enjoy.

351
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,430
曾奶奶  快幫我帶喜旺出去
Maw Maw, help me get Hope out of here.

352
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,010
我在跟這貓頭鷹比賽對視呢
Shh! I'm in a staring contest with this owl.

353
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,380
我本想運個游艇  度個開心的假期
I came here to deliver a boat and have a nice vacation.

354
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,690
現在我的假期全給毀了
And right now, I'm all out of vacation.

355
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,900
姐你在說什么
What does that even mean?

356
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,390
別怕  喜旺
It's okay, Hope.

357
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,380
我們只是在玩躲貓貓的恐怖加長版
We're just playing a long, creepy game of peek-a-boo.

358
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,130
我要去網上
I am gonna write a very negative

359
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,920
給你們博物館差評
online review of your museum!

360
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,900
去吧  我會刪掉的
Go ahead, I'll delete it.

361
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
你刪掉了我還會繼續寫
Well, then I'll write another one!

362
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,530
那我就繼續刪
Then I'll delete that one, too.

363
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,940
你行  那我不寫了
Fine! Then I'll probably give up at that point.

364
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,030
但我還是很生氣
But I'll still be very upset!

365
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,890
吉米
Jimmy!

366
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,430
去找那家伙要名片
Get this guy's card.

367
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,490
他真能干
He's good.

368
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,750
我之前在考慮火化
I was thinking cremation,

369
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,480
可是看到他把這老蝙蝠保養得這么好
but if he can make this old bat look good,

370
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,450
我想把我交給他應該也錯不了
imagine what he could do for me.

371
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,150
伯特  怎么了
Burt, what's going on?

372
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,140
可能有點問題
I think I'm having a little problem.

373
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,970
要來點我們在野外浴缸里激戰時
Do we have to get those pills

374
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,030
用的那種藥嗎
where we sit in bathtubs in a field?

375
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,050
不是  這家人的度假照片
No, I think I'm just distracted

376
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,430
讓我分心了
by these pictures of this family on vacation.

377
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,530
我在想我們以前是不是能讓吉米的童年更加美好
I'm wondering if we could've done better for Jimmy.

378
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,850
伯特  他們這些有游艇的土豪
Burt, these people are "Boat rich."

379
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,580
當然有資本享受豪華的假期了
Of course they had fancy vacations.

380
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,950
也不都是豪華的
But they're not all fancy vacations.

381
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,920
他們去遠足  去海邊
They went hiking, they went to the beach.

382
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,150
去納什維爾湖釣魚
They went fishing at Natesville Lake.

383
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,910
這湖離咱家很近
That's closer to our house than the Dumpster

384
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,260
比照相館后面的垃圾箱近多了
behind the photo studio.

385
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,160
接下來你就該同意塞布麗娜的想法了
Next you're gonna say you think Sabrina was right.

386
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,260
不會不會
No, no, no, no.

387
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,440
絕對不會
No!

388
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,710
肯定不會
No.

389
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,880
也許吧
Maybe.

390
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,970
也許
Maybe?

391
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,490
不是肯定也許
Not a definite maybe.

392
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,880
是可能大概也許
A maybe-ish maybe.

393
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,240
那
So...

394
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,600
就是說我不對咯
you're saying I'm wrong?

395
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,570
也許吧
Maybe?

396
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,620
你也許就是這個意思
Maybe you're saying that,

397
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,860
還是我也許錯了
or maybe I'm wrong?

398
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,390
或者
Or...

399
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,960
也許你是我見過的最美的女人
maybe you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

400
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,820
也許你就自個兒在游艇上擼吧
Maybe you should have boat sex by yourself.

401
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,560
不要啊  維吉妮亞  這種事我已經在游艇上干過了
No, Virginia, I've already done that on a boat.

402
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,500
別介啊  維吉妮亞
Come on! Virginia!

403
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,730
維吉妮亞  別走
Virginia, wait!

404
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,660
我把車找回來了
I got the car back.

405
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:02,740
你倆...
You guys...

406
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,660
干啥呢
what are you doing?

407
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,820
瞧瞧  大英雄回來了
Look who saved the day

408
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,070
騎著偷來的摩托去追盜車賊
chasing thieves on her stolen motorcycle.

409
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,650
我們的萬事神通小姐
Little Miss Right About Everything.

410
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,970
我從沒說過她是萬事神通
I never said she was right about everything.

411
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,530
老天爺  她都蠢到嫁給吉米了
For God's sake, she married Jimmy.

412
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,720
這絕對是史上最糟的一次度假了
This is officially the worst vacation ever.

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,800
什么
Excuse me?

414
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,690
我為給這個家帶來一場前所未有的體驗
I have done absolutely everything I can do

415
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,420
已經使盡渾身解數了
to give this family something that they've never had before.

416
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,690
偷摩托車嗎
A stolen motorcycle?

417
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,740
不  一次真正的度假
No. A vacation.

418
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,990
你偷了一輛摩托
You stole a motorcycle?

419
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,070
是為了把車找回來
To get the car back.

420
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,180
吉米  我這是一種無私的英雄主義
Jimmy, it was a selfless act of heroism

421
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,400
不過是為了讓你們能盡情參觀泰迪熊博物館
so you could enjoy your time at the teddy bear museum.

422
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
那根本不是泰迪熊
They were not teddy bears.

423
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,560
它們是被填充的動物
They were stuffed animals.

424
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,420
是真正的動物
Real animals.

425
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,750
還是捕食中的動物
Eating other animals.

426
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,360
這會給喜旺留下一輩子的心理陰影的
Hope's going to be scarred for life.

427
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,410
幸好我偷拿了這只羚羊  也不算一無所獲
I pilfered this antelope, so the day wasn't a total loss.

428
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,920
你說得沒錯  伯特  我們做得不好
You're right, Burt, we messed up.

429
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,740
我們應該在吉米小時候  多帶他出去度假
When Jimmy was a kid, we should have taken him on vacation,

430
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,380
偷上一輛摩托  帶他去個恐怖博物館
stolen a motorcycle and gone to the museum of nightmares.

431
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,360
這種童年回憶肯定比我們假造的那些
Those would've been way better vacation memories

432
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,330
要美好多了
than we ever gave him.

433
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,890
這和我們給吉米的無關
It's not about what we gave Jimmy.

434
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,470
我們當年也算盡力了
We did the best we could with what we had.

435
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,730
我不后悔
I can live with that.

436
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,480
但如果我們支持他們  而不是挖苦  對著干
But they could do better with Hope if we're on their side,

437
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,300
喜旺就會得到更棒的體驗
not rooting against them.

438
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,140
摩托車之旅肯定很有趣吧
...A motorcycle ride would've been fun.

439
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,030
聽著  伙計們
You know what, you guys?

440
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,850
咱們還是趕緊把船拉上  送到地方
Let's just hitch up the boat and drop it off,

441
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,450
然后就能收工回家
then we can all just go home.

442
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,490
吉米  我懷疑你是基佬
Hey, Jimmy, I always suspected you fancied boys,

443
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,210
但你啥時候開始大張旗鼓地出柜了
but when did you start advertising it?

444
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,380
什么意思
What are you talking about?

445
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,330
你的保險桿貼紙上寫著"哥就是喜歡后庭"
Your bumper sticker says, "I'd rather be spelunking."

446
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,210
本意為山洞探險

447
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,380
這不是我們的車
This is not our car.

448
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,240
你們誰襲擊了這位先生  還偷走了他的車
Which one of you assaulted this man and stole his vehicle?

449
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,970
什么
What?

450
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,020
給老娘抱著
Hold this for me.

451
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,270
一個人坐牢就夠了
No reason both of us have to go to jail.

452
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,810
聽著  這太容易搞混了
Look, honestly, it's-it's such an easy mistake.

453
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,690
我們的車顏色一模一樣
Our-our cars are the exact same color...

454
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,910
她攻擊了我
She assaulted me!

455
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,880
我的蛋蛋現在還腫著呢
Do you know how swollen my testicles are?

456
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,100
你不給我們看  我們怎么知道
We'll never know unless you show us.

457
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,600
那個經營標本動物博物館的變態
That psycho from the Stuffed Animal Museum

458
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,560
才該被抓起來
is the real criminal!

459
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,270
這幾個瘋子根本沒沿著黃色熊掌印走
Those deviants didn't even follow the yellow paw prints!

460
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,300
他們直接從防火出口跑了
They went right out the fire exit!

461
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,980
給我把他們拷上  我要把他們做成標本
You cuff 'em, I'll stuff 'em!

462
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,820
都給我安靜點
Everybody quiet down.

463
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,060
請把手放到背后  小姐
Put your hands behind your back, miss.

464
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,390
你要逮捕我嗎
You're arresting me?

465
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,010
我唯一犯下的罪行就是愛心太泛濫
Look, my only crime is caring too much.

466
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,860
我是打了人  偷了車
I mean, sure, assault and grand theft auto,

467
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,600
但我的動機純粹是出于愛啊
but mostly just caring too much.

468
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,490
我只是想給女兒
Look, I just really wanted to give my daughter

469
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,180
創造一段美好的假期回憶
a fun vacation memory.

470
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,170
你要是逮捕她
If you're gonna arrest her,

471
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,480
就把我一起抓走吧
you're gonna have to arrest me, too.

472
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,780
-為什么  -因為要不是因為我
- Why? - She wouldn't have had to do any of this

473
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,740
沒有盡職盡責
if I just tried harder

474
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,040
帶我孫女度一場真正的假  她也不會這樣
to give my granddaughter a real vacation.

475
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,440
那個小可愛就是你的孫女嗎
Well, if that little cutie is your granddaughter,

476
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,510
別錯過這一幕了
you're missing it.

477
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,820
奶奶
Hey, Gram!

478
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
我在開船呢
I'm driving a boat.

479
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,750
喜旺
Hope!

480
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,850
請你等一下再逮捕我
Please, can you just wait one second to arrest me?

481
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,230
我真的好想把這段拍下來
I just... I really want to get this on video.

482
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,860
好的  等等
Okay. Stay there.

483
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,980
好了  喜旺  我們來創造美好回...
Come on, Hope, let's make a memor...

484
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,230
這下好了
Oh, yeah.

485
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,050
吉米嬰兒床的悲劇重演了
Same thing happened with Jimmy's crib.

486
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,030
我是在牢里嗎
Oh. Am I in jail?

487
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,130
不
No.

488
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,510
你撞到了頭  在醫院里呢
You hit your head; you're in the hospital.

489
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,500
好消息是
Good news is,

490
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,760
他們看見你像脫水的魚一樣
when they saw you flopping around

491
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
疼得在地上打滾
on the ground like a fish out of water,

492
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,140
就不忍心指控你了
they felt too bad to press charges.

493
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,720
太好了
Oh, that's good news.

494
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,260
但話說回來
Oh, on the flip side,

495
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,740
我帶喜旺過了一個糟糕透頂的假期
I just gave Hope the worst vacation ever.

496
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,360
我可不覺得喜旺會這么想
I don't think she feels that way.

497
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,350
看這個
Look at this.

498
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,390
你在我昏迷不醒的時候  把我弄上了船
You put me up on the boat while I was unconscious?

499
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,880
假期是你一手策劃的
Hey, I mean, you planned the whole thing.

500
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,650
我們怎么能不把你拍進去呢
We weren't gonna leave you out of the videos.

501
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,870
救護車來之前
And holding you upright,

502
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,000
我們一直讓你保持直立狀態
kept you from swallowing your tongue

503
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,220
免得你把舌頭吞下去了
till the ambulance got there.

504
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,250
看看這個
Check these out.

505
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,250
抓到貓嘍
Catfish!

506
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,690
抓到了
Whoa! Catch it!

507
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,420
很棒  是不是
Eh? That's good, right?

508
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,210
喜旺玩這么開心  我太高興了
Oh, I'm glad Hope had a good time.

509
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,010
維吉妮亞  你是對的
Virginia, you were so right.

510
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,480
真正的度假太麻煩了  得不償失
Having a real vacation is more trouble than it's worth.

511
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,180
這一趟是很糟
Well, this trip was awful.

512
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,470
哪里是度假啊  簡直是亡命之旅啊
This was more of a crime spree than a trip.

513
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,010
但明年  只要我們齊心協力
But next year, we could do better

514
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,550
就可以做得更好
if we all work together.

515
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,920
誰知道呢  也許有一天吉斯一家的旅行照里
And who knows, maybe someday the Chances will take a vacation

516
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,030
每個人都能是清醒的
where one of us isn't passed out in every picture.

517
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,330
那可就太好了
I would really like that.

518
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,220
但別再搞什么游艇了
But no more boats.

519
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,650
吉米  我怎么被曬傷了
Jimmy, how did I get so sunburned?

520
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,280
可能是我忘了給你擦防曬霜
I may have forgotten to put your sunscreen on.

521
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,520
我為你驕傲
Hey... I'm proud of you.

522
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,450
我知道  你愿意承認錯誤一定不容易
I know how hard it is for you to admit you're wrong.

523
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,330
不會啊
No, it isn't.

524
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,630
完全同意
I totally agree.

525
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,660
可惜現在沒有游艇了
Too bad there's no boat here.

526
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,780
沒關系
Oh, that's okay.

527
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,970
天涯何處無交通工具呢
Plenty of other vehicles in the sea.

528
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,940
快走  一個洞穴探險者的蛋蛋碎了
Let's go! We have a spelunker with a ruptured testicle!

529
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,530
和大活人跳舞的感覺
It's so nice to dance with something

530
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,680
真是好
that still has a pulse.

531
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,470
晚餐很可口
Dinner was lovely.

532
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,610
雞肉真鮮美
The chicken was delicious!

533
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,570
因為那不是雞肉
That's because it wasn't chicken.

534
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,960
是狐?肉[暗示《少年派》中吃狐?的情節]
It was meerkat.

535
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,320
家有喜旺

536
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,320
第四季 第三集
