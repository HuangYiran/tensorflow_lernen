1
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,969
那是去年的【世界街舞大赛】
That's last year's Battle of the Year.

2
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,771
这是在法国举行的国际“霹雳舞”
It's an international b-boy competition held in France,

3
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,042
过去15年
which for the last 15 years

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,170
美国一直输
the United States has lost.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,764
上周末, 我去演唱会
I went to a concert this past weekend,

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,444
我听到了一些高中的孩子
and I overheard some high school kids

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,524
说“霹雳舞”已不再酷
saying that b-boying was no longer cool

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,011
像他们父母那一代在跳的
and it was something their parents did.

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
这吓了我一跳
That scared me.

10
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,930
这把我吓坏了, 因为这家公司
It scared me because this company,

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,365
我建立的一切
everything I've built,

12
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,006
就是靠“霹雳舞”起家的
started off with b-boying.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,602
在法国还是很酷
It's obviously still cool over in France.

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,048
他们政府赞助【世界街舞大赛】
The government subsidizes Battle of the Year.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,010
是政府让“嘻哈”得以生存
The government is keeping hip-hop alive.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,805
在俄罗斯还是很酷
Still cool in Russia,

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,325
德国
Germany,

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,370
韩国
Korea.

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,201
偏偏在这里不酷
But it's not cool here where it was founded.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,651
这可以解释为什么
Which would explain why,

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,449
国内的销量下降
domestically, our sales are down.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,042
商品、影片、门票、服装
Merchandising, record sales, ticket sales, apparel.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,248
这是公司创始以来, 第一次
But for the first time in this company's history,

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,370
国际销售超过国内
international sales are exceeding domestic.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,805
我们有麻烦了
We are in trouble.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,008
想想看, 若是“霹雳舞”不再酷了
Think about it, if b-boying ain't cool,

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,208
“嘻哈”还能撑多久？
how long before hip-hop isn't cool?

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,250
对我们公司而言, 代表什么意思？
And what will that mean to our business, our company?

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,125
嘿哟！
Hey, yo!

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,129
起床！等等！
Wake up! Hold on!

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,526
太阳晒屁股了
Get your ass up.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,082
等你死了就可以睡很久
Come on, man. You can sleep when you're dead.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,531
进来
Coming.

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,206
唐帝？
Dante?

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,248
你的佣人忘了擦窗户吗？
See your maid doesn't do windows, does she?

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,691
你来干嘛, 兄弟？
What the hell are you doing here, man?

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,250
我打给你了, 你没接
I've been calling, you ain't been answering.

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,881
我最近很忙
I've been busy lately.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,930
好啦, 动动你的屁股, 开门
All right, well, bring your busy ass over and open up this door.

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,201
我不是来探监的
This ain't no prison visit.

41
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,807
你看起来像大便
You look like shit.

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,048
如果你是来烦我的,  D. ..
Look, if you came here to sweat me, D...

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,610
我来给你个建议
Came here to make you a proposition.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,325
要不要让我进去啦？
You gonna let me in or what?

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,290
好吧
Okay.

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,130
这老东西还能用吗？
This... This old thing work?

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,008
好... 放看看
All right. Here we go.

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,610
瞧瞧
Check this out.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,124
日本对韩国的世界冠军赛
That's Japan versus Korea, world champions.

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,810
现在的“霹雳舞”不一样
I mean, b-boying ain't the same

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,570
跟我们那时跳的不一样
from back in the days when we were dancing, man.

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,244
我们参加过最屌的是那一场?
I mean, what's the farthest we ever had to go to battle,

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,367
布朗克斯？
the Bronx?

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,246
现在, 这些孩子都跑去日本、德国、法国比赛
Now these kids are battling in Japan, Germany, France.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,883
【世界街舞大赛】又要到了
So, the Battle of the Year is coming up, right?

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,689
我赞助了美国队
And I'm sponsoring the US crew.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,931
我的舞团名字是“无敌洛杉矶”, 这些孩子都不错
So my crew is called LA's Finest. Now, these kids are good.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,651
他们有舞技, 但还不是最棒
Acrobatic, they got skills, but they're not great.

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,886
然而
Yet.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,121
就缺一件
Only missing one thing.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,681
你
You.

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,651
我要你当教练
I want you to coach the crew.

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,966
教练？
Coach?

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,327
现在, 我知道你需要钱, 所以...
Now, I know you need money, so...

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,965
这样吧, 签个名...
Here you go, check that out,

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,361
只要你愿意...
let me know if that meets your approval.

67
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,130
下个月就是自由式比赛
But the freestyle sessions are next month,

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,645
我需要你整队去参加
and I need you to prepare my crew for battle.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,643
我是一个篮球教练...   没关系
I was a basketball coach. It doesn't matter.

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,405
教练就是教练, 你是我见过的最好的, 兄弟
A coach is a coach, and you were the best I've ever seen, man.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,602
你行的!    我已经不再是从前的我
It's in your heart. I ain't that guy anymore.

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,921
跟我来吧, 让我们去看看孩子们,
Just come with me, let's go check out the boys,

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,924
如果你认为他们很烂, 你掉头就走
and if you think they suck, you walk away.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,480
没有压力, 你还等什么？
No pressure. So what are you waiting on?

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,085
我不行... D.     说真的,
You don't want me, D. I mean, seriously,

76
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,565
你错过了多少次机会
how many opportunities do you have

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,603
会自动送上门, WB ？
come knocking at your window every day, WB?

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,841
我连自己的生活都一团乱
Can't even keep my own shit straight.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,126
我不想站在这里
Look, I'm not gonna stand here

80
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,690
假装关心你是怎么过日子的
and pretend like I know what you're going through,

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,086
我才不在乎
'cause I don't.

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,601
拜托, 老兄, 你心里有团火
But, come on, man, that fire in your heart,

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,523
渴望着打赢胜仗
that need to win and the ability

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,325
感染你周围的人, 让他们相信
to infect those around you and get them to believe the same thing?

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,051
你仍然有那种能力,  不会失去它
Man, you still got that shit. Guys like you don't lose it.

86
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,050
你不能老是窝这里, 这不是你
Look, man, this right here, this ain't you.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,006
我知道你的过去
You had trajectory.

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,691
坦白的说
And I'll be frank with you, man,

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,603
我们都知道,  她再也不会回来
You and I both know she's never coming back.

90
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,563
够了
You know what, man?

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,086
到此为止!    我错了
We're done here.  I was wrong.

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,929
看来, 我真的是来探监的
This was a prison visit.

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,762
你把自己关在这里
And this is your cell, man.

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,123
我们之间的差别
The only difference has been between my life and yours,

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,764
我开了一扇门
is that I made a life out of opening doors

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,245
你却把它关上
and you made one out of closing them.

97
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,996
发掘娱乐公司... 请稍等
Dig One Entertainment. Please hold.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,170
发掘娱乐... 我可以帮你吗？
Dig One Entertainment. How may I help you?

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,046
WB！
WB!

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,571
欢迎来发掘娱乐公司
Welcome to Dig One, baby.

101
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,290
你好, D
What's up, D

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,122
真是令人印象深刻
It's impressive. So talk to me.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,168
告诉我好消息, 你答应了吗？
Tell me something good, man. You in?

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,725
还没有
Not yet.

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,489
我要做些功课, 看看我是否能担任
I need to do some homework, see if I can even pull this off, all right?

106
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,846
跟我来
Follow me.

107
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,926
就是这样
That's it.

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,571
这四、五年来... 约100小时的影片
About 100 hours of footage, goes back four or five years.

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,045
还需要什么吗？
Need anything else?

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,690
一百个小时, 是吧？
A hundred hours, huh?

111
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,685
一壶咖啡, 三明治
Maybe a pot of coffee, couple sandwiches.

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,368
杯里只有咖啡？(没酒)
So that is just coffee in there, right?

113
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,403
嗯... 只有咖啡
Yeah. Just coffee.

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,646
好
Good.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,847
你好好用功吧
Keep the good shit right here.

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,326
你喔~ D.
Come on, D.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,289
不会那么快就见到成效
Can't plug the cork overnight.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,523
我会在我的办公室
Doesn't work that way. I'll be in my office.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,441
你点的一壶咖啡
Okay, got you a fresh pot.

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,883
在我下班之前, 要不要先帮你叫个便当？
Did you want me to order you any dinner before I punch out?

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,570
不用了, 谢谢
No, I'm all good, thank you. Yeah.

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,890
呦, 看看那些肘部旋转
Yo, look at those elbow spins.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,365
真是烂招
That shit is nasty.

124
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,646
那年韩国人变强了
Koreans came strong that year.

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,881
韩国舞团像是超级英雄
Those K-boys are like superheroes.

126
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,168
你也是“霹雳舞团”？   还不算
You b-boy? Nah, I wish.

127
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,926
我的队不是想跳霹雳舞就可以加入的
My people are not exactly chosen when it comes to breaking.

128
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,168
什么意思, 你的队？    我是犹太人
What do you mean, your people? Jews.

129
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,844
陆续参加比赛
We're rhythmically challenged.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,400
我们企图想找出族人的风格
We're stripped of our swag at the circumcision.

131
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,966
我也得接受现况, 我还只是个粉丝
I've made my peace with it. Anyway, I'm a fan.

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,445
期待美国队在BOTY夺冠
Be dope to see the US crew take the BOTYs.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,364
什么是BOTY？   你跟我开玩笑吧？
What the hell is a BOTY? Seriously?

134
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,442
请坐, 你叫什么名字？
Have a seat. What's your name?

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,001
富兰克林-歪
Franklyn, with a "Y".

136
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,605
布雷克
Blake.

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,084
富兰克林-歪, 教教我吧
So, Franklyn with a "Y" fill me in.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,010
BOTYs代表【世界街舞大赛】
The BOTYs stands for Battle of the Year.

139
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,923
是世界杯“霹雳舞”大赛
It's the world cup of b-boying.

140
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,486
这是街舞比赛中最重要的大赛
It's the premier event, the big daddy of them all.

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,761
它起源于90年代-德国
It started in Germany in the '90s,

142
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,206
现在在法国举办
but now it takes place in France.

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,327
法国？
Why France?

144
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,410
因为在法国跳舞比吃饭还重要
'Cause the only thing the French revere more than carbs is dance.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,690
总之,  20个国家的顶级队伍争夺世界冠军
Anyway, 20 countries bring their top crew to battle for the world championship.

146
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,969
你这么帅的犹太孩子怎么会懂这个？
And a nice Jewish kid like you knows all this because?

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,481
在希伯来学校里他们也不会教你泡妞
They don't teach you how to pick up chicks at Hebrew school,

148
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,284
因为跳霹雳舞很酷
and breaking made me cool.

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,688
虽然我是犹太人, 但我的宗教是“嘻哈”
I mean, I might be Jewish, but my religion is hip-hop.

150
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
你看过电影“街舞开战”了吗？
You've seen Planet B-Boy, yeah?

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,406
没有
Afraid not.

152
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,561
我能请教你一些事吗？
Can I ask you something?

153
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,721
可以
Sure.

154
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,928
为什么唐帝要找你来当教练？
Why is Dante having you coach his crew?

155
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,165
这是个好问题
That's a good question.

156
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,806
电影“街舞开战”就像是我们的圣经
Planet B-Boy, it's like our bible.

157
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,209
影片记录着“霹雳舞”的现况
It's this dope documentary about what b-boying is now.

158
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,166
我能用一下？
Can I see that?

159
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,770
这个吗？   对!
What, this? Yeah.

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,365
这是什么东西？
What is this thing?

161
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,608
这是新的索尼平板电脑
It's the new Sony tablet.

162
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,364
产品的未来趋势
It's the future.

163
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,881
“街舞开战”, 从网路影城下载超过十亿次
Planet B-Boy, it's got a billion rentals on Netflix.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,001
等我一下
Hold on.

165
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,527
瞧瞧
Check it out.

166
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,209
起床！起床！
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,685
没时间睡觉！做事！
No time to sleep! Work to do!

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,890
几点了?    九点钟
What time is it? 9:00.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,445
你们搞了一整晚？
You been holed up in here all night?

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,726
一百小时的影片耶...
Hundred hours of footage, right?

171
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,490
下了功夫, 是吧？
Guess you did your homework, huh?

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,483
够了
Enough, anyway.

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,370
什么时候世界变了？
When did all this shit happen?

174
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,686
感觉你老了吗？
Feeling old yet?

175
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,120
一点点
Little bit.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,929
这些家伙的舞蹈真是惊人
The moves these guys are pulling off are phenomenal.

177
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,565
韩国队更是烧烫烫
The Koreans are on fire.

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,404
我们需要帮我们的舞团也点把火
And we need some of that fire for our crew.

179
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,522
如何呀？你答不答应？
So what's up, man? We got a deal or what?

180
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,409
两个条件...     你说
Two conditions. Name them.

181
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,369
首先, 富兰克林当我的助理教练
First, I want Franklyn here as my assistant coach.

182
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,443
真的假的？  你要这小子？
For real? This guy?

183
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,561
嗯
Yeah.

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,162
好吧!  第二个呢？
All right, done. Second one?

185
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,730
写在这里
This right here.

186
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,649
合约上多加了点东西
Made a little addendum to your contract.

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,210
只要是钱, 都不是问题
If this is about money, I'll take care of it.

188
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,442
只是一句话, D.   你先看看
It's just one line, D. Just read it.

189
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,041
“如果要我当教练的话...... ”
"If I do this..."

190
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,804
我看不懂你这鬼画符...
I can't make this out, man. It's chicken scratch.

191
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,564
写什么？ "如果要我当教练的话...
What does that say? "If I do this,

192
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,523
就得按照我的方式走 "
"I got to do it on my own terms."

193
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,050
签名吧
Little place for your initials right there.

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,610
好吧
Okay.

195
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,123
你很难搞, 兄弟
You are a tough negotiator, my man.

196
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,801
一个小时后让我们去看看舞团
All right, let's go see the crew in about an hour.

197
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,006
嘿, 珍, 你好
Hey, Jan, how you doing?

198
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,127
我在忙
I'm doing busy.

199
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
我想找D？ 一会儿就好
Can I see D? it won't even take a minute.

200
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,724
我干嘛帮你？
And I would do that for you because?

201
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,486
因为我们是同事?  我会很感激
'Cause we're co-workers and I'd really appreciate it.

202
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,965
再试试
Try again.

203
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,801
因为我只是一个男孩, 站在一个美女面前
( 电影《新娘百分百》台词 )
'Cause I'm just a boy standing in front of a girl

204
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,446
请教她关于未来的人生
asking her to further his career.

205
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,886
我很喜欢那部电影
I love that movie.

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,405
你叫什么名字？  你不知道？
What's your name again? Seriously?

207
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,289
富兰克林-歪
Franklyn. With a "Y".

208
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,408
富兰克林-歪想见您
Franklyn with a "Y" is here to see you.

209
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,371
翻回第一页
Go back to the first one.

210
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,361
对不起,  我不是故意要打扰您
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.

211
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,646
没事, 请坐
No bother. Have a seat.

212
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,206
好! 选那个, 但是玫瑰要拿掉
Okay, let's go with that one, but kill the roses.

213
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,044
乐队的经理想要有玫瑰
The band's manager really wanted the roses.

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,130
好吧... 玫瑰拿掉
Right, killing the roses.

215
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,290
什么事？
What's up?

216
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,971
我只是想告诉您
I just wanted to tell you

217
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,129
我不知道他为什么要找我当助教
I didn't know anything about him asking me to take the coaching job.

218
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,566
你现在才跟我说你不想做？
You saying you don't want to do this now?

219
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,642
不, 我想做
No, I want to do it,

220
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,731
不是我唆使WB这么做的
but I didn't want you to think that I put WB up to it or something.

221
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,326
没人叫的动WB, 连我也不行
Listen, nobody puts WB up to anything, not even me.

222
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,647
是啊, 我只是想确定您和我是很酷的
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you and I were cool.

223
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,970
酷？
Cool?

224
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,485
我的意思是, 您应征我进来, D
I mean, you hooked me up with this job, D,

225
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,409
我不想忘恩负义
and I don't want to seem ungrateful.

226
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,847
小兄弟, 我坦白跟你说
Look here, man, let me level with you.

227
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,410
我甚至于不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are.

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,766
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

229
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,080
您不知道？
Seriously?

230
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,010
我是富兰克林-歪
I'm Franklyn with a "Y".

231
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,168
你几岁？   到12月时就满23岁了
How old are you? I'll be 23 in December.

232
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,810
富兰克林-歪, 你知道这两个家伙是谁吗？
Franklyn with a "Y", do you know who these two guys are?

233
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,446
知道
Yeah.

234
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,522
你们是当初的创始者
Yeah, y'all were ground-breakers back in the day.

235
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,483
当初舞团刚起步时
When I started off with the crew,

236
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,529
我们被称为斗鸡舞团
we were called the Battle Troop Crew.

237
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,762
我们内斗, 比对抗外敌多
We battled each other more than we battled other crews.

238
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,160
直到WB出现
Until WB showed up.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,843
像是从乔治亚洲领养来的孩子
Comes up as a foster kid from Georgia

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,129
一副乡巴佬的样子
with this country, hillbilly-type swag,

241
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,770
但他就是有本事
but it was something about him, man,

242
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,609
他整合了舞团
that he just unified the crew.

243
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,364
让大家团结在一起
He just knows how to bring people together.

244
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,885
“嘻哈”流行的初期
And this is in the early days of hip-hop

245
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,203
在白人开始搞饶舌和跳霹雳舞之前
back before white boys were rapping and b-boying.

246
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,442
都是黑人和拉丁美洲人的天下
That wasn't around back then. It was just black and Latino.

247
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,646
那是我们的天下
That's all we had.

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,371
当我们准备好组团出来斗舞时
So when we would show up to a battle, oh, man.

249
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,641
你知道吗？
But you know what?

250
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,370
他早就跨过种族的藩篱
When he'd leave that cipher,

251
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,289
已经分不清他是白猫还是黑猫
he went from white bread to Wonder Bread.

252
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
他就是这么赞
That's how good he was.

253
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,484
难怪他叫WB (白与黑)
Guess I know why you call him WB.

254
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,641
没错!
Oh, yeah.

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,566
既然他这么沉浸于中, 为什么要放弃霹雳舞？
But if he was so dope, then why did he stop breaking?

256
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,409
他有他想做的事
He wanted to do the right thing.

257
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,767
以前我们很穷
See, back in those days, man, we were all broke.

258
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,645
跳“霹雳舞”没啥钱可捞
There was no money in b-boying. Sure.

259
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,563
当他知道女友怀孕时
So, when he got his girlfriend pregnant,

260
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,723
他的叔叔介绍他去圣马可队, 当篮球助理教练
her uncle offered him an assistant basketball coaching job at St. Mark's,

261
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,926
他去了
and he took it.

262
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,161
等等, 圣马可队...
Wait, not St. Mark's that, that racked up

263
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,322
击败洲际冠军的篮球队？  对!
all those state championships? Yeah.

264
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,482
他就是当时赢球的总教练
And he was the head coach at the time that they did it.

265
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,164
后来他有回来吗？
Then what is he doing back here?

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,241
又重头开始
Starting over.

267
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,481
我不懂
I don't follow.

268
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,244
几年前
Couple years ago,

269
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,325
他的妻子和孩子出车祸死了
WB lost his wife and son in a horrible car accident.

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,526
彻底摧毁了他的家
Completely tore his world apart, man.

271
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,681
于是他就...
I mean, he just...

272
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,762
他选择逃避
He checked out.

273
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,765
我希望他已经准备好重新开始
And I'm hoping that he's ready to check back in.

274
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,370
如果我是对的
And if I'm right,

275
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,841
往后五周里, 你能从他那儿学到的
you're gonna learn more in five weeks from that man

276
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,922
比在这里混五年还多
than you ever would in five years in this place.

277
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,286
我敢保证
That I promise.

278
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,200
就算失败了, 起码我们试过了, 富兰克林...
If it doesn't work out, well, we tried, right, Franklyn

279
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,203
歪!
with a "Y"?

280
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,971
“ 改变态度, 改变人生 ”
Change how you think, change your life.

281
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,411
瞧
See?

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,886
D, 瞧瞧~ 法国佬
D, didn't I tell you? Bring on the French.

283
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,008
打你韩国仔的小屁屁
Bring on the punk-ass Koreans.

284
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,003
赞赞赞
I like that. Looking good.

285
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,566
干得好
I like what I see. Good job.

286
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,165
教练, 你有什么感想？
Coach, what do you think?

287
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,648
你看到我拍手了   你们都不错
You saw me clapping. You guys are good.

288
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,165
没有瞧不起你们
No disrespect, but aren't those

289
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,487
有跟在法国比赛时跳的不一样吗?
the same moves you guys brought to France?

290
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,011
跟在法国时跳的不一样呀
That wasn't anything like France.

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
我看过你们的录影画面
I've been watching your tapes.

292
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,930
欧洲赛, 地区赛
European tours, regionals.

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,525
虽然修改了排舞顺序
You've changed the sequencing, yes,

294
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,688
但是看起来跟四年前的舞蹈动作一样
but it's basically the same routine as four years ago.

295
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,326
D, 我说过请教练是没用的
D, didn't I tell you this coaching thing wasn't gonna fly?

296
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,083
用不着你来教我怎么做
You don't tell me shit. You understand?

297
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,685
我并不想跟你抬杠
I'm not trying to play the hard case with you,

298
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,529
我只是想让你知道, 我们有我们的玩法
but I just want you to know we do have other options.

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,841
他们是在威胁我吗？听起来很像, 对不对？
Are they threatening me? Sounds like a threat, right?

300
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,849
你在威胁我吗？   没有啦
Are you threatening me? Come on, man.

301
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,009
这是你们的教练   教练说了算
This is your coach. What Coach says, you do.

302
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:37,995
少啰嗦
End of story.

303
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,206
教练？
Coach?

304
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,691
来, 大家排成一列
All right, everybody line up right here.

305
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,450
来吧, 兄弟们
Come on, fellas.

306
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,682
好! 全都向右转
All right, everybody turn to the right.

307
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,724
抬头挺胸, 起步走!
Chins up, start walking.

308
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,887
我们去外面
Let's take this outside.

309
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,801
你到底在干什么？
What the hell are you doing?

310
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,041
少跟我机机歪歪
Think they got options, right?

311
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,326
我找你来是要让他们更好
I brought you here to make 'em better,

312
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,646
不是直接赶他们出去
not kick 'em out into the street.

313
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,484
他们可能有点态度上的问题
They may have a little bit of attitude...

314
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,005
我才不管什么态度... 来呀!
I don't care about attitude. Bring it.

315
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,247
这些家伙被宠坏了,  D. 越来越不像样
These guys are stuck, D. They ain't getting any better.

316
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,810
他们组团多久了?  五年？
How long they been a crew, five years?

317
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,006
六年
Six years.

318
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,361
更糟
Even worse.

319
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,725
他们正面临了转捩点
They've hit the tipping point.

320
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,168
他们已经不想为了获胜而去奋战
They've stopped putting all their blood, sweat and tears into winning a battle

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,811
只想随便混一混
and started putting it into just not losing.

322
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,331
相信我, 兄弟, 我有办法
Trust me, man, I got a plan.

323
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,641
人都被你赶跑了
What you have is an empty room.

324
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,848
你要怎么玩
That's what you got.

325
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,242
好吧, 你有什么好办法?  说来听听
All right, what's your plan? Make it good.

326
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,403
愚蠢的行为一再的重复着
Insanity is doing the same damn thing over and over

327
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,607
还妄想会有不同的结果
and expecting a different result.

328
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,404
这就是我们一直在做的傻事
That's what we've been doing.

329
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,766
这就是为什么我们一直输,  D
It's why we can't compete, D.

330
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,923
人家都挑最棒的选手出来组团比赛
All of our competitors are gonna bring their best dancers,

331
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,202
但在美国, 我们只会挑一个城市代表队参赛
but the US, we send one crew from one city

332
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,528
顶多夹杂着两三个霹雳舞高手
with maybe two or three top-tier b-boys on it.

333
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,604
我们该做的是挑三拣四
What we should be doing is cherry-picking the top b-boys

334
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,564
从美国各地进行海选
from every crew in every city across America.

335
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,760
好吧, 我大概懂了
Okay, let me get this straight.

336
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,845
也就是说, 你想组个霹雳舞明星梦幻队？
So you're saying put together some kind of b-boy all-star team?

337
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,291
霹雳梦幻舞团
A b-boy dream team.

338
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,451
跟打篮球一样
We did the same thing in basketball,

339
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,965
霹雳舞也行
and we started that sport, too.

340
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,684
参加奥运之前
We were getting schooled in the Olympics

341
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,450
集合乔丹、魔术强森、伯德
till we put Jordan, Magic, Bird,

342
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,050
巴克利、尤因,  在比赛前进行集训
Barkley, Ewing on the court,

343
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,360
组成梦幻篮球队
our dream team.

344
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,283
那个梦幻蓝球队有时间搞
That dream team had time to prepare.

345
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,283
你要知道, 你也想那样组队
You do realize you're trying to put together

346
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,646
组一个新的舞团要花多久？
a whole new crew in what?

347
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,125
【世界街舞大赛】还有三个月吗?
Battle of the Year is in three months?

348
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,971
碰巧的是, 自由式比赛将在下周举行
Here's the beauty of it. Freestyle sessions are next week.

349
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,644
很多高手都会来
All the top crews are gonna be in town.

350
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,047
与其整修你那个洛杉矶破烂队
Instead of a tune-up for LA's Finest,

351
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,122
还不如搞个真正的国家代表队
why not turn it into a try-out for a national team?

352
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,131
当你大肆宣传你将赞助一个新的梦幻舞团
When you put the word out you're sponsoring a dream team,

353
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,566
他们就会成群结队而来
they'll come in droves.

354
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,802
这是一个千载难逢的机会
It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

355
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
所以这就是你的计划？
So that's your plan?

356
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,406
这是我的计划
That's my plan.

357
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,563
不成功变成仁
It better work.

358
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,924
听好了
All right, so listen up.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,402
唐帝, 传说中的霹雳舞王, 现在的嘻哈大亨
Dante, the once legendary b-boy, now hip-hop mogul,

360
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,086
大肆宣传
is putting out a nationwide shout.

361
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,606
呦, 照过来... 注意听!
Yo, this is it. Pay close attention.

管你是大江、还是大海
Crews from sea to shining sea,

364
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,444
唐帝大大正在寻找美国最棒的霹雳舞者
My man Dante is on the hunt for America's best b-boys

365
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,091
将代表美国参加世界冠军杯
to represent the US in the world championship.

366
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,084
没错, 他要挑选出一支梦幻舞团
That's right, he's gonna handpick a dream team.

367
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,611
想加入的人
You want to be a part of it,

368
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,126
就来参加自由式霹雳舞大赛

369
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,851
不管你有啥过人之处
and if you think you got what it takes to represent

370
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,685
管你是红、白、蓝, 你最好秀出来 (美国国旗)
the red, the white, the blue, you'd better bring it.

371
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,125
- 好的, 泰伦斯    - 试音, 试音, 试音
- Okay, Terrence. - Check, check, check.

372
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,601
我的兄弟D大为了求得霹雳舞高手
My man D is prowling for b-boy gold.

373
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,364
如果你真是高手中的高高手
If your crew has what it takes,

374
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
你一定要来这里
you need to come on down here.

375
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,604
我们正在寻找高高高高手
We are looking for the best of the best.

376
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,722
我不在乎你怎么来的
I don't care how you get down here.

377
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,365
只要勇敢的秀出你的小屁屁
Just bring your ass on down.

378
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,966
首轮挑出的32名
Here's our first 32.

379
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,121
接下来怎么办？
So what now?

380
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,565
先了解一下他们的来历
Now we see what they're made of.

381
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,045
告诉我你的名字和你来自哪里
Tell me your name and where you're from.

390
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,567
我们代表费城

footwork, style, power, originality and soul.

396
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,721
不懂, 你就别上舞台
If you ain't got that, don't even get in the ring.

397
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,928
你为什么要跳霹雳舞呢？ 霹雳舞是我的所有
So why do you break? Breaking is my everything.

398
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,326
对我而言是世界的全部
This means everything in the world to me.

399
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,561
我生命中最重要的事
It's the most important thing in my life.

400
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,484
这是自我体现, 我靠它呼吸生存
It's self-expression. I live it, I breathe it.

401
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,085
我一无所有, 直到跳霹雳舞
I didn't really have much, and then I found breaking.

402
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,770
阿富汗归国后, 我需要“霹雳舞”
After Afghanistan, I needed b-boying.

403
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,841

407
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,206
想像一下, 如果你是犹太教祭司的孩子
Imagine you're the son of a rabbi

408
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,606
想要酷酷的跳舞
and you're trying to be cool and break.

409
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,404
你是犹太人的霹雳舞者
You're Jewish and a b-boy.

410
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,929
他可能是被领养的
He's probably adopted.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,525
每个霹雳舞者都有个最终目标
A main goal that I think every b-boy has

412
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,761
【世界街舞大赛】
is Battle of the Year.

413
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,524
【世界街舞大赛】是像“霹雳舞”里面的麦加圣地
Battle of the Year is like the Mecca of b-boying.

414
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,284
这就像伊莱·曼宁赢得超级杯橄榄球赛
It's like Eli Manning winning the Super Bowl.

415
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,686
这就像霹雳舞奥运大会
It's like the Olympics to breaking.

416
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,205
【世界街舞大赛】是霹雳舞者的全部
Battle of the Year means... Everything to a b-boy.

417
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,441
没别的了
It's the only thing there is.

418
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,124
你凭什么可以加入这个舞团？
Why do you deserve to be on this crew?

419
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,766
梦幻舞团不可能没有我"骗子", 因为我就是行!
There is no dream team without Grifter. 'Cause I'm damn good.

420
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,888
我具有资质...
I have what it takes to be one of the...

421
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,883
有史以来最好的
Best ever. Ever?

422
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,610
我想加入舞团, 光荣返乡
I want to be on that team that brings it home.

423
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,886
比赛跳舞时你在想什么？
What do you think about when you battle?

424
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,530
我的焦点是, 如果我赢不了
My main focus is, if I don't win,

425
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,045
我得回到我原来的生活
I got to go back to my old life.

426
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,122
我的母亲...      “女霹雳舞”
My mother.     B-girls.

427
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,884
好到冒泡...       踢屁屁教训一下...
Being so damn good. Kicking ass.

428
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,564
我想的是  我是多么爱“霹雳舞”
I think about how much I love b-boying.

429
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,246
霹雳女孩
Yeah, b-girls.

430
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,963
首先, 我要感谢各位的光临

就这样
That's it.

465
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,881
该死的
Damn.

466
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,491
为什么有铁丝网？
What's up with the barbed wire?

467
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,005
这到底是什么鬼地方？
What the hell is this place?

468
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,923
废弃的青少年感化院
It's an old abandoned juvenile detention center.

469
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,724
妈的, 我妈说对了   什么？

教练选的
Coach picked it.

473

这里废弃后, 他来带过夏季篮球训练营
He used to teach summer basketball camp here after it closed.

474
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,520
你不是犹太兄弟会的人, 对吧？
Not exactly B'nai B'rith, right?

475
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,402
我们俩虽然是犹太人, 但不见得就是好朋友
Listen, man, just 'cause we're both Jewish doesn't mean we're best friends.

476
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,681
也对啦
Good stuff.

477
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,683
- 好烂的地方 - 我喜欢
- This place is nasty. - Looks good to me.

478
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
比我出身的地方还要好, 算是希尔顿饭店
Compared to where I'm from, this joint's the goddamn Hilton.

479
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,686

宿舍在这边
Dorms are right through here.

483

搬进来住吧
Go ahead and drop your stuff and get settled in.

484
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,730
不会吧...  你是认真的？
Nah, man. Are you serious?

485
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,007
开什么玩笑  神经病
This is ridiculous. Crazy.

486
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,008
呦,  什么鬼地方？
Yo, what is this place?

487
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,044
教练, 我一直有些想法...
Listen, Coach, I was thinking on some ideas

488
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,487
打从我当你的助手以来, 当然我也不想被开除啦
ever since you made me your assistant. Well, I want to earn my keep.

489
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,006
我认为我们应该请人来编舞, 如果你真的很想
Anyway, I think we should get a choreographer if you're really serious

490
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,162
在【世界街舞大赛】中尽情挥洒的话
about making a splash at the Battle of the Year.

491
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,801
找个具有世界水准的编舞艺术家
Someone who's done world tours and worked with major artists.

492
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
你脖子上挂着什么, 富兰克林？
What's that around your neck, Franklyn?

493
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,490
这是我的教练哨子
It's my coaching whistle.

494
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,846
交给我
Let me have it.

495
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,729
为什么？   交给我
Why? Give it up.

496
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,690
我要靠这个哨子
It's more of a support whistle for your

497
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,728
来辅助教练的工作...      富兰克林
head-coach whistle, so... Franklyn.

498
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,290
区分助教与舞者的角色
It just separates me from the b-boys.

499
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,328
交给我...        不要这样啦...
Let's have it. Can I say no?

500
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,164
不要啦...     把哨子交给我!
I really want to say no. Give me the damn whistle.

501
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,287
不要
No.

502
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,244
还有别的吗？
Anything else?

503
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,924
教练的宿舍在哪里？
Where's the coaches' quarters?

504
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,571
在那里, 但你会跟他们住在一起
Over there, but you'll be staying with them.

505
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,130
真的假的？
Seriously?

506
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,326
听好了！
Listen up!

507
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,168
离【世界街舞大赛】剩三个月了
Battle of the Year is three months away.

508
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,844
花点时间想想
Take a moment, think about that.

509
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,051
在三个月内
In three months,

510
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,008
有9个人会被淘汰
nine of you will be sitting back on your couches

511
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,971
其他13位将代表美国

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,570
站上国际的舞台
Center stage in a global arena.

513
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,801
命运掌握在你手里
Choice is yours.

514
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,085
你付出了努力
You do this right,

515
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,242
生活将会大大的不同
nothing in your life will ever be the same.

516
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,285
我不是你们的朋友
Don't make the mistake of thinking I'm your friend.

517
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,850
我不是
I'm not.

518
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,810
我在这里唯一的目的
I'm here for one purpose.

519
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,085
我会用任何手段把你们组成一个团队
Turn you into a team by whatever means I deem necessary, period.

520
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,083
因为现在, 在韩国、日本
'Cause right now, in Korea, Japan,

521
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,288
法国、俄罗斯、遍布世界各地,
France, Russia, all over the world,

522
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,089
舞者每天训练7个小时

523
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,288
因为他们想赢得【世界街舞大赛】
'cause they want to win the Battle of the Year.

524
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,931
问题是, 你呢？
The question is, do you?

525
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,925
规则很简单, 清晨6点开始训练
Our rules are simple. Practice starts at 6:00 a.m.

526
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,923

6:00 a.m.? 6:00 a.m.?

527
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,843
你敢在6点01分才出现的话...
You come at 6:01...

528
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,211
淘汰！

没时间了
We ain't got time.

532
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,490
这里就是你的世界
This facility will become your world.

533
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,451
敢跑出去鬼混的话就淘汰!
Step outside that world, you will be gone.

534
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,091
不按照我的规矩来... 就淘汰!
Bitch about my simple rules, you will be gone.

535
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,844
嘿, 教练
Hey, Coach.

536
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,002
想清楚再发问
Ask me some wise-ass question

537
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,766
我说会淘汰!  就会淘汰!
about "you will be gone," and you will be gone.

538
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,571
接下来的每个周五
Over each of the next nine Fridays,

539
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,644
我会给被淘汰的人
I'll be handing one of you one of these.

540
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,766
一张公车票
Bus pass.

541
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,604
送你回老乡
Take you back to wherever it is you came from.

542
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,331

这就是每个人都在争夺的... 派?
This is what everybody's battling for. Pie?

我知道, 我知道, 我说真的
I know, I know, I got it. No, I'm serious. Focus.

554
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,884
不要跟任何人说话, 不看任何人
Don't talk to anybody, don't look at nobody.

555
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,883

Just us, double trouble. Right, double trouble.

557
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,850
呦, 我只是打招呼？你太认真？
Yo, what did I just say, man? Are you serious?

558
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,126

Bon appetit, guys.

我们有误会吗？
We got a problem?

562
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,080
没有啊
I don't have a problem.

563
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,208
那为何你不愿意跟我一起用餐？
Why'd you get up when I sat down?

564
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,171
兄弟, 我习惯独来独往
Listen, man, where I'm from, we don't ask and you don't tell.

565
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,401

太着重于个人的舞技表现
a lot of individual skills for battling.

581
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,244
他们必须整合团队的力量
They need to get together as a crew and also overcome

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,322
克服大多数团员自大的问题

598

So this is how we begin, huh?

604
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,242
你们总是在互相攻击

There's two ways to have the tallest building in the world.

一, 盖自己的摩天大楼越高越好
One, build yourself a giant-ass skyscraper.

607
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,285
二 ...
Two...

608
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,964
把别人的大楼给拆了
...tear all the other skyscrapers down.

609
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,125
我们要这里建立
We're here to build.

610
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,089
要建立一个团队
To build a team.

611
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,083
你早点想清楚
The quicker you get that through your heads,

612
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,561
就有更好的机会组成团队
the better chance you got of making that team.

再这样小鼻子小眼睛注定失败
But not if you keep thinking small.

615
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,722
别以为你比旁边的跳的好就够了
Not if you're just trying to prove you're better than the b-boy next to you.

616

Hey, Coach, I ain't got to prove shit.

617
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,329

So you got to know which one's the best, huh?

627
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,206
好吧, 那就来尬一下

We're splitting into teams. I need two captains.

629
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,125
敲敲对山鸡, 真是意外啊...
Do Knock and Rooster, surprise, surprise.

630
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,211

I want to see a warm-up.

637
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,527

639
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,407
让他见识见识！
Get him out of there!

640
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,048
宝贝！你在做什么？
Let's go, baby! What you doing, huh?

641
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,167
跳啊, 秀啊
Work it out, work it out.

642
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,925
教练, 我可以问你一个问题吗？
Coach, can I ask you a question?

643
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,331
整他, 山鸡！
Smoke him, Rooster!

644
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,641
如果目标是整合团队, 那......
If the idea is making these guys a team, then...

645
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,921
为什么让他们彼此斗舞？
Why have them battle? Yeah.

646
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,764
他们都被宠坏了

It's not like these guys don't feel the pressure.

649
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,091
完全搞错方向
Wrong kind of pressure.

650
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,487
正确的导正才会让他们团结一心
The right kind will make them a team.

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,248
♪ I never say never ♪

669
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,003
我尬过你了！    是哦！
I just owned you! Oh, yeah!

670
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,411
呀！  就这点本事吗？
Yeah! That's all you got, kid?

671
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,324
尤其是你, 山鸡！无庸置疑
And especially you, Rooster! No more questions.

672
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,802
无庸置疑...     你开我玩笑是吧?
No more questions. This is a joke, right?

673
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,370
我看起来像是在开玩笑？
I look like I'm joking?

674
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,010
黑色星期五, "骗子", 必须淘汰一个
Today's Friday, Grifter, somebody's got to go.

675
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,168
不是我 搞啥! 不是我... 教练, 应该是他们其中一个
Not me. Hell, no, not me, Coach. Any one of them, yo.

676
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,083
你选一个啊    就是你!
Take your damn pick. You are my pick.

677
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,730
我说我们分队尬舞
I said we're breaking into teams.

678
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,211
但你没有融入队友, 有吗？
But you didn't become part of a team, did you?

679
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,362
但我尬了他们, 教练!  我宰过......
Yeah, but I just roasted them, Coach. I smoked...

680
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,920
“我, 我, 我”你眼里只有"自我"
"I, I, I." Everything out of you is "I".

681
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,604
你甚至连团队作战的观念都没有？
You even understand the concept of a team?

682
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,762
团队作战是没有"自我"的...
Might be a cliche, son, but there is no "I" in team,

683
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,046
以后也不准有
and there'll be no "I" in this team.

684
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,122
又还不是个舞团, 这只是一个小分队！
This ain't no team, this is a crew!

685
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,123
很显然, 我比任何人都强！
And obviously, I'm better than anyone on it!

686
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,570
恭喜
Congratulations.

687
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,966
呦, 教练！
Yo, Coach!

688
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,006
教练！
Coach!

689
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,763
哟, 我比"敲敲"还棒
Yo, I've taken shits bigger than Do Knock.

690
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,490
Sisqo想去那边
Sisqo wannabe over there.

691
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,127
这是不对的... "骗子", 宰了他... 尬他!
It's not right. Grifter smoked him, roasted him.

692
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,725
太冷酷了, 宝贝
That was cold, babe.

693
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,689
教练使出杀鸡儆猴之术
Coach fired off a warning shot. Damn right.

694
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,966
不要让他找到把柄....
Don't give the man what he wants...

695
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,405
淘汰!
You will be gone.

696
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,403
恭喜你, "骗子" 你是最好的
Congratulations, Grifter. You're the best.

697
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,970
这里是你的公车票
Here's your bus pass.

698
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,610
淘汰!
You will be gone.

699
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,285
可惜淘汰的不是山鸡
Too bad it wasn't Rooster.

700
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,407
感谢上帝, 那不是我
Thank God it wasn't me.

701
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,891
是啊, 说的对极了
Yeah, word.

702
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,367
好多鞋,  是的
Lot of kicks. Oh, yeah.

703
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,206
我妹的老公的表哥的情妇帮Puma做广告
My sister's husband's cousin's mistress runs advertising for Puma,

704
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,560
所以她提供了一些给我们
so she hooked us up with some gear.

705
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,324
那两个家伙怎么解决？
Am I gonna have a problem with those two?

706
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,402
哪两个？  富兰克林
Those two? Catch up, Franklyn.

707
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,244
怎么处理山鸡和敲敲？
What's the deal with Rooster and Do Knock?

708
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,402
两个都在耍嘴皮子
They're in the middle of a really heated Twitter war

709
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,766
所以...   讲重点!
right now, so... The point?

710
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,569
他们就像Shaq去呛Kobe的事件
They're like Shaq and Kobe.

711
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,483
他们曾经是携手合作的战友
They used to be real tight, even ran a crew together.

712
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,164
发生了什么事？  你知道
So what happened? You've seen them.

713
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,083
各个都想当王
They both want to be the man.

714
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,491
说清楚点, 兄弟
Got to be more to it than that, man.

715
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,483
前阵子, 他们俩爱上同一个妞
A while back, they were both dating the same chick.

716
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,641
用膝盖想也知道
You know how that goes.

717
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,161
两个兄弟爱上同一个女孩,
Two guys fall in love with the same girl,

718
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,401
用跳舞对决
settle it with dance.

719
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,209
像古老童话故事那样...
It's a tale as old as...

720
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,850
...as time.

721
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,210
新的袋子？
We got new bags?

722
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,406
新的袋子？
We got bags?

723
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,567
每人一个？
We all get one?

724
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,767
什么？
What?

725
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,001
呦！
Yo!

726
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,286
嘿！
Hey!

727
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,971
哟, 唐帝送的, 兄弟
Yo, listen up. This came from Dante, man.

728
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,769
你知道这要花多少钱？这些都不便宜
You know how much these cost? These aren't cheap.

729
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,046
我知道我买不起
I know I can't afford it.

730
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,521
什么？PS Vita！
What? No way. I got a PS Vita!

731
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,204
真的？可以从背面进行操作
Are you serious? You can control it from the back.

732
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,203
哟, 我得到了一个刮胡刀, 我需要这个
Yo, I got a shaver. Yo, I needed this.

733
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,203
叛徒, 你又没有长胡子
Rebel, you don't have facial hair.

734
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,568
嘿, 我用相机跟你换
Hey, I'll trade you my camera for that.

735
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,646
好多喔
It's got everything.

736
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,449
像是在过圣诞节...  真的假的
It's like Christmas in here right now, seriously.

737
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,050
评判的准则是...
The criteria's to judge on are

738
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,890
编舞, 主题, 音乐,
choreography itself, theme and music,

739
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,803
舞团跳舞的一致性
and if the crew are synchronized.

740
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,564
第一轮得进前四强
So the top four crews from the first rounds

741
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,404
才有资格晋级第二轮...
are qualified for the second round...

742
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,211
简单的说, 兄弟们
It's real simple, gentlemen.

743
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,248
要是进不了前四强
You don't place among the top four teams,

744
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,971
就没机会争冠了
you don't even get a chance to battle for the world championship.

745
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,203
六周以后, 有针对俄罗斯的对抗赛
In six weeks, we have an exhibition against Russia.

746
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,965
想赢就得整合成一个跳舞的团队
For us to have any chance, we must become a team.

747
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,044
一直提醒你们团队中没有自我
And since we've been reminded there's no "I" in team,

748
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,122
“我”现在被禁了
the word "I" is now forbidden.

749
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,567
字典里再也没有这个字眼
We will hereafter strike it from our vocabulary.

750
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,404
谁说了"我"这个字
Whenever the word "I" comes out of one of your mouths,

751
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,767
整个团队连座处分100下伏地挺身
the entire team will do 100 pushups.

752
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,521
不团结在一起就没有机会
You will become "we," or we don't stand a chance.

753
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,563
兄弟们, 听好了
All right, gentlemen, listen up.

754
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,801
我们先轻松的练习一下
We'll begin this nice and easy.

755
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,042
先开始同步练习... 了解吗？
All right, sync drills. Everybody clear?

756
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,369
五, 六, 七, 八！
And five, six, seven, eight!

757
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,725
注意到你旁边的家伙了没？
Feel the guy next to you?

758
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,881
【世界街舞大赛】时, 我们应该闭着眼睛都能跳
By the Battle of the Year, we should be able to do this blindfolded.

759
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,530
你害我搞乱了, 闭嘴!
You're messing me up, bro. Shut up, man.

760
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,886
我会宰了你
I'll smoke you.

761
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,122
你再讲, 我就要爆掉你的菊花
Keep talking, I'm gonna bust your ass.

762
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,644
我们好像听到了 "我"？
Did we hear "I" over here?

763
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,125
你知道该怎么做, 兄弟们
You know what to do, gentlemen.

764
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,208
一, 二...
One, two...

765
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,806
跳啊！跳啊！没时间了！
All right, let's go, let's go! Time is short here now!

766
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,211
保持队形
Keep that formation tight.

767
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,367
就是这样
There it is.

768
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,326
没错！
Right!

769
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,970
就是这样没错
That's what I'm talking about.

770
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,246
终于有点成效了
Now we're getting somewhere.

771
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,243
整好队形  我们再做一次
All right, form your lines up. Let's do it again.

772
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,288
教练, 我们刚才的动作, 像...
Coach, we just did it, like... Come on, man.

773
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,249
等一下
Hold on a second.

774
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
这是我们跳舞的奥林匹克运动会
This is the Olympics of our sport.

775
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,608
妈的疯了.... 叫什么叫,  阿斯达 ？
Shit is crazy. What's that, Abbstarr?

776
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,331
教练, 没有不敬, 但“霹雳舞”不是一种运动
Coach, no disrespect, but b-boying is not a sport.

777
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,368
是一个舞蹈艺术形式
It's a dance. What we do is an art form.

778
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,487
就是说嘛
Yeah, that's right.

779
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,080
嘿, 听好了
All right, hey, listen up.

780
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,207
你说的没错
That's right.

781
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,648
艺术与体育, 富有哲理的对话
Art versus sport, very philosophical conversation.

782
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
坐下来...  让我们来谈谈
Let's all have a seat. Let's talk about this.

783
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,089
你听说过的一个名叫魔术强森的家伙？
You ever hear of a guy named Magic Johnson?

784
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,241
当然, 当然
Of course, yeah. Of course.

785
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,651
当然听过
Of course you have.

786
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,609
打篮球是一种运动
Played basketball, a sport.

787
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,920
但是他打球的方式
But watching him play,

788
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,606
像是艺术、行云流畅的诗歌
it's like art, poetry in motion.

789
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,762
有哪里不搭嘎吗?
Why can't it be both?

790
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,606
整好队形, 重新练习
Let's form it up, and let's run it again.

791
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,603
我们可以训练一整晚
We'll be here all night if you want to be!

792
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,330
现在, 跳吧！
Now, run it!

793
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,090
没错就是这样  跳啊!
That's what I'm talking about. That's it.

794
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,326
他在哪里？
Where is he?

795
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,850
继续跑, 兄弟们, 还有四圈！
Keep going, guys, four more!

796
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,808
你们在干什么？难道你不是应该
What is this? Aren't you supposed to be

797
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,961
盯着他们跳舞吗？  我们是啊
working on the routine? We are.

798
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,611
我看倒像是犯人被罚集体跑操场？
By running them like a chain gang?

799
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,445
"骗子" 他人呢？
Where's Grifter?

800
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,925
他走了
He's gone.

801
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,889
去哪儿了？  淘汰了
Gone where? Cut him.

802
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,810
所以, 你把我们最好的霹雳舞者给淘汰了？
So you cut one of our best b-boys?

803
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,928
应该说... 他曾经是最好的
Actually, he was the best.

804
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,841
我想确认一下... 我们的想法是否还一致
Let me just make sure we're on the same page here.

805
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,844
我没搞错吧, 还是它不是你出的主意
Am I mistaken, or was it not your idea

806
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,571
带美国最好的霹雳舞者去参加世界杯？
to take America's best b-boys to the worlds?

807
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,721
你错了
You're mistaken.

808
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,167
我打的主意是, 组最好的舞团去参加大赛
It was my idea to bring the best team to the worlds,

809
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,287
这是我们正在做的
which is what we're doing.

810
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,566
哪里有"我们"?
Ain't no "we," all right?

811
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,324
你是我花钱请来的...    你别管!
You work for me.  Back off.

812
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,687
不, 你才别乱搞!  赞助舞团的人是我
No, you back off. I'm sponsoring this team.

813
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,040
我不顾一切的挺你
I stuck my neck out for you.

814
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,088
我打电话给你, 你都不回
I've been calling you, you don't call me back,

815
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,447
所以我就来这儿看看是怎么回事,
so I got to come down here to see what's going on,

816
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,522
你却只会叫他们跑操场！
and you're running my boys into the ground!

817
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,608
还有, 你在摆烂
Meanwhile, you're a mess.

818
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,684
满身酒气冲天
You smell like you're sweating gin.

819
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,764
你还吐在鞋子上？
And is that vomit on your shoes?

820
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,171
鞋子是富兰克林的
Shoes are Franklyn's.

821
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,287
惨了
That's not cool.

822
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,890
我没时间跟你再鬼扯下去
I don't got time for this.

823
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,726
我要去忙俄罗斯对抗赛
I got to get your team ready for the Russian exhibition.

824
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,248
下来
Get your ass down here.

825
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,730
他是怎么操练他们的
How hard's he working these guys?

826
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,881
很严格
Real hard.

827
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,530
但是有效
But it's working.

828
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,082
他疯了, 但他知道自己在做什么
WB might be crazy, D, but he knows what he's doing.

829
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,446
让他们团结
He's bringing them together.

830
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,726
他怎么弄的?
And how is that?

831
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,002
敌人的敌人
The enemy of my enemy

832
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,605
就是我的朋友
is my friend.

833
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,487
叫他们集合
Get them inside.

834
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,604
感觉如何, 教练？
How you feeling, Coach?

835
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,568
很好
Fine. Yeah?

836
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,086
刚刚你看起来像一只羚羊
You look like a gazelle out there.

837
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,242
有关节炎的羚羊
A gazelle with arthritis.

838
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,123
我只是想问问你请人来编舞的事
I just wanted to ask you about the choreographer thing again.

839
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,123
周五就要跟俄国人比赛了
We got the Russians in five weeks.

840
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,645
是啊...呃...
Yeah... Uh...

841
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,246
你帮我找
Get me the best.

842
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,006
遵命
Got it.

843
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,171
还有别的事吗, 富兰克林？
Anything else, Franklyn? Yeah.

844
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,004
是啊, 我只是想谢谢你
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you.

845
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,764
为了什么？
For what?

846
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,284
所有的事
For everything.

847
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,647
D曾说跟着你可以学到更多, 他是对的
D said I could learn a lot from you, and he was right.

848
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,205
他很聪明
He can be a wise man.

849
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,531
是啊
Yeah.

850
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,601
我们念高中时
We were just in high school and everything,

851
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,569
大家都很疯
but being here is definitely, like, mad emotional.

852
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,005
当你在走廊走着, 就好像,
When you walk through the hallways, it's like,

853
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,889
碰到的人就是竞争对手
that competitor, that's the guy

854
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,769
当场就尬起来, 你听的懂吗？
you're competing against right there, you know what I mean?

855
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,962
不要慢下来！
That's it. Don't slow it down!

856
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,570
慢了！跟上！
You're slowing down! Pick it up!

857
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,801
跟上！
Come on!

858
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,161
俄罗斯排名前九已经很强
Russia's Top 9 has experience on their side.

859
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,765
组团超过10年
They've been a team for over 10 years.

860
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,161
他们是2010年【世界街舞大赛】 冠军
They were Battle of the Year champions in 2010,

861
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,402
艺术性、舞技和表演能力都是一流的
known for their artistry, finesse and showmanship.

862
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,005
再来！
Now, run it! Do it again!

863
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,211
...跳舞, 兄弟们, 这是关于
...dancing, fellas, it's about

864
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,805
融合为一, 对吧？   没问题
becoming one, right? Should be fine.

865
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,770
刚开始生疏, 慢慢会越来越熟练
He's a little brusque at first, but you'll get used to it.

866
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,001
安静
Settle down.

867
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,366
就是他
Here he comes.

868
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,680
她是谁？
Who's she?

869
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,046
编舞的
Choreographer.

870
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,001
她是个女的
She's a girl.

871
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,208
是啊   女的
Indeed she is, yeah.

872
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,282
找她来有用吗？
She's gonna help us win Battle of the Year? Yeah.

873
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,850
霹雳舞女孩？是的
A b-girl? Yeah.

874
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
街舞大赛时由她负责编导
She's gonna help us flip the script at the Battle of the Year.

875
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,925
她来了   不要再讲悄悄话了
She's coming. We can't whisper anymore.

876
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,047
史黛西    很高兴认识你
Stacy. It's nice to meet you.

877
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,768
布雷克  你好
Blake. Nice to meet you.

878
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,971
富兰克林说你是一个舞者
So, Franklyn here tells me you're a dancer.

879
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,121
编舞
Choreographer.

880
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,531
对
Right.

881
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,524
那个...  史黛西
Look... Stacy,

882
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,369
丑话说在前头
I'm just gonna be honest with you here.

883
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,205
我怕在这种情况下, 这些男孩,
I'm afraid in this situation, with the boys,

884
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,883
你可能有点...
you might be a bit of a...

885
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,405
为我们开启新的诗章
An exciting new chapter.

886
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,561
会让人分心
A distraction.

887
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,483
会分心      谢谢
A distraction. Thank you.

888
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,084
他们需要加强专注力和纪律
Well, maybe we need to teach them a little bit of focus and discipline.

889
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,849
相信我, 你需要我
Trust me, you need me.

890
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,811
丑媳妇要见公婆
Let's meet the boys.

891
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,887
我是史黛西, 你们的编舞老师
My name is Stacy, and I'm gonna be your choreographer.

892
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,166
无论你想, 你可以教教我
You can teach me whatever you want.

893
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,401
最好躺在地板上！
Preferably on the floor!

894
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,561
你会按摩吗？
Are you good with massages, too?

895
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,769
大腿内侧那边很需要
'Cause I have a lot of tension right here up in my upper thigh region.

896
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,966
说够了吗？
Are you done?

897
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,604
让我来解释一下
Let me explain something to you.

898
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,125
我对小鬼没兴趣
I'm not into boys.

899
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,362
嘿, 我喜欢这一点   这很酷
Hey, I like that. That's cool.

900
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,403
我并不介意
I'm cool with that. I don't mind.

901
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,561
我喜欢成熟的男人
I'm into men.

902
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,721
所以, 你和我, 下辈子吧
So you and I, we won't have a problem.

903
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,563
像这样   这很酷
Like that. That's cool.

904
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,681
第一件事, 明天早上几点？
First thing tomorrow morning?

905
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,000
六点
6:00.

906
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,764
从头来, 五, 六, 七, 八
From the top, clean, five, six, seven, eight.

907
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,002
一, 二, 三, 四......
One, two, three, four...

908
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,448
你们是跳霹雳舞的,  跳啊！
Y'all are supposed to be b-boys. Come on, let's go!

909
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,368
千瓦, 你搞屁啊
Kilowatt, you're killing me.

910
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,770
一, 二, 三, 四......
One, two, three, four...

911
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,490
停停停！
All right, hold up, hold up!

912
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,647
大家停止
Everybody stop.

913
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,926
你在干嘛, "敲敲"？
The hell are you doing, Do Knock?

914
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,128
我做了什么？ “我” ？
What did I do? "I"?

915
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,921
又来了？
Again?

916
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,764
受罚, 兄弟！白痴
Come on, man! Idiot. Who's stupid now?

917
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,649
你再讲, 混蛋, 我会打你屁股
Keep talking, bitch, I'll beat your ass.

918
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,166
打败我吗？你总是活在我阴影之下, 这是有原因的,
Beat me? There's a reason why you're always in my shadow,

919
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,044
难怪萝莉会甩掉你
and that's the same reason Lauren left your punk ass.

920
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,006
起来！
Get your ass up!

921
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,326
怎样？
What?

922
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,370
你这个矮骡子
Yeah, that's right. You was half the man I was.

923
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,402
哟, 哟
Yo, yo

924
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,482
你不管吗？
You're not gonna stop this?

925
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,361
嘿, 嘿！
Hey, hey!

926
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,204
够了！拉开他！
That's enough! Get him back!

927
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,486
退下！ 退下！
Back up! Back up!

928
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,686
够了！
That's it!

929
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,526
又是女的吗？
This about that girl?

930
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,806
那女的现在跟谁啊？
Either one of you still with her?

931
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,683
没有
Huh? No.

932
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,649
开天窗说亮话
So let me get this straight.

933
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,121
我们曾经是朋友, 现在反目成仇
We used to be friends, now we're swapping blows over

934
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,282
女人都跟别人跑了
some girl we're both glad is gone

935
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,089
早就变成别人的小三了
and who no doubt has hooked up with some other fool.

936
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,969
没说错吧
That about right?

937
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,326
想清楚
Let me be crystal clear.

938
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,290
好汉不提当年勇
History is exactly that. History!

939
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,681
结束！你明白了吗？
Fighting ends now! You understand me?

谁还想斗, 就淘汰！
Any one of you even think about fighting, you will be gone!

942
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,491
荒唐！浪费时间！

哟, 你跳舞的艺名从哪来的, 花美男？
Yo, where'd you get your b-boy name from, Lil Adonis?

979
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,726
在这里
Here.

980
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,723
那是什么？  我妈给的
What's that? That's my mom.

981
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,608
15岁时我第一次跳舞比赛
First time I tried a battle, I'm 15.

982
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,923
我的母亲, 她知道我与众不同
But my mother, see, she knows I'm not like the other kids.

983
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,128
我很害怕   我是同志
I'm scared. I'm gay.

984
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,089
是啊, 他是个妈宝
Yeah, he's a mama's boy.

985
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,444
你可以说我
Say all you want about me,

986
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,409
但别提到我妈一个字...
but say one more word about my mother...

987
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,131
还好吧？
We all good in here?

988
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,445
没事  教练
Yeah, we good, Coach.

989
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,121
花美男？
Lil Adonis?

990
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,606
你呢？
We all good?

991
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,085
没事, 教练
Good, Coach.

992
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,811
兄弟, 淘汰越来越严格了
Man, these cuts are getting crazy.

993
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,600
不坏
Not bad.

994
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,571
放下你的自我
You need to let go of your ego.

995
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,206
手表坏了吗, 叛徒？
Something wrong with your watch, Rebel?

996
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,931
呃...不, 教练, 没坏
Uh... No, Coach, it's good.

997
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,804
那我们干嘛等这么久？
Then what was so important to make the rest of us wait?

998
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,843
俄罗斯比赛不到两周的时间
We battle Russia's top crew in less than two weeks.

999
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,250
不想说耶
We'd rather not say.

1000
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,765
理由?
I said, why were we late?

1001
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,881
还是不要说的好
We'd really rather not say.

1002
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,011
讲啊
I said, why were we late?

1003
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,888
刚刚在大便
We had to take a shit.

1004
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,450
越来越难挑了, 是吧？
Getting harder to pick them, huh?

1005
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,048
天哪, 大家跳的越来越一致
God, each one of these guys has the moves down.

1006
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,043
不是动作的问题, 富兰克林
It isn't about the moves anymore, Franklyn.

1007
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,685
是关于化学变化
It's about chemistry.

1008
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,967
是指越来越团结吗？
Like which dudes are getting along?

1009
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,889
不是
Not about that, either.

1010
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,841
有名的舞团不见得大家都相处融洽
Record books are filled with teams that never got along,

1011
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,769
冠军舞团也一样
championship teams, too.

1012
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,084
你想说什么
So, what, then?

1013
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,561
要有亮点
Those teams had something else.

1014
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,646
有冲撞才有进步
The players pushed each other to greatness.

1015
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,289
告诉"难搞的" 我找他
Tell Intricate I need to see him.

1016
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,246
是
Okay.

1017
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,324
明天就是我们等待的一天
All right, gentlemen, tomorrow's the day we've been waiting for.

1018
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,521
俄罗斯队纪律高、同步、精准
The Russians are disciplined, synchronized, precise.

1019
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,685
记住, 要赢得这场唯一的办法, 就是发挥团队精神
Remember, the only way to win this is going there as a team.

1020
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,921
去睡吧!  明天是大日子
Get some sleep. Tomorrow's the big day.

1021
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,650
今晚比赛的特点
Tonight's battle features

1022
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,883
俄罗斯的前9尬美国梦幻队！
Russia's Top 9 versus America's Dream Team!

1023
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,804
跳吧！跳吧！
Let's go! Come on!

1024
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,166
叛徒上场！
Let's get 'em, Rebel!

1025
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,761
叛徒! 加油!
Come on, Rebel.

1026
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,720
"童童"！加油！
Let's go, Kid! Come on!

1027
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,085
啪
Pow!

1028
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,284
这是什么狗屁？
Come on. What is this shit?

1029
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,130
他妈的！
God damn it!

1030
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,524
上啊! 跳啊!
Go, go, go. Come on. Chief, chief, go, go.

1031
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,648
上！
All right, let's go!

1032
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,401
他在做什么？
What's he doing?

1033
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,168
你的团队在哪里？
Where's your team?

1034
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,846
山鸡, 归队！
Rooster, get out there!

1035
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,847
团队！团队！
Act like a team!

1036
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,806
该死的！
Damn it!

1037
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,721
你的团队在哪里？
Where's your team?

1038
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,368
回来啦！
Get off the floor! Get off the floor!

1039
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,685
你看你做了什么？
You see what you did?

1040
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,889
叫他们通通到外面去！
Get 'em outside right now!

1041
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,765
哦, 该死
Oh, shit.

1042
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,521
布雷克！
Blake!

1043
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,045
跟他们谈谈吧？
Are you gonna talk to them?

1044
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,441
没什么好说的
I got nothing to say to them I haven't already said.

1045
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,085
回程路上教练居然气到连一句话都没说
Can't believe Coach didn't say a word to us the whole way back.

1046
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,321
就是你搞砸的
It's 'cause you blew it.

1047
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,402
什么？你的错
What? All of y'all blew it.

1048
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,051
单挑就能代表梦幻队？我看是梦幻女
Call yourself the Dream Team? More like the Dreamgirls.

1049
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,690
你怪我？是啊, 我是认真的！
Look, are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious!

1050
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,961
阿尼斯, 告诉他们！谁的错
Anis, tell 'em! Back me up!

1051
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,326
这是你的错, 山鸡
It was your fault, Rooster.

1052
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,000
你说什么？
What'd you say?

1053
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,208
你听见了! 就是因为你才输的
You heard me! We lost tonight because of you, man!

1054
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,881
我的错? 我跳出来拯救大家... 我哪有错!
Because of me? If anything, I tried to rescue everybody! Yo, I'm over this!

1055
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,724
听到我耳朵都长茧了！
I've heard that same tired shit for years!

1056
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,121
老是怪罪别人！
Anything happens, it's always somebody else's fault!

1057
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,480
哟, 你怪我干嘛？
Yo, why you coming at me like this?

1058
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,649
我的脚受伤了, 我累了, 就是你的错, 兄弟！
'Cause my feet hurt, I'm tired, and it's your fault, man!

1059
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,888
呦, 你有问题吗？连你的人都这么说了, 山鸡
Yo, what the hell is your problem? Listen to your boy, Rooster.

1060
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,450
不, 你也闭嘴！你也是烂货！
No, you shut up, too! You're as bad as him!

1061
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,851
怎样, 你想对抗全世界吗  法国佬？
What, you against the whole world now, Frenchie?

1062
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,001
没有, 就你们两个混蛋！
No, just you two assholes!

1063
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,491
自从我加入舞团,
Ever since I walked in these doors,

1064
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,005
我为舞团付出一切！
I gave everything I got in this team!

1065
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,330
所有的一切！
Everything!

1066
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,046
教练是对的, 这支舞团不是没有机会
But Coach was right, this team isn't going nowhere

1067
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,771
如果任你们继续分裂恶搞
if you two don't get together right now!

1068
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,524
看看你的周围！
Look around you!

1069
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,520
看看这些队友！
Look at these guys!

1070
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,321
我们明明拥有获胜的条件！
We got everything we need to win, right here!

1071
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,044
成为最棒的舞团
To be the best there is!

1072
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,122
而你们就是他妈的乱搞
And you're too goddamn ignorant to see that!

1073
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,123
你需要管管你的人！    闭嘴！
You need to check your boy! Shut up!

1074
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,283
你和山鸡, 可能还有其他机会
Guys like you and Rooster, you might get other chances,

1075
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,011
对我而言, 就只有这里
but for someone like me, this shit is it, man.

1076
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,010
错过这舞团我就再也没有机会了, 永远！
I'm never gonna get another shot at this, ever!

1077
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,566
所以 我一直忍着
So I'm taking it,

1078
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,961
我想我该揍你或是教训我的老友！
even if I gotta punch you in the face or dog my oldest friend!

1079
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,371
兄弟, 这舞团是我生命中最重要的！
I want this, man, more than anything in my life!

1080
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,482
问题是, 你们这两个混蛋到底想干嘛？
Question is what the hell do you two assholes want?

1081
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,322
♪ Independent now Sans label

1082
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,401
山鸡！山鸡！
Rooster! Rooster!

1083
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,205
♪ Haters gonna ruin it ♪

1084
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,808
我们谈谈
We need to talk.

1085
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,690
- 少啰嗦   - 滚开
- There's been too much talk already. - Move.

1086
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,250
你干嘛这么欠揍？
Why you gotta be such an asshole?

1087
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,560
你想打架吗？烦死我了！
You want to fight? I'm tired of your shit!

1088
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,091
你的兄弟说的没错
I'm trying to tell you your boy is right.

1089
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,764
是啊, 我知道, 我是一混蛋啊  怎样
Yeah, I know, I'm an ass. I got it.

1090
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,450
我也老是怪东怪西的, 跟你一样
No, I'm as much to blame as you are.

1091
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,090
你知道你是多么有才华？
Do you know how talented you are?

1092
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,441
你随便跳一跳就会了
You try a move once, bam, you get that shit.

1093
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,489
我呢？我必须靠不断的练习才跟的上你
Me? I got to practice and practice my ass off just to come close to you!

1094
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,085
我一直很嫉妒
I've always been jealous of that.

1095
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,361
但是, 这就样我才能站在这里
But that's what got me here.

1096
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,605
你逼我成长
You got me here.

1097
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,451
让我有机会加入舞团
Without that, I don't even make this team.

1098
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,567
哟, 你到底想怎样, 兄弟？
Yo, where you going with this, man?

1099
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,761
我要赢！
I want to win!

1100
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,526
我要赢
I want to win.

1101
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,728
抛开过去, 我们就能赢
We put aside all our old bullshit, we can win this.

1102
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,370
他们需要我们
They need us.

1103
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,081
萝莉怎么办？
What about Lauren?

1104
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,448
我们分手两个月后, 你们才在一起的
I broke that off two months before you guys even hooked up.

1105
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,085
真的假的?
Really? Really.

1106
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,406
那你一直在跟我吵个屁？
So why you been acting all crazy?

1107
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,720
因为你太容易动怒了
'Cause it pisses you off!

1108
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,609
不过 我想尽释前嫌
But I want to squash this right now.

1109
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,926
来吧
Come on.

1110
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,568
让我们重新开始
Let's be partners again.

1111
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,130
放音乐
Just play my music, man.

1112
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,641
抱一下
Hey, give me a hug, bro.

1113
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,324
抱抱吗
A hug? Yeah!

1114
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,561
给我一个拥抱
Give me a hug.

1115
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,844
兄弟好样的
Come on, man. All right.

1116
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,131
教练！
Coach!

1117
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,841
呦, 教练！醒醒吧, 你迟到了
Yo, Coach! Wake up, man. You're late.

1118
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,445
都过六点了, 我们该开始训练
It's after 6:00, we gotta train right now.

1119
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,010
滚出去  今天放假
Get out. There's no practice today.

1120
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,009
起床啦!     滚出我的房间！
Come on. Get up, man. Get out of my damn room!

1121
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,246
我们哪里都不去
We aren't going anywhere.

1122
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,527
“我们”你懂个屁
"We." You don't know shit about "we," son.

1123
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,364
我们懂... 我们搞砸了
We get it. We screwed up.

1124
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,090
来啦, 叫叫叫个屁
Come on, let's go. You don't tell me shit.

1125
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,571
我们不是叫你该怎么做, 教练
We're not telling you what to do, Coach.

1126
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,051
我们在求你
We're asking.

1127
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,167
教练, 请
Come on, Coach, please.

1128
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,611
来啦, 大哥
Come on, man.

1129
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,964
训练室,  10分钟后
Training room, 10 minutes.

1130
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,970
看吧
Told you.

1131
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,201
我们想赢, 我们就要改变我们的态度
We want to win, we need to change how we think.

1132
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,044
听起来很熟悉？成功是一种选择
Sound familiar? Success is a choice.

1133
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,805
真正的冠军都知道, 心里想的才是关键
Every true champion knows mental game is the key.

1134
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,041
最大的动力来源
It's our greatest power.

1135
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,441
普通人不懂的驾驭他, 甚至于根本不知道
Most people never touch that power. Don't even know they have it.

1136
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,965
不断地重蹈覆辙
Go around, doing the same old shit,

1137
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,042
冥顽不化
thinking the same old thoughts every damn day.

1138
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,646
混吃等死
It's why those people will tell you, "Same shit, different day."

1139
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,690
宇宙中唯一不变的真理就是, 什么都会变
Truth is the only thing permanent in this universe is change.

1140
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,285
与其抱怨这些训练
Instead of griping about these drills,

1141
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,806
不如说,  “训练可以带给我们舞团,
choose to say, "We're giving these drills, our team,

1142
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,689
“我们国家, 我们个人”
"our country, every ounce of ourselves. "

1143
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,171
冠军之路
Choose to see ourselves as champions.

1144
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,130
走路, 说话, 吃, 喝, 思考就像个冠军样
Walk, talk, eat, drink, think like champions,

1145
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,531
没人可以阻挡我们
we become unstoppable.

1146
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,887
魔鬼藏在细节里
We become champions in everything we do.

1147
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,088
我看到你们的进步
All right, it's looking good. I can see progress.

1148
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,366
我知道你累了
Holy... I know you're tired,

1149
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,842
才过45分钟而已, 别像个娘们  深呼吸
but it's the fourth quarter, gentlemen. Suck it up. Deep breath.

1150
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,289
再来
Let's run it again.

1151
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,725
明天是星期五
Tomorrow's Friday.

1152
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,529
还要淘汰一个
Last man standing.

1153
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,122
淘汰不是重点
Can't think of it as cutting the last man.

1154
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,726
要这样想... 舞团终于要成军了!
Gotta think of it as choosing our final team.

1155
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,131
是吗？
Yeah?

1156
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,405
成军后会比较轻松吗？
Does that make it any easier?

1157
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,925
不会
No, not really.

1158
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,561
嘿, 教练
Hey, Coach.

1159
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,769
- 嘿    - 嘿, 宝贝
- Hey. - Hey, baby.

1160
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,802
好吧, 再见
All right, see ya. See ya.

1161
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,011
你真蠢？
Are you really this stupid?

1162
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,287
教练, 我...         规则很简单
Coach, look... The rules are very simple.

1163
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,931
请进
Come in.

1164
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,491
没关系, 宝贝, 爸爸在这里
It's okay, baby, Daddy's here.

1165
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,606
她叫阿丽娜
This is Aleena.

1166
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,490
没关系, 宝贝...   妈妈很快就回来
It's okay, baby. Mama's gonna be back soon.

1167
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,608
她好漂亮         谢谢
She's beautiful. Thank you.

1168
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,045
没事
It's okay.

1169
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,769
你有听过 4个撇步？
You ever hear of the Four S's?

1170
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,804
那是什么？   婴儿包巾、侧抱、摇摇、嘘嘘
What's that? Swaddle, side, shimmy, shush.

1171
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,206
我做给你看
May I?

1172
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,044
没关系, 宝贝
It's okay, baby.

1173
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,690
瞧, 包巾很舒服
See, swaddling soothes them.

1174
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,046
有点紧, 但不要太紧
Tight, but not too tight.

1175
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,844
然后, 侧抱
Then you turn her on her side like this.

1176
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,929
摇一摇
Then you shimmy back and forth.

1177
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,286
不行吧
It's not gonna work.

1178
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,089
行!   你不要吵
It will, quiet.

1179
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,730
嘘嘘
Shushing.

1180
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,961
你怎么做到的？
How'd you do that?

1181
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,521
我的儿子有腹绞痛问题
My boy had colic when he was a baby.

1182
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,681
你有儿子？
You got a boy?

1183
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,404
没问题了
It's okay.

1184
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,970
等我一下
I'll be right back.

1185
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,205
说吧
Start talking.

1186
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,165
我不能把她们丢在纽约不顾
I'm not gonna leave my family back in New York, Coach.

1187
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,402
在过去的三个月里, 只能靠信用卡过活
For the last three months, we've been living off credit cards.

1188
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,209
你已经溜出了三个月？
You been sneaking out for the last three months?

1189
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,129
不是每晚, 有机会的话
It's not every night. It's when I can.

1190
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,130
不要淘汰我, 教练
You can't kick me out, Coach.

1191
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,765
拜托, 不要在这个时候
Please, not now.

1192
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,889
应该有更好的办法
There are better ways to handle this.

1193
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,327
我家没钱, 教练
I don't come from much, Coach.

1194
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,164
我只能靠跳舞
All I got is breaking.

1195
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,969
你应该优先照顾你的家人
You gotta take care of your family first.

1196
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,530
我有在做啊, 教练
That's what I'm trying to do, Coach.

1197
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,122
难道你不明白吗？舞团是我的机会
Don't you see? This team is my chance

1198
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,282
能给阿丽娜更好的未来
to give Aleena chances I never had.

1199
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,569
有机会给她更好的生活
Chances to know that we can actually do something

1200
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,331
只要赢得【世界街舞大赛】
with our lives if I make it to Battle of the Year.

1201
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,482
明天就只剩下13名正式团员了
Team goes down to the final 13 tomorrow.

1202
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,407
如果我不够资格进前13名, 就淘汰我
If I don't make top 13, send me home.

1203
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,363
我只是希望得到公平待遇
I just want my fair shake, Coach.

1204
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,928
请不要现在就淘汰我
Please don't bus-pass me.

1205
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,445
不要给我迟到
Don't be late.

1206
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,561
唐帝要给你的
Delivery. From Dante.

1207
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,522
“去法国前, 烧掉那丑死的连帽运动服 ”
"For France. Burn that goddamn hoodie."

1208
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,405
我的运动服有什么问题？   没有
What's wrong with my hoodie? Nothing.

1209
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,811
无业游民风格
It's just very "vagrant chic."

1210
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,211
很好
It's nice.

1211
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,166
审判日
Judgment Day.

1212
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,006
嗯
Yeah.

1213
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,563
你会选择谁？
Who you gonna pick?

1214
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,645
不是我
I'm not.

1215
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,841
你来选
You are.

1216
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,926
我？  你来
Me? You.

1217
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,327
其实我已经挑好人选了
I know which man I'd send home.

1218
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,009
名字先写下来了
Wrote his name on the back.

1219
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,525
让我看看是谁
Great. Let me see. I'll go get him.

1220
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,001
教练要知道, 当他的判断有偏差时
Coach has gotta know when his own judgment's biased.

1221
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,885
就是怕感性大于理智
I can't help feeling my heart's talking louder than my head.

1222
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,883
兄弟们都很努力
Guys have worked too hard.

1223
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,644
撑到现在
Come too far.

1224
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,205
所以, 我相信你的判断, 富兰克林
So I'm trusting your judgment, Franklyn.

1225
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,009
你跟我一样了解他们
You know them as well as I do.

1226
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,650
不, 我不能选择
No, I can't choose.

1227
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,051
淘汰一个
Take one down.

1228
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,566
如果我选错了人？
What if I pick the wrong guy?

1229
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,766
你不会的
You won't.

1230
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,005
好吧
Okay.

1231
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,806
这不是淘汰最后一人
It's not like we're cutting the last man,

1232
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,681
而是终于要组成舞团了
we're just picking the final team.

1233
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,443
你说得对, 不会更轻松
You're right, doesn't make it any easier.

1234
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,530
同一个
Same man.

1235
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,246
哦, 富兰克林...
Oh, Franklyn...

1236
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,929
你有资格了
You've earned it.

1237
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,366
谢谢你, 教练
Thank you, Coach.

1238
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,249
谢谢你, 富兰克林
Thank you, Franklyn.

1239
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,401
哟, 巴比诺
Yo, Bambino.

1240
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,690
虽然安慰不了你, 但这是教练最难的选择
I know this is no consolation, but this was the toughest choice for Coach.

1241
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,331
我们到了法国会打电话给你
We'll give you a call when we get to France, won't we, guys?

1242
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,686
最好是
Yeah. You better.

1243
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,569
烂透了
That sucked.

1244
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,881
嘿, 靠过来！
Hey, gentlemen! Huddle up!

1245
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,530
靠过来
Let's huddle up!

1246
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,246
听好了
All right, listen up.

1247
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,243
我们要给唐帝做行前验收
We have our final presentation with Dante,

1248
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,085
回宿舍换衣服, 一小时后见
so go back to your dorms, get changed, meet me back here in an hour.

1249
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,246
哦, 带护照
Oh, and get your passports together.

1250
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,846
我们要去法国！
Looks like we're going to France!

1251
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,684
唐帝来了, 再彩排一下
Dante's at the gate, so let's run the intro one more time.

1252
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,003
回到最初的队形, 整齐划一
Get in the first formation. Make sure it's clean.

1253
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,288
预备 开始
Here we go.

1254
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,168
棒极了
All right. It's looking great.

1255
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,210
嘿,  WB , 有人想来道别
Hey, WB, somebody wants to wish us farewell

1256
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,406
去法国之前
when we go to France.

1257
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,084
WB 瞧瞧你
Look at WB.

1258
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,208
WB , 现在是怎样, 宝贝？

Unbelievable!

1260

还好吗？
How you doing?

1261
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,322
你呦, 卡迈勒！
Look at you. Yo, Kamel!

1262
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,920
大哥, 哎, 我从小就是你的忠实粉丝
Man, hey, I been a big fan of yours since I was about this big.

1263
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,684
你认识我吗？   什么？
You know me? What?

1264
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,841
你是霹雳舞界的麦可乔丹耶
You're like the Michael Jordan of b-boys.

1265
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,166
嘿, 见见我的好友
Hey, meet my friend.

1266
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,441

Yo, what's good? Sniper. What's up, man?

1269

1270
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,689

Yo, let's show them the new move.

1271

1272
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,047

哟, 教练, 照过来！
Hey, yo, Coach, check this out!

Five, six, seven, eight...

1275
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,010

哦, 不
Oh, no.

靠
Shit.

1279
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,324
兄弟们, 不要看我可怜
Come on, guys, don't watch me pack.

1280
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,525
兄弟们, 我向来都是很自大
Guys, ever since I was about this big, it's always been about me.

1281
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,124
山鸡唱独脚戏
The Rooster Show.

1282
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,602
但是和你们相处这三个月以来
But these last three months with you guys,

1283
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,763
与你们能成为兄弟...

1284
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,049
我只想说
I just gotta say

1285
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,971
又是我的问题
it still is about me.

1286
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,408
我实在没资格做队长
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't even be in this position.

1287
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,561
敲敲, 你才有资格
Do Knock, it should be you.

1288
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,170
哦, 谢谢你喔
Oh, for real?

1289
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,448

Anis, make sure you call me, in France, when y'all win, all right?

1290
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,641

Yo, this is where we want to be, fellas!

And remember, we got curfew at 10:00.

1356

该死的！唐！
Damn! Dang!

"福利兹"和"敲敲"抢头阵？
Flipz and Do Knock got that first set down?

1358

还要转换步伐...
Still need to work on that transition...

1360

布雷克, 他们可以

1361
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,484
先停一下, 不要再烦恼比赛了
Don't you ever just stop thinking about the battle?

1362
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,800
对不起
I'm sorry.

1363
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,160
没关系     只是...
It's okay. It's just...

1364
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,681
环顾四周
Look around.

1365
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,485
我们人在法国
We are in France

1366
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,082
辛苦了半天才来到这里

Don't forget, it's not all about winning or losing.

1373
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,810
大家群聚一堂, 庆祝嘻哈文化
The whole world is coming together to celebrate hip-hop culture.

1374

Yo, Mayhem. I'm-a go to the bathroom.

马上回来, 兄弟
I'll be right back. All right, man.

He's cute. He's cute. So, no matter what

01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,363
或者什么宗教, 让我们一起庆祝,
country you're from or what religion, let's celebrate,

1378
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,124
同一个世界, 同一首歌
All Around the World, Same Song.

1379
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,848
干杯, 山姆男孩！
To us, Sam boy!

1380
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,126
我去拿饮料   小心
I'm gonna get a drink. Watch out.

1381
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,247
好吧！
All right!

1382
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,402
对不起        对不起
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1383
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,720
妈的！
Shit!

1384
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,688
喂! 你打翻了我的酒！对不起
Man, you just spilled my drink! I'm sorry.

1385
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,886
对不起有个屁用？
I don't care if you're sorry, all right?

1386
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,371
对不起    对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1387
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,805
哇, 哇！冷静!  他喝醉了
Whoa, whoa! You good? He's drunk.

1388
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,365
没事啦  好啦~  好个屁!
Are you good right now? No, it's not good, all right?

1389
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,568
这个混蛋刚刚打翻了我的酒
This asshole just came and spilled my drink.

1390
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,721
好吧, 我赔你一杯
Okay, I'm gonna get you another one.

1391
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,370
我不用你赔
I don't care if you get me another one.

1392
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,562
我跟我的朋友坐在一起...    他们是你的朋友吗？
I was sitting with my friends... These your friends?

1393
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,721
我请你们, 没事啦
Drinks on me, everything's cool.

1394
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,167
开干了！上！
Fight, fight, fight! Let's go, go, go!

1395
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,005
嘿！冷静下来！冷静下来！
Hey, hey, hey! Chill! Chill!

1396
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,566
喂
Yeah.

1397
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,851
什么？
What?

1398
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,689
好, 托马斯
All right, Thomas.

1399
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,524
我会处理
I'll handle it.

1400
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,521
该死的！
Damn it!

1401
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,366
才第一个晚上！
One night!

1402
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,649
我让你们这些小鬼乐个一晚, 你们就这样报答我
I give you clowns one night, and you throw it back in my face.

1403
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,370
教练, 请让我...         闭嘴
Coach, please let me... Shut up.

1404
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,523
我不敢相信
I can't believe this shit.

1405
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,325
果然出了洋相, 丑陋的美国人
You gave them exactly what they expected, ugly Americans.

1406
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,323
你都不听我解释...
Come on, Coach, you didn't even let me explain what happen...

1407
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,004
我说闭嘴
I said shut up.

1408
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,449
你什么也没学到
You've learned nothing.

1409
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,885
什么都没有
Nothing.

1410
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,010
狗改不了吃屎
You're the exact same guys

1411
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,889
跟三个月前一样
that walked through my door three months ago.

1412
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,450
就是你
And you,

1413
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,005
祸由你起
you started this little dance party.

1414
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,481
喜欢打人是吧？
You like to hit people? Huh?

1415
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,645
打我啊？
Want to take a swing at me?

1416
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,846
不, 老兄咦？
No, man. Huh?

1417
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,366
WB , 你在做什么？你在做什么？
WB, what are you doing? What are you doing?

1418
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,450
托马斯说
Thomas called.

1419
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,760
"狙击手"被取消资格
Sniper's been disqualified.

1420
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,649
你明天滚回家    什么？
You go home tomorrow. What?

1421
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,485
如果"狙击手"走了,  我也不干了
If Sniper's gone, I'm gone.

1422
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,801
你威胁我   我没有
Don't you test me. I'm not.

1423
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,206
哟, 如果"狙击手"走了, 我也走
Yo, if Sniper's going, I'm going.

1424
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,486
我也一样, 教练
Me, too, Coach.

1425
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,483
对不起, 教练, 没错
Sorry, Coach, that's right.

1426
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,085
他走了, 大家都不跳了
He goes, we all go.

1427
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,640
怎么回事
Start talking.

1428
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,802
是当地的小混混起的头
These local punks were trying to start shit.

1429
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,530
他们出拳打"花美男"
All right? They punked Lil Adonis.

1430
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,648
这就是为什么"狙击手"也跳出来
That's why Sniper stepped up.

1431
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,960
听我说
But listen.

1432
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,361
几个月前, 他们两个就连用餐
A few months ago, Sniper couldn't even sit

1433
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,046
都不能坐在一起
at the same table as Adonis.

1434
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,645
互看不顺眼
He couldn't even look at him,

1435
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,688
现在竟然为他挺身而出
and now he's fighting for him.

1436
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,240
教练你要怎么骂都行
Say what you want, Coach, but down to a man,

1437
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,802
他们已经是今非昔比
these are not the same guys that walked through your door that first day.

1438
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,806
你想要组一个团队
You wanted a team.

1439
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,725
他们就是
Well, you got one.

1440
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,523
我跟托马斯谈一谈
I gotta call Thomas.

1441
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,961
如何？
So, what now?

1442
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,371
我们等待
We wait.

1443
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,521
兄弟们！兄弟们
Guys! Guys.

1444
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,846
你跟托马斯谈过了？
Did you talk to Thomas?

1445
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,524
嗯
Yeah.

1446
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,125
结果呢？
And?

1447
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,451
"狙击手"
Sniper.

1448
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,726
有, 长官
Yes, sir.

1449
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,521
你可以留下
You're staying.

1450
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,326
听好了
Listen up.

1451
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,725
这是一个漫长的夜晚
It's been a long night.

1452
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,566
睡个好觉
Get some sleep.

1453
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,369
明天是大日子
Big day tomorrow.

1454
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,646
兄弟们...
Gentlemen...

1455
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,084
团队的感觉如何呀？
How's it feel to be a team?

1456
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,883
超赞, 教练
Damn good, Coach.

1457
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,689
我是Artem Korolev,
My name is Artem Korolev,

1458
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,922

1467
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,644
我在世界街舞大赛现场
Right now, I'm inside at the Battle of the Year.

1468
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,808

This atmosphere is explosive!

1469

1475
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,404
今晚将会有惊人的发展
It's gonna be absolutely amazing tonight.

1476
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,926
是啊, 但是法国队有主场优势
Yeah, but there's something to be said about home-court advantage.

1477
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,769
我们在法国！
Yes. And right now, we're in France!

1478
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,370
大家都关注着韩国刺客队
The crew that everybody's going after are the Seoul Assassins!

1479
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,761
韩国舞团正处于巅峰状态
This Korean crew is on top of the mountain,

1480
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,127
毫无疑问的是由"老油鬼"来领军
and they're unquestionably led by Fuel,

1481
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,249
世界上最具传奇色彩的“霹雳舞团”！
one of the most legendary b-boys in the world!

1482
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,926
不要忘记这种艺术的起源
But let us not forget where this art form all began.

1483
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,445
是在哪儿, 泰伦斯？是美国！
Where was that, Terrence? In America!

1484
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,887

1486
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,370
像是刚刚组团才15分钟而已
they've been together 15 minutes.

1487

荣耀的时刻
Time to shine.

1539
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,963
我们为此而生, 兄弟们

1540
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,644
没错!

1546
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,484
看来大家很厌恶
This is some overt hating.

1547
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,246
应该是昨晚发生的意外所造成的
I knew after the incident last night that it was gonna be ugly,

1548
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,324
真是没想到会演变成这样
but I don't think anybody could have imagined this.

他们要跳什么故事呢?

1563
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,008

I don't know, things just

1750
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,970
这一路走来

1755
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,883
我不知道, 我只是...
I don't know, I just...

1756
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,800
自甘堕落
Well, I quit living.

1757

你们都听我说过很多次了

1758
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,482
“ 改变态度, 改变人生 ”

1759
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,331
事实上是...
Fact is,

1760
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,329
你们改变了我
you've changed the way I think.

1761
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,844
你改变了我的人生
You've changed my life.

1762
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,366
培训的第一天, 我有一个目标,
First day of training, I had one goal,

1763
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,008
教导舞团如何整合成一个团队
teach a crew how to be a team.

1764
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,680
没想到不仅如此
We became much more than that.

1765
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,691
我们变成了一家人
We became a family.

1766
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,929
有时我以为我将一蹶不振
Something I thought I'd lost forever.

1767
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,289
成败论英雄
And win or lose, gentlemen,

1768
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,771
当你有了家人
when you got family

1769
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,244
输赢都不重要了
nothing else matters.

1770
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,324
我们不甘心就这样结束, 教练
But it wasn't supposed to end like this, Coach.

1771
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,448
这不是结束, 敲敲
It's not the ending, Do Knock.

1772
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,806
这是开始
It's the beginning.

1773
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:06,927
等等...
Wait.

1774
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,206
明年还要来吗, 教练？
You coming back next year, Coach?

1775
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,407
你在开玩笑吧？
You kidding me?

1776
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,964
辛苦了半天只为争第二？
We did all this work to come in second?

1777
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,281
第二名烂透了
Second sucks.

1778
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,045
对啊
Damn right.

1779
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,971
来! 靠过来!
Come on, let's huddle up one more time.

1780
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,246
数三下
On three.

1781
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,731
一, 二, 三！
One, two, three!

1782
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,325
梦幻队！
Dream Team!

1783
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,931
到底要看几遍啦？
Do we have to watch that whole thing?

1784
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,490
不要关啦
No.

1785
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,130
是啊,  山鸡说要关掉
Yeah, Roo's right. Take it off.

1786
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,967
要是我去了, 我们就赢了
Hey, you guys needed me. If I was there, we would have won.

1787
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,644
狗真的改不了吃屎
Once an asshole, always an asshole.

1788
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,761
我只是说真话呀
I'm just saying.

1789
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,601
少臭屁了？
Are you for real?

1790
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,841
这家伙, 兄弟
This guy, man.

1791
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,867
第二名没啥不好呀
Second place, there's nothing wrong with it.

1792
01:43:24,893 --> 01:43:25,909
啊就第二名啊
It's just second place.

1793
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,487
兄弟们, 告诉他第二名怎样
Guys, tell him what we think about second.

1794
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,324
第二名烂透了!
Second sucks.

1795
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,169
没错
It sure does.

1796
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,009
我也要参一咖啦...
I still wish I could have been there, though, man.

1797
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,202
好啊, 看什么时候不用再撑拐杖？
You can be. How much time you got left on those crutches?

1798
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,806
大约六个星期, 我就没事了
About six weeks, and I'll be ready. There it is.

1799
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,804
其他的人, 我们有超过三个月的准备期
For the rest of us, though, since we got more than three months to prepare,

1800
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,211
应该在周一就开始排练
we should start rehearsals on Monday.

1801
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,368
什么？别闹了, 教练
What? Come on, Coach.

1802
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,561
我们才刚回来耶~        好主意, 教练
We just got back. Good idea, Coach.

1803
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,324
我们才刚回来!     教练, 真的吗？
We just got back, Coach. Really?

1804
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,364
听好了
Listen up.

1805
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,686
我的规则很简单
My rules are simple.

1806
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,643
早上六点开始训练
Practice starts at 6:00 a.m.

1807
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,891
谁敢超过六点....
Come at 6:01...
