{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want more.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't get greedy.

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry.

8
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was gonna be, like, so sophisticated when we met.

9
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Little hard to do that with your mouth full of... whatever that is.

10
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's great. It's great. Do you want some?

11
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sure.

12
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yum.

13
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's, um... kind of what I was thinking.

14
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry?

15
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You just don't look like the kind of guy who has to meet girls over the internet.

16
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it's better to meet people online first sometimes.

17
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You get to know what they're like inside.

18
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When you work as a photographer you find out real quick, people's faces lie.

19
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does my face lie?

20
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I look at those eyes and I see...

21
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}a girl who reads Zadie Smith,

22
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who listens to John Mayer and ColdPlay,

23
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who loves Monty Python episodes

24
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and who, desperately,

25
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}madly, deeply, wants,

26
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}needs, longs for... more chocolate.

27
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Excellent, excellent judge of character.

28
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I get two of those truffles

29
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and two ganaches.

30
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now what's a ganache?

31
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't know what a ganache is?

32
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Lucky, you're with a woman of the world

33
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to introduce you to these things.

34
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And two chocolate-covered hearts.

35
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And a decaf latte for me.

36
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And? - I'm good.

37
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, you do appear so.

38
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So what's in the bag?

39
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you know,

40
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}just, like, books and stuff.

41
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I figured if you stood me up, then I should have something to read.

42
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well... I couldn't really decide.

43
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm reading this book about Jean Seberg.

44
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's this actress who slept with all the wrong people

45
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and ended up killing herself.

46
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you do that.

47
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. I intend to sleep with all the right people.

48
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Plus, I'm reading Romeo and Juliet.

49
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a ninth grade book,

50
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I figured I could have it done before the school year starts, so...

51
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Doesn't look like Elizabethan tragedy.

52
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, that's 'cause...

53
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, my dad... he's letting me audit one of his med school courses, right?

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't really understand half of it,

55
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I totally love it.

56
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

57
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you go to UCW

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you sit in a lecture hall with all these grad students

59
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and, what, do they hit on you?

60
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why? Are you jealous?

61
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just admiring. I didn't know you were interested in that kind of thing.

62
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

63
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You thought since we'd been chatting for three weeks

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that you knew everything about me?

65
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Plus, they wouldn't hit on a 14-year-old girl. They're old enough to be my dad, so...

66
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're like...

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're bad older. They're... You're not...

68
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so articulate.

69
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry. Can I just, like, start over?

70
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. I get it. I get it. I just thought...

71
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, well, you look older than you are.

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You certainly act older than you are.

73
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really?

74
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. I was expecting someone not as impressive.

75
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Me too.

76
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cool shirt.

77
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You want it?

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I didn't really bring enough bucks, so...

79
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And yet, not actually what I was asking.

80
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sure, I want it.

81
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I get a green shirt in a small, please?

82
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. No, no.

83
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I can't let you do that. - What? Because...

84
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Because... - What? Because you'd be so

85
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}indebted to me that you'd have to...

86
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. I guess I can let you do that.

87
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have to model it for me.

88
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Conditions. I can't live with all these conditions.

89
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks.

90
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- This is so unfair. - What?

91
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is when things happen,

92
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in the middle of the night, by which time I am completely out of the scene.

93
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Life as a teenager.

94
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just hate having to depend Lindsey to drive me everywhere.

95
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll be driving before you know it.

96
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In the meantime, I missed Elizabeth Wurtzel speaking at USC

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and the Goldfrapp concert.

98
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was at the Goldfrapp concert actually.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shut up. You were? Was it great?

100
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course it was great. What am I saying?

101
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, you could judge for yourself.

102
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I got a bootleg MP3. - You have the concert?

103
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just one song. A little louder, please, so the authorities know.

104
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I totally have to hear it.

105
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll send it to you.

106
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}After you get home, after you get around to it.

107
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good things are worth the wait.

108
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And what have you waited for recently?

109
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna have to wait four years for you.

110
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are just trying to distract me from that MP3.

111
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I have to send it.

112
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not like I could take you to my house.

113
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That would be a little insane.

114
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}True.

115
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, now don't peek.

116
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I shoot models for a living.

117
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've seen it all before.

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you're so sure about that?

119
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm thinkin' yeah.

120
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe you should peek

121
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and make that clerk wonder what's going on over here.

122
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In your dreams, little girl.

123
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Little girl?

124
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever happened to how mature I was?

125
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Is this mature enough for you? - Okay...

126
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Keep teasing me like that, you're gonna drive me crazy.

127
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that so?

128
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. All right.

129
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How's this?

130
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nice.

131
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

132
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, there's three points I have to make.

133
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One: You wouldn't take advantage because you've been seen with me.

134
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And two: It's Goldfrapp.

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And three?

136
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, and three...

137
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You said that it would be insane for me to come over and...

138
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Four... Four out of five doctors agree that I am actually insane.

139
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thus, I have to come over

140
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in order to be true to myself.

141
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right?

142
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the fourth reason: This amazing car.

143
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, in the face of logic like that, I bow down and worship.

144
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bow down?

145
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a good idea. What are you waiting for?

146
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Worship me.

147
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, oh, royal Thonggirl.

148
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am not worthy to kiss your feet.

149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe you are.

150
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe we should, like, get going.

151
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, oh, magnificent thonggirl.

152
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wanna call your sister? Tell her where you'll be?

153
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe later. I just wanna get in this car.

154
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow. So hot.

155
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's wrong?

156
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, they teach us "young things"

157
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}not to drink anything we haven't mixed ourselves, so...

158
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Smart.

159
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come back in the kitchen. I'll pour it again.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Come on.

161
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can whip up something more entertaining than that.

162
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Healthy dude, huh?

163
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I try.

164
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Figure I'll live as long as I can.

165
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Living long is overrated.

166
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? You don't want to reach a ripe, old age?

167
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For what? When I'm 80,

168
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}what do I do for fun?

169
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When you're 80 I'll be 98.

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right... and useless to me.

171
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What use do you have in mind for me?

172
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew there'd be something fun around here.

173
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, other than wa...

174
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I bet these babes got some dirt on you.

175
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those are models.

176
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So why are they on your walls instead of magazine covers?

177
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here, looking at you while

178
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you know, you do the most intimate things.

179
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My house is my studio.

180
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When clients come here they're walking into my giant portfolio.

181
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what? These were all shot here?

182
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God.

183
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you are like a big deal, aren't you?

184
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I get work.

185
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Isn't that one of those cameras that gives you the square image?

186
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you know that?

187
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm a goon. I just, like, read constantly.

188
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You saw all those books in my bag.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Feels good.

192
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't fall behind.

193
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We should toast.

194
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Carpe...

195
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}omnious.

196
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's that?

197
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's my own little toast.

198
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know carpe diem.

199
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Seize the day."

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I figure, carpe omnious.

201
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Take it all."

202

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take it all.

203
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, like, what is it like to look through your lens at some...

204
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}beautiful woman who's working so hard

205
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to look good for you?

206
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know these models. They all have handlers.

207
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}People to make sure their hair is just right

208
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and their makeup is okay

209
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they don't get lost on their way to their next gig.

210
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you never get to be alone with them?

211
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Rarely. - Poor Jeff.

212
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am compensated for my troubles. Don't worry about me.

213
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I like worrying about you.

214
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It makes me wonder...

215
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

216
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no. Forget it.

217
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, come on.

218
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. What's in that insane mind of yours?

219
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. We'll have another screwdriver and then maybe I'll tell you.

220
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm waiting. - Hold on.

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are not keeping up.

222
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

223
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, here's where you're supposed to make it easier for me and read my mind.

224
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're wondering how many models I've done it with.

225
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

226

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- How many? - None of them.

227
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, get out. - No. They're underage, mostly.

228
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd be arrested.

229
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you're not arrested for photographing them like this?

230
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm very aware of the legal boundaries.

231
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I have to be. - Right. Right.

232
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'Cause secretly... Secretly...

233

234
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. There's just one that I slept with

235
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}when we were both younger.

236
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That one?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what? What? Was she, like, the first big girlfriend or something?

244
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's right.

250
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She actually signed with Ford right after this shoot.

251
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- She really took off. She, um... - Oh, my God.

261
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. - Really, really, really?

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They have to show us a little of their soul,

281
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}their secrets.

282
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And most people only open up from weakness.

283
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nobody wants to see photos of weak people.

284
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We look at great models because they open up...

285
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}from a position of...

286
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of, uh, of strength.

287
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They have the strength...

288
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to believe they can do anything,

289
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}no matter how crazy, or, uh...

290
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you okay?

291
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Let's try something. - Okay.

292
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do me out here.

293
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I shoot everyone in my studio. - Oh, come on.

294
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I'm not everyone, am I?

295
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Clearly not.

296
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, Jeff. Shoot me.

297
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on.

298
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shoot me.

299
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Don't do that. - What?

300
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That phony music video crap.

301
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on.

302
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just be yourself.

303
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just be open.

304
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Weren't you just listening to me? - Come on, Jeff.

305
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sit down. - Shoot me.

306
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at me.

307
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Be honest.

308
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you listen to me? Just sit down.

309
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Jeff, I don't... - Sit down.

310
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- J-Jeff, I don't... - Sit down!

311
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you okay?

312
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't feel so good.

313
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you... Did you call me?

314
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry. I was just looking through your medicine cabinet.

315
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, boring! No Valley of the Dolls stuff at all.

316
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't help but wondering why all the lubricants though.

317
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, hey, just... Tell me when you're ready.

318
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take your time.

319
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What did you...

320
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What di... - You remember what I said

321
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}about not drinking anything you didn't mix yourself?

322
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's good advice for everyone.

323
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what? I'm sorry you were drugged for so long.

324
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've never really done that before and I swiped this from my dad.

325
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Didn't come with directions and it's not like I could just ask him

326
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}how much to use.

327
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I probably used too much

328
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or those screwdrivers could have affected my judgment, you think?

329
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's real water.

330
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Scout's honor.

331
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wha...

332
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why do I get... tied up first

333
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}if this is how we're gonna play?

334
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff...

335
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}play time is over.

336
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now it's time to wake up.

337
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This isn't funny.

338
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is this some... teenage joke?

339
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Teenage."

340
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes.

341
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Joke?

342
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

343
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Now let me... - Patience.

344
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Let me go. Let me go! - Patience.

345
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Let me go! - Patience.

346
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just checking out the side of the house, okay?

347
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I saw this cop show once. It was great.

348
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the killer, he thought he had cleaned up all the evidence

349
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but some of the victim's blood was on his shirt

350
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and, yeah, sure, he washed it,

351
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but some of the dried up blood got caught in the lint trap, so...

352
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean...

353
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anything in here I should know about?

354
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck are you doing?

355
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's kind of been my question, Jeff.

356
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck are you doing,

357
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}living in a house filled with pictures

358
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of half-naked teenage girls?

359
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, none of whom you've ever done it with...

360
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help! Help!

361
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help! He...

362
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There is really no point in me taking any risks, Jeff.

363
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Technically, I could let you scream your fucking brains out

364
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and no one is going to hear you.

365
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I waited till today because Mr. Coughlin is at work,

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and the Kraskows... they're vacationing in Santa Barbara.

367
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Still, I can't have some pedestrian just happening by as you're screaming,

368
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:44,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so shut up, or next time it's gonna be bleach, okay?

369
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've been stalking me?

370
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

371
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Let's get this straight.

372
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have been stalking me.

373
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. I went into other chat rooms, with different nicknames.

374
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You would get to know each woman...

375
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and then as soon as you found out they were any bit older than me

376
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you would just drop them like that.

377
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You took your time sniffing out someone my age.

378
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't talk to the others because they were boring.

379
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You and I connected. - Oh, right.

380
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. You think I faked all that?

381
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, actually it's kind of funny.

382
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because every time I would mention some obscure singer or band

383
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you knew so much about them.

384
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But not right away.

385
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was, like, a few minutes later.

386
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe to give you enough time to look them up on the web?

387
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff...

388
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you used the same phrases about Goldfrapp

389
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}as they do on Amazon. Com.

390
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Busted.

391
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}By the way,

392
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I fucking hate... Goldfrapp.

393
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on.

394
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wanted to impress you.

395
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not the first guy to do something stupid to impress a girl.

396
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does that deserve being tied up and tortured?

397
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Torture?

398
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is this torture to you?

399
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess you've never read anything by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch

400
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because this...

401
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is nothing.

402
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course you're not the first guy to lie to a girl, Jeff.

403
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The operative word there being "girl."

404
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, you know how old I am.

405
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What makes a kid who's barely past her first period worth all this research?

406
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, you really got to start to wonder

407
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}when a grown man goes through all this trouble

408
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}just to charm a girl.

409
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow. There's that word again.

410
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Girl."

411
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, maybe it's this whole camera thing?

412
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cameras... computers.

413
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They let you hide, don't they?

414
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So safe.

415
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I heard how your voice changed when the camera came between us.

416
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My voice changed because I felt sick

417
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because you drugged me.

418
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, you were drugged, all right.

419
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the drug was sweet

420
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}little 14-year-old flesh.

421
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look...

422
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.

423
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go ahead. Call these models. They'll tell you.

424
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course they will.

425
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not an idiot, Jeff.

426
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't piss where you live.

427
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those girls were your work and I, on the other hand was...

428
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}your play.

429
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You were coming on to me. - Come on.

430
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's what they always say.

431
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Who? - Who?

432
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The pedophiles!

433
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"She was so sexy. She was asking for it."

434
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"She was only technically a girl. She acted like a woman."

435
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just so easy to blame a kid, isn't it?

436
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just because a girl knows how to imitate a woman

437
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}does not mean she's ready to do what a woman does.

438
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, you're the grown-up here.

439
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If a kid is experimenting

440
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and says something flirtatious, you ignore it.

441
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't encourage it.

442
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If a kid says, "Hey, let's make screwdrivers,"

443
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you take the alcohol away and you don't race them to the next drink!

444
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, look.

445
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've been Ionely, okay?

446
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That makes me stupid but I am not a pedophile.

447
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I am not Ionely. - This is some horrible mistake.

448
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And not stupid. - Untie me. We'll forget this whole thing.

449
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just untie me now!

450
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I might be a little peeved. So when I am ready,

451
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll call a cab and call another one to let you loose.

452
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- When will that be? - I'm not sure yet.

453
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't...

454
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can save yourself so much time

455
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}by just dropping that word from your vocabulary.

456
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna do what I want, Jeff.

457
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}See, a guy as smooth at seducing adolescents as you are

458
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and takes those photographs...

459
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just figure he has something around that he doesn't want seen,

460
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and when I find that,

461
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}then maybe I'll know what I'm dealing with.

462
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What you're dealing with?

463
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, what kind of pedophile are you?

464
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just a voyeur?

465
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Again, not a pedophile.

466
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. You're a photographer.

467
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Takes a genius to get paid for what you'd be happy to do for free.

468
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go into the living room.

469
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look in the grey cabinet. Pull out the third drawer down.

470
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll see prints of my work for all kinds of environmental groups.

471
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've done shots of the Yukon Territory,

472
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the Utah wilderness,

473
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Inuit villages in Alaska...

474
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So what?

475
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You love nature, thus you must be a nice guy?

476
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm saying my modeling shots are just part of my portfolio.

477
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've shot a lot of different subjects,

478
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}some of it very important work.

479
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it was so important that you thought,

480
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Well, I can't possibly hang it on the walls of my home.

481
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need to plaster my house with pictures of underage nymphs

482
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and just tuck the nature shots away."

483
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So... a voyeur and a conservationist.

484
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not a voyeur!

485
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not just a voyeur.

486
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sometimes you kick it up a notch to molestation.

487
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am not a molester! I've no idea who you've confused me with.

488
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sometimes you molest someone and they fight back

489
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you completely lose control and you hurt them.

490
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have never hurt anyone!

491
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll just see, won't we?

492
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those letters are mine.

493
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing's yours when you invite a teenager into your home.

494
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't love her anymore, huh?

495
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That explains why you save these.

496
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought about selling them on e-Bay.

497
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Excuse me?

498
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry. I couldn't hear you. Maybe it was the music or...

499
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. Maybe it was the bullshit.

500
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Honestly...

501
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Some day I thought about sending them to her,

502
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}reminding her how much of a bitch she was.

503
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A little angry, are we?

504
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She broke your heart and you haven't gotten over it?

505
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You walk into somebody's house, you start looking through their shit...

506
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're gonna find things that embarrasses them.

507
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It doesn't mean anything.

508
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Okay.

509
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Dear Jeff.

510
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have to stop. I can't go where you wanna take me.

511
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're just not the person I thought you were."

512
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't have to read it. I know what it says.

513
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I bet you do. How many times did you read this?

514
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}None of your business.

515
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What kind of person did she find out you were, Jeff?

516
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}None of your business.

517
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That kind of depends on how you define business, actually.

518
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what? Did you find her?

519
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The girl you wanted? Is this what your work is, some big search?

520
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you the type of guy who likes to save his outgoing e-mails?

521
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Read them over and over again, to think about what you said?

522
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is weird.

523
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your download manager says you pulled some photos off the net,

524
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but... I can't find them.

525
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Gosh, that's strange.

526
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. A smart guy doesn't leave photos on his computer.

527
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'Cause that's the first place the cops are gonna look.

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then you're... into mementos.

529
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So where do you put the stuff that you pull off the net, hm?

530
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you have a special little hiding place or something?

531
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I live alone.

532
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why would I need a hiding place?

533
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just what I've been wondering.

534
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have looked through your whole house.

535
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everything...

536
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I have found no porn.

537
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have not found a single bit...

538
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of porn.

539
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guys tend to have porn around don't they?

540
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing against it, nothing against them.

541
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just the way they're brought up.

542
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Seriously, if a guy knows he can get away with it,

543
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}all guys, they have porn at least somewhere in their crib.

544
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You've done studies on this of course. - Then I was thinking...

545
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that these photos on his wall, maybe those are his porn.

546
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I bet they're not your stroke shots.

547
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I bet whatever you have is so...

548
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}juicy,

549
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it needs its own little cubbyhole.

550
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Isn't that right, Jeff?

551
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So what's the combination, Jeff?

552
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Eat me.

553
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at how he's sweating.

554
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does this worry you, Jeff?

555
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna figure it out, so you might as well just tell me.

556
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am an honor student.

557
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take your time.

558
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I will.

559
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Believe me, I've got plenty. - No, not much.

560
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aren't mommy and daddy gonna worry if you're not home before dinner?

561
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm thinking no.

562
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, is that it?

563
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? They're too busy to keep track of you,

564
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so you reach out to somebody who seems like he might care about you?

565
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you're so mad because they ignore you?

566
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They've always made the fuss over your older sister

567
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because she learned to do everything first?

568
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're furious with them,

569
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but they do love you

570
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they pay for your existence,

571
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but you can't let them see any of that anger.

572
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm not angry at them. - No, no. Absolutely not.

573
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That'd be too dangerous.

574
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you are angry,

575
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you gotta let it out somehow.

576
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you find a guy... an older guy...

577
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe he reminds you a little of your dad.

578
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me guess. I look like him?

579
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't look anything like him.

580
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you say so.

581
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you gotta let that anger out somehow.

582
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And I seem like a good target... - Will you shut up?

583
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Seriously, just shut up!

584
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know nothing about me.

585
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:02,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, you're right. So sit down and tell me.

586
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll talk.

587
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah, right. - We can sit on the sofa.

588
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I'll call a taxi for you.

589
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you want, I'll hold you.

590
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you don't want, I'll keep my distance.

591
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can let it all out. If you need to cry, if you need to scream.

592
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever you need, Hayley.

593
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wouldn't be mad at me?

594
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want you to look at what you're doing.

595
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just wanna ask, um...

596
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you... Did you seriously think that that was gonna work?

597
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're good at what you do, Jeff.

598
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What you do is work with teenage girls, put them at ease

599
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so they can trust you with all their secrets.

600
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, that's not what I was doing.

601
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Janelle's birthday.

602
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Janelle's phone number.

603
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Janelle's phone number backwards.

604
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're an honor student.

605
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Try every possible combination of numbers.

606
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Should only take you the rest of the week,

607
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}if you figure in breaks for meals.

608
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or l...

609
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or I could just try March 19th.

610
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}March 19th. First with Janelle.

611
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's this, Jeff? You are lensman319 after all.

612
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was this the first photo session or the first time you banged her?

613
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or was that the same thing?

614
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hm. What year would that have been?

615
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}3-19-87?

616
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nope.

617
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}3-19-89?

618
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How sentimental you are.

619
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's so special about these photos?

620
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is what they make those federal laws for, Jeff.

621
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is officially sick.

622
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What makes this girl so special?

623
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why does she get to keep her clothes on?

624
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I recognize this girl.

625
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hayley?

626
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are you?

627
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, fuck!

628
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Welcome back.

629
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry to expose you like this.

630
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not about sex, although I have to admit...

631
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you are built.

632
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never touched you.

633
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was trying to hold you off me

634
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}while I called the cops.

635
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you have shown them this?

636
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why do you have a picture of Donna Mauer in your safe?

637
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And have you seen her, because no one else has.

638
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I did meet Donna for coffee.

639
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I took a shot of her to make her happy.

640
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So how happy did you make her?

641
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at her. She's fully dressed.

642
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can see the coffee shop behind her.

643
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never brought her home.

644
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, what? You just said,

645
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"See you later, kid. It's been fun."

646
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could have thrown this away.

647
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You didn't.

648
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You needed to hang on to it.

649
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could have talked to the police.

650
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You're right. - Yeah.

651
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or maybe you had something to hide,

652
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like the extensive kiddy porn collect...

653
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look. I'm not the monster you think I am.

654
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But okay, I... crossed a line.

655
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just call the cops. I'll turn myself in.

656
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A cute pedophile pleads guilty.

657
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"But, oh, it's not his fault.

658
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's sick. He has an addiction."

659
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll do jail. Isn't that what should happen?

660
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, you might. You might get jail time.

661
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know... Therapy, drugs,

662
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}group discussions, notifying people when you move into a new house.

663
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- How bad is that, really? - It'll ruin my career, my life.

664
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Didn't Roman Polanski just win an Oscar?

665
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So why the ice?

666
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I read the psych profile about the person who took Donna Mauer.

667
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Said he's a Ioner.

668
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thinks he's pretty damn bright and as powerful as a teenage girl.

669
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's gonna strike again. Kind of sounds a lot like you.

670
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not me!

671
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe not, but...

672
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those photos that I found

673
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and the way you let me get drunk...

674
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're a headline waiting to happen.

675
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everybody will be safer if I do a little preventive maintenance.

676
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What the fuck are you doing? - I have to shave you down here.

677
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't have any hair on the incision site, right?

678
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

679
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've been going in my dad's medical library at school

680
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and, um, well, you said I was pretty bright, right?

681
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think I'm smart enough to perform a successful castration.

682
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No!

683
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Please. - No! Ow!

684
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, okay. I guess you're not numb enough yet.

685
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What should we talk about while we're waiting?

686
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Dear Janelle. My name is Hayley Stark.

687
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope you don't mind me writing you like this.

688
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I met this guy that I think you know... Jeff Kohlver.

689
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's so cute.

690
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, he seems to really like me.

691
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He even asked me over to his place to do some photography,

692
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I am so excited about this

693
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because, well, for a 14 year old like me,

694
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}this could be a huge break, you know?"

695
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And here I put in a little smiley face icon.

696
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Thing is,

697
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I've tried to pretend this isn't the case, but he talks about you a lot,

698
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I have this ooky feeling he's still in love with you.

699
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm pretty sweet on him too,

700
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I don't want to go crazy over him if there's some chance

701
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that you two might get back together.

702
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, so, so, so,

703
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I found your e-mail address in his PDA,

704
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I thought I'd just ask.

705
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is this insane?

706
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Am I insane?

707
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is Jeff?

708
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And this other girl he talks about all the time.

709
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Her name is... Donna Mauer.

710
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you know anything about her?

711
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I found these photos on his computer but, silly me, I can't figure out how to open them,

712
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I'm attaching them to this note.

713
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are they pictures of you or Donna?

714
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anyhoo, thanks a mil.

715
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your complete honesty will be "mucho" appreciated.

716
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Love and peace, Hayley."

717
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I tried to make it sound as innocent and moronic as possible.

718
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you think I did?

719
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fine.

720
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guess I'll just send it and that'll be that.

721
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're getting yourself in terrible trouble.

722
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, and how's that?

723
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you cut me in any way, you won't forget it.

724
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It changes you when you hurt somebody.

725
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you speak from experience, I guess.

726
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've just lived.

727
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Unlike you.

728
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The things you do wrong...

729
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They haunt you.

730
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tell me what you're haunted by.

731
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wanna remember this day when you're with a guy on a date?

732
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or on your wedding night?

733
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'Cause I promise you, you will.

734
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't do that to yourself.

735
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow.

736
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, that is so thoughtful.

737
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are speaking to me so selflessly.

738
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:37,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, you just don't want me to castrate you for my own benefit?

739
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow, I'm touched.

740
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff.

741
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't we imagine someone saying the same thing to you

742
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}at a random moment?

743
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Imagine that, when you downloaded this little girl...

744
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was sitting by your side saying, "Stop. Don't do that to yourself."

745
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you have listened?

746
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop.

747
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't do that to yourself.

748
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop.

749
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't do that to yourself.

750
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop.

751
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop.

752
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are good and numb, aren't you?

753
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck off.

754
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your conversational skills are really deteriorating as the day goes on.

755
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:02,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Seriously. It turns out that castration is the easiest surgical procedure around,

756
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and thousands of farm boys across the country guild their own livestock.

757
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I figure, if they can do it, then I can pull it off, if you know what I mean.

758
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not fucking livestock.

759
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You keep telling yourself that, stud.

760
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help!

761
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help!

762
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, that wasn't necessary.

763
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You bitch.

764
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No more wiggling.

765
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does your mother know you cut off men's balls?

766
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've never done it before today, but...

767
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I'll tell her when I get home,

768
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}see what she says.

769
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Hayley, I knew you needed a science fair project, but really..."

770
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you and your mom are both whacked.

771
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. That's that whole nature versus nurture question, isn't it?

772
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was I born a cute, vindictive little bitch or...

773
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}did society make me that way?

774
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I go back and forth on that.

775
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be done in a sec. I'm almost done.

776
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's money in the safe.

777
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- So? - So you could take it.

778
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take the camera equipment. Take whatever you want!

779
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am.

780
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You really can't talk me out of this by bribing me, okay?

781
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How... How can I?

782
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? Talk me out of it?

783
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. I haven't thought about that.

784
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what? I need to sterilize this before we start.

785
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you want me to use the vodka,

786
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or do you have another alcohol you wanna offer me?

787
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

788
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, all that scraping I did...

789
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The blood probably rushed back in. I have to numb you out a bit more, okay?

790
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be right back.

791
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I call someone for you? Is that what you...

792
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you're getting bored.

793
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I'm sorry. We gotta get this show on the road.

794
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, it's actually really impressive.

795
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought it would be fun to see how far you could get,

796
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I really only expected, like, an inch or two.

797
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's not bad.

798
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't you just kill me?

799
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that what you think I want?

800
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Isn't it?

801
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Close.

802
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I love that you have all this stuff

803
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because, like, this way you can watch, you know?

804
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now I'm hurt.

805
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I go through all the trouble to set this up and you don't want to watch?

806
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just...

807
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I stayed one summer with my Aunt Denise and her kids.

808
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, and her kids were, like four or five,

809
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I was, like, ten.

810
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. No, I was nine.

811
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the littlest one... the daughter, Lynnie...

812
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She... she loved me.

813
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So she had this... she had this game

814
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}where she would jump out of the bathtub, all soaking wet...

815
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and she'd jump on top of me

816
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and she'd tickle me.

817
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And she'd tickle me and she'd shout:

818
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Prune attack! Prune attack!"

819
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'Cause her fingers were all pruney.

820
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}L-l-I couldn't do anything 'cause I was afraid I'd hurt her

821
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it was weird.

822
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And one day her mother came in, in the middle of it...

823
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and she saw her daughter, naked on top of me.

824
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then... she yelled at her:

825
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:19,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Lynnie, get back in the bathtub."

826
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then she took me by the hand...

827
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and she dragged me to the kitchen.

828
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She turned the stove on.

829
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We stood there while the burner got hot.

830
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And she pulled my pants down...

831
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and lifted me up over the burner.

832
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could feel the dirt on my skin from her hands.

833
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She must have been gardening.

834
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I cried and cried.

835
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:09,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I could hear the tears sizzle as they hit the burner.

836
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then she sat me down.

837
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She said, " If I ever catch you with my daughter again..."

838
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She called my mom.

839
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My mom came the next day.

840
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never saw Aunt Denise again.

841
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}These things really stick.

842
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, well, you know, we're set.

843
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't.

844
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I told you not to use that word.

845
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay?

846
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hayley, please.

847
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You need help.

848
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A teenage girl doesn't do this.

849
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've seen your idea of what a teenage girl should do,

850
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so don't even start.

851
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll pay for a therapist.

852
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks.

853
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks, but if I ever see a shrink...

854
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I want to make my case... - Please.

855
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really, really interesting for them.

856
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please. I'll do whatever you want.

857
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could call the cops. I'll say I did whatever you want.

858
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't think they're gonna believe a confession under these circumstances.

859
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then I'll leave. I'll leave, okay? I'll move.

860
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mm-hmm.

861
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Donna's body will still be where you left it.

862
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:37,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not the guy!

863
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not the guy, I swear!

864
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anything! Please!

865
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please don't do this!

866
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Anything? - Anything! Piss on me!

867
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fucking feed me glass! I don't care! Whatever you want!

868
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll tell the cops I did whatever you want. Please!

869
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't what ever you want. Anything. Please.

870
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please. Anything.

871
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anything. Anything.

872
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please.

873
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Anything. - Yes.

874
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, anything.

875
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, please.

876
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please!

877
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When I talked about sending an email to Janelle, you changed the subject.

878
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:40,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could send it right now, pack up and go.

879
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It could be the best thing that ever happened to you.

880
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could stop torturing yourself with the idea that you might get back with her.

881
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What do you say? - Goddamn it! Get the fuck off of me!

882
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please untie me and let me go!

883
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please! Please don't cut me!

884
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please! Please!

885
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please!

886
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I shouldn't have teased you like that.

887
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I shouldn't have let you think there was a way out of this.

888
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, um...

889
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got this medical text,

890
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and if I forget anything just don't panic.

891
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, 'cause it's... It's right here.

892
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I knew you'd want to watch.

893
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, if you move too much, I could...

894
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}knick the perineal artery and you...

895
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could, like, bleed to death before anyone got here, okay?

896
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, just, please. I really need to have

897
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}a steady, steady hand, okay?

898
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff?

899
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you feel that?

900
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why do you care?

901
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd be thankful for small favors.

902
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow.

903
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That went well.

904
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, you told that, uh...

905
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that Aunt Denise story very well.

906
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Very, very well.

907
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that supposed to be? Some kind of magic key

908
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to explain why you are the way you are?

909
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Doesn't.

910
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. What should I do first? Your right or left testicle?

911
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't we just say right, okay?

912
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, now, I just have to give it one little slice to free it up,

913
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and then, um...

914
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Snip.

915
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay. Now I just need to suture it up.

916
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This would be so much easier if I had, like, a nurse or something,

917
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but, you know, I asked my friend if she'd help me castrate a guy

918
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and, well, she made all these, like, ooky sounds,

919
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like I was asking her to swallow worms or something.

920
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, we'll see who makes medical school in eight years, huh?

921
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, now, you're gonna feel a tug,

922
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause I really gotta get this tight, all right?

923
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So just... bear with me.

924
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay...

925
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

926
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, halfway through. Over the hump.

927
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't you stop?

928
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please?

929
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Some men,

930
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}they go through their whole lives with only one ball,

931
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they're just fine, you know?

932
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or so I've read.

933
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I guess I figured that you're not really punished if I leave you with a spare.

934
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

935
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's okay. It's okay, Jeff.

936
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If-if I left one, then you'd be walking around crooked all the time.

937
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, this is for the best, all right?

938
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay, you're entering a whole new world now.

939
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just gotta...

940
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}snip and...

941
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

942
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow.

943
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This seriously has to be, like,

944
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}one of the easiest operations, because...

945
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wow.

946
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wonder why they teach Girl Scouts things like camping

947
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and selling cookies.

948
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know? 'Cause this is what's really useful.

949
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know how they'd design a merit badge though.

950
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That'd be interesting.

951
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I saw Lynnie at Aunt Denise's funeral.

952
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I told her what her mom did.

953
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She didn't believe me.

954
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If Denise was here right now, what would you say?

955
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd say, " Help.

956
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A teenager cut my balls off. Call the police."

957
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:25,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She wasn't very sympathetic the last time,

958
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so I wouldn't really hold your breath.

959
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

960
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I would cancel any appointments you have in the next few days

961
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}because you're going to be sorer than you've ever been before.

962
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I'd say, in, like,

963
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}eight or nine days, take the stitches out,

964
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}which I suggest you do yourself

965
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to save embarrassment.

966
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}EunuchsQuestions. Com Oh, and there's this website: EunuchsQuestions. Com.

967
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Eunuchs is e-u-n-u-c-h-s.

968
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had a lot of trouble with that but it gives great advice

969
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}on how to deal with your castration.

970
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You really... You don't have to go through this alone, you know?

971
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you want some souvenirs?

972
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No?

973
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

974
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What should we do with them?

975
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We could see how far they bounce.

976
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Actually...

977
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}we wouldn't want, like, a little animal

978
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}confusing it for an afternoon snack.

979
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know? A little squirrelly

980
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or a coyote might get sick.

981
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We don't want that, especially with you being such a conservationist.

982
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We could grind them up in the garbage disposal.

983
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or... or we could sew them back in.

984
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had this shop teacher once,

985
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who sawed off his thumb in class,

986
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and then he grabbed some ice,

987
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}drove to the emergency room.

988
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The next day, sure enough, he has his thumb.

989
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Didn't bend so well, but he could, like, hitchhike and stuff.

990
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just checking to see if it works.

991
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess they, uh, weren't brass.

992
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not laughing, are you?

993
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, no wonder. This isn't a laughing matter at all.

994
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. Maybe Donna's smiling just a tad.

995
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't do anything to her.

996
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:13,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe, maybe not.

997
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I suggest you track down the guy who did...

998
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause he has no idea what's waiting for him.

999
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:22,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here.

1000
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You really need to rehydrate.

1001
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:27,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff. Please. Come on.

1002
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff, I'm serious.

1003
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You really, really need to drink this, okay?

1004
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on.

1005
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Attaboy.

1006
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you want more?

1007
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why are you being so nice to me now?

1008
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're pitiful now, aren't you?

1009
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:06,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, it's going to be tricky, not letting anyone find out about...

1010
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No more sex.

1011
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No more taking public showers.

1012
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But one of these days you're going to get a physical,

1013
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and your doctor's going to find out.

1014
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And don't worry. He's not gonna tell his golf buddies...

1015
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they're not gonna tell their friends,

1016
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and they're not gonna tell their friends.

1017
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But a couple years down the road you're going to start wondering,

1018
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Do your publishers know?"

1019
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Do your models know?"

1020
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Does Janelle know?"

1021
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}God, I'm sweating.

1022
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I'll go take a shower

1023
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and then I'll be out of your life, okay?

1024
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll find you.

1025
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:58,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't make threats while you're still tied down.

1026
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm just saying... - What do you expect me to do about it?

1027
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just saying.

1028
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The easiest thing for me to do

1029
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}would be to just kill you.

1030
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I already told you I'm not going to do that.

1031
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't get off that easy, Jeff.

1032
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sweating like a pig. Seriously.

1033
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Um... I gotta go have a shower,

1034
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and then when I come back later, maybe we can chat some more.

1035
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm all here.

1036
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm all here.

1037
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why you can see it with your very own eyes.

1038
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. Come on.

1039
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

1040
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Trace.

1041
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I'm gonna be done, like, so much sooner than I thought,

1042
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so do you wanna catch a movie or something?

1043
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cool.

1044
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I'm not telling you.

1045
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, this is Lieutenant Hayley, L.A.P.D.

1046
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're acquainted with a photographer, one Jeffrey Kohlver?

1047
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, there's been an incident here.

1048
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is it possible that you can assist us?

1049
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not at liberty to discuss that at this moment, ma'am,

1050
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but it's a very delicate matter and the sooner we can speak with you here,

1051
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the better chance we have of keeping it out of the newspapers.

1052
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We appreciate that.

1053
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The address...

1054
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes.

1055
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, that's the place.

1056
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How soon do you think we can be here?

1057
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Steady.

1058
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stand straight.

1059
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Attaboy.

1060
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You're insane. - Right.

1061
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Which I did tell you when we first met, remember?

1062
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Four out of five doctors agree..."

1063
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:19,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I should ask my therapist.

1064
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}See what she thinks about it.

1065
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ask her much it would cost to get a padded cell...

1066
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help!

1067
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shut up.

1068
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hi.

1069
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:38,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, hello. Is Mr. Kohlver here?

1070
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Um, he's asleep. Not feeling so well.

1071
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it's food poisoning.

1072
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:44,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry to hear that.

1073
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you...

1074
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm his niece.

1075
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, really?

1076
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I ask you something?

1077
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Okay.

1078
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:58,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I might be a little out of line here.

1079
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you babysit?

1080
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, yeah. I do. I do.

1081
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:08,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I'm only here for, like, a couple more days.

1082
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's too bad.

1083
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm on a constant patrol for new babysitters.

1084
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right.

1085
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are those...

1086
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. Mr. Kohlver's cookies.

1087
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My daughter's a Girl Scout and we've been trying to deliver these,

1088
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but we've always been missing him, so here they are, yummy stuff.

1089
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks.

1090
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:30,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Uncle Jeff loves his Girl Scouts, so...

1091
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You should probably... - What?

1092
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, pay me.

1093
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. Yeah. I'm sorry. How much is it?

1094
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Six. - Six.

1095
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can you just wait here for a second?

1096
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No problem. Sure.

1097
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here you go.

1098
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did I hear something?

1099
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The food poisoning. He's... vomiting and...

1100
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so sorry.

1101
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Your cookies. - Thanks.

1102
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And if you're going to be around any longer,

1103
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just... I'm three houses down, across.

1104
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can always, always, always use a new sitter.

1105
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I wish I could, but... - Yeah, me too.

1106
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well...

1107
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So how's the roof?

1108
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry?

1109
01:22:34,370 --> 01:22:35,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You were on the roof.

1110
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was.

1111
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just a little while ago I was trimming my roses and looked up

1112
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:46,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I saw you there and I was wondering who it was.

1113
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ah, yeah, we... There's, uh...

1114
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We had a leak and I...

1115
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}thought I'd go up and check.

1116
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your uncle made you go up on the roof?

1117
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well...

1118
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}he's sick

1119
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I said I'd go and see if there's, like...

1120
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- A hole or... - Right.

1121
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did it rain?

1122
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have to go back to my uncle.

1123
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, sure. No problem.

1124
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just tell him Judy Tokuda said hello.

1125
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You bet. - Okay?

1126
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks.

1127
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:30,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well... it's "yummy stuff."

1128
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A leak? That's all you could come up with? Pathetic.

1129
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't piss me off right now, Uncle Jeff.

1130
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, she'll be back.

1131
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She thinks you're flakey.

1132
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You might need help... putting it fucking mildly.

1133
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When you got loose...

1134
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}did you call the police, did you run for help, like an innocent person would?

1135
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I did call. - Oh, yeah?

1136
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't we just press redial and see?

1137
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Face it, Jeff.

1138
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You could have gotten away and you didn't.

1139
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:13,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now it's so easy.

1140
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I leave you here,

1141
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}someone will find you...

1142
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}along with the photo of Donna

1143
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and the confession that I typed on your computer.

1144
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or...

1145
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have a special time, limited offer.

1146
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You step off that chair, you end it all,

1147
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I destroy all the evidence.

1148
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No one will ever know why you killed yourself,

1149
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}not even Janelle.

1150
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't kill Donna Mauer.

1151
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We've been over this. - Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg.

1152
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You mean you're not going to beg again?

1153
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because you do it so well.

1154
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please.

1155
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, pretty please, with a cherry on top.

1156
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}One that you just had to pop.

1157
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll leave a clue.

1158
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've messed up once already,

1159
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}more than once.

1160
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mrs. Tokuda's made you.

1161
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's figured you out.

1162
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They'll find you.

1163
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- They might. - No. They will.

1164
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll spend the rest of your life lookin' over your shoulder.

1165
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Waking up, in the middle of the night,

1166
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}jumping at every noise.

1167
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How hard do you think they're going to look for me, really?

1168
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, they find a pedophile killer, all gift wrapped for them.

1169
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you think they're going to care who did the work?

1170
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you think they're even gonna bring it up?

1171
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:49,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I will have the biggest legal defense you ever saw.

1172
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:53,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If everyone who's ever molested sends me $5,

1173
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}oh, come on, I'll be able to afford

1174
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,280

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Two years of community service?

1177
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jody Foster directs the movie version of the whole thing.

1178

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who do you want to play you?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've spent too much time only to walk away.

1184

{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know you're not gonna leave.

01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you for helping me see it.

1202
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What took you so long?

1203
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You dropped this. - I had to.

1204
01:29:57,410 --> 01:29:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah? - You would have been down there forever.

1205
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Were you jerkin' off?

1206
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Which do you wanna fuck first, me or the knife?

1207
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You know how to use that? - Honor student, remember?

1208
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing I can't do when I put my mind to it.

1209
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toss the knife in the backyard!

1210
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why?

1211
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or you'll shoot again? Go on, shoot me.

1212
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not gonna shoot me!

1213
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not me you have to worry about. It's Janelle.

1214
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I called her.

1215
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:32,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Told her I was Lieutenant Hayley from the L.A.P.D.

1216
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How far does she live, Jeff?

1217
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look over there.

1218
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look over there!

1219
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The deal's still open.

1220
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You put the noose around your neck, you end this whole game.

1221
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I will still clean up all the evidence. You're running out of time!

1222
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or we can wait for her.

1223
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll pull off my clothes,

1224
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I will run into her arms.

1225
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? Unless I hang myself?

1226
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll find you. I'll track you down!

1227
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Assuming you knew anything about me.

1228
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Calabasas girl who's dad teaches at UCW shouldn't be that hard to find.

1229
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You believed all that, huh?

1230
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who are you?

1231
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's hard to say for sure.

1232
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe not a Calabasas girl.

1233
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe not the daughter of a med school professor.

1234
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Maybe not even a friend of Donna Mauer. - Maybe not even named Hayley.

1235
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who the hell are you?

1236
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am every little girl you ever watched...

1237
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}touched, hurt,

1238
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:00,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}screwed, killed.

1239
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- She's gonna find it, Jeff. - No.

1240
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's gonna find it all. Put on the noose and jump and I'll stop it.

1241
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She'll never find out.

1242
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:31,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She'll just think you were some sad man

1243
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who she never should have left.

1244
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff?

1245
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bad things...

1246
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fucking awful things will happen to you in prison.

1247
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is the only way. You'll wish you'd killed yourself when you had the chance.

1248
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the only way, Jeff.

1249
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff!

1250
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't kill her.

1251
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just watched.

1252
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wanted to take pictures...

1253
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but he wouldn't let me.

1254
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was me and another guy.

1255
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't do it. I swear.

1256
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll tell you the name,

1257
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I'll help you find him.

1258
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll help you find him.

1259
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know his name.

1260
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:57,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know his name, Jeff.

1261
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what's funny?

1262
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff?

1263
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aaron told me you did it before he killed himself.

1264
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was him. It wasn't me.

1265
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jeff.

1266
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord2\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't care.

1267
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:38,140
