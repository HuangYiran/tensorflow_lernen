1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,540
THEN

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,160
Now,Dean!Go!

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,840
What else do you remember?

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,250
Nothing.I was a kid,all right?

6
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,130
- And most important...
- Watch out for Sammy.

7
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,360
Watching out for you...
it's kinda who I am.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,820
I got this brother,right?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,490
And he's always telling me how
he's gonna watch out for me.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,060
Now eat your dinner.

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,760
Don't forget your vegetables.

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,380
Don't you dare think that there is
anything that I would put in front of you!

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,820
Sammy's hurt.He's hurt real bad.

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,730
I heal Sam while healing myself.

15
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,040
Every time I use my power,it weakens me.

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,050
You went through the trials.

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,400
I just think it's better if you took it
easy,you know,and didn't act like you were...

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,660
Possessed by an angel.

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,900
NOW

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,540
Wait up!

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,970
Hurry!He's right behind us.

22
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,230
H*****

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,540
Come on,come on!

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,340
Hurry!

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,820
Go,go,go... it's open!

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,580
Come on,guys.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,030
The barn is a no-fly zone
during hide-and-go-seek.

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,000
Boys?

29
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,500
Come on,you delinquents.

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,220
Time for bed!

31
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,870
All right!Game is over,boys!

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,170
Let's bring it in!

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,800
Lights out was 10 minutes ago!

34
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,360
You little bastards.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,260
Okay,I'm gonna...

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,230
You got till the count of 10,and you'd
better come out or the belt's coming off!

37
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,400
1...

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,940
Come on!

39
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,900
Boys?

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,340
Come on!

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,650
This isn't funny.

Kevin?

48
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,260
Hello?

49
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,690
- I'm sorry,there's no,uh... there's
no Dee-dawg,uh...- I got it.I got it.

50
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,660
Sonny,hey.So,what's up?

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,720
Okay.

52
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,890
All right.Yeah,just sit tight.I'll
be there as soon as I can.

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,730
Yeah.

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,270
So,what was that all about,Dee-dawg?

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,660
You remember when we were kids
that spring in upstate New York?

56
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,180
Dad was on a rugaru hunt.We,uh...
we crashed at the,uh...

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,040
the bungalow colony
with the ping-pong table.

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,900
Yeah.Uh,y-you disappeared.

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,990
Dad came back.You were gone.

60
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,640
He shipped me off to Bobby's for a
couple months and went and found you.

61
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,000
You were lost on a hunt or something.

62
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,100
That's what we told you.Right.

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm sorry.That's what you told me?

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,540
Truth is,um...I lost the food money
that dad left for us in a card game.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,320
I knew you'd get hungry,

66
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,760
so I tried taking the five-finger discount
at the local market and got busted.

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,510
I wasn't on a hunt.They
sent me to a boys' home.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,120
- A boys' home,like a reform school?
- Yeah,more or less.

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,580
It was a farm,and the guy who ran it...
Sonny... he,uh... you know,he looked after me.

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,830
Wait.Does Sonny know what we do?

71
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,860
Yeah.He's good people.

72
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,420
I gave him the number to the bat phone,and
sounds like he's got something in our wheelhouse.

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,880
So...Hey,you gonna be cool to
do this,or are you too tired?

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,300
Uh,no.Yeah,I'm just,uh...I'll be fine.

75
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,430
And everybody's okay with
heading out to the Catskills?

76
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,740
I am everybody.

77
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,350
Yeah.Right.All right.Grab
your stuff,and we'll head out.

78
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,790
Hey,Dean...I mean,why didn't you
just tell me you went to a boys' home?

79
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't know.Uh,it was dad's idea.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,220
And then it just... you
know,the story became the story.

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,950
I was 16.

82
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,550
S*****

83
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,210
You were here for two months
and dad couldn't find you?

84
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,620
Oh,no.He found me.He found me quick.

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,550
But he left me here
'cause I lost our money.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,620
You were 16.You made a mistake.

87
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,450
Yeah.I made the mistake.

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,020
Look,I know how you think.None
of this was dad's fault.

89
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,920
What can I do for you boys?

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm Dean.This is my brother,Sam.

91
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,830
We're old buddies of Sonny's.

92
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,940
Prison buddies?

93
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,830
No.Uh,you mind telling
him that we're here?

94
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,250
I'll go get him.

95
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,370
I just mopped this floor,so you
take off those roach stompers.

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,830
Sonny's an ex-con,huh?

97
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,900
What,and we're such angels?Trust
me,he's more than made up for it.

98
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,790
Steven Hewlett caught him red-handed
...stealing up at his store.

99
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,040
So,what did he take?

100
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,080
Get this... peanut butter and bread.

101
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,150
Okay.And how about family?

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,620
Well,his old man called.

103
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,530
Once he found out what happened,he
said let him rot in jail.

104
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,510
Judge is off on a fishing trip.The
boy's too young to leave in county.

105
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,350
So we thought it best he
stay here till arraignment.

106
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,620
I don't see why not,man.

107
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,940
Appreciate it,Sonny.

108
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,830
Where'd you get the shiner?

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,410
You think that's funny?

110
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,200
I think you're slow.

111
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,650
- You sucker punched me!
- You wish!

112
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,780
Come on,now!Billy,I got this,buddy.

113
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,400
It's all right.

114
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,590
You shouldn't do that,kid.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah?Why?Because he's a cop?

116
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,680
Because when you make him
mad,he leaves with the key.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,440
Eh,don't sweat it.

118
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,330
Deputy do that?

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
What,your old man?

120
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,750
Well,then,how'd you get it?

121
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,460
Werewolf.

122
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,570
Okay.

123
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,300
So,how do you know I
won't just run away?

124
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,210
- Because you're hungry.
- No,I'm not.

125
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,160
Well,then,why'd you steal
bread and peanut butter?

126
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,390
So,what is this place,anyway?

127
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,790
It's for boys like you.

128
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,090
You work the land.

129
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,250
Teaches you some discipline
and responsibility.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,940
Keeps you out of trouble.

131
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,210
That's lame.

132
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,430
Beats jail.

133
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,730
Come on.I'll fix you something to eat.

134
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,680
Dee-dawg!

135
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,170
- Sonny,good to see you.
- Hey,you,too,brother.

136
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,570
Oh,and this must be Sam.

137
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,940
- Good to meet you.
- Back at you,brother.

138
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,080
So,farm looks,uh,nice.

139
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,040
Oh,please,man.It's barely standing.

140
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,480
- Only got a handful of kids working around here now.
- Why's that?

141
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,250
Because these days,the system would
rather incarcerate a boy than redeem him.

142
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,770
Hey,Sonny,uh,y-you
mind if we talk alone?

143
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,860
Hey,Ruth,would you,uh,please
go check on the boys,

144
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,850
make sure their morning
chores are getting done?

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,640
All right.So,what's happening?

146
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,860
Well,you remember Jack,don't you?

147
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,620
Yeah.The,uh,tough,old leatherneck.

148
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,570
Well,somehow,that ancient,rusty,

149
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,910
broken-down tractor just roared to
life and ran him over the other night.

150
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,620
Maybe... maybe it just,uh,slipped
out of park or something.

151
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,090
Couldn't have.

152
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,240
You know,I never... I never believed any
of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into,

153
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,810
but...something ain't right.

154
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,730
What do you mean?

155
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,220
Well,just things started happening...
you know,lights flickering on and off,

156
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,390
strange scratching sounds coming from
inside the walls,windows and doors slamming.

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,890
All right.You think you can round up
the boys while we take a look around?

158
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,720
Well,that shouldn't be a problem.

159
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,220
Most are home on break... well,except
those with no home worth going to.

160
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,740
All right.Why don't you take the
house?I'll check out the barn.

161
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,790
Yeah.

162
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,180
k***

163
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,480
DA**

164
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,860
D***

165
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,550
I am so sorry.I-I-I thought
I...saw something in,uh...

166
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,630
Like a ghost?

167
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,720
Sonny told me you were old friends,but
I know why you're really here.

168
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,570
That's why I was praying for us.

169
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,650
Praying for what?

170
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,880
For the ghost that
haunts this farm to leave.

171
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,180
All right,Casper...

172
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,510
Where are you at?

173
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,810
Hello?

174
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,830
Anybody here?

175
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,880
Hey,kid,what are you
doing in here by yourself?

176
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,890
Fighting monsters.

177
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,540
What kind of monsters?

178
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,040
All sorts with Bruce
the monster smasher.

179
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,270
Is that a cape?

180
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,390
Little impractical for
smashing monsters,huh?

181
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,100
You know,you could choke.

182
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,080
I clobber evil!

183
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,940
I bet you do.

184
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,930
I'm Dean.

185
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
Timmy.

186
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,080
Let's try that again.

187
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,580
If you're gonna be a man,you got
to learn how to shake like one,okay?

188
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,700
So give me your best Kung Fu grip.

189
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,520
Good.Now look me straight in the
eye.Let me know that you mean business.

190
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,820
Shake as hard as you can.

191
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,450
That's it.

192
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,540
You shake like that,you'll be all right.

193
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,660
Hey,Timmy,did you know
Jack who worked here?

194
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,250
What can you tell me about him?

195
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,410
He yelled a lot.

196
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
He was yelling when he had his accident.

197
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,780
How do you know that?

198
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,030
'Cause me and the other boys were
playing here when it happened.

199
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,210
Did you see anything?

200
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,150
Is there anything else about that night
that you can remember,anything at all?

201
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,280
It suddenly got really cold.

202
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,930
Can I go?I have to finish my
chores before Ms.Ruth gets mad.

203
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,190
That Ruth... she runs a tight ship,huh?

204
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,690
Yeah,you better roll.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,100
I grew up in this town.

206
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,940
I used to come up here as a little girl.

207
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,880
The Wasserlaufs,Howard and Doreen...
they used to own this farm back then.

208
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:11,660
My co-worker,Jack,may he rest in
peace,he worked here as a farmhand.

209
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,420
Howard was a nice man,but...

210
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,510
Well,he'd get into that corn liquor.

211
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,500
And one night he got it
into his thick skull that

212
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,050
Jack and his wife,Doreen,were
rolling around in the hay.

213
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,380
It wasn't true,but... but Howard's
paranoia got the better of him.

214
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,760
He tried to kill them both.

215
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,580
Jack got away,but Doreen...

216
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,390
He killed her?

217
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,750
With a meat cleaver.

218
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,920
Got life in jail...

219
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,980
which for Howard ended a year ago.

220
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,320
He always swore he'd get his
revenge on poor,old Jack,and...

221
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,510
looks like he finally got it.

222
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
Is Howard buried here in town?

223
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,450
So Dad didn't want you to tell me.

224
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,410
How come?

225
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,930
Was this place really so bad?

226
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,240
I don't really remember.

227
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,390
I mean,look,nobody bad touched me.

228
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,990
Nobody burned me with their smokes
or beat me with a metal hanger.

229
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,540
I call that a win.

230
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,520
All right.Let's barbecue old MacDonald
here,get the hell out of Dodge.

231
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,490
Help! Help!

232
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,750
Ruth,you okay?

233
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,030
What's wrong?

234
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,880
Open up!

235
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,260
Ruth!

236
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,580
Ave Maria Ave Maria That's okay.

237
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,030
Dean,you know I'm fine just grabbing
a burger to go somewhere,right?

238
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,740
What,and miss out on the best
banana pancakes you ever had?

239
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,010
Thanks.

240
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,220
No problem.I do this for all the boys
after they've been here for a month.

241
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,620
I meant for getting the
charges against me dropped.

242
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,840
Well,being hungry's not a crime.

243
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,760
It's the stealing that is.

244
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,010
But I feel if you only do that
once,you don't deserve a record.

245
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,710
And seeing as how we can't find your pops
anywhere,you can stay here as long as you want,Dean.

246
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,190
You're doing good in school.

247
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,170
You're making friends.You
made the wrestling team.

248
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,920
I'm proud of you.

249
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,060
Let me ask you something,and I
want you to be straight with me.

250
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,030
Are you into the whole
heavy-metal,devil-worshiping stuff?

251
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
What?No.

252
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,570
Hey,I'm not... I'm not judging.

253
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,230
It's just I found a few occult-looking
symbols carved into your bedpost.

254
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,680
It's...It's a very long story.

255
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,010
That story have anything to
do with why you put the salt

256
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,620
in front of your bunk door
every night before bed?

257
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,930
Well,it's a family thing,so
I can't really talk about it.

258
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,400
Same family that left you here?

259
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,250
What are you... what are
you,in the mob or something?

260
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,730
More like something.

261
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,330
I was part of this gang,right?

262
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,920
They were my family.

263
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,260
I lived,breathed,I would
have even died for them.

264
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,100
You know where it got me?

265
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,740
15 years in a correctional facility.

266
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,720
And for what?

267
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,940
Being loyal?

268
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,810
To who?

269
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,270
I should have been loyal to myself.

270
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,540
Because you get one shot at this
game,Dean,and when you look in the mirror,

271
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,090
you want the guy looking
back at you to be his own man.

272
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,740
Hey,guys.

273
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,880
-Hey,Robin.How are you?
- I'm good.How are you?

274
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,970
Good.Meet my new ranch
foreman here,Dean.

275
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,610
Welcome to Cus's.What can I get you two?

276
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,410
Bet you never thought
you'd see me here,huh?

277
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,710
Uh,look,I'm a little bit slammed right
now.Do you guys want to hear the specials?

278
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,300
Robin...Dean Winchester.

279
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,350
I used to live up at Sonny's.

280
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,100
Uh,look,sorry.There's just... there's
so many boys that pass through there,

281
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,570
it's... it's hard to remember
every... every name and face.

282
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,980
Yeah.Uh,no.Sorry,I just...

283
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,110
I remember you coming
up there with your mom.

284
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,550
She'd give guitar lessons.

285
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,000
It's,uh... it was a long time ago.

286
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,300
Yeah.Mom... she loved
helping out the boys.

287
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,160
I guess that's why I kept
giving lessons after she passed.

288
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Hey,Robin?

289
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,070
Um,would you excuse
me?I'll be right back.

290
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,820
- Dude...
- Let's go.

291
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,110
- what was that?
- Nothing.

292
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,990
Nothing?Well,obviously it was something.

293
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,820
- Who was that waitress?
- Said it was nothing,all right?Drop it.

294
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,370
Sonny.

295
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,590
What?

296
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,250
I tried to get in to save her,but
the damn door wouldn't open.

297
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,170
Locked?

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,210
There's no locks on the farm.

299
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,150
That means our little field
trip to the cemetery was a bust.

300
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,290
Sonny,is there anything
else weird you can remember?

301
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,080
What,'cause we're not
chest-deep in weird already,boys?

302
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,930
I know,I know.I mean anything... really.

303
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,530
There was one thing.

304
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,450
Ruth always had her rosary beads with
her,but now I can't find them anywhere.

305
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,720
All right.Um,let's start with the
vics,okay?I mean,both lived in the house.

306
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,790
They both,uh,worked
closely with the boys.

307
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,260
All right,why don't I go have a
chat with the rug rats,see what's up?

308
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,660
Yeah.

309
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,960
Sonny,you got any employee
records on the victims?

310
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,080
In my office.

311
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,480
Let's do it.

312
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,920
Come on,whatcha gonna do
about it?You gonna cry?

313
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,630
Timmy,you're such a little weirdo.

314
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,500
- What are you doing?Come here.
- Nothing.

315
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
Timmy,what's going on?

316
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,120
All right,you two.

317
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,520
Where were you this morning
when Ruth had her accident?

318
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,510
Unless you're a cop,we don't
need to tell you anything.

319
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,110
Oh,okay.Well...how about that?

320
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,440
We weren't even here this morning.

321
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,520
Sonny sent us into town to get
some chicken feed... we swear.

322
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,940
What about Ruth?What can
you tell me about her?

323
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,640
Uh,we used to call her the warden.

324
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,680
She was a real
Bible-thumping hard-ass.

325
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,650
Obviously.What else?

326
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,520
Anything different or
weird you can think of?

327
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,780
You mean besides Timmy?

328
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:04,140
Either of you touch him ever again,I'm
gonna go all Guant??namo on you.

329
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,920
Understand me?Get the hell out of here.

330
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,060
Go on!Get.

331
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,250
- You and Bruce okay?
- Yeah.

332
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,490
Listen to me.

333
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,420
Guys like that... they're cowards,okay?

334
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,020
All you got to do is stand up to them
one time and they'll stop,I promise.

335
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,860
Okay.

336
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,650
Sonny,wait.

337
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,050
W-what is all this?

338
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,570
It's our hall of fame.

339
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,850
We had some pretty great athletes come
through here,including your brother.

340
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
He was Sullivan county
135-pound wrestling champion.

341
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,670
Hey,guys!

342
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,760
She could give me a lesson anytime.

343
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,110
Gross.She's like ancient.

344
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,230
What the hell?

345
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,420
What's this doing in here?

346
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,090
Kid's gonna need about 8,000
stitches,but he'll be fine.

347
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,010
That kid was bullying Timmy
before the accident,right?

348
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,110
Yeah.Why?

349
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,190
Check this out.

350
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,250
Timmy was found in an abandoned
building about a year ago all by himself.

351
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,060
No one was sure how
long he had been there.

352
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,570
And what about his parents?

353
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,410
Well,they posted a picture on the
Internet,but no one ever showed up.

354
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,520
Well,then,what's he doing
here?Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?

355
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,050
He kept running away
from Child Services.

356
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,140
So about three months ago,Sonny
offered to take him in.

357
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,110
All right,so hard-ass counselors,bullies
all bite the dust,but Timmy's still standing.

358
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,910
So,what are we talking?We got
ourselves a Damien on our hands?

359
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,800
No.EMF rules out a demon.So...

360
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,320
probably ghost possession.

361
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,320
Meaning what,we find Timmy and shove a fistful
of salt down his throat,forced ejection?

362
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,100
You're taking the barn this time.

363
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,660
- So,you've been a lot of places?
- Yeah.

364
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,170
My,uh...My dad likes
to move around a lot.

365
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,030
What's your dad do?

366
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,010
Boring stuff.

367
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,490
Do you like it?

368
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,780
No,not really.

369
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,700
But my dad expects me to
follow in his footsteps.

370
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,800
So I've kind of gotten used to it.

371
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,980
Yeah.I-I get it.

372
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,390
My pops wants me to take over the
diner,but that's not happening.

373
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,970
So,what do you really want to do?

374
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:39,110
I want to be a photographer and see the
world,go to strange lands,eat crazy food.

375
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,030
I want to be a rock star,but...

376
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,140
I also really like cars.

377
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,690
Being a mechanic seems rough.

378
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,250
What?No,no.Not at all.

379
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,800
Cars are freaking cool as hell.

380
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,950
Fixing them is like a puzzle,and
the best part is when you're done,

381
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,400
they leave,and you're not
responsible for them anymore.

382
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,950
Have you kissed many girls?

383
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,820
What?

384
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,260
Yeah.Of course.

385
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,080
- Lots.
- Really?

386
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,090
Well,I guess we'll just
have to keep practicing.

387
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,170
Uh,what happened to you at the diner?

388
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,400
I turned around to take your
order,and you were just gone.

389
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,010
Long story.

390
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,910
Um,have you seen Timmy?

391
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,770
No,not yet,but he should be here
any minute for his guitar lesson.

392
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,010
Yeah,we're gonna cancel that.

393
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,980
What?

394
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,880
We got to get out of here,okay?

395
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,620
I don't have time to
explain.You just got to trust me.

396
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,090
T-trust you?

397
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,830
And why would I do that again?

398
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,470
You do remember me.

399
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,240
How could I forget?

400
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,490
What's wrong?

401
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,760
I just hope this lasts.

402
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,970
I'm not going anywhere,Robin.

403
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,990
Yeah,says you.

404
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,810
Well,I can't.

405
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,710
Who else would take
you to the school dance?

406
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,830
Is this your way of asking me
to be your date,Dean Winchester?

407
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,910
Yeah.How am I doing so far?

408
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,780
There were... there were
reasons why I had to leave.

409
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
I don't have time to explain
them to you right now.

410
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,340
I got to get you out of here.

411
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,730
What are you doing?

412
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,010
I'm sorry.

413
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,890
Sorry about what,Timmy?

414
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,230
I can't stop it.

415
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,150
Go,go,go!

416
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,430
Sam,go!

417
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,930
- Locked.
- Damn it!

418
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,640
Circle.

419
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,990
Dean,what... what
just happened in there?

420
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,690
Okay,listen to me.Whatever
happens,you stay inside this circle.

421
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,190
Understood?

422
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,560
All right.Dean...

423
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,190
I can't control her.

424
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,030
Can't control who?

425
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,950
Your mom,right?

426
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,380
Timmy,listen.

427
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,510
We need you to tell
us about the fire,okay?

428
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,920
It was late,and we were driving
home when we crashed in the woods.

429
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,990
Everything was on fire.

430
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,660
But she saved me,pushed me out...

431
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,780
Before the car blew up...

432
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,320
With her in it.

433
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,390
But that's not all,was it?

434
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,740
I ran through the woods.

435
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,890
I found an empty building,where I hid.

436
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,340
I was scared.It was dark and cold.

437
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,090
So I cried.I cried for my mom.

438
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,520
And then she came.

439
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,230
But she had changed,right?

440
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,090
I'll bet she gave you that
cool action figure,huh?

441
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,350
Yeah.When I turned 9.

442
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,090
Timmy...

443
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,180
I'm gonna need that action figure.

444
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,170
No!

445
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,110
I clobber evil!

446
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,970
I clobber evil!

447
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,930
I clobber evil!

448
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:36,390
I...clobber...evil!

449
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,150
It looks like it wasn't the action
figure that was anchoring her here,Dean.

450
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,130
Well,then,what is?

451
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,260
Him.

452
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,580
You know what?

453
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,740
I think maybe his mom can't let go and
she's still protecting him from the grave.

454
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,990
Protecting him from what?

455
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,760
What,from us?

456
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,400
Maybe she doesn't know what threats are real
and what's not,so she just attacks all of them.

457
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,000
Great.So,what,unless we waste
the kid,we're sitting ducks?

458
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,000
This is... this is crazy.

459
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,220
Robin.Robin!

460
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,380
Damn it.

461
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,840
Robin,wait!

462
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,870
Who are you?

463
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,760
Right now I'm the only thing
that's keeping you safe.

464
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,790
Timmy,we're gonna need your help,okay?

465
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,430
Listen to me.

466
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,790
I need you to focus,okay?

467
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,060
Look,we are not here to hurt you.

468
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,050
Sammy!

469
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,920
I can't stop her.

470
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,820
Timmy,you have to try!

471
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,950
She came to you when
you cried out for her.

472
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,770
Now you have to tell
her to stop and go away!

473
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,000
She's my mom.

474
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,070
She's a ghost.

475
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,470
Timmy,because she can't move
on,she's going crazy.Okay?

476
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,190
You got to let her go.

477
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,310
You'll be okay.

478
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,930
Listen to me.

479
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,260
Sometimes you got to do what's best for
you,even if it's gonna hurt the ones you love.

480
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,710
Mommy...Stop it.

481
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,330
Timmy,Kung Fu grip!

482
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,690
Mommy,stop it!Stop hurting people!

483
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,590
You have to go.

484
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,950
Never come back.

485
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,140
I'll be okay.I promise.

486
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,600
I love you,too.

487
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,500
So,then,this is the family business?

488
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,810
Told you it was boring.

489
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,010
Yeah,right.

490
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,920
Well,as you can see,I did not
run off to become a rock star.

491
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,530
I don't know about that.

492
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,480
You look pretty rockin'
to me,Dean Winchester.

493
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,850
And what about you?

494
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,350
I mean,I always thought that I would hate
being in the same little town my whole life,

495
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,820
and,you know,taking over the diner
like dad always wanted,but...I don't.

496
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,240
I just... I love it.

497
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,540
I guess we didn't know everything
we thought we did at 16,huh?

498
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,690
Not everything.

499
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,000
Just some things.

500
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,320
Sounds like Timmy's gonna
need some help adjusting.

501
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,900
Yeah,but he's got you.

502
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,320
I always hate to see you go,Dee-dawg.

503
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,540
Can't thank you enough for this one,man.

504
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,890
Sonny,we'll see you around.

505
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,620
You can bet on that,boys.

506
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,690
Take it easy,man.

507
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,500
Hey,h-how did you know Timmy asking
his mom to leave was gonna work?

508
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,600
I didn't.

509
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,360
Total hail Mary.Got lucky.

510
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,540
You just got lucky?

511
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,470
Kind of like you did with this place.

512
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,240
I mean,here I was thinking this
was the worst part of your life,

513
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,700
and it turns out it was the best.

514
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,100
Why'd you ever leave?

515
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,100
Never felt right.

516
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,380
Really?

517
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,860
It was two months,Sam,okay,and I
couldn't wait to get out of here.

518
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
I don't know what to tell you.

519
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,620
It wasn't me.

520
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,320
Oh,look at you.

521
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,490
- You clean up good!
- Thank you.

522
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,730
You know,uh...I've never actually been
to one of these school dances before.

523
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,540
Yeah.

524
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:51,490
Look,about that,Dean,your old man's
outside,and,man,he's really something.

525
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,070
I tried to tell him what a
big night it was for you,Dean,

526
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,760
and ask him if he could come back later,but
he just said to tell you he had a job,

527
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,600
said you'd know what that means.

528
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,100
You know,after I got out of jail,this
place gave me a second chance,

529
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,370
and it's done the same for you,too.

530
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,380
So if you want,I'll stick my neck out
for you,and I'll fight for you to stay.

531
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,390
Sonny...

532
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,600
thank you... for everything.

533
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,760
But I have to go.

534
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,410
Dean...

535
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,650
Thank you.

536
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,880
For what?

537
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,810
For always being
there,for having my back.

538
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,890
Look,I know it always hasn't been easy.

539
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,630
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.
