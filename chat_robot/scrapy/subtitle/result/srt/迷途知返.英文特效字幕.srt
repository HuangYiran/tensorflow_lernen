00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a fair assessment? You're just happy to not do anything?

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, damn, to me that is a three.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One day, we could become a family.

43
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do you say'? Let's try to get that score up. Huh'?

00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:22,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be out on the ledge if it does get any worse than this

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you don't know me at all

56

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it.

57
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, could I get the keys?

58
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

59
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God!

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another night of drinking alone and I was going to kill myself!

61
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

62
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm off the wagon again.

63
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Accept it and move on.

64
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Press my laundry.

65
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, Trent. - How're you doing?

66
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good. I like this.

67
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love your ride. Does the eight track still work?

68
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What this? This is exactly the car my dad used to drive us in.

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old and crappy.

70
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any idea how much I've spent on this car?

71
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is cherry. This is a cherry car.

72
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A car salesman with bad taste.

73
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shocker.

74
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi. I'm Betty. - Hi, Pam.

75
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trent's probably already talked crap about me.

76
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

77
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did, didn't he? It's okay if he has.

78
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he say?

79
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm loving this.

80
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank you.

81
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't pull it off. My hair seems to hate me.

82
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where you're supposed to say, "Your hair's lovely."

83
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it, is. It is lovely.

84
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

85
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like her.

86
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's not to like?

87
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it where you can. I'd be on my back after a line like that.

88
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susanna, Trent's here.

89
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is his new girlfriend, Pam.

90
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Susanna.

91
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, "Hi."

92
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

93
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but don't come down.

94
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stand there, brooding.

95
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

96
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've brought me a man. How thoughtful.

97
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, sailor.

98
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this in all his awkward stage glory?

99
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my son, Duncan.

100
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody lends a hand.

101
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. I was going to name my youngest Duncan,

102
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but my ex-husband thought it was too nerdy.

103
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we went with Peter. Which, personally, I think is worse.

104
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, it suits my son, so...

105
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't worry, you wear the name well.

106
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trent, where's Staph?

107
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been here all of two minutes,

108
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I suppose she's getting ready for the beach.

109
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. She's just like me. Screw cancer.

110
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be an even golden brown. Everywhere.

111
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's back this year. The Gales. The Hutchisons.

112
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Campbells, sans Ben because of the trial.

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insider trading.

114
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Smythes. Oh, and the Keegans, who I'm not talking to.

115
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can if you want to,

116
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but just know that most of us aren't.

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

118
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, do you think you will'? Pam?

119
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I think I will, what?

120
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to the Keegans.

121
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I don't know. I don't even know them.

122
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do if you want to but just know that I'm mad at them.

123
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even want to get into why.

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They called me a See-You-Next-Tuesday.

125
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To my face.

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to love it here! Whoa!

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've only had one.

128
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yee-haw!

129
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how was your winter?

130
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because our year was a challenge.

131
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My niece was raped in October.

132
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God!

133
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Not even food courts are safe

134
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and Bob, that's my ex-husband.

135
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally came out of the closet. Not a shock.

136
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just say that, in bed,

137
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}his favorite view was the back of my head.

138
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My oldest, Charlie, is still into the drugs and psychedelic music.

139
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drugs I get. But, come on,

140
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gary Garcia's dead! Get over it.

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gary?

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do drugs, Declan.

143
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

144
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and Susanna. You saw her. She's a walking mood.

145
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's going through an "I hate my mother" Phase.

146
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taking her father's side, as usual.

147
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

148
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Steph, don't you look so cute.

149
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly the kind of suit

150
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that got me pregnant the first time.

151
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm hoping for.

152
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

153
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kidding!

154
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and Peter. Finally got his surgery to fix his lazy eye.

155
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, ifs even worse.

156
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try to get him to wear an eye patch,

157
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so people don't feel awkward.

158
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:06,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, what are you gonna do?

159
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm outta here.

160
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, why don't you take Duncan with you?

161
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Screw that. I told you I'm not baby-sitting him all summer.

162
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna take Duncan with you, young lady. All right'?

163
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go to the beach, honey? You'll have fun.

164
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just going to be unpacking here.

165
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We might be doing some other stuff, too.

166
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm.

167
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's our cue, kids. Come on.

168
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, listen, lam still having my annual Fourth of July Clambake.

169
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it will bleed into youryard.

170
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay-

171
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bob or no Bob, the party must go on.

172
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's probably sliding off our gardener right now.

173
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's have a fun summer!

174
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan, are you coming or what?

175
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have fun.

176
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just keep your distance.

177
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, just don't die. I don't need that shit hanging over my head.

178
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can absolutely party at my place.

179
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad only gets to see me, like, twice a year,

180
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he totally just wants me to be happy.

181
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly the type of parent I'm going to be.

182
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna do drugs with my kids.

183
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:27,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. I forgot. Willem broke up with Jessica!

184
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

185
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. I don't get her face.

186
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like she fell on it.

187
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! Susanna,

188
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have to get on that this summer.

189
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

190
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chad!

191
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chad!

192
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chad!

193
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

194
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to go in the water!

195
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, go!

196
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, I'm right in the middle of tossing. We talked about this.

197
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. He's being weird.

198
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

199
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ew! What are you staring at, perv?

200
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is that kid from, anyway?

201
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Albany.

202
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He and his mom.

203
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad says they live in a one-bedroom apartment.

204
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tragic.

205
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, right?

206
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, Susanna. We're all swimming!

207
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is her deal?

208
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. She's been like that since we got here.

209
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan. We were just coming to find you

210
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Peter.

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Duncan.

212
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

213
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

214
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stare at the bridge of his nose. That's what I do.

215
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom. Are you shitting me?

216
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wore the patch,

217
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't have to keep telling people that, would I?

218
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan, I thought you and Peter should hang out this summer.

219
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord knows he brought enough of his Star Wars dolls.

220
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're action figures! And they're classics!

221
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

222
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They lose value if I take them out of the box.

223
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we can still have awesome battles with them.

224
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He needs human contact

225
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's having far too many conversations with those dolls.

226
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not!

227
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should we set up a time for you two to get together tomorrow?

228
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um...

229
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should check with my mom.

230
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Okay.

231
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't stand us up. We know where you live!

232
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you. Your eye makes people uncomfortable.

233
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the worst parent.

234
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is your father talking.

235
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he tell you to say that'?

236
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

237
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did?

238
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

239
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's terrible.

240
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:58,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't fight this feelin' anymore

241
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:04,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgotten what I started fightin' for

242
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to bring the ship into the shore

243
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And throw away...

244
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not doing it.

245
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You put it on.

246
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire burns just like me

247
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no.

248
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me. No!

249
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

250
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

251
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carry a laser down the road that I must travel

252
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carry a laser down the darkness of the night

253
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carry a laser...

254
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Whoa! Are you saying, "Carry a laser?"

255
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what it is.

256
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would anybody write a song called, "Carry A Laser?"

257
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they like outer space.

258
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-oh!

259
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just walked into the wrong room, stranger.

260
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

261
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

262
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Duncan, my son.

263
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are Trent's friends, Joan and Kip.

264
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chief, I'm Kip. I'm the one who's not grinding on you right now.

265
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not grinding on him.

266
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you are.

267
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carry a laser down the road that I must travel

268
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make it worse.

269
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, no.

270
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm out of here.

271
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait. I made dinner.

272
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shoot. I have plans.

273
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steph, wait, check out his moves.

274
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoo!

275
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy therapy.

276
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa.

277
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- See you, Dad. - See you.

278
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, we did that

279
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not me. I could barely watch that.

280
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddy, any chance you were on top of my car?

281
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

282
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. 'Cause there was a dent in the roof.

283
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big dent.

284
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It popped out. It's fine.

285
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just wondering if you knew anything about that?

286
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did have bags up there, honey.

287
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's true. We did. Fair enough.

288
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was probably it. Right?

289
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Pam. You need a hand?

290
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Thank you. We've got a system going on here.

291
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! We got a good team here. Right?

292
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good team.

293
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adorable.

294
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you pass me something to eat, sweetie?

295
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can tell you exactly where I was.

296
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Passed out in the dunes.

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's true!

298
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Because, you left me there!

299
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait! Kip wanted to go out on his boat.

300
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said you would be fine by the fire.

301
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's what he said! "Yoo, hoo! You never came back."

302
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we didn't.

303
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came back the next morning.

304
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes! - First thing.

305
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I had to poke her with a stick to wake her.

306
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I once went to this luau-themed party.

307
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. No, please. You were talking...

308
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you go.

309
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell your story, babe.

310
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's dumb.

311
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now you have to tell it.

312
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to this luau and I passed out in the dunes, too.

313
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's basically it.

314
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so funny.

315
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's just a similar thing to...

316
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, totally.

317
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to point out by the way I'm loading up for the third time.

318
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

319
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo.

320
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I apologize for this asshole

321
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}springing us on you at the last minute.

322
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not at all. I'm a caterer.

323
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love cooking for people.

324
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you cater? That makes sense.

325
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of her many talents.

326
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, she has some ideas for fixing up the place.

327
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Are you gonna fix up the Riptide?

328
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just mentioned rearranging.

329
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should. Put your stamp on it.

330
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:12,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not set in my ways.

331
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell that to Christine.

332
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Somebody took my weed."

333
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'm sorry. I have to put my son out of his misery.

334
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're free to go.

335
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey' buddy, take your plate with you.

336
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We clean up after ourselves in this house.

337
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, back to my story.

338
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trent was it last summer that you and I got stuck on our boat?

339
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is because this bastard buys gas three dollars at a time!

340
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susanna, close the screen door!

341
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting eaten alive by mosquitoes!

342
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like the way you're acting, young lady!

343
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't be this way if your dad was here!

344
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

345
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

346
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about that. I didn't...

347
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care.

348
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ifs not like we were using our inside voices.

349
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's cool. That's cool.

350
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you're a big fan of REO Speedwagon?

351
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

352
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't Fight This Feeling?

353
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. My mom must have put that on there.

354
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and you just got to it and thought,

355
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What the hell. I'm going to sing the shit out of it, anyway?"

356
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something like that.

357
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sucks here, huh?

358
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

359
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sucks.

360
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Totally.

361
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It blows.

362
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much.

363
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's tough, yeah.

364
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

365
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It feels like it's going to be a hot summer.

366
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

367
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we were done.

368
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

369
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just thinking about that earlier. The hot thing.

370
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it just came to me again.

371
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Isaid it.

372
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

373
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if anything else comes to you again,

374
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will be inside.

375
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

376
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They drank all the beer.

377
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not looking in the right place.

378
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get mad at me, Peter. I don't know where you're looking!

379
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it! It's gone!

380
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, next time you say, "Look at the seagull,"

381
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you just have to remember to point!

382
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There goes one there now. "Look at the seagull, Mother.

383
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I wanna share it with you. Isn't it pretty?

384
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Look at the fence. Look at me! Look!"

385
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just point.

386
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I go

387
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out the door

388
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:29,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need no more

389
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I stand

390
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got your hand

391
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no need to know

392
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which way to go

393
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's her versus him

394
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's us against them

395
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sink or swim Or you're swallowed

396
00:21:55,848 --> 00:22:00,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bleed till you're bled You feed till you're fed

397
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lead or you're led...

398
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lemonade?

399
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mind standing to the side?

400
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting your reflection in the screen.

401
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

402
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't normally care, but I'm having the game of my life.

403
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on the cherry level.

404
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's the first level.

405
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and I got one man left.

406
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, like I said, ifs the game of my life.

407
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like Pac Man?

408
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

409
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a classic!

410
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not into all the bells and whistles, my man.

411
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much going on.

412
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, my mistake is that I get greedy.

413
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going for all the ghosts and fruits

414
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:55,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}instead of just clearing pellets.

415
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, there's a pattern. Right?

416
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't tell me you're one of those guys.

417
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Takes all the challenge out of it. Anybody can learn a pattern.

418
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owen, we gotta go!

419
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Lunch hour's over.

420
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, so much for the game of my life.

421
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you still have one more man left.

422
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I've yet to see the second board.

423
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gives me something to look forward to.

424
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The board's always the same.

425
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's that. Thank you. Now, I can die.

426
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Get in here.

427
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I...

428
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on.

429
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, listen, it's still my quarter.

430
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, if you end up getting a high score, I don't want to see...

431
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

432
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

433
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to see that up on the screen.

434
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, they only let you use three letters.

435
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

436
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's left to the imagination with you, huh, kid?

437
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh and hey!

438
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No pattern on my quarter. Cut your own path.

439
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are. We were just about to leave without you.

440
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you go off to?

441
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:04,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nowhere.

442
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's leave notes, okay?

443
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mom was worried.

444
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to get your swim trunks on.

445
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kip and Joan have invited us out on their boat.

446
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna be late.

447
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Head's up, buddy.

448
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to wear that.

449
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's gonna be all right without that.

450
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Duncan can't swim.

451
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trent, he's just not a comfortable swimmer.

452
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really think he's gonna be okay without it.

453
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, just wear it. So people don't have to worry about you.

454
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we're inviting ourselves. Accept it and move on.

455
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter does have to stay down below though.

456
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His eye throws off his equilibrium and he will get sick everywhere.

457
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I won't, Mom!

458
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell that to the bucket we have to bring!

459
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, why do I have to wear this'? Nobody else does.

460
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just wants you to be safe.

461
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that snug enough?

462
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? We take our shoes off.

463
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. Sorry.

464
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me this is gonna clear, Trent.

465
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna clear.

466
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My titties need some color.

467
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Basically, he was relentless.

468
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't get me wrong. I was looking.

469
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had been divorced for well over a year.

470
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just took a little persistence on my end.

471
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't sure about you.

472
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I met her when she was catering some Halloween party in Albany.

473
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:26,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I met her when she was catering some Halloween party in Albany.

474
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He went as a sexy cop.

475
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God!

476
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I went as a '70s, badass cop.

477
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he followed me around all night,

478
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}saying that he was there to "Protect and serve" Me.

479
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That about ended it right there for me.

480
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sadly, I would have been working his bag at that point.

481
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, I do remember.

482
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did let me help you pack your van at the end of the night.

483
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, I did. - Yes, you did.

484
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it took three months to get her to go outwith me.

485
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three months?

486
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not know you had that kind of stamina.

487
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She definitely made me work for it.

488
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it was worth it.

489
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There may be hope for you yet.

490
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What finally changed your mind?

491
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said we were already in this together,

492
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I might as well.

493
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been almost a year.

494
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

495
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

496
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys, help yourselves.

497
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you look a little more miserable?

498
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could he be even more of a dick?

499
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. He's making an effort.

500
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants this to work. He wants us to be a family.

501
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he says that, but that's not what he does.

502
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look' I know this isn't easy, but you promised, remember?

503
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd give it a try.

504
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand why I can't just spend the summer with Dad.

505
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you're with me.

506
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, buddy, the cooler's not going to get to the car by itself.

507
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, sweetheart.

508
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want some breakfast?

509
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm good.

510
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look up here

511
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most people can'! Make out the difference

512
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it could be a small change

513

00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool. I got a great idea.

536
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not, I don't know,

537

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}put on some pants.

538
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's being coy.

539
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she digs me. Big time.

540
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a thought. You know what? Scratch it.

541
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like that's professional.

542
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See what I did there?

543
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I manipulated her with my sexual charisma.

544
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

545
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It was clever as shit.

546
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you come down from your apartment

547
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and actually manage this place?

548
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you come on up here and we'll talk about politics?

549
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet ride.

550
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's not mine.

551
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I figured.

552
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right, by the way.

553
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a hot summer.

554
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I just call it like I see it.

555
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just waiting for my dad to call me back.

556
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to be inside because my mom

557
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just stares at me while I'm on the phone.

558
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's all freaked out

559
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I'm gonna want to live with him or whatever.

560
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom's the same way.

561
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you.

562
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, let me know if you have any other observations

563
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on weather patterns.

564
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will do.

565
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll check and see if he's out front.

566
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder where he is.

567
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he'll turn up.

568
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you seen my flip-?ops?

569
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we had a deal about leaving notes.

570
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Checking in.

571
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom and I do.

572
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You worried her. Again.

573
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told her I'd wait up for you.

574
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm here.

575
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Duncan?

576
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not interested in talking to the back of your head.

577
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we're going to make this work,

578
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it is "We,"

579
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then there has to be trust. And respect. Am I right?

580
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that's something we both want.

581
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

582
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go, buddy.

583
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

584
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

585
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you're going to have to take off. I'm getting complaints.

586
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're having too much fun. It's making everyone uncomfortable.

587
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

588
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa.

589
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just kidding.

590
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. That wasn't even my best stuff.

591
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you for real?

592
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you're in complete awe of our picnic table.

593
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is one-of-a-kind

594
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}except for the 200 other ones here that are exactly like it.

595
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there is more park to be seen.

596
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First things first.

597
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As much as I'm a fan of Tuff Skins,

598
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we've got to get you a swimsuit.

599
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, when's the last time you bought jeans?

600
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom buys my jeans.

601
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Always take things literally.

602
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that working out for you'? Does that get you laid?

603
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lewis, hook up my man Duncan here

604

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with one of our finest rentals would you?

605
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.

606
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sexy. Let's try not to impress him all at once. Huh?

607
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That will not be a challenge.

608
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lewis is kind of over this place.

609
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you. I'm not long for here.

610
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I remember that conversation.

611
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 2003, 5, 11, April.

612
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yesterday.

613
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't eat that now. Your dirty mouth's been on it.

614
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Germophobe.

615
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just told you. There are things I want to do.

616
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prove it. Without thinking rattle off three. Go!

617
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See New Mexico. Invent something.

618
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Become a storm chaser.

619
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had me until number three.

620
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you have to go to school for that.

621
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Look. There's a storm." "Where?"

622
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Over there." "Cool."

623
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Let's go get it." "Got it."

624
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He actually is.

625
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been studying meteorology since pre-school.

626
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let the Dahmer glasses fool you.

627
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These don't have any mesh, so you're going commando.

628
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch sitting. Your junk will fall out.

629
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Found that out the hard way at a birthday party.

630
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And like that you're impressed. And grossed out.

631
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye Lewis.

632
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

633
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Water Wizz Waterpark. Built in the summer of '83,

634
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's the last bastion of everything that time period stood for.

635
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, it was decreed by its creator

636
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this place shall never age.

637
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On his deathbed, he said,

638
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I don't want this place re-painted or updated.

639
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I don't even want it brought up to code.

640
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"And the minute someone tries, it needs to be destroyed."

641
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We actually have a nuclear bomb forjust such an occasion.

642
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bought it off the Russians.

643
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Still good with all that?

644
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the Russian thing?

645
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Cold War. It's kind of dated.

646
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, that was a waste of a bit.

647
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

648
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.

649
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Why is this the first I'm hearing of this?

650
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:41,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it, woman!

651
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caitlin, Duncan. Tony, Mary Beth.

652
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Duncan. Also, I need you to reorder more mats.

653
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did it.

654
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finish the work schedule for next week.

655
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did it.

656
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Change all the filters.

657
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done.

658
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm going to check all that stuff, right?

659
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, in that case, I didn't do any of that.

660
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I'm doing it.

661
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called delegation. I read about it in a book about it.

662
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the one you wait for, my man.

663
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

664
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She looked back. She likes me.

665
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Devil's Peak. The largest waterslide in a 50-mile radius.

666
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stretch out the tube, end to end.

667
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}13 football fields.

668
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't Google that for confirmation.

669
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That fact predates technology.

670
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owen, settle a debate for us.

671
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, boys. Duncan, this is Vladimir,

672
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ishmael, and Ming Lee.

673
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those aren't our names!

674
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are the names I'm giving you, Vlady.

675
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are my illegitimate sons. They all have different mothers.

676
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to be a positive influence in their lives.

677
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take them to Little League,

678
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys Club, raising pandas to fight.

679
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, jackass!

680
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cloud fencing, hooker retreats.

681
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neil says that years ago some kid figured out

682
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how to pass someone on the water slide. Is that true?

683
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did!

684
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's physically impossible, Neil!

685
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't catch up to someone and pass them!

686
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, Ming Lee's right. I was here when it happened.

687
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, then how'd he do it?

688
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It happened inside the tube. So, no one really knows.

689
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the kid and the person he passed.

690
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Jesus Christ, our lord. But, he's a little hard to get a hold of.

691
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't return my calls.

692
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wore the same shirt to a party and it got a little weird.

693
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be serious!

694
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't interrupt him, Neil! He's talking!

695
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, what happens in the tube stays in the tube.

696
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just the law of the park.

697
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit. We'll just ask the kid how he did it.

698
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be my guest if you can find him.

699
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last I heard he went into a deep depression.

700
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fame was too much.

701
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He turned to cocaine to escape the limelight.

702
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And eventually, a life of male prostitution.

703
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}0h, no. Wait. There he is.

704
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:22,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got sober. You look good.

705
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good for you!

706
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Screw you, Owen!

707
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, screw you, Owen.

708
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just said that, Neil!

709
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm being supportive!

710
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, that crack-addled male whore was me.

711
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

712
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

713
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you get comedy?

714
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, did he pass him by sliding up the side of the tube?

715
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not telling you.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Pointless news travels fast.

721
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,294

00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan we've got to start having faster conversations.

765
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw your bike in the back.

766

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd help you out but I got my hands on the wheel.

767
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giving you a ride. I think that's enough.

768

00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The car's just the right amount of shitty.

771
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what brought you to the water park?

772
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not many kids head our way when the ocean's their backyard.

773
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I guess there's not much for me at home.

774
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have you been working there?

775
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! The park? I've always been there.

776
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever since I was a small Cambodian child.

777
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, that was after 'Nam. I was in the shit.

778
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I joined the circus to become a clown fighter.

779
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know about 46 ways to kill a clown. I hate clowns.

780
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kidding except for the part where I really do hate them.

781
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice teamwork.

782
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm exhausted.

783
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for the ride.

784
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, thanks for the memories.

785
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Evel Knievel.

786
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're probably busy or not interested,

787
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I need somebody to be a floater at the park.

788
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, do some odd jobs, clean up some vomit.

789
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

790
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Definitely. Awesome. Yeah.

791
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's too much trouble, you totally don't have to, but...

792
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you need someone...

793
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

794
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

795
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:57,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go. Tomorrow. 9:00 a.M.

796
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was that you were with?

797
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a friend.

798
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A friend who drives?

799
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

800
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's his name?

801
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owen.

802
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how do you know him?

803
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, he's just a friend.

804
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A friend with a license?

805
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you should bring him by.

806
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? I'd like to meet him.

807
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

808
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. I'm not done.

809
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't stay out all night and disappear all day.

810
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand me?

811
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could say the same to you.

812
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

813
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to make an appearance at Betty's.

814
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

815
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious.

816
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay!

817
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Susanna! Susanna! We're hanging over here.

818
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Grab a cup, we're playing quarters!

819
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe in a minute.

820
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is empty. And, that's just not right.

821
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Duncan.

822
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should hang outwith Peter.

823
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's playing under one of these tables.

824
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Peter! - What?

825
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

826
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want me to make you a plate of food?

827
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can do it.

828
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be sure to get some clams. They were all my doing this year.

829
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring your food over here and eat with me, okay'?

830
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

831
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlie, don't do your "Dead" Dance so close to the fire!

832
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need my first born bursting into flames at my party.

833
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up, Peter?

834
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:45,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man.

835
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the battle going?

836
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luke and Leia are hooking up.

837
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know they're brother and sister, right?

838
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

839
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

840
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd avoid the clams if I were you.

841
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're one of the many casualties of my father's absence.

842
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

843
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because your mom will see my plate.

844
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your funeral.

845
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Charlie!

846
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like my brother just made another sale.

847
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be right back.

848
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Peter.

849
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

850
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to go chase ghost crabs?

851
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hell, yeah!

852
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan? Any interest?

853
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Sure.

854
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was younger,

855
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my dad used to bring me down here to do this all the time.

856
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd fill my head with all these useless facts about ghost crabs.

857
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, did you know they're omnivorous?

858
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Basically, they eat both animals and vegetables.

859
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom jokes, "Leave it to your dad

860
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:24,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"To be interested in a creature that goes both ways."

861
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, do you want me to keep talking

862
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or are you going to say something eventually?

863
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom doesn't smoke pot.

864
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the power of this place. It's like spring break for adults.

865
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I think really kills my mom.

866
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that my dad left,

867
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that he's got someone and she doesn't.

868
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, is your dad seeing anybody?

869
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she's a lot younger.

870
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Classic.

871
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just getting situated in San Diego.

872
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know? New place.

873
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, he says it's not a great time right now.

874
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm going to go visit him soon

875
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once he gets settled.

876
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's supposed to be awesome out there.

877
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}California. That's cool.

878
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

879
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, where is it you go?

880
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go where?

881
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On your sexy, pink cruiser?

882
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nowhere.

883
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. I see.

884
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:46,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I... I just...

885
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. Let it be yours.

886
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

887
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, good night.

888
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I see.

889
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just not this summer?

890
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:44,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who cares?

891
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're never gonna die.

892
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were gone that whole time

893
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you only brought the marshmallows?

894
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joan has the rest.

895
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't get up!

896
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

897
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let them burn.

898
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I keep asking you.

899
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when do we get new employee T-shirts?

900
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:44,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two years from yesterday.

901
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause this one makes me self-conscious about my body.

902
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You disappoint me, kid.

903
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're late! You planning on making a habit of this?

904
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

905
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fired.

906
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I just...

907
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make a valid point. Welcome back. With benefits.

908
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You waste an exorbitant amount of time. Do you know that?

909
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:03,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suit up.

910
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't look too pumped.

911
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, let's get pumped!

912
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the place where dreams are made

913
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or destroyed

914
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Depends on how you feel about working at a water park

915
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a situation over at Harpoon Lagoon.

916
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it a homicide?

917
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's a homicide.

918
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew this day would come.

919
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna stay here

920
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the booth no one comes to.

921

1025
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this.

1026
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owen, I don't know if that's a good idea.

1027
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if we just turn off the water'? They could get their footing.

1028
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's call that Plan B.

1029
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, I'm not going to lie to you. This is probably going to hurt.

1030
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going to hurt who?

1031
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One.

1032
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

1033
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember you signed a waiver. You can't sue us.

1034
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three!

1035
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

1036
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see!

1037
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! Vladimir. Ishmael, Ming Lee!

1038
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I lost you!

1039
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God you're alive.

1040
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was awesome!

1041
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You survived.

1042
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa. Whoa. We aren't done with this now. Thank you.

1043
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, no! No!

1044
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1045
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Having fun. It's all good. Nobody got hurt.

1046
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not all good! You can't do that.

1047
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the reason that places like this get shut down.

1048
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it me or is she very sexy right now?

1049
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's certainly got my attention.

1050
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're an impressive man.

1051
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be you when I grow up.

1052
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get so tired of this guy. Aren't you tired?

1053
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you sick of yourself?

1054
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of it! I'm sick of who lam around you.

1055
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of having to be this person. I'm not this person.

1056
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just messing around with you.

1057
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1058
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why this doesn't happen.

1059
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just a job now.

1060
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish this wasn't just a job.

1061
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

1062
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's my fault.

1063
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it.

1064
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The soup needs a little longer.

1065
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a 1:30 and a 3:30.

1066
00:59:58,704 --> 00:59:59,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could see one of those.

1067
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's stay in. Do something we can all do together. As a family.

1068
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can see a movie as a family.

1069
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could grab Kip and Joan and make an evening out of it.

1070
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't feel like hanging out with Kip and Joan.

1071
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like hanging outwith all of you.

1072
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1073
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says appropriate for people four to eight.

1074
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we're good.

1075
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What color gingerbread character do you want to be? Trent?

1076
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surprise me.

1077
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to be yellow!

1078
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:49,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look, you can take the shortcut there.

1079
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He can't do that.

1080
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, he can. He crosses the bridge.

1081
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is so stupid.

1082
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're at the shortcut. So, take it.

1083
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,941
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Hold on, hold on. Okay. Here we go.

1084
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:05,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Shortcuts. If your playing piece lands by exact count

1085
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"On the purple space below Gumdrop Pass,

1086
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:10,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Then you can take the shortcut."

1087
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Exact count."

1088
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He picked a card with a blue square

1089
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he has to go to the blue square.

1090
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:16,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think it matters.

1091
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it didn't matter, they wouldn't put it in the directions.

1092
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can fudge the rule.

1093
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're gonna play this way, then, I'm just going like that.

1094
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the way past Molasses Swamp and I win.

1095
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No rules. I win the game.

1096
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. We'll play the way you're supposed to play.

1097
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan, move back to your correct place.

1098
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we just play by the rules?

1099
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then everybody's gonna be happy. Okay?

1100
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already did.

1101
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

1102
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, take my turn. I'm going to set the table for lunch.

1103
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Wait. You have to do it.

1104
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan can move for me.

1105
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You're the one who wanted to play. So play your turn.

1106
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Purple.

1107
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's two.

1108
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:12,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to move two purple squares.

1109
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:15,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

1110
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

1111
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've landed by exact count, at the shortcut

1112
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so, I am going to take the Gumdrop Mountain Pass.

1113
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? You're way ahead now.

1114
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Candy Land, Trent.

1115
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your turn, Steph.

1116
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fucking Candy Land!

1117
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1118
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:04,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here? It's your day off.

1119
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figured it rained yesterday, so I thought I could make it up.

1120
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you?

1121
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:17,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought I'd open the place up. See what all the fuss is about.

1122
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your shirt's inside out.

1123
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, how sexy does authority look on me?

1124
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You love it.

1125
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you thought you'd just open up?

1126
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What're you? Some kind of wise guy?

1127
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still your superior. A cup of coffee in my hand.

1128
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two minutes.

1129
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1130
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't sell coffee. Burn!

1131
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we do.

1132
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says you.

1133
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And by the way, we put the chairs in rows.

1134
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that.

1135
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a ten-step process.

1136
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, this is where you run off to?

1137
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1138
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,733
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1139
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I followed you earlier. Then went and got my stuff.

1140
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to "Let it be yours?"

1141
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I held out as long as I could.

1142
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's on. Wow.

1143
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:25,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's way on.

1144
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1145
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does your mom know that you work here?

1146
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1147
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice.

1148
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:35,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Report to the Administrative Offices International.

1149
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan, please report

1150
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the Administrative Offices international.

1151
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to have to announce it over the PA

1152
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as my voice won'! Carry that far.

1153
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My throat suffered major damage

1154
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}during an intense make-out session with Lewis'mom.

1155
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She has a forked tongue and a touch of the herpes.

1156
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have a mom. I have two dads. In your face.

1157
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on a second.

1158
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Hurry up. This is pressing, pressing. Urgent.

1159
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you how pressing. You can't fathom how pressing.

1160
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it going? What's up? Did you need something?

1161
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:04,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1162
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that, big guy?

1163
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:08,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a girl.

1164
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stallion, you.

1165
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. She's older than me.

1166
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what are you doing over here talking to us

1167
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not over there, sealing the deal with that cougar?

1168
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:25,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe, Roddy, if you guys hadn't called me over here.

1169
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Return to your lady friend.

1170
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan, please return to your lady friend.

1171
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:33,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please let her know

1172
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that this conversation was entirely about her.

1173
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In other news, this is very awkward for you.

1174
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Water Wizz Waterpark. It was built in the summer of '83.

1175
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The creator never wanted the place to change.

1176
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, on his deathbed, he says,

1177
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I don't want this place to be up to date or repaired.

1178
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I don't even want it brought up to code.

1179
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The minute someone tries, it needs to be destroyed."

1180
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh. I didn't get thatjoke quite as fast.

1181
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Pop 'n Lock.

1182
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:03,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you?

1183
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it.

1184
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks a lot for ditching me, bitch.

1185
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't aware we had plans.

1186
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't aware that you two had plans.

1187
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1188
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. I have got a ton of stuff going on in my life right now.

1189
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:59,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, it would have been nice to have a friend.

1190
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner's almost ready.

1191
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

1192
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you.

1193
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No use in waiting. Let's eat.

1194
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's Chad, Staph?

1195
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We broke up.

1196
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh...

1197
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1198
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to say? Pam?

1199
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1200
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It got late. I didn't call 'cause I didn't want to wake you up.

1201
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me.

1202
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1203
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's something I should know.

1204
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:54,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was with Kip on his boat all day. We lost track of the time.

1205
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make me feel crazy. I've been through this before.

1206
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Just stop.

1207
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. Okay? I'm right here.

1208
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always have been.

1209
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in this together. Remember?

1210
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning.

1211
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you're hungry. I've already made too many pancakes.

1212
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where was he?

1213
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was with Kip. But he's here now.

1214
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, buddy.

1215
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey. We don't say good morning?

1216
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome home.

1217
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about this spread, huh?

1218
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did Joan find the time to order take-out?

1219
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:08,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if there's one thing that travels really well, it's fried food.

1220
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:11,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must get Joan's recipe for Big Daddy's menu.

1221
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Touch.

1222
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Is everyone having a good time?

1223
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you got your food. Mm-hmm.

1224
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pam, I don't know what I was thinking.

1225
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have had you cater the party.

1226
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least this way, you'll have lots of leftovers.

1227
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New look?

1228
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just have...

1229
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always do this.

1230
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Ramsey, you have been avoiding me all night.

1231
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not having it. Not tonight.

1232
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

1233
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out on the dance floor. Come on. You know you want to.

1234
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look so glum, everybody.

1235
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I'll be back.

1236
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joan found herself a victim, huh?

1237
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kip, I expect to be inviting myself on your boat again.

1238
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when should I plan on doing that?

1239
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would like nothing more than to get you on my boat in a bikini.

1240
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:06,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the motor's out.

1241
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1242
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the motors out and its' been out for a week.

1243
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's gonna be another week until I get the parts.

1244
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that doesn't fit my schedule.

1245
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:16,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

1246
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just...

1247
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much more do you need?

1248
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do something, Mom!

1249
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what's happening.

1250
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's sleeping with her. Do something about it!

1251
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:32,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1252
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's it! Walk away!

1253
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's easier!

1254
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's right in front of your face, Mom!

1255
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go of me! I'm not talking to you.

1256
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm talking to you.

1257
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go screw her, asshole! You already have!

1258
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's certainly not going to do anything about it. Are you, Mom?

1259
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what you're talking about.

1260
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody knows what I'm talking about!

1261
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:51,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1262
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both of you! Stop it! Duncan!

1263
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine!

1264
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to do anything about it'? It's your life.

1265
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not mine.

1266
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to be with Dad!

1267
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1268
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father? Good luck with that.

1269
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Trent, don't

1270
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't want you, kid.

1271
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that true?

1272
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan...

1273
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you it sucks here.

1274
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talked to my dad today.

1275
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told him that we had chased ghost crabs.

1276
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It made him very happy.

1277
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I felt like he was here.

1278
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Did you tell him about the eyes, Susanna?

1279
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You've got to tell him about their eyes!"

1280
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gets so excited.

1281
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, their eyes can rotate 360 degrees.

1282
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can see everything that's around them.

1283
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:39,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they can't look straight up.

1284
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which makes it easy for birds to attack them.

1285
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:46,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So they have to gather their food at night for safety.

1286
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. My dad finds it cool.

1287
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a dork.

1288
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

1289
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1290
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1291
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it didn't mean anything.

1292
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:27,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a mistake. A stupid mistake.

1293
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! I'm such an asshole!

1294
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pam. Listen.

1295
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You deserve better. I know that.

1296
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to be better.

1297
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to be better.

1298
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna be better for you.

1299
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for Duncan.

1300
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's up? Where are you going?

1301
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, Peter.

1302
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan?

1303
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take me with you.

1304
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1305
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:01,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please! - No.

1306
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1307
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll scream.

1308
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it.

1309
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, you could just use the gate.

1310
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everybody, be cool.

1311
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our boss is here with his pirate friend.

1312
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, yeah. I could use a cleansing ale.

1313
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or check them out from afar.

1314
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had a beer before.

1315
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've spent a night in jail before.

1316
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's a limit to everything.

1317
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's your friend?

1318
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter.

1319
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice eye patch.

1320
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

1321
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't sound too cool with it.

1322
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom makes me wear it. She says my eye confuses people.

1323
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well now you gotta show me.

1324
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:24,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha, ha!

1325
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that thing! She wants you to hide that?

1326
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she insane?

1327
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd kill to have that eye.

1328
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're full of shit.

1329
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:33,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously. You know how many bits I could do with that?

1330
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:35,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daring people to look me straight in the eye?

1331
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That thing is awesome.

1332
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mind if I mingle?

1333
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. But keep your hands in your pockets.

1334
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look a little shady to me.

1335
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll circle back.

1336
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a lot of confidence.

1337
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:51,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man. What's up?

1338
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're having a party?

1339
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:56,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we're having a farewell for Lewis.

1340
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's serious this time.

1341
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you want to talk to me?

1342
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just wanted to hang out.

1343
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1344
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about we say you hang out for a little bit? Okay?

1345
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure you'll be wanted at home at some point. You're a popular guy.

1346
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owen, you shouldn't have.

1347
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to three different places in the water park to find that.

1348
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can use it to catch thunderclouds.

1349
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:48,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn the music down.

1350
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to hear a few parting words from our guest of honor.

1351
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

1352
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - No, thank you.

1353
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to open myself up to some bit.

1354
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to be part of a tradition?

1355
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no bit here. We're going to miss you.

1356
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plain and simple.

1357
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna have to sit for this.

1358
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You don't know where this has been.

1359
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um...

1360
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:21,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I won't say that I won't miss some aspects of this place.

1361
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't completely void of decent times.

1362
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember a couple of clays that were almost memorable.

1363
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:36,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess if there's one thing I will miss dearly, it's...

1364
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}oh, my God!

1365
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell, man?

1366
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:42,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's part of our tradition.

1367
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of warped tradition is that?

1368
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lewis was pouring his heart out!

1369
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was going to say people. I'll miss the people.

1370
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God! Not you, Roddy!

1371
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously! My doctor said not to get water on my face!

1372
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God!

1373
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing that could make this worse

1374
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is if there were more squirt guns.

1375
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there are!

1376
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember sitting in class

1377
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Waiting for the bell to ring

1378
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:21,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause on the playground That's where I was king

1379
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I jumped up real quick

1380
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:26,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to be the first in line

1381
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:31,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause the sun is out And you know I'm feeling fine

1382
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:34,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the bell will ring

1383
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna sing about it

1384
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

1386
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's recess

1387

01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That better be water.

1393
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a fun night.

1394

1398
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was a little frustrated.

1399
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:52,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just planned on being here one summer, and now it's three years.

1400
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It had a lot to do with you.

1401
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't want to look back and regret

1402
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:03,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that it should have only been one summer.

1403

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't

1405
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do sell coffee.

1406
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said you could hang out for a little bit

1407
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but sunrise of the next day is where I have to draw the line.

1408
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:50,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta go home.

1409
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I could stay here forever.

1410
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to love the winters. They're pretty spectacular.

1411
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Painting houses until it gets too cold,

1412
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bar backing at some dive, talking to inanimate objects.

1413
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:03,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious.

1414

1416
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't settle.

1417
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:14,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet.

1418
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have anywhere else to go.

1419

01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet that's not true.

1421
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:26,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the only place I'm happy.

1422
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

1423
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate him.

1424
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

1425
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trent. My mom's boyfriend.

1426
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said I was a three.

1427
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:46,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He asked me what I thought I was on a scale from one to ten.

1428
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called me a three.

1429
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who says that to somebody?

1430
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:54,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody who doesn't know you.

1431
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:58,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't want to have to answer! I shouldn't have to answer!

1432
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me. That's about him, man. That's all about him.

1433
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got nothing to do with you.

1434
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:05,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? How do you know?

1435
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:11,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause I know. Okay? Don't worry about how I know.

1436
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:14,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad was the same way.

1437
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I don't like patterns and rules.

1438
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's why you can't buy into that shit.

1439
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta go your own way.

1440
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:28,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, my friend, are going your own way.

1441
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:48,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, they're home!

1442
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:49,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you.

1443
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the hell have you been all night, young man!

1444
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:55,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now, woman.

1445
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say to me?

1446
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk when I get up. All right?

1447
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you talking to, buddy? Don't you walk away from me!

1448
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:05,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pam, he's here.

1449
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:07,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's your eye patch?

1450
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lost it!

1451
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:18,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were worried about you, buddy.

1452
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen. Let's just forget about last night. All right?

1453
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start over. A clean slate.

1454
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sound good to you, buddy?

1455
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hope you're happy now.

1456
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

1457
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're leaving. I need you to get your stuff.

1458
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:44,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, I'm sorry.

1459
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

1460
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me too.

1461
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:56,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, why do you and I have to go? The summers not over.

1462
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:57,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Duncan.

1463
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can stay somewhere else. I don't understand.

1464
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want to leave early, so that's what we're doing!

1465
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:04,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we're going with them?

1466
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't expect you to understand.

1467
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're 14.

1468
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, I know that means you think you know everything, but...

1469
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do things.

1470
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do things to

1471
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}protect ourselves. Because we're...

1472
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're scared.

1473
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're leaving with them.

1474
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. We are good to go.

1475
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1476
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you are great.

1477
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are.

1478
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I guess. We're leaving.

1479
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good bye.

1480
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just surprised me, that's all.

1481
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you staring at, perv?

1482
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:28,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'd laugh and dance like fools

1483
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:34,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they only knew

1484

1486
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:50,774

01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:56,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let 'em eat if they want to

01:27:59,074 --> 01:28:05,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let my soul now rest in peace

01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I know the one who holds the truth

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they only knew

01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:25,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That life ain't dance like fools

01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:21,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came to say goodbye. Come on.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm doing it, Hot Rod. I'm gonna pass him.
