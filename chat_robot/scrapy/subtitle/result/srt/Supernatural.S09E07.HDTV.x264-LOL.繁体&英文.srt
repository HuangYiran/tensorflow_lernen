00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,300
你好像出去獵魔走丟了
You were lost on a hunt or something.

72

我根本沒去獵魔  他們送我去了個男童院

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,730
你怎么知道我不會跑
So, how do you know I won't just run away?

143
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,640
因為你餓了
Because you're hungry.

144
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,580
才不呢
No, I'm not.

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,510
那你為什么偷花生醬和面包
Well, then, why'd you steal bread and peanut butter?

146
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,470
這是什么地方啊
So, what is this place, anyway?

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,490
專門為你這樣的男孩準備的
It's for boys like you.

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,560
你去種地
You work the land.

149
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,740
我教你服從紀律  承擔責任
Teaches you some discipline and responsibility.

150
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,150
讓你不去惹麻煩
Keeps you out of trouble.

151
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,260
真無聊
That's lame.

152
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,420
總比監獄強
Beats jail.

153
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,040
來吧  我給你弄點吃的
Come on. I'll fix you something to eat.

154
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,830
D狗
Dee-dawg!

155
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,340
-桑尼  見到你真好  -你也是啊  伙計
- Sonny, good to see you. - Hey, you, too, brother.

156
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,220
-這一定是薩姆了  -見到你很榮幸
- Oh, and this must be Sam. - Good to meet you.

157
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,430
我也是  伙計
Back at you, brother.

158
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,340
農場看起來不錯嘛
So, farm looks, uh, nice.

159
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,270
得了吧  都要經營不下去了
Oh, please, man. It's barely standing.

160
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,920
-現在就不幾個孩子在這兒干活兒了  -為什么
- Only got a handful of kids working around here now. - Why's that?

161
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,580
因為如今  司法系統
Because these days, the system 

162
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,750
寧可讓孩子去坐牢而不是改過
would rather incarcerate a boy than redeem him.

163
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,990
桑尼  我們能單獨談嗎
Hey, Sonny, uh, y-you mind if we talk alone?

164
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,350
露絲  你去看看孩子們  好嗎
Hey, Ruth, would you, uh, please go check on the boys,

165
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,180
確認他們在做早上的雜活兒了
make sure their morning chores are getting done?

166
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,900
好了  怎么回事
All right. So, what's happening?

167
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,100
你還記得杰克吧
Well, you remember Jack, don't you?

168
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,810
那個老海軍陸戰隊員硬漢
Yeah. The, uh, tough, old leatherneck.

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,600
不知怎么  那個又老又破  銹跡斑斑的拖拉機
Well, somehow, that ancient, rusty, broken-down tractor

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,230
前天晚上突然啟動把他壓死了
just roared to life and ran him over the other night.

171
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,900
或許就是意外
Maybe -- maybe it just, uh, slipped out of park or something.

172
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,700
不可能
Couldn't have.

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,300
要知道我一直不相信你們干的那些鬼鬼神神的事
You know, I never -- I never believed any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into,

174
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,000
但這事有些蹊蹺
but... something ain't right.

175
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,000
什么意思
What do you mean?

176
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,980
出了一些事
Well, just things started happening --

177
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,530
燈忽明忽暗
You know, lights flickering on and off,

178
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,320
墻里有奇怪的抓撓聲
strange scratching sounds coming from inside the walls,

179
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,840
窗和門突然關上
windows and doors slamming. 

180
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
好了  你能把孩子們召集起來嗎
All right. You think you can round up the boys 

181
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,980
我們要到處看看
while we take a look around?

182
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,070
沒問題  大部分都回家休假了
Well, that shouldn't be a problem. Most are home on break --

183
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,550
除了一些無家可回的孩子
Well, except those with no home worth going to.

184
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,550
你查房子
All right. Why don't you take the house?

185
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,880
我去查谷倉
I'll check out the barn.

186
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,220
好
Yeah.

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,640
{\an8}迪恩·溫

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,580
抱歉
Hey. I am so sorry.

189
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,660
我以為我看到了什么
I-I-I thought I... saw something in, uh --

190
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,920
鬼嗎
Like a ghost?

191
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,120
桑尼告訴我你們是老朋友
Sonny told me you were old friends,

192
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
但我知道你們是來干什么的
but I know why you're really here.

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,960
所以我在為我們祈禱
That's why I was praying for us.

194
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,930
祈禱什么
Praying for what?

195
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,330
祈禱在農場陰魂不散的鬼離開
For the ghost that haunts this farm to leave.

196
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,360
好吧  鬼馬小精靈
All right, Casper...

197
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,480
你在哪呢
Where are you at?

198
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,630
有人嗎
Hello?

199
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,880
這兒有人嗎
Anybody here?

200
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,300
孩子  你怎么自己在這兒
Hey, kid, what are you doing in here by yourself?

201
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,410
打怪獸
Fighting monsters.

202
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,780
什么樣的怪獸
What kind of monsters?

203
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,250
各種怪獸  我跟怪獸粉碎者布魯斯一起打他們
All sorts with Bruce the monster smasher.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,110
他還穿斗篷啊
Hmm. Is that a cape?

205
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,560
這對打怪獸有點不太現實吧
Little impractical for smashing monsters, huh?

206
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,430
或許會卡住呢
You know, you could choke.

207
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,480
我打敗邪惡
I clobber evil!

208
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,040
那是當然
I bet you do.

209
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,580
我是迪恩
I'm Dean.

210
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,670
蒂米
Timmy.

211
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,260
我們再來一次
Let's try that again.

212
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,030
如果你想做個男人
If you're gonna be a man,

213
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
就得像大男人那樣握手
you got to learn how to shake like one, okay?

214
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,410
拿出你最好的握手來
So give me your best kung fu grip.

215
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,290
很好  直視我的眼睛
Good. Now look me straight in the eye.

216
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,850
讓我知道你不是鬧著玩的
Let me know that you mean business.

217
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,720
用力搖一下  這就對了
Shake as hard as you can. That's it.

218
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
這樣握手就挺好
You shake like that, you'll be all right.

219
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,010
蒂米  你知道在這兒工作的杰克嗎
Hey, Timmy, did you know Jack who worked here?

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,670
能跟我說說他嗎
What can you tell me about him?

221
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,620
他老是吼
He yelled a lot.

222
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,260
他出事的時候就在吼
He was yelling when he had his accident.

223
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,640
你怎么知道的
How do you know that?

224
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,300
因為事發的時候我和其他男孩在這兒玩
'cause me and the other boys were playing here when it happened.

225
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,590
你們看到什么了嗎
Did you see anything?

226
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,810
關于那晚的事
Is there anything else about that night

227
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,450
你還記得什么嗎
that you can remember, anything at all?

228
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,630
周圍突然變冷了
It suddenly got really cold.

229
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,560
我能走了嗎
Can I go?

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
我得去干活兒了  否則露絲小姐要生氣的
I have to finish my chores before Ms. Ruth gets mad.

231
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,610
露絲挺嚴厲的  是吧
That Ruth -- she runs a tight ship, huh?

232
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,040
是啊  你快去吧
Yeah, you better roll.

233
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,440
我是在這兒長大的
I grew up in this town.

234
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,140
我小時候經常來這兒
I used to come up here as a little girl.

235
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,540
霍華德和多琳·瓦瑟勞夫
The Wasserlaufs, Howard and Doreen --

236
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,640
當時農場是他們的
they used to own this farm back then.

237
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,500
我的同事  杰克  愿他安息
My co-worker, Jack, may he rest in peace,

238
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,780
他在這農場做工
he worked here as a farmhand.

239
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,330
霍華德是個好人
Howard was a nice man, but...

240
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,170
但他有酒癮
Well, he'd get into that corn liquor.

241
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,010
有天晚上  他不知怎么了
And one night he got it into his thick skull

242
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,130
就認定杰克和他妻子多琳在干草垛上做愛
that Jack and his wife, Doreen, were rolling around in the hay.

243
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,500
根本不是那樣的
It wasn't true, but --

244
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,550
但霍華德被妄想左右
But Howard's paranoia got the better of him.

245
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,120
他想殺了他們倆
He tried to kill them both.

246
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,450
杰克逃過一劫  但多琳
Jack got away, but Doreen...

247
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
他殺了她
He killed her?

248
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,050
用一把切肉刀
With a meat cleaver.

249
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,040
判了無期
Got life in jail...

250
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,280
霍華德一年前死了
Which for Howard ended a year ago.

251
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,170
他一直發誓說要報復可憐的老杰克
He always swore he'd get his revenge on poor, old Jack,

252
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,860
看來他終于成功了
and...looks like he finally got it.

253
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,520
霍華德埋在鎮上嗎
Is Howard buried here in town?

254
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,590
那么說
So

255
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,830
是爸爸不想讓你說嗎
dad didn't want you to tell me.

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,300
為什么
How come?

257
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,220
這里就那么糟嗎
Was this place really so bad?

258
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,490
我都不怎么記得了
I don't really remember.

259
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,660
沒人把我怎么樣
I mean, look, nobody bad touched me.

260
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,230
也沒人拿煙頭燒我  或是拿鐵衣架打我
Nobody burned me with their smokes or beat me with a metal hanger.

261
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,260
我覺得這不錯了
I call that a win.

262
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,130
行了  我們趕快燒了這老骨頭
All right. Let's barbecue old MacDonald here,

263
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,370
然后離開這里
get the hell out of dodge.

264
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,320
救命
Help! 

265
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,310
救命
Help!

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,710
露絲  你沒事吧
Ruth, you okay?

267
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,890
怎么了
What's wrong?

268
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,600
開門
Open up!

269
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,830
露絲
Ruth!

270
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,550
迪恩  你知道
Dean, you know I'm fine

271
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,240
我們隨便去哪買個漢堡帶走我就滿足了
just grabbing a burger to go somewhere, right?

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,020
不嘗嘗世上最好吃的香蕉煎薄餅嗎
What, and miss out on the best banana pancakes you ever had?

273
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,150
{\an8}家庭餐館

274
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,960
-謝了  -不客氣
- Thanks. - No problem.

275
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,530
所有孩子在這兒待了一個月我都請他們來吃飯
I do this for all the boys after they've been here for a month.

276
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,260
我是說謝謝你幫我撤銷了對我的指控
I meant for getting the charges against me dropped.

277
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,710
餓不是罪
Well, being hungry's not a crime.

278
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,970
偷東西才是
It's the stealing that is.

279
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,380
我覺得如果你只干過一次
But I feel if you only do that once,

280
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,310
就不該留個案底
you don't deserve a record.

281
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,510
而且既然我們找不到你爸爸
And seeing as how we can't find your pops anywhere,

282
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,870
你想在這兒待多久都行  迪恩
you can stay here as long as you want, Dean.

283
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,270
你在學校的成績不錯  也交了朋友
You're doing good in school. You're making friends.

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
還進了摔跤隊
You made the wrestling team.

285
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,770
我很為你驕傲
I'm proud of you.

286
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,700
我問你
Let me ask you something,

287
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,030
我希望你跟我說實話
And I want you to be straight with me.

288
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,270
你喜歡重金屬魔鬼崇拜什么的嗎
Are you into the whole heavy-metal, devil-worshiping stuff?

289
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,540
什么
What?

290
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,980
當然不啊
No.

291
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,730
我沒別的意思
Hey, I'm not -- I'm not judging.

292
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,500
只是我看到你床柱上刻了幾個神秘的符號
It's just I found a few occult-looking symbols carved into your bedpost.

293
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,640
那是
It's...

294
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,990
說來話長
It's a very long story.

295
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,360
這跟你每晚睡覺前
That story have anything to do

296
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,870
都在屋門前撒鹽有關嗎
with why you put the salt in front of your bunk door every night before bed?

297
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,930
我們家就這樣  我不能說太多
Well, it's a family thing, so I can't really talk about it.

298
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,800
就是把你扔在這兒的家庭嗎
Same family that left you here?

299
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,980
你是怎么了
What are you --

300
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,630
你加入黑幫了還是怎么的
What are you, in the mob or something?

301
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,800
不是
More like something.

302
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,640
我曾加入過一個幫派
I was part of this gang, right?

303
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,940
他們就像我的家人
They were my family.

304
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,330
我愿為他們生  為他們死
I lived, breathed, I would have even died for them.

305
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,130
但你知道我落得什么下場嗎
You know where it got me?

306
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,950
在監獄關了15年
15 years in a correctional facility.

307
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,550
為了什么
And for what?

308
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,920
忠誠嗎  忠于誰
Being loyal? To who?

309
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,560
我該忠于自己的
I should have been loyal to myself.

310
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,480
因為人生只有一次  迪恩
Because you get one shot at this game, Dean,

311
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,220
你照鏡子的時候
and when you look in the mirror,

312
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,550
鏡子里的人應該為自己做主
you want the guy looking back at you to be his own man.

313
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,150
二位好啊
Hey, guys.

314
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,390
羅賓  你好啊
Hey, Robin. How are you?

315
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,040
-我挺好  你呢  -挺好的
- I'm good. How are you? - Good.

316
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,390
這是我的新農場工頭  迪恩
Meet my new ranch foreman here, Dean.

317
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,270
{\an8}羅賓

318
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,300
歡迎光臨家庭餐館  二位來點什么
Hi. Welcome to cus's. What can I get you two?

319
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,890
肯定沒想到會在這兒見到我吧
Bet you never thought you'd see me here, huh?

320
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,700
我現在挺忙的
Uh, look, I'm a little bit slammed right now.

321
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,210
你們想聽聽特色菜嗎
Do you guys want to hear the specials?

322
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,880
羅賓  我是迪恩·溫徹斯特
Robin... Dean Winchester.

323
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
我以前住在桑尼那兒
Um... I used to live up at Sonny's.

324
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,740
抱歉  我就是...
Uh, look, sorry. There's just --

325
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,190
那里住過好多男孩
There's so many boys that pass through there,

326
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,210
我不可能把每個人都記住啊
It's -- it's hard to remember every -- every name and face.

327
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,250
是啊  抱歉  我就是...
Yeah. Uh, no. Sorry, I just --

328
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,490
我記得你跟你媽去農場
I remember you coming up there with your mom.

329
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,190
她教我們彈吉他
She'd give guitar lessons. It's, uh --

330
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,240
真是過了很久了
It was a long time ago.

331
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,740
是啊  我媽最喜歡去幫助那些男孩了
Yeah. Mom -- she loved helping out the boys.

332
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,760
所以她去世后  我也去給他們上課
I guess that's why I kept giving lessons after she passed.

333
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,650
羅賓
Hey, Robin?

334
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,830
失陪一下  我就回來
Um, would you excuse me? I'll be right back.

335
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,840
-伙計  -我們走吧
- Dude... - Let's go.

336
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,710
你怎么回事啊
What was that?

337
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,410
沒什么
Nothing.

338
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,440
沒什么  你顯然是有什么
Nothing? Well, obviously it was something.

339
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,570
那個女服務員是誰
Who was that waitress?

340
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,520
都說了沒什么了  別提了
Said it was nothing, all right? Drop it.

341
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,780
桑尼
Sonny.

342
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,430
什么
What?!

343
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,070
我努力想進去救她  門就是打不開
I tried to get in to save her, but the damn door wouldn't open.

344
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,340
鎖住了嗎
Locked?

345
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,870
農場里沒有鎖
There's no locks on the farm.

346
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,750
看來我們去墓地的一趟是白跑了
That means our little field trip to the cemetery was a bust.

347
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,680
桑尼你還記得什么其他的怪事嗎
Sonny, is there anything else weird you can remember? 

348
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,590
現在不是已經到處是怪事了嗎
What,'cause we're not chest-deep in weird already, boys?

349
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,340
我知道  你再想想  什么都行
I know, I know. I mean anything -- really.

350
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,860
是有一件事
There was one thing.

351
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,910
露絲總是帶著她的串珠
Ruth always had her rosary beads with her,

352
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,950
但現在我找不到了
But now I can't find them anywhere.

353
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,700
好吧  我們先想想被害人
All right. Um, let's start with the vics, okay?

354
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,150
他倆都住在房子里
I mean, both lived in the house.

355
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,180
工作都跟這些男孩有關
They both, uh, worked closely with the boys.

356
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,590
我去跟那些孩子談談
All right, why don't I go have a chat with the rug rats, 

357
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,660
看看是怎么回事
see what's up?

358
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,100
好
Yeah.

359
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,430
桑尼  你有兩名被害人的雇員記錄嗎
Sonny, you got any employee records on the victims?

360
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,340
在我辦公室
In my office.

361
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,330
走吧
Let's do it.

362
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,240
怎么  你要怎么辦  哭鼻子嗎
Come on, whatcha gonna do about it? You gonna cry?

363
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
蒂米  你個小怪物
Timmy, you're such a little weirdo.

364
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,130
你們干什么呢  給我過來
What are you doing? Come here. Huh?

365
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,350
沒什么
Nothing.

366
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,670
蒂米  怎么回事
Timmy, what's going on?

367
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,300
行了  你們倆
All right, you two.

368
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,290
露絲今早出事的時候你們在哪
Where were you this morning when Ruth had her accident?

369
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,950
除非你是警察  我們什么都不用跟你說
Unless you're a cop, we don't need to tell you anything.

370
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,530
這樣啊
Oh, okay.

371
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,020
瞧見沒
Well...how about that?

372
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,880
我們今早根本不在
We weren't even here this morning.

373
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,050
桑尼讓我們去鎮上買雞食  我發誓
Sonny sent us into town to get some chicken feed -- we swear.

374
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,300
那露絲呢  跟我說說她
What about Ruth? What can you tell me about her?

375
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,150
我們以前管她叫典獄長
Uh, we used to call her the warden.

376
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,420
她特別信奉宗教  很嚴厲
She was a real bible-thumping hard-ass.

377
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,330
看出來了  還有嗎
Obviously. What else?

378
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,980
能不能想到什么不尋常的奇怪的事
Anything different or weird you can think of?

379
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,560
除了蒂米嗎
You mean besides Timmy?

380
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,620
你們倆再敢碰他
Either of you touch him ever again,

381
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,660
我可就對你們動刑了
I'm gonna go all guantanamo on you.

382
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,250
聽懂了嗎
Understand me?

383
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,700
給我滾吧
Get the hell out of here.

384
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,640
滾啊
Go on! Get.

385
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,550
你和布魯斯沒事吧
You and Bruce okay?

386
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,960
嗯
Yeah.

387
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,680
聽我說
Listen to me.

388
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,200
他們那樣的人只是懦夫
Guys like that -- they're cowards, okay?

389
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,390
只要你敢勇敢面對他們一次
All you got to do is stand up to them one time

390
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,550
他們就再不敢欺負你了  我保證
and they'll stop, I promise.

391
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,770
好
Okay.

392
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,890
桑尼  等等
Sonny, wait.

393
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,260
這都是什么
Um... w-what is all this?

394
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
榮譽堂
It's our hall of fame.

395
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,600
我們這兒來過不少很厲害的運動員
We had some pretty great athletes come through here,

396
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,230
包括你哥哥
including your brother.

397
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,440
他曾經是蘇利文郡135磅級的摔跤冠軍
He was Sullivan county 135-pound wrestling champion.

398
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,840
大伙兒們好啊
Hey, guys!

399
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,340
她什么時候給我上課我都愿意
She could give me a lesson anytime.

400
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,680
惡心  她就像個老古董似的
Gross. She's like ancient.

401
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,360
怎么回事
What the hell?

402
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,850
這東西怎么會在這里
What's this doing in here?

403
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,280
這孩子估計得縫八千針
Kid's gonna need about 8,000 stitches,

404
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,580
但是他會好起來的
but he'll be fine.

405
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,580
那孩子在事故發生前欺負過蒂米  是吧
That kid was bullying Timmy before the accident, right?

406
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,500
是的  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

407
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,330
看看這個
Check this out.

408
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,150
蒂米是在一棟廢棄的建筑物里被人發現的
Timmy was found in an abandoned building

409
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,690
那是大約一年前  他當時孤身一人
about a year ago all by himself.

410
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,780
沒人確定他在那里呆了多久
No one was sure how long he had been there.

411
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,220
他的父母呢
And what about his parents?

412
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,640
他們在網上放了一張照片
Well, they posted a picture on the internet,

413
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,070
但是兩人都沒出現過
but no one ever showed up.

414
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,710
那么  他怎么會來這里
Well, then, what's he doing here?

415
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,760
他不是應該去孤兒院嗎
Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?

416
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,380
他不斷從這種機構里逃跑
He kept running away from child services.

417
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,560
所以大概三個月前  桑尼提出接收他
So about three months ago, Sonny offered to take him in.

418
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,240
好吧  所以說壞輔導員
All right, so hard-ass counselors,

419
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
小惡霸都被整了  但是蒂米卻沒事
bullies all bite the dust, but Timmy's still standing.

420
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,770
所以我們怎么看這件事
So, what are we talking?

421
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,120
我們遇上了一個達米安
We got ourselves a Damien on our hands?

422
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,980
{\an8}《兇兆2》里的小男孩  是魔鬼的化身

423
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,130
不是  電磁干擾表明不是惡魔搞的鬼
No. EMF rules out a demon.

424
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,980
所以  八成是惡鬼附身
So... probably ghost possession.

425
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,060
什么意思  難不成我們要找到蒂米
Meaning what, we find Timmy and

426
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,470
往他喉嚨里塞一把鹽
shove a fistful of salt down his throat,

427
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,890
強行讓惡鬼離體
forced ejection?

428
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,600
這次換你去谷倉
You're taking the barn this time.

429
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,230
所以說  你去過很多地方
So, you've been a lot of places?

430
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,880
是啊  我
Yeah. My, uh...

431
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,780
我老爸喜歡到處走
My dad likes to move around a lot.

432
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,500
你爸是干什么的
What's your dad do?

433
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,140
都是些無聊的事
Boring stuff.

434
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,690
你喜歡這樣嗎
Do you like it?

435
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,190
不  并不喜歡
No, not really.

436
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,860
但是我爸想我追隨他的步伐
But my dad expects me to follow in his footsteps.

437
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,280
所以我差不多已經習慣了
So I've kind of gotten used to it.

438
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,230
是啊  我明白
Yeah. I-I get it.

439
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,130
我老爸想我接手這家餐廳
My pops wants me to take over the diner,

440
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,100
但是他不會如愿的
but that's not happening.

441
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,580
所以說  你自己真正想干的事是什么
So, what do you really want to do?

442
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,960
我想成為一個攝影師  全世界到處看看
I want to be a photographer and see the world,

443
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,720
去那些奇怪的地方  吃那些瘋狂的食物
go to strange lands, eat crazy food.

444
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,040
我想成為搖滾明星  但是
I want to be a rock star, but...

445
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,450
我也很喜歡汽車
I also really like cars.

446
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,090
當一個機械師看起來很苦啊
Being a mechanic seems rough.

447
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,620
什么
What?

448
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,530
不不  完全不會
No, no. Not at all.

449
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,010
汽車酷死了
Cars are freaking cool as hell.

450
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,050
修理他們就像解謎
Fixing them is like a puzzle,

451
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,890
最棒的是當你完成了你的工作
and the best part is when you're done,

452
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,570
他們就會離開
they leave,

453
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,030
然后你就再也不用為他們負責了
and you're not responsible for them anymore.

454
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,060
你吻過很多女孩子嗎
Have you kissed many girls?

455
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,970
什么
What?

456
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,560
是啊  當然了
Yeah. Of course.

457
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,330
很多
Lots.

458
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,350
真的
Really?

459
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,440
那就讓我們繼續練習練習吧
Well, I guess we'll just have to keep practicing.

460
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,500
在餐廳時你怎么了
Uh, what happened to you at the diner?

461
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,050
我轉過身去幫你點菜  但你居然走了
I turned around to take your order, and you were just gone.

462
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,270
說來話長  你看見蒂米了嗎
Long story. Um, have you seen Timmy?

463
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,860
沒啊  沒看見  但是他應該馬上就會來這兒
No, not yet, but he should be here any minute 

464
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,000
上他的吉他課了
for his guitar lesson.

465
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,550
是的  我們得把今天的課取消了
Yeah, we're gonna cancel that.

466
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,140
什么
What?

467
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,860
我們得離開這里  好嗎  我沒時間解釋了
We got to get out of here, okay? I don't have time to explain.

468
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,340
你只要相信我就好
You just got to trust me.

469
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,300
相信你
T-trust you?

470
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,340
我為什么要再相信你一次呢
And why would I do that again?

471
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,930
你其實是記得我的
You do remember me.

472
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,830
我怎么能忘得掉
How could I forget?

473
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,420
怎么了
What's wrong?

474
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,530
我只是希望這永遠不會結束
I just hope this lasts.

475
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,490
我哪兒也不去  羅賓
I'm not going anywhere, Robin.

476
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,410
是啊  說得好聽
Yeah, says you.

477
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,280
我不能
Well, I can't.

478
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,410
否則還有誰會帶你去學校舞會呢
Who else would take you to the school dance?

479
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,900
這就是你邀請我
Is this your way of asking me 

480
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,230
做你女伴的方式嗎  迪恩·溫徹斯特
to be your date, Dean winchester?

481
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,370
是的
Yeah.

482
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,290
到目前做得怎么樣
How am I doing so far?

483
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,860
我不得不離開  是有原因的
There were -- there were reasons why I had to leave.

484
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,470
現在我沒時間跟你解釋
I don't have time to explain them to you right now.

485
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,050
我得把你帶離這里
I got to get you out of here.

486
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,100
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

487
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,200
對不起
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,310
為什么對不起  蒂米
Sorry about what, Timmy?

489
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,790
我無法阻止
I can't stop it.

490
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,590
走走走
Go, go, go!

491
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,720
薩姆  快走
Sam, go!

492
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,390
-鎖上了  -該死
- Locked. - Damn it!

493
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,950
畫圈
Circle.

494
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,630
迪恩  剛剛那是怎么回事
Dean, what -- what just happened in there?

495
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,310
聽我說
Okay, listen to me.

496
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,300
不管發生什么  你都不要出這個圈
Whatever happens, you stay inside this circle.

497
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,450
明白嗎
Understood?

498
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,010
好了  迪恩
All right. Dean...

499
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,540
我沒法控制她
I can't control her.

500
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,470
不能控制誰
Can't control who?

501
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,200
你媽媽  對嗎
Your mom, right?

502
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,950
蒂米  聽著
Timmy, listen.

503
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,070
你得告訴我們著火的事情  好嗎
We need you to tell us about the fire, okay?

504
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,550
當時很晚了  我們開車回家
It was late, and we were driving home

505
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,420
在樹林里撞車了
when we crashed in the woods.

506
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,260
全都著火了
Everything was on fire.

507
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,840
但是她救了我
But she saved me,

508
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,840
在車爆炸前
pushed me out...

509
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,980
把我推了出去
before the car blew up...

510
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,390
她卻還在車里
with her in it.

511
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,770
但并不只是如此  對嗎
But that's not all, was it?

512
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,260
我跑著穿過森林
I ran through the woods.

513
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,480
找到了一個空建筑  躲在里面
I found an empty building, where I hid.

514
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,250
我很害怕
I was scared.

515
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,070
又黑又冷  所以我就哭了
It was dark and cold. So I cried.

516
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,190
我哭著叫媽媽
I cried for my mom.

517
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,770
然后她就出現了
And then she came.

518
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,690
但是她變了  是嗎
But she had changed, right?

519
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,420
我敢說那個帥氣的玩具小人就是她給你的  對嗎
I'll bet she gave you that cool action figure, huh?

520
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,510
對  我9歲的時候
Yeah. When I turned 9.

521
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,980
蒂米
Timmy...

522
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,890
你需要把那個玩具小人給我
...I'm gonna need that action figure.

523
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,170
不
No!

524
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,770
我打敗邪惡
I clobber evil!

525
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,360
我打敗邪惡
I clobber evil!

526
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,940
我打敗邪惡
I clobber evil!

527
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,660
我打敗邪惡
I...clobber...evil!

528
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,180
似乎不是玩具小人
It looks like it wasn't the action figure 

529
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,510
把她束縛在這里的  迪恩
that was anchoring her here, Dean.

530
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,850
那是什么呢
Well, then, what is?!

531
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,330
他
Him.

532
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,890
你知道嗎
You know what?

533
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,320
我覺得也許他媽媽不能放手
I think maybe his mom can't let go

534
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,070
她還在墳墓中保護著他
and she's still protecting him from the grave.

535
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,250
保護他什么  保護他不被我們傷害嗎
Protecting him from what? What, from us?

536
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,320
也許她不知道哪些威脅是真實的哪些不是
Maybe she doesn't know what threats are real and what's not,

537
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,710
所以她就一起攻擊了
so she just attacks all of them.

538
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,290
好極了  除非我們廢了那孩子
Great. So, what, unless we waste the kid, 

539
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,540
否則我們就會一直被攻擊
we're sitting ducks?

540
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,240
這太瘋狂了
This is -- this is crazy.

541
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,650
羅賓  羅賓
Robin. Robin!

542
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,400
該死
Damn it.

543
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,020
羅賓  等等
Robin, wait!

544
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,340
你到底是誰
Who are you?

545
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,290
現在我是唯一能確保你安全的人
Right now I'm the only thing that's keeping you safe.

546
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,120
蒂米  我們需要你的幫忙  好嗎
Timmy, we're gonna need your help, okay?

547
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,150
聽我說  我需要你集中注意力
Listen to me. I need you to focus, okay?

548
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,780
我們不是來傷害你的
Look, we are not here to hurt you.

549
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,530
小薩姆
Sammy!

550
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,010
我不能阻止她
I can't stop her.

551
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,450
蒂米  你得試一試
Timmy, you have to try!

552
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,710
她在你需要她的時候找到了你
She came to you when you cried out for her.

553
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,360
現在你得告訴她住手然后走開
Now you have to tell her to stop and go away!

554
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,710
-她是我媽媽  -她是一個鬼魂
- She's my mom. - She's a ghost.

555
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,630
蒂米  因為她不能繼續前進  所以越來越瘋狂
Timmy, because she can't move on, she's going crazy.

556
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,590
你得放她走  你不會有事的
Okay? You got to let her go. You'll be okay.

557
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,190
聽我說
Listen to me.

558
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,790
有時你得做一些對你最好的事情
Sometimes you got to do what's best for you,

559
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,790
即使會傷害你所愛的人
even if it's gonna hurt the ones you love.

560
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,800
媽咪
Mommy...

561
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,030
住手
Stop it.

562
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,870
蒂米  像個大人那樣
Timmy, kung-fu grip!

563
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,220
媽咪  住手  不要再傷害別人了
Mommy, stop it! Stop hurting people!

564
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,480
你得離開  永遠不要回來
You have to go. Never come back.

565
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,510
我會沒事的  我保證
I'll be okay. I promise.

566
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,690
我也愛你
I love you, too.

567
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,960
那么這是家族事業嗎
So, then, this is the family business?

568
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,340
跟你說了這很無趣的
Told you it was boring.

569
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,300
是啊
Yeah, right.

570
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,370
如你所見
Well, as you can see,

571
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,490
我沒有逃走變成搖滾明星
I did not run off to become a rock star.

572
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,110
這我就不知道了呢
Mm... I don't know about that.

573
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,910
對我來說你很帥呢  迪恩·溫徹斯特
You look pretty rockin' to me, Dean Winchester.

574
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,110
你呢
And what about you?

575
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,950
我一直在想
I mean, I always thought 

576
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,560
我會討厭一輩子都待在這一個小鎮上
that I would hate being in the same little town my whole life,

577
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,410
正如我爸希望的那樣  接管餐廳
and, you know, taking over the diner like dad always wanted, 

578
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,740
但是  我真的不討厭
but...I don't.

579
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,530
我很喜歡
I just -- I love it.

580
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,020
我想我們還是不能理解16歲時一切的想法啊
I guess we didn't know everything we thought we did at 16, huh?

581
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,730
不是一切
Not everything.

582
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,370
只是一部分而已
Just some things.

583
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,720
聽起來蒂米需要別人幫助他調整一下
Sounds like Timmy's gonna need some help adjusting.

584
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,320
沒錯  但他還有你
Yeah, but he's got you.

585
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,890
我真的很不喜歡看著你離開  D狗
I always hate to see you go, Dee-dawg.

586
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,170
這次真的太感謝你們了
Can't thank you enough for this one, man.

587
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,420
桑尼  回見吧
Sonny, we'll see you around.

588
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,110
肯定的  孩子們
You can bet on that, boys.

589
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,090
慢慢來
Take it easy, man.

590
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,500
你是怎么知道
Hey, h-how did you know

591
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,230
蒂米讓他媽媽離開會管用
Timmy asking his mom to leave was gonna work?

592
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,050
不知道  絕對是碰運氣  還好碰對了
I didn't. Total Hail Mary. Got lucky.

593
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,030
只是碰運氣
You just got lucky?

594
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,880
和你在這里做的事情很像呢
Kind of like you did with this place.

595
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,290
我之前在想
I mean, here I was thinking

596
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,660
這是你生命中最糟糕的一段時間
this was the worst part of your life,

597
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,400
結果卻是你最好的時光
and it turns out it was the best.

598
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,530
你為什么離開
Why'd you ever leave?

599
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,540
感覺不對
Never felt right.

600
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,700
真的嗎
Really?

601
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,070
只是兩個月  薩姆  好嗎
It was two months, Sam, okay,

602
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,300
迫不及待想要離開這里
and I couldn't wait to get out of here.

603
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,430
我不知道該怎么跟你說  那不是我
I don't know what to tell you. It wasn't me.

604
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,380
瞧瞧你
Oh, look at you.

605
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,460
-你收拾好了  -謝謝你
- You clean up good! - Thank you.

606
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,220
你知道  我其實從來沒
You know, uh... I've never actually been

607
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,040
去過什么學校舞會
to one of these school dances before.

608
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,540
是啊
Yeah.

609
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,260
那個嘛  迪恩  你爸爸在外面
Look, about that, Dean, your old man's outside,

610
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,930
他真的很了不起
and, man, he's really something.

611
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,300
我試圖告訴他今晚對你來說很重要  迪恩
I tried to tell him what a big night it was for you, Dean,

612
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,780
問他能不能晚點再來
and ask him if he could come back later,

613
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,070
但他讓我告訴你  他有活兒
but he just said to tell you he had a job,

614
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,480
他說你知道什么意思
said you'd know what that means.

615
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,590
在我從監獄里出來之后
You know, after I got out of jail,

616
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,700
這地方給了我第二次機會
this place gave me a second chance,

617
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,820
對你也是一樣
and it's done the same for you, too.

618
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,160
如果你需要  我會為你竭力爭取
So if you want, I'll stick my neck out for you,

619
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,970
爭取讓你留下
and I'll fight for you to stay.

620
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,000
桑尼
Sonny...

621
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,910
謝謝你所做的一切
...thank you -- for everything.

622
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,640
但我得走了
But I have to go.

623
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,630
迪恩
Dean...

624
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,820
謝謝你
Thank you.

625
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,710
為什么
For what?

626
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,120
一直在這里  一直支持我
For always being there, for having my back.

627
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,480
我知道一直都不容易
Look, I know it always hasn't been easy.

628
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,840
我不知道你在說什么鬼話
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
