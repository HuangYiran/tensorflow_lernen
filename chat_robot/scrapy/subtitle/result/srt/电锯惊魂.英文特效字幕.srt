00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is someone there?

4
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. I probably dead.

5
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're not dead.  -Who's that?

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn on the lights!

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is going on? Where am I?

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know yet.

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that smell?

11
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see a thing, asshole.

12
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

13
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

14
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one can hear you.

15
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What the fuck is this?  -Calm down. Just calm down.

16
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you hurt?  -I don't know. Yeah!

17
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

18
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is very fucking confused. What's your name? What's going on here?

19
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Lawrence Gordon. I'm a doctor.

20
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just woke up here. Just like you.

21
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Recognize that man?  -No.

22
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do you have any idea how you got here?  -No.

23
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's the last thing you remember?  -Nothing.

24
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

25
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about you?

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not much to tell really.

27
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was on my way home from work and I don't remember anything else.

28
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First dead body I've ever seen. Look different in real life.

29
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't move.

30
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the looks of these chains...

31
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}someone didn't want us to go very far either.

32
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can you see any scars?  -What?

33
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what they do. They kidnap you and drug you...

34
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and before you know it, you're in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.

35
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No one has taken your kidneys.  -How can you tell from way over there?

36
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you'd either be in terrible agony or you'd be dead by now.

37
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me.

38
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you, a surgeon?  -Yeah.

39
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you going to tell me your name or what?

40
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adam.

41
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Adam...

42
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what we need to do...

43
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is start thinking about why we are here.

44
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever brought us here could've killed us by now.

45
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they didn't.

46
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must want something from us.

47
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Question is what.

48
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That clock.  -What about it?

49
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's brand-new.  -So?

50
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So somebody obviously wanted us to know the time.

51
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. I think I might be able to reach the door.

52
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

53
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

54
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's a tape.  -Where did you find it?

55
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was in my pocket.

56
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says "Play me. "

57
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

58
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw it over here.

59
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No?

60
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Use your shirt.  -What?

61
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your shirt.

62
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

63
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It won't work.

64
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around. There must be something else you can use.

65
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There's nothing.  -There must be something.

66
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. You can do it.

67
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Again.

68
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rise and shine, Adam. You're probably wondering where you are.

69
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you where you might be.

70
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might be in the room that you die in.

71
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows...

72
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}watching others live out their lives.

73
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror?

74
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I see you as a strange mix...

75
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of someone angry and yet apathetic.

76
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But mostly just pathetic.

77
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam?

78
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or do something about it?

79
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

80
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw me the player.

81
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You throw me your tape.

82
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we're going to have to work together if we want to get out of here.

83
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, just throw it to me.

84
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going to risk breaking it. You throw me your tape.

85
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Gordon. This is your wake-up call.

86
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day of your working life, you have given people the news...

87
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they are going to die soon.

88
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you will be the cause of death.

89
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.

90
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have until 6:00 on the clock to do it.

91
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a man in the room with you.

92
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When there is that much poison in your blood, the only thing left to do...

93
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is shoot yourself.

94
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are ways to win this...

95
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}hidden all around you.

96
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just remember: "X" marks the spot for the treasure.

97
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you do not kill Adam by 6:00...

98
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon.

99
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll leave you in this room to rot.

100
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the game begin.

101
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me that. Now.

102
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon.

103
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I will leave you in this room to rot.

104
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any idea who that is?

105
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the game begin.

106
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He knows us.  -Come on.

107
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

108
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably a joke, right?

109
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let the game begin.

110
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen.

111
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow your heart.

112
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?

113
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, right next to you, on the toilet.

114
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

115
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Anything?  -No solids.

116
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take off the lid.

117
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really wish I had checked in there first.

118
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

119
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind passing me the other one?

120
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck!

121
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

122
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants us to cut through our feet.

123
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I may know who's done this to us.

124
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What did you say?  -It's not someone I know personally.

125
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just someone I know of.

126
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?

127
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The last I heard...

128
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the police still hadn't caught him.

129
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect.

130
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll start from the beginning.

131
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one's not fresh anymore. At least three weeks out.

132
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victim's a 46-year-old male.

133
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Died of massive blood loss. Mostly through the femoral artery.

134
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He started at the back of the cage...

135
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tunneled his way through that razor wire so fast...

136
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's amazing he got as far as he did.

137
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.

138
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We also found this.

139
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Paul.

140
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male.

141
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yet, last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists.

142
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hurt yourself because you truly wanted to die...

143
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or did you just want some attention?

144
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight, you'll show me.

145
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The irony is that if you want to die you just have to stay where you are.

146
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again.

147
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One path through the razor wire to the door.

148
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock...

149
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then this room becomes your tomb.

150
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul?

151
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The door was on a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00.

152
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it snapped shut. He was given two hours.

153
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jigsaw piece.

154
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm gonna be here for a while.

155
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The newspapers started calling him the "Jigsaw killer."

156
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, technically speaking, he is...

157
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not really a murderer.

158
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He never killed anyone.

159
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.

160
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Mark, if you're so sick...

161
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then why do I have so many photos of you up and about?

162
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's put your so-called illness to the test.

163
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins.

164
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The antidote is inside the safe.

165
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The combination to the safe...

166
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is written on the wall.

167
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step.

168
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, that's flammable substance smeared on your body.

169
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I would be careful with that candle, if I were you...

170
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help.

171
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or all the people you've burned with your act...

172
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just might have their revenge.

173
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found something else. Well, two things actually.

174
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole.

175
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his sick games.

176
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was there at the last one as well.

177
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only this time, he left us his penlight.

178
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Get a rush on the prints.  -Copy that.

179
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor...

180
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}extending across the midline. Started as a colon cancer.

181
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The patient has come in for a standard checkup...

182
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.

183
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The patient had...  -His name is John, Dr. Gordon.

184
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a very interesting person.

185
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for that information, Zep.

186
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see, our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients.

187
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Continuing on, the patient...  -Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.

188
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously, someone doesn't want me to tell you what the patient has. Excuse me.

189
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Gordon, I'm Det. Tapp...

190
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is Det. Sing. City Homicide.

191
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very impressive.

192
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. I do my best.

193
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sorry to interrupt you while you're working.  -That's fine.

194
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can I help you, gentlemen?

195
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell us where you were...

196
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}between the hours of 11:00 p. m. And 1:00 a. m. Last night, Doctor.

197
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it that you're interested?

198
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd like to ask you a few questions about it.

199
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For your sake, I think it's best if we do it down at the station.

200
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to follow us there?

201
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm afraid that's quite out of the question.

202
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today.

203
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay. You can ride with us, Doc.

204
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, you'll have to tell me again. What is this all about?

205
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this yours, Doctor?

206
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?

207
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

208
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have to ask. What were you doing last night?

209
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was seeing someone.

210
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

211
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Look, if you can't be honest with me...  -I was visiting someone. It wasn't a patient.

212
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I gonna do?

213
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet...

214
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and give them your alibi now.

215
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because no one is going to believe you later.

216
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was five months ago.

217
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to set me up for murder.

218
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up.

219
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Can I go home now?

220
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have one of the victims who managed to escape.

221
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking around and listening to her testimony?

222
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Maybe it'll trigger something.  -I'd like to help really but...

223
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd really appreciate it.

224
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She's the only one who made it.  -Okay.

225
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amanda...

226
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in your own time...

227
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tell me the first thing you remember.

228
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I woke up. All I could taste was blood...

229
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and metal.

230
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Amanda.

231
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know me, but I know you.

232
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose.

233
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws.

234
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the timer at the back goes off...

235
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your mouth will be permanently ripped open.

236
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

237
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, I'll show you.

238
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is only one key to open the device.

239
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

240
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.

241
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better hurry up.

242
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Live or die. Make your choice.

243
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I saw the body.

244
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a knife.

245
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.

246
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He couldn't move or feel much of anything.

247
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You mean he was alive?  -Was.

248
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened after you took it off?

249
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations. You are still alive.

250
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

251
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not you. Not anymore.

252
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isn't that right, Mandy?

253
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think that is why he picked you?

254
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you grateful, Mandy?

255
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He helped me.

256
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you sure it's him?  -Yeah, I'm sure.

257
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I know you're telling the truth? You can be the one that put me in this room.

258
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm in exactly the same situation you are in.  -Wrong.

259
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got one thing I don't: Information. You know who did this.

260
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you either tell me what is really going on...

261
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I'll cut you with this. You hear me? I'll cut...

262
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?  -It's a two-way mirror.

263
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see you.

264
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's what this is. Reality TV.

265
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look at me. I can't help you.

266
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you hear me in there? I'm having a blast.

267
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

268
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make sure you're getting everything.

269
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not going to do anything.

270
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You just want to leave it running on us?  -He won't stop it.

271
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we can't cut through these chains.

272
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's why you won't break that glass.

273
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every possible angle has been pre-thought out by him.

274
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sound like you admire this prick.

275
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To overcome something, you have to understand what a perfect engine it is.

276
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how you fight disease.

277
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now the tape told us to find an "X."

278
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That "X" has to be somewhere in this room. Help me find it.

279
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you be the calm doctor-guy when your wife and kid are out there?

280
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got them, too. He could be doing anything to them right now.

281
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you thinking about that?  -I am thinking about that.

282
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinking about the last thing I said to my daughter.

283
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diana. Honey, are you okay?

284
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can you hear me?  -Mommy.

285
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is it, sweet pea?  -There's a man in my room.

286
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, are you sure he's not just hiding in your imagination?

287
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He talked to me.

288
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, I'll come and check your room.  -I want Daddy.

289
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll get the scary man.

290
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, if you want. Come on.

291
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again.

292
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a minute.

293
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wants you to check her room.

294
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just got to finish this paragraph.

295
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, sweetie, I'll go check with you.

296
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep. I'm done.

297
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, there's no one in your room.

298
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep?

299
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm still scared.  -You are?

300
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your tootsy.

301
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a big tootsy.

302
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember this one?

303
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This little piggy went to market This little piggy stayed home

304
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This little piggy had roast beef This little piggy had none

305
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This little piggy went 'Whee' all the way home"

306
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate that thing.

307
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddy's job is like.

308
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, come on.

309
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see. Try and get some sleep now, okay?

310
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?

311
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

312
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy?

313
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sweetheart. I would never do that.

314
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who gave you that idea?  -No one.

315
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not true. Okay?

316
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much do I love you?

317
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Love you very much.  -Very much. That's right.

318
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good night, sweetie.  -Good night, Daddy.

319
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tomorrow, I'll read your favorite story.  -Okay.

320
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how much longer I can do this.

321
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

322
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you walk through life pretending you're happy?

323
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I am happy.  -That is complete bullshit.

324
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather you break down and tell me that you hated me.

325
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least there'd be some passion in it.

326
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to see her?

327
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She's beautiful.  -Thank you.

328
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You gonna have any more kids?  -We've talked about it, but...

329
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with our schedules, it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

330
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where is the lucky wife?

331
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's another picture behind the one you're looking at.

332
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my favorite one because we're all in it together.

333
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera...

334
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means I'm always missing from the photos.

335
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's not here.  -What?

336
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This photo you're talking about is not here.

337
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really? Are you sure?  -Yeah.

338
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must have taken it.

339
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you walk through life pretending you're happy?

340
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I am happy.  -That is complete bullshit.

341
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather you break down and tell me that you hated me.

342
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least there'd be some passion in it.

343
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can talk about this later, okay?

344
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just leave.

345
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, little girl.

346
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diana!

347
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy!

348
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy!

349
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do that! Leave her!

350
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You little man...

351
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you.

352
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does Dr. Gordon know you're at home with his wife?

353
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you know something.

354
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing there?

355
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Waiting for the doctor? I'm waiting for the doctor, too.

356
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that she'll let you go.

357
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?

358
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We checked your alibi. It holds up.

359
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that right?

360
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that she'll let you go.

361
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are.

362
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

363
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I can't be of more help to your investigation.

364
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we arrested a dentist last week...

365
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who liked to play with kids a bit too much.

366
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He lived two blocks from here.

367
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sewer lines run under this neighborhood, too, Doctor.

368
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Amanda.

369
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know me, but I know you.

370
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to play a game. Here's what happens if you lose.

371
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a timer at the back of the device you're wearing

372
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the timer goes off...

373
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your mouth will be permanently ripped open.

374
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll catch you guys down there.

375
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think of it like a reverse bear trap.

376
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show you.

377
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna go down to The Grill, go get a beer. You wanna come?

378
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't think so. Thanks, anyway.  -You know I always ask.

379
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one key...

380
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll leave you to have fun here then.

381
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

382
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

383
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

384
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.

385
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around.

386
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.

387
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better hurry up.

388
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Sing.

389
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Get back here.  -What?

390
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember 118th Street?

391
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}K2K.

392
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gang's territory was only about four blocks.

393
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to this.

394
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta check the records...

395
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from all fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks.

396
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go. Right now.

397
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the night of Tuesday, the 17th...

398
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213, Stygian Street.

399
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an old listing. Used to be a mannequin factory.

400
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think we have enough for a warrant now?

401
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who said anything about a warrant?

402
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Right now?  -Why not?

403
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

404
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

405
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you.

406
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is this?

407
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

408
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sing.  -What?

409
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let's see what's he's gonna do.  -Why? We got him.

410
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know what he looks like. Lets see what he's gonna do.

411
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No fucking way.

412
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck that. I'm gonna take him.

413
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck? Shit!

414
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awake already, Jeff?

415
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need more powerful tranquilizers next time. Don't cry.

416
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've given your life a purpose.

417
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a test subject for something greater than yourself.

418
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Freeze! Police.  -Hold it right there! Don't move!

419
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your fucking hands in the air!

420
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you'll make a choice.

421
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

422
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shut up and get down here.  -Turn it off.

423
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing, stop that thing. I'm taking this bastard down.

424
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move!

425
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How do you turn it off?  -Tell him how to stop it!

426
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-One key will unlock it.  -Where is it?

427
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's in the box.  -Box?

428
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which key?  -Tell him which key it is.

429
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Time is running out.  -Get down here right now, asshole!

430
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's more important to you, Officer...

431
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}arresting me, or the life of another human being?

432
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down on your knees!

433
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Jesus!  -Help me!

434
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I am sick, Officer.

435
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tapp, it's none of the keys here!

436
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

437
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sick of people who don't appreciate their blessings.

438
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

439
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick of all.

440
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Tapp. Shit.

441
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be back. Okay?

442
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze! Or I'll shoot.

443
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you on your knees.

444
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're running.

445
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're running scared because we had you.

446
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to close this case.

447
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've closed it. We're right, Sing.

448
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to close this thing.

449
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"X" marks the spot.

450
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should search this room again.

451
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing over there?

452
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

453
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because I'm stuck in this room with you...

454
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean I have to report to you every 10 seconds.

455
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really don't see the point in us not helping one other.

456
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.

457
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly why we need to talk. We need to think.

458
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am thinking.

459
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:35,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then don't keep me in the dark about what you're thinking.

460
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Turn off the lights.  -What?

461
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Turn them off, now, please!  -Why?

462
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just turn them off for a second.

463
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus! Behind you.

464
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How come we didn't see that before? - The lights in here hadn't charged it.

465
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must be glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

466
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Open it.  -It's locked.

467
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The key. The one from my envelope. Where is it?

468
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the fuck... Here.

469
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cell phone. The most beautiful invention on this planet.

470
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that second most beautiful invention.

471
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Give me that.  -Are you joking?

472
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth?

473
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I'm willing to risk it. Give me that sweet cancer.

474
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care, I really don't. Give me one of those.

475
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cigarettes are harmless, I promise.

476
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed.

477
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about this: You don't need a gun to kill Adam.

478
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I please have a cigarette?

479
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying the police.

480
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

481
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

482
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. This has happened before.

483
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night, after I finished at the hospital...

484
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was walking back to my car.

485
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was alone, but I'm sure someone else was there.

486
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That thing. It was waiting for me.

487
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How did you know to turn off the lights?  -Who cares? It worked.

488
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, but how did you know?  -Instinct.

489
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Instinct?  -Yeah.

490
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:59,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? You're a terrible liar.

491
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say that like you know me.

492
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else aren't you telling me?

493
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see.

494
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:12,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On my sixth birthday, my best friend at that time, Scott Tibbs...

495
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stabbed me with a rusty nail. I didn't tell you that.

496
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't tell you my last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk...

497
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}broke up with me because she thought I was too angry.

498
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I haven't told you that one of my toenails...  -Stop it.

499
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:28,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You knew to turn off these lights.  -Whatever.

500
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm dealing with a juvenile.

501
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You wanna know?  -Yeah.

502
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is.

503
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God!

504
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get this?

505
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was in your wallet, behind the photo of your daughter.

506
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why didn't you show me this before?  -I couldn't.

507
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

508
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing to them, you bastard?

509
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I got to think now.

510
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about this: You don't need a gun to kill Adam.

511
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:56,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When there is that much poison in your blood, the only thing left to do...

512
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is shoot yourself.

513
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

514
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

515
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing?

516
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adam, listen to me. I want you to play along with me on this.

517
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got that?

518
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you still want that cigarette?

519
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Sure.

520
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, I've done it!

521
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've killed him with the poison, just like you wanted!

522
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now where is my family? Where are they?

523
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

524
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just got electrocuted.  -What?

525
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That was our way out.  -Did you hear what I said?

526
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get this thing off me. Get it off!

527
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stop acting.  -You think I would make that up...

528
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to mess up your stupid, fucking charade?

529
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, that's it!

530
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it!

531
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember everything now.

532
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:40,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember how I got here.

533
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is someone there?

534
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can hear you.

535
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

536
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

537
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that? Who's in there?

538
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on out! I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

539
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who is this?  -Daddy?

540
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:16,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Diana?  -Daddy, is that you?

541
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, baby, it's me. I'm here.

542
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:22,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared, Daddy.

543
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, honey. Everything's going to be okay.

544
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where is Mommy?  -She's here with me.

545
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me talk to her, sweetie. Okay? Put Mommy on.

546
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bad man from my room is here.

547
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has us tied up...

548
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he has a gun.

549
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What man?

550
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please come home, Daddy.

551
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

552
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diana?

553
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Larry?  -Ali?

554
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Adam there?

555
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know?

556
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ali, what is going on?

557
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't believe Adam's lies.

558
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:26,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows you. He knew all about you before today.

559
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Ali?

560
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

561
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn you!

562
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:44,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you so much as lay a finger on them, I'll kill you! Do you hear me?

563
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You son of a bitch. I'll kill you!

564
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they okay?

565
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife, she mentioned your name.

566
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did she say?

567
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me...

568
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not to believe you.

569
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me about what?

570
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me you know me.

571
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

572
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know who I am.

573
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop the lies. You're a liar!

574
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know the truth!

575
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a liar?

576
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do last night, Lawrence?

577
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Work at a hospital? Saving sick children?

578
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital.

579
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because it's the truth.

580
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not. Your wife is right, Larry.

581
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot?

582
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near a hospital last night.

583
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

584
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been taking pictures of you for a few days now.

585
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

586
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna know what I do? I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you...

587
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels to fuck their secretaries.

588
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night I went to your house. I watched you leave.

589
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I followed you...

590
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all the way to that shitbag hotel.

591
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've had these with you the whole time?

592
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found them in there, with the hacksaws.

593
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how they got there.

594
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right. You're so full of it!

595
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters, but my camera isn't.

596
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't know how to lie. It shows you what's put right in front of it.

597
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room?

598
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:31,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got out of there pretty fast.

599
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?

600
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know if you were gonna make it.

601
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

602
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do that.

603
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

604
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong, Dr.Gordon?

605
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, it was wrong of me to make you come here.

606
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But I thought we...  -Please.

607
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

608
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You tell anyone you were here?  -No.

609
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

610
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's for you.  -For me?

611
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

612
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:16,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what you're doing, Doctor.

613
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I have to go.  -What happened?

614
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to go.

615
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who was it?  -Who was what?

616
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The person who paid you to follow me? Who was it?

617
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money up front.

618
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$200 a night.

619
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I knew I was gonna end up here, I would've asked for more.

620
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

621
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

622
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask your name. I didn't know who you were.

623
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how I got here, I don't know how you got here.

624
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just took the shots and went straight home to develop.

625
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe...

626
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in some pre-historic bathroom...

627
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}staring at the guy I've been taking shots of all night.

628
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here.

629
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Maybe.  -What do you mean maybe?

630
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course it is. What did he look like?

631
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He was just a guy.  -Was he tall, skinny, obese, what?

632
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't take notes about his appearance.

633
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You must remember something of him.  -I can't.

634
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember a thing about the guy?

635
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I told you...  -For fuck's sake! I give up!

636
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a tall, black guy. He's got a scar around his neck, okay?

637
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tapp!

638
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Det. Tapp.

639
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop.

640
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He was discharged from the police force.

641
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He broke down after his partner was killed. But that didn't stop him from harassing me.

642
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy became obsessed.

643
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He convinced himself I must have somehow been involved with the murders...

644
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you helped him.

645
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took money from him to invade my privacy.

646
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How could you do that?  -Call it my need to eat.

647
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

648
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? You're not a victim of this game...

649
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-you're a part of it.  -Really?

650
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously this cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

651
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you, he's not a cop.

652
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's a bottom feeder. Just like you.  -What are you more pissed off about?

653
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I took some shots of you...

654
01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or that I took shots while you were cheating on your wife?

655
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I did not cheat on her!  -Why do you care what I think anyway?

656
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:02,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter...

657
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and had a 15 hooker gang-bang.

658
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did I get here?

659
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had everything in order.

660
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My whole life was in perfect order.

661
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart, are you okay?

662
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy just needs you to be really strong right now.

663
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:12,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going to let anybody hurt you. You got that?

664
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my good girl.

665
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, was there someone else at your house last night...

666
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-besides your wife and daughter?  -No.

667
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's someone here.

668
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know him. Zep!

669
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name is Zep.

670
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an orderly in my hospital.

671
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You perverted little psychopath.

672
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:22,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this!

673
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bastard! Fuck!

674
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:28,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look.

675
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're out of time.

676
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:02,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's okay.  -Mommy, help me.

677
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Gordon's time is up.

678
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I gotta do what I've gotta do, and...

679
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed.

680
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that you, Zep, you bastard! I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

681
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Larry.  -Ali?

682
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You failed.

683
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

684
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't move! Stay on the ground.

685
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the phone.

686
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to me!

687
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Larry?  -Ali!

688
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Honey, are you all right?  -No.

689
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we're not... Get down!

690
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Larry, where are you?

691
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

692
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

693
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm so sorry, Ali.  -Larry, we need you here.

694
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for everything. It's my fault.

695
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:50,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please forgive me. I've always been happy with you.

696
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy.

697
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ali!

698
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy, help me.

699
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze!

700
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

701
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

702
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Gordon?

703
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:32,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Diana?

704
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,550
