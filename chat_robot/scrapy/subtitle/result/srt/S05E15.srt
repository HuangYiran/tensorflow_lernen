1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,860
我发现他挺忧伤
I find he's sad.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,360
什么  你在说什么
What?  What are you talking about?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,360
伍尔希先生  看上去挺寂寞
Mr.Woolsey. it seems he's lonely

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,860
-有么  -他从来不参加城里的社交活动
He does? Never take parts in any of the city's social activities.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,860
拜托
Oh, please. I mean...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,860
他总是一个人吃饭
He always eats alone,

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,000
不是在自己办公室就是在他住处
Either in his office or in his quarters.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
他可能有活要干
Maybe he has work to do, you know?

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,730
我们中有些人就是大忙人
Some of us are busy people.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,930
有时候我夜里经过他住处
Sometimes, when I walk by his quarters at night,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,130
听见他在哭
I hear him crying.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,100
什么  真的
What? really?

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,160
假的
No.

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,700
伍尔希先生
Mr. woolsey!

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,960
要不要一起吃
Would you care to join us?

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,500
多谢了
Well, thank you,

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,760
但我今天得在房里
But I'll be taking breakfast

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,260
吃早餐
In my quarters today.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,560
我还剩一点业绩评估
I still have some final preparations

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,030
没弄完
For my impending performance evaluation.

21
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,230
我有点担心
I'm a little apprehensive.

22
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,700
别那么担心
You shouldn't be.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,260
作为我们的指挥官你做很出色
You've done a wonderful job as our new commander.

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,130
希望勘察顾问组也这么想
Well, let's hope the i.o.a. agrees.

25
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,430
看到了吧
There you go.

26
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,700
他就喜欢一个人待着
He prefers to be on his own.

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
话说回来  谢帕德去哪儿了
Speaking of which, where's sheppard?

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,130
今早他带了几个太空生物学家去陆地了
He flew some astrobiologists to the mainland this morning.

29
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,000
并自愿
And volunteered

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,760
陪他们在那儿过夜
To stay with them overnight.

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,130
真的
He did?

32
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,160
为什么
Why would he do that?

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,930
这个星球上的太阳是G级行星
This planet's sun is a class G star.

34
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,630
该条件连同
That fact, coupled with

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,300
与地球类似的大气组成成分
Its earth-like atmospheric composition,

36
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,630
为绿色光合有机物的生长
Results in the predominance

37
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,530
提供了有利环境
Of green photosynthetic organisms.

38
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,730
当然啦  叶绿素
Chlorophyll, of course,

39
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,730
吸收了大部分
Mostly absorbs

40
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,160
蓝光和红光的波长
The sun's blue and red wavelengths,

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,900
反射出绿色
Reflecting green ones.

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,730
你可能在想"等等"
"but hang on a minute," you're probably thinking.

43
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,930
"真奇怪"
"that's strange.

44
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,600
"为什么叶绿素不吸收绿光"
Why doesn't chlorophyll absorb green light?"

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,160
是啊  很奇怪  那为什么呢
Oh, yeah. weird. well, why doesn't it?

46
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
答案可不在
The answer lies not so much in the--

47
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,460
上帝啊
Oh, my god!

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,700
在这儿等着
Wait here.

49
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,500
怎么了
What happened?

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,560
瞧瞧这个
Look at this. huh?

51
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,700
这植物多像毛柄秋海棠
It's a plant not unlike the begonia eiromischa!

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,260
天哪
Oh, god.

53
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,000
罗恩提醒过我的
Lorne warned me about this.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
你不懂
You don't understand.

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
这种有毛高茎秋海棠属植物
The woolly-stalked begonia

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,000
只有在2007年的地球上才有
Went officially extinct back on earth in 2007

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,830
我们就站在这儿
And yet here we are,

58
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,600
站在这株极其相似的植物旁边
Standing over a species that's shockingly similar--

59
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
我得回飞船了
I'm going to go back to the jumper

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,130
准备过夜
And set up for the night.

61
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,760
在这种环境中仍然生机勃勃
...and it's thriving in a climate that is...

62
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,230
要来么
Want to join me?

63
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,700
这真是罕见
It's a very unusual find.

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,860
行
Right.

65
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,330
尽情玩  别客气
Well, knock yourself out.

66
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,900
真是不虚此行啊
That's what we're here for.

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,200
慢慢来
Take your time.

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
我们整晚都在
We're here all night.

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,600
要帮忙么
Can I give you a hand with that?

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,160
其实  如果你不介意
Actually, if you wouldn't mind...

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,300
你好
Hello.

72
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,660
你好
Hi.

73
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,930
你去哪儿
Where are you headed?

74
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,600
回我住处
Back to my quarters.

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,630
东南部码头
Um, the southeast pier.

76
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,630
第19层
Level 19.

77
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,030
住在顶楼
Ooh, penthouse suite.

78
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,030
不错
Nice.

79
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,300
我们认识么
Have we met?

80
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,760
不  我是瓦纳萨·康拉德
Not yet. I'm vanessa conrad.

81
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,430
瓦内萨·康拉德博士
Dr. vanessa conrad.

82
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,900
理查德·伍尔希
Richard woolsey.

83
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,700
我最近刚到阿波罗号
I just recently arrived on the apollo.

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,830
欢迎来到亚特兰蒂斯
Oh, welcome to atlantis.

85
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,030
谢谢
Thank you.

86
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,560
这儿很漂亮  也很大
It's beautiful. and huge.

87
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,930
搞清楚路恐怕得要好几个星期
It's probably going to be weeks before I know my way around.

88
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,160
我想指导部的人会帮你
Well, I'm sure the gang at orientation

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,300
慢慢习惯的
Will help you settle in.

90
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,730
耽误你了
I'm keeping you.

92
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,860
东南码头  第19层
Southeast pier, level 19.

93
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,230
没有  一点没有
No, no. not at all.

94
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,160
我一直在
I have all the time in the--

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,660
就是这儿吧
This is you, I believe.

96
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,300
是啊
Oh. right.

97
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,030
那
Well.

98
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,860
很高兴见到你  博士
Nice to meet you, doctor.

99
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,400
瓦纳萨
Vanessa.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,100
你可以叫我瓦纳萨
You can call me vanessa.

101
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,760
很好
Very well.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,500
很高兴见到你  瓦纳萨
Nice to meet you, vanessa.

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
谢谢  伍尔希博士
Thank you, mr. woolsey.

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,500
其实  你可以叫我
Actually, you can call me--

105
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,860
妈的
Dick.

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,060
靠
Crap.

107
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,860
令你大惊小怪的外世宴会呢
What happened to your off-world foofaraw?

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,200
我还以为你是
I thought you were the guest of honor

109
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,600
外交晚宴上的贵宾呢
At some big diplomatic dinner on m2j?

110
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,730
本来是的
Yeah, I was,

111
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,030
但宴会提前结束了
But the festivities ended early

112
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,560
多诺万中尉队里的三个人
When three members of lieutenant donovan's team

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
对我们在宴会上供应的某种食物
Suffered a severe allergic reaction

114
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,530
产生了严重的过敏反应
To something we were served at the grand banquet.

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
我想可能是
I think it might have been

116
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,300
那种长紫斑的绿浆果有问题
Those little green berries with the purple specks on them,

117
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
我吃过后舌头就有点麻
Because my tongue did feel a little bit numb afterwards--

118
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,530
仅供参考
Yeah, fyi,

119
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,230
该对话结束于六秒前
This conversation ended six seconds ago.

120
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,430
好吧  总之
Yeah, anyway,

121
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,430
回来的路上  我有个主意
On the way back, I had an idea.

122
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,460
打个小盹就忘了
Have a little lie-down. it'll pass.

123
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,400
不是
No, uh...

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,060
你得听我说
You should hear me out.

125
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,330
我觉得应该扫描下
I think we should run a scan

126
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,800
海底
Of the ocean floor.

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,630
我发现城周围的水温
I've been noticing anomalous temperature variations

128
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,030
有异常的变化
In the waters surrounding the city.

129
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,230
需要进一步调查
I think it bears Further investigation.

130
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,560
不用啊
Not really.

131
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,430
听着  我们每天穿越星门
Look, we head through the gate every day

132
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,000
探索远方世界
Exploring distant worlds,

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,130
可是除了几个海洋生物学测试
And yet, with the exception of a few marine biology tests,

134
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,260
我们还没弄清
We have barely scratched the surface

135
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,300
自己所在的这个星球
Of the very planet that we occupy.

136
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,600
那是因为这儿风平浪静
That's 'cause there's nothing there.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
我的意思是彻底调查一下无伤大雅
My point is it wouldn't hurt to be thorough.

138
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,800
我的意思是你在说废话
My point is your point is pointless.

139
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,060
浪费时间
And a giant waste of time.

140
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,700
该死的
Aah! dammit.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,530
肖  欢迎你
Xiao, welcome.

142
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,630
亚特兰蒂斯欢迎你
Atlantis welcomes you.

143
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,360
十分荣幸能够
It is with great pride that i--

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,000

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,830

欢迎来到亚特兰蒂斯
Welcome to atlantis...

147
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,930
深感荣幸
With... great pride.

148
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,930
我很期待这次旅行
I'm looking forward to the grand tour.

149
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,660
这样
Well, then...

150
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
走么
Shall we?

151
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,300
好的
Yes.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,530
这儿是控制室
This is the control room--

153
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,060
实际上  这里是整个城的中心
For all intents and purposes, the city's nerve center.

154
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,400
技术人员对他们的工作
These technicians are the very best

155
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
完成的堪称完美
At what they do.

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,030
跆拳道练的怎么样  阿米丽亚
How's the kickboxing going, amelia?

157
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,400
好极了  长官  多谢关心
Great, sir. thanks for asking.

158
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,730
你好啊  恰特
Hello there, chet.

159
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,200
是恰克
It's chuck.

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,100
什么
Excuse me?

161
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,160
是恰克  长官  我叫恰克
It's chuck, sir. my name is chuck.

162
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,900
是啊  恰克
Oh, of course. chuck.

163
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,700
恰特是夜班
Chet's on the late shift.

164
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,430
没人叫恰特
There is no chet.

165
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,800
我想改装一下
I think it would be a simple matter

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,660
城市的短程传感器应该不难
Of reconfiguring the city's short-range sensors

167
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,760
可以实现
In order to achieve--

168
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
我只看到你的嘴唇在动
You know, I can see your lips moving

169
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,900
但没在听你说
But I'm not hearing any sound.

170
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,730
不用一小时
It would take

171
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,060
不用一小时就可以
It would take less than an hour

172
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,000
准备好必要的调整
To make the necessary adjustments.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
好吧  知道么
All right, you know what?

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
如果对你来说真的这么简单这么重要
If it is so simple and that important to you,

175
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,630
你为什么不自己去弄
Why don't you just go ahead do it yourself?

176
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,330
因为我需要得到你的允许
Because I require your authorization.

177
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,330
没问题
You got it.

178
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,360
谢谢  罗德尼
Thank you, rodney.

179
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,560
知道么  你很有可能
You realize it's highly unlikely

180
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,030
一无所获
You're actually going to find anything.

181
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,530
那我就得花一个小时
Then I would have wasted an hour of my time

182
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,130
听你说教"早告诉过你了"
And you'll be able to tell me "i told you so."

183
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,730
另一方面  如果我真的有所发现
If, on the other hand, I do find something,

184
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,130
他们说不定会给我个头衔
Perhaps they'll name something after me for a change.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,730
指挥亚特兰蒂斯的探索工作
The prospect of commanding the atlantis expedition

186
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,600
令人畏惧
Was a daunting one.

187
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,400
韦尔博士和卡特中校
Dr. weir and colonel carter

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,560
他们的行为令人捉摸不透
Were incredibly tough acts to follow.

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,530
你表现的很好啊  理查德
Yet you availed yourself nicely, richard.

190
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,500
这九个月你都挺过来了
And you survived your nine months here.

191
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,030
我想不仅仅是挺过来吧
Well, I like to think I've accomplished a little more than mere survival,

192
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,530
而且我肯定
And I'm certain

193
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,030
如果你有机会看我的报告
That once you've had a chance to review my report--

194
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,700
没那个必要了
That won't be necessary.

195
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,500
就是说我通过考验了
So I'm receiving my graduation papers?

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,200
当然
Of course.

197
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,060
介于你在这儿出色的表现
In recognition of the great job you've done here,

198
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,700
勘察顾问组任命你为
The i.o.a. is appointing you

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,200
地球新环境部门的主席
As chair of earth's new environmental initiative.

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,930
恭喜你  理查德
Congratulations, richard.

201
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,830
你就要回来了
You're coming home.

202
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,260
好了  短程传感器好了
All right, short-range sensors are good to go.

203
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,330
可以开始扫描了
Start the sweep.

204
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,300
扫描开始
Sweep initiated.

205
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,630
很好
Great.

206
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,460
大概要三十分钟
So it should take about 30 minutes

207
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,000
来扫描整个星球
To scan the entire planet,

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
也就是说我有大把时间
Which means I've got plenty of time

209
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,830
去一下餐厅
To get down to the cafeteria,

210
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,130
吃点杏仁脆饼
Get myself some of that fine almond biscotti

211
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,130
太棒了
And a yoohoo,

212
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,460
然后准时回来
And be back in time

213
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,630
等你告诉我啥都没发现
For you to tell me you have found nothing.

214
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,800
我们有发现了
We've found something.

215
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,800
是啊  当然了
Yes, of course we did.

216
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,630
无论什么
Whatever it is,

217
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,730
它在海平面以下大概1500尺处
It's sitting approximately 1,500 feet below sea level.

218
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,530
你好  约翰
Hello, john.

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,930
克亚
Kolya?

220
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,160
我无法理解你的反应
I don't understand your reaction.

221
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,830
九个月前你是那么害怕到这儿来
Nine months ago, you were dreading coming over here.

222
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,560
九个月可以改变很多东西
A lot has changed in nine months.

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,760
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

224
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,230
而且  说实话
And, quite frankly,

225
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,830
我不喜欢半途而废
I don't like the idea of leaving a job unfinished.

226
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,430
我做得很好
I've done good work.

227
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,360
我的记录就是证明
My record speaks for itself.

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,330
究竟发生了什么
What's really going on?

229
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,560
勘察顾问组觉得
The i.o.a. is concerned

230
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,430
你做的一些决定
About some of the decisions you've made,

231
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,100
与协议冲突
Decisions that have run counter to protocol

232
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,330
说实话也不合常理
And, quite frankly, common sense.

233
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,200
他们...我们...
They... we...

234
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
觉得这个职位对你来说
Feel that the demands of this position

235
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,260
是屈才了
Have compromised your judgment,

236
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,930
是时候做些改变了
And it's time for a change.

237
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,100
这里
Right here.

238
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,830
行了
That'll do.

239
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,100
这东西究竟在下面多久了
I wonder how long it's been down there.

240
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,130
想想  如果我们没发现它
To think, it would have remained undiscovered

241
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,960
如果我们没
If we hadn't have...

242
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,230
短程传感器改装的不错
Nice job on reconfiguring the short-range sensors.

243
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,700
谢谢
Thank you.

244
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
推测得也不错
Nice job on the... wild guess.

245
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,430
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,330
可以开始了么
Shall we?

247
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,800
可以
Yes.

248
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,960
再找找
Keep looking.

249
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,030
他们无处可逃
There's nowhere for them to go.

250
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,600
他们是科学家
They're scientists.

251
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,500
相信我
Trust me.

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,700
他们跑不快
They don't run very fast.

253
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,100
你醒了
Oh, you're awake.

254
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,660
留点力气吧
Save your energy.

255
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,160
这次你跑不掉了
You're not getting away this time.

256
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,260
我杀了你
I killed you.

257
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
你射中了我  这不一样
You shot me. there's a difference.

258
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,400
不  我杀了你
No. I killed you.

259
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,900
贝克特确认
Beckett confirmed it.

260
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,860
你已经死了
You were dead.

261
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,330
没错  他肯定这么认为
Yeah, I'm sure that's what he thought.

262
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,730
那就说说你的朋友吧
Let's just say your friend--

263
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,960
他叫什么来着  卢休斯
What was his name? lucius?

264
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,300
那天他不是唯一
He wasn't the only one

265
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,030
使用古人技术的
Using ancient technology that day.

266
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,660
你是怎么来这儿的
How did you get here?

267
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,700
你怎么找到我们的
How did you find us?

268
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,530
貌似你的那些外世联系
Turns out some of your off-world contacts

269
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,100
没你想的可信啊
Aren't as trustworthy as you think.

270
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,060
你的秘密泄露了  谢帕德
Your secret's out, sheppard.

271
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,360
朝那个方向走半天
A half day's walk in that direction

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,830
就能到达陆地的边缘
Will bring us to the edge of the mainland.

273
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,430
我觉得
I figure

274
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,900
坐船去亚特兰蒂斯可能要两天
It'll take us maybe two days to reach atlantis by boat.

275
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,330
你连城都进不去
You won't even get to the city.

276
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,900
他们会直接把你吹飞的
They're going to blow you out of the water.

277
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,200
不会的  他们根本看不到我们来
No. they won't even see us coming.

278
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,800
他们会忙着数死尸
They'll be too busy counting their dead.

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,860
你要干什么
What are you going to do?

280
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,660
通过星门送点炸药
Send an explosive through your gate,

281
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,160
瓦解城里的防御
Cripple the city's defenses.

282
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,500
为此
But for that,

283
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
我得问你要点东西
I'm going to need something from you.

284
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,830
我想你称之为虹膜解除码
I think you call it an idc.

285
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,660
去死吧
Go to hell.

286
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,100
没错
Yeah,

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,860
我就知道你需要劝劝
I thought you would need some convincing.

288
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,430
康拉德博士  瓦纳萨
Dr. conrad. vanessa.

289
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,430
进来吧
Come in.

290
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,430
希望没打搅到你
I hope I'm not intruding.

291
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,900
当然不会  什么风把你吹来的
Not at all. what brings you by?

292
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
也许这不太合适
This may be wholly inappropriate,

293
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,630
但是我想知道
But I was wondering

294
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,630
你想不想一起看电影
Whether you'd like to catch a movie.

295
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,200
电影
A movie?

296
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,300
今晚在放我最喜欢的两部
They're screening two of my favorites tonight--

297
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,960
《一路顺风》
Planes, trains, and automobiles

298
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,260
《偷心大少》
And  dirty rotten scoundrels.

299
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,800
说实话
Truth be told,

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,430
我今天很不爽
I'm having a horrible day

301
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,860
没心情笑了
And I'm not in much of a laughing mood.

302
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,530
那就等到明天吧
Then we can wait until tomorrow

303
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,300
明天要放《女为财死》和《袋鼠杰克》
When they'll be screening mad money and  kangaroo jack.

304
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,160
你想聊点什么吗
Is it something you'd like to talk about?

305
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
看来我们没空聊了
It seems the time for talk has passed.

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,430
我刚刚收到通知
I've just been informed

307
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,900
我不能在亚特兰蒂斯
That I'm being relieved of my command

308
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
继续指挥了
Here on atlantis.

309
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,500
对不起
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,730
为什么
Why?

311
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,360
显然  我在不够循规蹈矩
Apparently, I'm not very good at toeing the company line.

312
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,760
我以为我得到这个职位
I assumed I got this position

313
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,160
是因为我的记录良好
on the strength of my record.

314
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,330
但很明显
But now it's clear

315
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,960
他们指派我的原因
That the only reason they appointed me

316
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,460
是因为他们希望
Is because they expected

317
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,360
我会向他们妥协
I would just roll over for them.

318
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,900
那就别
Then don't.

319
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,130
什么
What?

320
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,330
别向他们妥协
Don't roll over for them.

321
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,330
反抗
Fight this.

322
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,700
我不能
I can't.

323
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
已经决定了
The decision's been made.

324
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,230
如果真是这样
If that was true,

325
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,630
那他们为什么不直接通知你
Then why didn't they just forward you a communique

326
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,830
而是派人花三周时间
Instead of sending a mouthpiece

327
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,430
赶到飞马座星系转告你呢
On a three-week journey to the pegasus galaxy?

328
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,730
你真的指望
Did you really expect me

329
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,360
我一点都不反抗就放弃么
To just give up without a fight?

330
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,730
老实说  是的
Honestly? yes.

331
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,960
我以为这件事你会用常识去处理
I assumed you'd let common sense Guide you on this one.

332
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,260
你不是来解雇我的
You weren't sent here to fire me.

333
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,900
你是来评估我的表现的
You were sent here to evaluate my performance

334
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,860
然后根据评估作推荐
And make a recommendation based on your findings.

335
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,760
勘察顾问组也许早有想法
The i.o.a. may be leaning a certain way,

336
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,700
但他们尚未对我的命运
But they have yet to make a decision

337
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,060
作出决定
On my fate.

338
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,760
但你  作为代表已经做出决定
Yet you, their representative, clearly have...

339
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,960
这让我觉得
Which leads me to assume

340
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,030
其中另有隐情
Something else is going on here.

341
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,260
勘察顾问组中的某个人
Someone in the i.o.a.

342
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,860
想赶我走
Wants me gone

343
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,900
他利用你赶我走
And is using you to make sure that happens.

344
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,300
告诉我吧  肖
Tell me, xiao.

345
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,360
你收了什么好处
What are you getting in return?

346
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,530
是我的职位  对吗
It's my job, isn't it?

347
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,300
他们许诺让你做亚特兰蒂斯的指挥官
They've promised you the atlantis command

348
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,560
只要你赶走了我
If you help them get rid of me?

349
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
这就简单多了
This will all go a lot easier

350
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
只要你接受事实
If you just accept where this is going--

351
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,660
我会才怪
The hell I will.

352
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,330
理查德  一切都在我掌控中
Richard, I hold all the cards.

353
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,200
我有决定权
The decision is in my hands.

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,860
这场仗你赢不了
This is a fight you cannot win.

355
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,900
你是我认识的最能忍的人
You can tolerate more than any man I've ever known.

356
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,730
为什么
Now, why is that?

357
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,030
我结过婚
Well, I was married once.

358
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,530
你在飞马座星系中
You're here in the pegasus galaxy

359
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,930
保卫你的人民
To protect your people,

360
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,630
但大部分时间你是徒劳
But half the time, you can't even do that.

361
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,300
这就是你的动力吧
That's what drives you, isn't it?

362
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,460
你曾经的失败
Your past failures.

363
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,060
你觉得不给我虹膜解除码
do you think By not giving me the idc

364
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,030
就能保住你的人民吗
You're keeping your people safe?

365
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,260
你只是在做无谓的反抗
You are just putting of the inevitable.

366
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,430
都完了
It's over

367
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,060
你保护不了他们
You can't protect them.

368
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
你和那些科学家
You, those scientists,

369
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,830
在亚特兰蒂斯的朋友
Your friends back at atlantis--

370
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,030
他们就要死了
They're as good as dead.

371
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,400
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Well, I see that asking nice isn't working.

372
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,360
我得改变计划了
I'm going to have to make other plans.

373
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,700
我的位置  来两个人
Two men report to my position.

374
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,360
马上到
On our way.

375
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,930
几分钟之后
In a couple of minutes,

376
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,100
你就会求着给我虹膜解除码了
You're going to wish you'd given me that idc.

377
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,430
忙什么呢
What are you working on?

378
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,700
根据这个
According to this,

379
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,660
这个装置正以振动形式
The device is emitting a low-level energy signature

380
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,530
发射低能量的信号
In an oscillating pattern.

381
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,630
危险么
Is it dangerous?

382
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,900
不  辐射很小  但
No. radiation's minimal, but--

383
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,230
这不重要
Unimportant.

384
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,560
我们应该主要看数据
We should be focusing on the data.

385
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,160
我有啊
I was.

386
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,860
我已经尽我所能
Like, I've run every kind of decrypt sweep

387
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,160
进行了解码扫描
I can think of at this thing.

388
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
还是一无所获
Still nothing.

389
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,530
我思维枯竭了
I don't know what to do.

390
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,100
你会想到怎么办的
Oh, you'll think of something.

391
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,130
真的
Really?

392
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,200
为什么这么肯定
What makes you so sure?

393
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,660
因为你聪明绝顶
Oh, because you're brilliant.

394
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,030
这倒是真的  但也不是说...
That's true. Doesn't mean I'm going to--

395
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,500
等等  你刚刚说什么
Wait a minute. What did you say?

396
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,660
为什么这么说  你病了么
Why did you say that? What are you, sick?

397
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,630
还是我病了
Am I sick?

398
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,530
你听到什么了
What've you heard?

399
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,560
没人病了  罗德尼
No, nobody's sick, Rodney.

400
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,160
我说你聪明绝顶  因为你就是
I said you were brilliant because... because you are.

401
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,500
我很少说
I rarely say it

402
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,900
是因为你不好恭维
because you're a difficult man to compliment.

403
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,700
你骄傲  自负  顽固...
You're egotistical, you're arrogant, stubborn--

404
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,160
但还是聪明绝顶
And brilliant.

405
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,200
是的  罗德尼
Yes, Rodney.

406
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
聪明绝顶
And brilliant.

407
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,360
谢谢了
Thanks.

408
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
搬张椅子过来  瑞迪克
Well, pull up a chair, Radek.

409
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,630
我们有活儿干了
We've got some work to do.

410
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,900
好的...
All right...

411
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,560
告诉我B计划是什么
Tell me what plan B is,

412
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,930
还是你想给我一个惊喜
Or are you just going to surprise me?

413
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,500
我会派人你修理
I'm going to have my men repair the damage

414
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,360
你那艘被他们弄坏的飞船
they did to your puddle jumper,

415
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,230
顺便用来攻城
Then use it to attack the city.

416
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,530
我不想泼你冷水
Well, I hate to be Mr. Negative,

417
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,900
但你们至少
But I can think of

418
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,660
会遇到一个问题
at least one problem you're going to run into.

419
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,700
我知道  我很清楚开飞船
Yes, I know all about the ancient gene

420
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,800
需要古人基因
needed to operate the jumper.

421
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,000
但那不成问题
But that's not going to be a problem

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,300
你可以助我们一臂之力
because you're going to give us a hand.

423
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
抓住他
Hold him.

424
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,030
最后一次机会  小约翰
Last chance, Johnny boy.

425
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,260
给不给我虹膜解除码
You going to give me that idc?

426
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,260
看是不给了
Didn't think so.

427
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,830
你真有意思  谢帕德
You're an interesting man, Sheppard.

428
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,030
一路来到另一个星系
You travel to another galaxy,

429
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,100
不惜自己的生命来保护一群
Risk your life defending a bunch of people

430
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,500
你甚至不认识的人
you don't even know.

431
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,200
如果你问我
If you ask me,

432
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,260
你是视死如归呢
You're either someone with a death wish

433
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,460
还是要逃避什么
or someone running away from something.

434
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,600
告诉我
So tell me,

435
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,530
你在逃避什么
what are you running away from?

436
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,160
你去哪儿了
Where have you been?

437
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,700
到处都去了
All over.

438
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,230
这个装置发出的电磁辐射
The electromagnetic radiation this device is giving off

439
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,600
覆盖了整个城  甚至外围
Covers the entire city and well beyond.

440
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,900
你不是说不危险么
I thought you said it wasn't dangerous.

441
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,500
是不危险  至少根据这个...
Oh, it's not. At least, according to this--

442
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
它运作的频率很低
It's operating at a relatively low frequency.

443
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,330
我觉得  顶多
I think, at worst,

444
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,930
会引起一些人头疼
Some people may experience headaches

445
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,160
或失眠
Or trouble sleeping--

446
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,460
那就在睡觉前关了它
Well, then, we'll shut it off before bedtime.

447
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,660
同时
In the meantime,

448
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,500
你得看看这些数据
You should be focusing on the data.

449
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,460
我没看出什么
I'm not getting anywhere with that.

450
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,230
尽管说我是个天才
I mean, despite the fact that I am a genius.

451
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,600
我说你聪明绝顶  但没说你是个天才
I said you were brilliant. I didn't say you were a genius.

452
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,100
没差
Aw, same diff.

453
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,160
我不明白
I don't get it.

454
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,660
这些密码看上去比我们以往
You know, this script appears to be a lot less complicated

455
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
遇到要简单得多
than many we've encountered.

456
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,100
只有12个字符
It's only 12 symbols

457
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,560
不停地重复不同的组合
in an endlessly repeating yet varying sequences.

458
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,400
是啊
Yeah.

459
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,300
我同意
I agree.

460
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,360
很奇怪
It's very curious.

461
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,030
就好像要破解外星人的
It's like being asked to figure out the password

462
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,200
电脑密码一样
For an alien laptop or something.

463
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,160
我觉得如果我们...
I think that if we--

464
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,800
怎么了  你在干什么
What? What are you doing?

465
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,160
我在破解外星人的密码
I'm figuring out the alien's password.

466
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,230
罗德尼  我开玩笑的
Rodney, I was kidding.

467
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,730
不  有点道理...
No, it makes sense--

468
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,300
连小孩都用口令保护电脑
Every kid with a computer password-protects.

469
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,760
或许外星人也用
Why wouldn't an alien?

470
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,230
有了
There.

471
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,600
为什么我之前没注意到
Why didn't I see that before?

472
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,730
什么
What?

473
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,960
文字不是重点
The pattern isn't in the text.

474
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,260
关键是文本中的空白
It's in the spaces in between the text,

475
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,060
每个都是12个字符长
Each exactly 12 symbols in length.

476
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,460
每段文本长都是12的倍数
Each section of text is a multiple of 12--

477
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,660
24  48  96
24, 48, 96...

478
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,200
之间有12个字符长的空白
Separated by a 12-symbol space.

479
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,930
是个猜谜
Look, it's-- it's a puzzle.

480
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,930
这是个提示
It's a prompt.

481
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,030
你在干什么
What are you doing?

482
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,960
用模式识别软件
Running pattern recognition software

483
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,300
处理这12字符序列
on the 12-symbol sequence.

484
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,500
最好能找出一个12字符的组合
Hopefully I can come up with a 12-symbol permutation

485
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,730
能让我进入装置系统
that I can feed directly back into the device.

486
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,060
如果我是对的...
And if I'm right--

487
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,130
如果我们是对的...
If we're right--

488
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,600
就能进入外星人的电脑
We unlock the alien laptop.

489
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,060
你占了我的秘密领地
You poached my private spot.

490
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,700
什么
What?

491
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,260
我是说...
Uh... what I meant to say is

492
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,160
你发现了我的秘密基地
You discovered my little personal area.

493
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,430
我想独自思考问题时就来这儿
This is where I come to be alone with my thoughts.

494
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,630
不介意分享吧
Do you mind sharing it?

495
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,530
当然不
Not at all.

496
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,100
这里很美
It's beautiful.

497
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
真希望能永远呆在这儿
I wish I could stay here forever.

498
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,900
顺便说一句
By the way,

499
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,000
我想谢谢你  为今天的事
I wanted to thank you for earlier today.

500
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,260
我听了你的建议
I took your advice.

501
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,100
他们让步了
Are they backing down?

502
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,660
也不是
Unlikely.

503
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,130
但至少
But at the very least,

504
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,700
我可以大摇大摆的离开了
I have the satisfaction of knowing I went out swinging.

505
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,430
你是个好人  理查德
You're a good man, richard.

506
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,030
我真希望他们能看到这点
I really wish they could see that.

507
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,360
瓦纳萨  要不要和我一起吃晚饭
Vanessa, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?

508
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,960
这是我的荣幸
It would be my pleasure.

509
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,930
太好了
Wonderful.

510
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,530
那我什么时候来大摇大摆的来接你
What time should I swing by to pick you up?

511
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,130
我想偶遇会更好
It might be easier if we just met up.

512
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,500
伍尔希先生  你的传呼
Mr. Woolsey, you're off radio.

513
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,900
麦凯博士要求马上见你
Dr. Mckay needs to see you right away.

514
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,560
这记录了一个消失文明的
That is the historical, scientific,

515
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,800
历史  科学  科技
and technological records of an extinct civilization,

516
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,560
如果这个装置预示着什么
And if this device is any indication,

517
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
一定是很先进的
a highly advanced one at that.

518
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,600
比如  医学上的重大突破
I mean, medical breakthroughs,

519
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,460
先进武器的使用说明
Specifications for advanced weaponry--

520
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,360
这太不可思议了
This is incredible.

521
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
是啊
It... is.

522
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,100
我嗅到了"但是"
I sense a "but".

523
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,000
不不不
No, no, no. no, no, no.

524
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,260
没有"但是"
No "buts".

525
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,830
顶多有个"顺便说一句"
A "by the way", maybe.

526
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,930
我听着呢
I'm listening.

527
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,560
就像我说的  这个装置里记录了
Like I said, the device contains the records

528
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,960
一个消失很久的文明
For a long-dead civilization.

529
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,860
但也同时含有构成硅基生命形式的
But it also contains the chemical building blocks

530
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,030
化学基础物质
For a silicon-based lifeform.

531
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,360
什么意思
What does that mean?

532
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
这个装置是用来
This device was designed

533
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
在星球上播撒种子
to seed planets with organisms

534
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,660
而这些种子会进化成为一种有意识的种族
That would, in time, evolve into a sentient race.

535
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,960
当该种族发展到
Once that sentient race

536
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,200
一定的智能水平
Reached a certain level of intellectual maturity,

537
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,600
他们就可以受益于
They could then benefit

538
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,560
祖先留下的信息
From the information left for them by their extinct ancestors.

539
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,000
然后怎么样
So what happened?

540
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,900
不知道
I'm not sure.

541
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,600
很明显  他们还没有完成旅程
Obviously, they didn't complete their journey.

542
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
就被我们捞上来了
They ended up here instead.

543
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,900
在代达罗斯号的帮助下
Still, with the help of the daedalus,

544
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,130
我们可以肯定
We could ensure

545
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,130
他最终抵达了目的地
That it finally reached its target destination.

546
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,230
好吧  复制下数据就把它送回去
Okay, let's copy the data and then send it on its way.

547
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,560
马上就要"顺便提一句"了
Which is where the "oh, by the way" comes in.

548
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,330
这个装置的设置
Look, this device is set up in such a way

549
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,400
是一旦读取数据
that accessing the data

550
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,500
就会对生物样本造成不可挽回的伤害
would do irreparable damage to the biological samples.

551
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,960
也就是说  要么要么
In other words, it's either/or?

552
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,200
要么读取数据  要么把它送回去
Either we take the data or we send it on its way.

553
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,300
不可兼得
We can't do both.

554
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,460
你真让我失望  约翰
You disappoint me, John.

555
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,660
我觉得你不是这么容易被打倒的
I didn't think you'd be this easy to break.

556
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,130
即便是和你一起来的两个科学家
Even those two scientists you came with

557
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,260
在被杀之前
put up more of a fight--

558
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,460
都能负隅顽抗一下
Before we killed them.

559
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,330
又葬送了两条命
Just another two you couldn't save.

560
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,760
搞定了
We're done.

561
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,100
能运作么
It's operational?

562
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,160
能  我们用基因物质将其初始化
Yes, we used the genetic material to initiate it.

563
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,960
听到了么  谢帕德
You hear that, sheppard?

564
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,900
我们搞定飞船了
We've got the jumper--

565
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,430
长官  我们可以搞定亚特兰蒂斯后
Sir, we can come back and deal with him

566
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,600
再回来解决他
once we're done with Atlantis.

567
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,700
不行
No.

568
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,730
得先解决他
We deal with him now.

569
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,500
找出来  杀了他
Find him and kill him.

570
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,900
你好  艾伦
Hello, Ellen.

571
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,430
你好  路人甲
Hello... you.

572
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,700
阿米丽亚  能不能帮我个忙
Amelia, could you please do me a favor

573
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,460
给瓦纳萨·康拉德博士发个消息
and pass on a message to Dr. Vanessa Conrad?

574
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,000
她住在科学公寓里
She's in one of the science departments.

575
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
转告她
Please tell her that,

576
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,500
因为麦凯博士发现
Given Dr. Mckay's recent findings,

577
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,100
我们共进晚餐的事需要另行安排
We may have to reschedule our dinner tonight.

578
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,530
康拉德医生  长官  你确定吗
Dr. conrad? are you sure, sir?

579
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,700
倒不如
Better yet,

580
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,360
你告诉我她住在哪儿好了
Why don't you just tell me where her quarters are?

581
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,900
我亲自跟她说比较好
I suppose it's only proper that I tell her personally.

582
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,700
没有资料  长官
There's nothing here, sir.

583
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
还没给她安排住处么
She hasn't been assigned quarters yet?

584
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,700
根据记录  亚特兰蒂斯没有叫康拉德的博士
No sir, according to this,there is no Dr. conrad on atlantis

585
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,900
阿米丽亚  我说的是早些时候
Amelia, the woman I was talking to

586
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,530
你来找我时  和我说话那个女的
When you approached me earlier today...

587
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,830
长官
Sir?

588
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,030
在看台那儿
On the balcony.

589
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,230
在你转达麦凯博士的留言时
The woman I was speaking with

590
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,600
跟我说话的那个女人
When you delivered the message from dr. mckay.

591
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,960
或许我来之前  她就离开了
She probably left before I got there, sir.

592
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,030
当我到达看台时
When I approached you on the balcony,

593
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,430
你是独自一人
You were alone.

594
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,200
你很正常
There's nothing wrong with you.

595
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,600
究竟是怎么回事
What's going on?

596
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,530
待会儿告诉你
Uh, I'll let you know in a second.

597
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,130
我正在分析你的数据
I'm just looking over your results.

598
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,330
不会有什么结果
She won't find anything.

599
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,600
根据检查  你没事
According to this, you're fine.

600
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
健康得很
Perfectly normal.

601
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
看吧
See?

602
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,730
那是怎么回事
Then what is going on?

603
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,030
为什么数据库里没有你的名字
Why isn't your name in the database?

604
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,300
为什么之前阿米丽亚
Why couldn't amelia see you

605
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,330
看不见你
Earlier today?

606
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,230
我很确定数据库里有我的名字
Uh... I'm pretty sure my name is in the database.

607
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,230
至于阿米丽亚
And as for amelia,

608
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,300
如果她不是有什么病的话
If she has a medical concern,

609
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,800
不可能看不见我
There's no reason why she shouldn't see me.

610
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,200
她什么时候过来的
When did she come by?

611
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,260
理查德  她看不见我的
She can't see me, richard.

612
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,600
只有你看得见我
Only you can see me.

613
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,200
为什么
Why?

614
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,260
我得澄清下误会
I'd like to clarify the misunderstanding.

615
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,400
我不希望她认为我无视她
I don't want her thinking I turned her away.

616
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,560
阿米丽亚那边没事
Uh... amelia's fine.

617
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
我会跟她谈
I'll talk to her.

618
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,660
好
Great.

619
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,130
那么你说
Um, as for you,

620
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,300
你一直感觉不好
You said you've been feeling unwell?

621
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,800
是的
Uh... that's right.

622
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,300
疲劳么
Tired?

623
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,930
有点
Somewhat.

624
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,030
视觉上有什么症状么
Any visual symptoms?

625
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,460
看东西的时候
Shadows or flashes

626
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,960
有黑影或者光点么
In your field of vision?

627
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,660
可以这么说
Sort of. yes.

628
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,460
那听觉症状呢
What about auditory symptoms?

629
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,500
时常有响声  嗡嗡声  嘘嘘声
Occasional ringing or buzzing or whistling?

630
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,730
我们要谈谈
We need to talk.

631
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,230
是的  有时有嗡嗡声
Yes. the occasional buzzing.

632
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,660
私下谈谈
Somewhere private.

633
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,100
现在又来了
There it goes again.

634
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,100
我猜你是因为试用期审核的事
I bet you haven't been sleeping very well,

635
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,300
弄得睡眠不足
What with this whole probationary review...

636
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,960
有道理
Of course.

637
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,160
正是如此
That's it exactly.

638
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,500
很明显你压力很大
You're obviously under a lot of stress,

639
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,300
焦虑能通过各种方式
And sometimes anxiety can manifest itself

640
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,860
表现出来
In a variety of ways,

641
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,200
这些药物能让你放松
But these are going to help you relax

642
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,860
睡个安稳觉
And sleep through the night.

643
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,130
希望充足的休息后
And hopefully, once you're well rested,

644
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,630
你能感觉好点
You'll be feeling much better,

645
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,160
药到病除
And your symptoms will disappear.

646
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,530
如果还是如此
But if they don't,

647
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,930
再回来复诊
Come back and see me.

648
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,860
好吗
Okay?

649
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,560
谢谢了  医生
Thank you, doctor.

650
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,630
我建议你不要吃
I wouldn't advise taking those.

651
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,330
你站在那儿多久了
How long have you been standing there?

652
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,400
抱歉
Sorry.

653
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
我只是...不想打扰你
I just... didn't want to disturb you.

654
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,860
你好像在沉思
You seemed deep in thought.

655
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,330
我常常沉思
I'm always deep in thought.

656
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,960
让我反应敏捷
Keeps me sharp.

657
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,060
保持清醒
And sleepless.

658
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,560
那  你在干什么
So, what are you working on?

659
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,730
我在分析那些
I'm just analyzing the readings

660
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,760
装置显示的
From the radiation

661
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,260
放射读数
The device is emitting.

662
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,430
天啊  又是放射
Oh, jeez, again with the radiation.

663
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,800
我只是在伍尔希允许我们
Hey, I'm just killing time

664
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,900
查询资料之前
Till woolsey gives us the green light

665
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,530
打发打发时间
To start data retrieval on that thing.

666
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,560
你认为他会么
You think he will?

667
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,230
当然  这很重要
Of course. this is huge--

668
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,700
外星种族成就编年史
The chronicled achievements of an alien race,

669
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,930
开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me?

670
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,760
慢着
Whoa, wait a minute.

671
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,400
怎么了
What?

672
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,000
那装置发出的
The modulated, ultra-low frequency

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,500
超低频率射线
Emanating from the device...

674
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,260
我貌似在哪儿见过
I've seen something like this before.

675
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,660
不会吧
Oh, no.

676
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,900
抱歉搞得你莫名其妙
I'm sorry I made you doubt your sanity.

677
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,460
你是谁
Who are you?

678
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,560
你是什么
What are you?

679
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,160
我是你潜意识中对
I'm a physical manifestation

680
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,430
浪漫和异性渴望的虚拟呈现
Of your subconscious romantic and sexual ideals.

681
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
天啊
Oh, god.

682
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,900
你没疯
You're not crazy.

683
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,330
你真的能看到我
You're really seeing me.

684
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,200
为什么
Why?

685
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
我很抱歉对你说了谎
I'm sorry I had to deceive you,

686
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
但整个文明的生死存亡
But the survival of an entire civilization

687
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
命悬一线
Is at stake.

688
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,730
这是跟麦凯博士
This has something to do

689
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,560
修好的装置有关吧
With that device dr. mckay recovered,

690
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,160
对么
Doesn't it?

691
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,660
理查德
Richard?

692
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,560
她看不到我
She can't see me.

693
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,230
在
Yes

694
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,860
我还以为你在和别人聊天
I thought I heard you talking with someone.

695
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,630
没有
No.

696
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,200
我在准备一个演讲
I was running through the pep talk

697
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,960
我要给他们讲讲微生物学
I'm going to be giving the gang in microbiology.

698
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,300
真的么
Really?

699
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
你也知道
You know,

700
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,800
我今天看到你在看台上
I saw you on the balcony this afternoon

701
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,500
自言自语
Talking with... yourself.

702
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,160
有时...我喜欢把自己的想法说出来
I... occasionally do verbalize my thoughts.

703
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
让我更好地整理思路
It helps me put things in perspective.

704
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,800
细心的人就会发现这种行为
A casual observer might find that sort of behavior

705
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,260
令人不安
A little disconcerting,

706
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,900
特别是面对重大抉择时
Especially coming from someone in your position...

707
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,630
何况你又身居要职
Faced with a very important decision.

708
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,830
又记上一过了是么
Oh, another nail in my coffin?

709
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,500
麦凯博士向我简述了一下重修的装置情况
Dr. mckay briefed me on the device he recovered.

710
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,300
那是伟大的发现
Yes, it is an impressive find.

711
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,260
但不属于你
That doesn't belong to you.

712
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,230
拜托...请坐
Please-- sit down.

713
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,060
他告诉我你很迟才允许
He tells me you've delayed giving the go-ahead

714
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
他们修复数据库
On the data retrieval.

715
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,500
我不确定
I'm not sure

716
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,460
麦凯博士是否说明了我们目前的困境
If dr. mckay explained the dilemma we're facing--

717
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,760
我不敢相信你竟然
I can't even believe you're considering

718
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,300
听之任之
Letting this slip away.

719
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,960
还有别的问题需要考虑
There are other issues to consider--

720
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,930
例如
Such as?

721
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,800
另一个种族的命运
The fate of another race.

722
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,860
你能不能给我消停会儿
Will you stay out of this!

723
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,030
恕难从命
I will do no such thing.

724
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,600
他们的文明不复存在
Their civilization is dead.

725
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,300
相反  我们的文明正蓬勃发展
Ours, on the other hand, is very much alive,

726
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,200
这是很重要的情报
And we could use that information.

727
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,760
我们的虐夺使
We'd be robbing a civilization

728
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,730
他们的文明无法重建
Of the opportunity to rebuild itself.

729
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,000
文明是否能重新萌芽
There's no guarantee that a civilization will evolve

730
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,230
还尚未可知
From the seeding process.

731
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,800
或许在达到情感认知程度前
The entire race could die out

732
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,860
就已经灭绝
Before it even reached sentient status.

733
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,930
而我们就错失了
And we would be throwing away

734
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,630
千载难逢的机会
An incredible opportunity.

735
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,030
或者把潜在的数十亿生命
Or consigning billions of potential lives

736
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,660
扼杀在摇篮之中
To oblivion.

737
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,860
理查德  我不敢相信你如此好运
I can't believe your good fortune, richard.

738
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,260
这是你的机会
This is your opportunity

739
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,400
回到家乡向你的下属展示
To show the team back home

740
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,030
你的领导才能
That you can play ball.

741
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,200
按规章办事  才能保住饭碗
Follow procedure and save your job,

742
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,300
要么向我辞职  你自己选
Or you can hand it to me on a silver platter.

743
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,560
你竟然恐吓我
How dare you threaten me.

744
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,360
这不叫恐吓  理查德
It's not a threat, richard.

745
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,290
只是告诉你
I'm simply telling you

746
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,360
如果没了那个装置
How things are going to play out

747
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,290
事态将会如何发展
If we lose that device.

748
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,700
理查德  拜托
Richard, please.

749
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,930
他们是友好和平的种族
They were a kind and peaceful race,

750
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,460
应当得到救赎
One well worth saving.

751
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,800
我们得毁了它
We need to get rid of it!

752
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
那装置发出的能量指标
The energy signature that device is giving off

753
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
和我们在m1b-129碰见的
Is very similar to one we encountered

754
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,130
十分相似
On m1b-129.

755
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,800
它可以让人产生强大幻觉
It can induce mass hallucinations.

756
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,300
或者以一种通讯的方式
Or function as a means of communication

757
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,730
和不同种族的人交流
Between two very different species.

758
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,300
速战速决
Let's act quickly.

759
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,930
修补数据
Salvage the data

760
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,000
毁灭装置
And destroy the device.

761
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,060
多谢大家独到的见解
Thank you all-- both for enlightening me.

762
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,030
我会很快做出决定
I'll make my decision shortly.

763
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,030
请
Please.

764
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,900
现在
Now...

765
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,160
告诉我到底怎么回事
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

766
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,200
时间也够久的了
This has gone on long enough.

767
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,230
换手吧
Use your other hand.

768
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,400
继续
Go on.

769
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,060
我可不想让你就这么死了
I have no intention of letting you die.

770
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,300
爬上来吧  约翰
Now, climb back up, john.

771
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,330
这就对了
That's it.

772
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,560
到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going on here?

773
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,060
千百年前
Tens of thousands of years ago,

774
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,360
一个文明预见了自己的末日
A civilization foresaw its end.

775
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,460
经历了数百年进化之后
After millions of years of evolution,

776
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,660
这个名为斯卡瑞的种族
The race known as the sekkari

777
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,160
濒临绝种
Faced extinction.

778
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,460
意识到自救无望
Knowing they couldn't save themselves,

779
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,630
他们便利用最后的日子
They spent their final days

780
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,300
寻找重新来过的方法
Creating the means to start over.

781
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,400
他们制造了很多贮种器
They built seed carriers,

782
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,860
各自按预定轨道
Each with a different target world

783
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,900
发往不同的
Programmed into its navigation system,

784
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,530
能够提供他们
Worlds that would provide them

785
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,230
充足化合物的目标世界
With the chemical compounds necessary

786
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,330
让他们有机会生存繁衍
To produce, sustain, and develop life.

787
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,860
每个贮种器里还专门设有资料库
Each seed carrier also held a repository

788
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,730
用来存放斯卡瑞人的史料
Containing the history of the sekkari people--

789
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,760
他们的坚韧不屈  丰功伟绩
Their struggles, their achievements,

790
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,230
还有他们犯过的
And the mistakes

791
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,760
导致最终毁灭的错误
That ultimately led to their own destruction.

792
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,430
贮种器装备完善后
The seed carriers were outfitted

793
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,100
还安装了子空间通讯器
With subspace communicators

794
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
用来在到达目的地时
Designed to alert the group

795
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,700
发回通知
Once a seeding was successful.

796
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,260
50多个贮种器发出去了
Over 50 were launched.

797
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,430
没有一个完成使命
None achieved their goal.

798
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,500
我的这架出了故障
This unit malfunctioned.

799
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,230
便让它停在了最近的星球
I guided it to the nearest planet--

800
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,500
也就是这里
This world,

801
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,800
希望这里的环境
In the hope that it would prove suitable

802
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,330
有利于我们的生命进程
To the life-forming process.

803
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,530
但不行
It wasn't.

804
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,160
好在设备着陆了
This device survived re-entry

805
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,700
基本无损
Relatively unscathed,

806
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,000
于是接下来的2000年里
Then spent the next 2,000 years

807
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,260
就在海底度过了
At the ocean's bottom,

808
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,830
直到最近
Until recently,

809
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,260
它的休眠系统被唤醒
When its dormant systems were awakened

810
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,730
探测器采集到了
By its sensors picking up trace readings

811
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,500
你们水下飞船的跟踪数据
From one of your submerged puddle jumpers.

812
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,060
几周前麦凯博士从水下停泊舱
The one dr. mckay flew up out of the underwater bay

813
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,700
开走的那艘
Several weeks ago.

814
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,500
我扫描了你们的城市  然后联接了你
I scanned your city, and then I linked with you.

815
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,600
那你是什么
What are you?

816
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,730
我是贮种器的人工智能产物
I'm the seed carrier's artificial intelligence.

817
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,930
我的使命就是研究你
My aim was to study you,

818
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,830
接近你
To get to know you,

819
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,430
还有  实际上  指引你
And, eventually, direct you

820
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,030
帮助我完成这艘贮种器的使命
To help complete this unit's assignment.

821
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,400
所以你就操纵我
By manipulating me.

822
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,260
不是的
No.

823
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,330
弄清
By finding out

824
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,460
你是怎样一个人
What kind of person you were

825
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,160
我们才敢托付于你
In the hope that we could place our trust in you.

826
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,100
你难道不能
Couldn't you have simply

827
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,430
一开始就跟我们坦白
Communicated your situation to us

828
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,500
你的境况么
From the beginning?

829
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,130
请你理解
Please understand--

830
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,530
我是斯卡瑞人最后的希望
I am the last hope for the sekkari people.

831
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,500
不能冒险行事
I couldn't risk it.

832
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,860
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

833
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
作为士兵  你是个威胁
As a soldier, you were a threat.

834
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,860
如果需要人用武力保全资料室
If anyone was to use force to secure the repository,

835
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,800
非你们莫属
It would have been you,

836
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,360
军人
The military man.

837
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,860
所以我使你产生了幻觉  迷惑你
So I connected with your mind to distract you.

838
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,060
迷惑我
Distract me?

839
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,460
让我以为飞船被毁了
Making me think the jumper had been sabotaged

840
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,230
算不上什么迷惑
Would've been enough of a distraction.

841
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,460
你迟早会发现破绽
You would have discovered the subterfuge.

842
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,160
而我又不能维持稳定幻象过久
I'm unable to maintain a static illusion over time.

843
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,760
我必须控制着你的思想
It was necessary to keep your mind occupied.

844
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,160
你就这么决定了
And that's what you chose?

845
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,630
是你决定的
What you chose.

846
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,500
我没有完全控制你的想象
I didn't have full control over your hallucination

847
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,460
或是帮你发出指令
Or the direction it took.

848
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,360
是你的思想在起主导作用
It was your mind driving the diversion.

849
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,230
我不过是顺着你的思路走
I merely played along.

850
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,660
你的意思是  我自己拷问了自己
Are you saying I tortured myself?

851
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,700
你每天都自我拷问  约翰
You torture yourself every day, john.

852
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,730
但这次
But in this case,

853
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,630
是你自己的大脑
It was your mind

854
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,460
呈现了你内心最深层的恐惧
Manifesting your darkest fears.

855
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,900
你一直在自欺欺人
You were the architect of your own self-deception.

856
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,930
现在你已经知道了真相
Now you know the truth

857
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,330
该做决定了
And have a decision to make.

858
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,760
中校  你去哪儿了
Colonel, where were you?

859
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,260
你知不知道我们在这坐了多久
Do you know how long we've been sitting here--

860
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,700
别嚎了  上船
Shut up. get in the jumper.

861
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,160
打扰了  沈女士
Sorry to disturb you, ms. shen,

862
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,000
你有地球来的
But you've just received a secure transmission

863
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,030
加密口信
From earth.

864
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,000
可以接通吗
Can I patch it through?

865
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
来吧
Go ahead.

卢瑟

867
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,730
情况怎么样
How are things?

868
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,530
我想  通知你最近的发展形势
Well, but I felt it only fair to inform you

869
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,530
才算公平
Of recent developments here.

870
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,000
虽然我很肯定你更能胜任
As much as I believe you'd be a worthy candidate

871
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
理查德·伍尔希的职位
To replace richard woolsey,

872
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,500
但恐怕委员会的其他成员
I'm afraid the rest of the council

873
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,460
持反对意见
Feels otherwise.

874
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,700
看来我们要换成詹姆斯·库立芝
It looks like we'll be going with james coolidge instead.

875
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,860
库立芝
Coolidge?!

876
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,000
别担心
Don't worry.

877
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,730
你促成交接的功劳  还是会有奖励的
You'll still be rewarded for facilitating the transition.

878
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,630
祝贺你
Congratulations.

879
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,310
你来坐国际勘察顾问组
You'll be chairing the i.o.a.'s

880
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,000
新环境部门的第一把交椅
New environmental initiative.

881
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,000
好  我走了
Well, I'm off.

882
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,530
我估计不久就能与你会合
I suppose I'll be joining you shortly.

883
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,960
别做放假打算了
Don't make any holiday plans.

884
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,400
你不会被调走的
You're not going anywhere.

885
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,000
我看你前途无量
I gave you a glowing review.

886
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,530
既然你的未来全凭我一纸公文
And since your future rests entirely on my report,

887
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,460
我很高兴第一个祝贺你
I'd like to be the first to congratulate you

888
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,530
新上任的亚特兰蒂斯远征队
As the new permanent commander

889
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,600
永久指令官
Of the atlantis expedition.

890
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,930
我没懂
I don't understand.

891
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,200
和你一样  理查德  我不是谁的傀儡
Like you, richard, I'm nobody's puppet.

892
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,560
他们昨天应该在传达任命前
They should've thought of that

893
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,730
就意识到这点
Before delivering yesterday's update.

894
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,500
祝你好运
Good luck.

895
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,430
昨天的任命
Yesterday's update?

896
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,700
我听不懂她在说什么  长官
I don't know what she's talking about, sir.

897
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,800
我们最近都没有联络记录
We haven't had a scheduled dial-out in days.

898
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,360
可以让我单独呆一会儿么  阿米丽亚
Could I have a moment alone, amelia?

899
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,430
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

900
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,230
我猜有你的功劳吧
I assume that you're responsible for that?

901
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,000
算个临别礼物
Consider it a going-away present.

902
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,230
谢谢
Thank you.

903
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,960
好吧
Alrighty.

904
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,500
给  完全修好了  整装待发
Here we are, all fixed up and ready to roll.

905
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,560
完成使命前
What happens to you

906
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,660
你们准备怎么办
When you reach your final destination?

907
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,060
使命
Destination?

908
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,130
你是在和a.i.说话  是么
Ah, you're talking to the a.i., aren't you? uh...

909
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,300
我先启动生命装置
I'll start the process

910
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,630
让斯卡瑞生命萌发
That will give life to the sekkari,

911
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,130
然后我就再度休眠
And then I'll go to sleep

912
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,930
直到下一次需要我的时候
Until a time when I'm needed again.

913
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,760
约翰
John,

914
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,860
我想
I realize

915
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,530
这种经历你一定不喜欢
It may have been an unpleasant experience--

916
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,500
是啊  还好吧  是有一点
Yeah, well, just a little bit.

917
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,600
怎么  你也能看见她
What-- you can see her too?

918
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
我想告诉你
And I want you to know

919
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,960
让你经历这些我感到很抱歉
I'm sorry for what you had to go through.

920
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,500
阿波罗号准备起程了
The  apollo is ready to beam.

921
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,330
这艘小飞船会带你去目标星球
The ship will take you to your target planet.

922
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,760
抱歉
I'm sorry,

923
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,660
我不是想抱怨
I don't mean to complain or anything,

924
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,000
我花了一天中最好的时间
It's just that I have spent the better part of a day

925
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
保证这东西能正常运转
Making sure this was in working order.

926
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,560
我是不是也应该
It would be kind of nice

927
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,230
看看你的庐山真面目
To just get a little face time with the--

928
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,160
看吧  麦凯博士
Here you are, dr. mckay--

929
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,530
斯卡瑞人的真实形态
The true form of the sekkari.

930
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,860
精致
Neat.

931
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,660
祝你好运
Good luck.

932
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,460
"精致"
"neat"?

933
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,300
什么  她突然就出来了
What? i-- she caught me off guard.

934
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,530
你指望我说什么
What did you want me to say?

935
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,730
你又会怎么说
What would you have said?

936
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,130
诡异吧
Oh, "weird."

937
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,260
伍尔希先生
Mr. woolsey.

938
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,730
要不要一起吃
Would you care to join us?

939
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,760
实际上
Well, actually,

940
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,560
我还有报告要整理
I have some reports to file...

941
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,400
谢谢邀请
Thank you.

942
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
乐意加入
I'd love to join you.

943
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,530
其实你根本不知道
So, you really had no idea

944
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,500
你看到的东西
That what you were seeing

945
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,660
不是真的
Wasn't real?

946
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,260
相信我
Trust me,

947
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,030
那个幻象太逼真了  博士
The manifestations were very convincing, doctor.

948
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,360
你绝对想象不到
You wouldn't have known.

949
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,760
恕我冒昧
Well, with all due respect,

950
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,000
我猜他们自知糊弄不了我
I think they knew they couldn't fool me,

951
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,930
所以嘛  才没找我
So they, you know, didn't bother.

952
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,030
注意力都放在你俩身上了
They just concentrated on you two.

953
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,260
我不明白的是
You know what I don't get,

954
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,460
那个a.i.早上现身
Is the a.i. thing revealed itself that morning,

955
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,060
你下午就发现了那个装置
You discover the device that afternoon.

956
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,900
时间掐得多准
I mean, that's perfect timing.

957
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
中校说的对  巧的离奇
The colonel's right. that was very coincidental.

958
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,930
我知道你想说什么
And I know what you're implying,

959
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,460
不过我脑子很清醒
But my mind was clear.

960
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,630
就是因为我聪明
That device was found

961
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,830
才发现了那个设备
Because of my brilliant thinking

962
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,530
还有  虽说不想承认
And, as much as I hate to admit it,

963
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,600
但泽兰卡帮了点小忙
A little help from zelenka.

964
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,660
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

965
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,560
泽兰卡在外世
Zelenka's off-world.

966
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,460
没有
No, he's not.

967
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,060
他昨天就回来了
He came back yesterday.

968
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,430
多诺万中尉
Lieutenant donovan had a nasty reaction

969
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,330
食物中毒的那个
To something he ate,

970
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,430
他们提前回来了
They came back early.

971
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,430
不是么
Didn't they?

972
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,260
哦  狗娘
Aw, son of a--

973
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,300
我看不完全是巧合
Guess it wasn't that much of coincidence

974
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,930
管他呢
After all.
