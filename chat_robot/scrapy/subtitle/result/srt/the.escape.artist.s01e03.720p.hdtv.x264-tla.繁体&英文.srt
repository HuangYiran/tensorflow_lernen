1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
謝謝你  我的朋友
Thank you my friend.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:56,450
{\pos(110,242)}shad2前情回顧

3
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,720
不客氣
Pleasure.

4
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,980
保重
Take care.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,920
你不該在睡覺前看恐怖電影的
You shouldn't watch scary movies so close to bedtime.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,890
凱特  杰米
Kate? Jamie!

7
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,570
爸爸
Dad!

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,500
-你替他辯護  -你跟我一樣清楚
- You're defending him. - You know as well as I do,

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,050
無論好壞  每個人都有權申辯
for good or bad, everyone deserves a defence.

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,660
伯頓先生不能以律師身份出庭
Mr Burton will not be in court.

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,080
他是目擊者  無論如何都不能代表檢方
As he's a witness, he cannot act for the Crown in any way.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,920
所以他只能看著
So he just has to watch.

13
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,750
福伊爾有個儲物間  有人幫他接管了
Foyle had a storage unit. Someone took it on after him.

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,720
要是調查沒有進展
If something's not turning up,

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,900
就意味著你要換個角度入手
you need to look for it somewhere else.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,270
你當天晚上做的晚餐是什么
And what did you make for dinner that night?

17
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,910
奶油培根意面
Spaghetti carbonara!

18
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,080
我應該更拼命地跟他打
I should've fought him harder.

19
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,990
杰米  你在說什么
Jamie, What are you saying?

20
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,050
我抓傷了他的頭
I scratched his head.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,490
你用手去抓他了
You scratched him with your hands?

22
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,310
-然后我躲起來了  -你挪過位置
- And then I hid. - You moved?!

23
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,330
法醫在小屋里找到了DNA
"The forensic team just found DNA at the cottage."

24
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,480
福伊爾的DNA嗎
Foyle's?

25
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,090
他們想見面談
"They want to meet."

26
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,360
你在發現妻子的震驚和悲傷之中
In the shock and trauma of finding your wife,

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,020
你看向窗外  看到一個男人
you look up at the window and see a man

28
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,030
如果此人消失  則對你非常有利
whose absence from your life would be very useful indeed,

29
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,440
但并不是他  對嗎  伯頓先生
but it wasn't that man, was it, Mr Burton?

30
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,250
只是你希望是他
You just wanted it to be.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,840
-謝謝  早安  -早安  蘭伯特醫生
- Thanks. Morning! - Good morning, Doctor Lambert.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,290
對不起我遲到了  給我提個醒兒
Sorry I'm late. Remind me...

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,450
-低數值DNA  凱特·伯頓  -想起來了
- Low-count DNA. Kate Burton. - Oh, yeah.

34
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,360
今天的證詞要簡短直接
Straight and short this morning.

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,570
他們會在低數值上面為難你
They'll try and trip you on the low count.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,390
回答簡潔明了就好
Keep your answers simple.

37
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,370
謝謝提醒  這種事我已經做過三四百次了
Thanks for the tip. I've only done this three or 400 times.

38
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,510
這種分析是否可以證明
Did this analysis prove conclusively

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,120
在小屋發現的DNA
that the DNA discovered in the cottage

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,560
與某個人的DNA吻合
matches that of a particular individual?

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,800
-可以  -與誰的DNA吻合
- It did. - Whose DNA did the sample match?

42
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,960
我們發現該DNA與利亞姆·福伊爾先生吻合
We matched the sample to the DNA of Mr Liam Foyle.

43
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,090
我們的檢測過程十分嚴格
We are very stringent about our quality controls.

44
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,430
對于工作向來一絲不茍
We take our job extremely seriously.

45
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,280
這樣我們就放心了
That is very reassuring.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,680
去年檢察署起訴福伊爾先生時
Were you responsible for analysing

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,670
是你們負責檢驗案子的DNA樣本嗎
DNA samples in connection with Crown vs Foyle last year?

48
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,350
我想是的
I believe so.

49
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,920
你想是的
You believe so?

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
是我們負責的
Yes, we were.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,120
為了做那份檢驗  我委托人的DNA樣本
And in order to do that, samples of my client's DNA

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,510
會被送到你們實驗室進行分析檢測  對吧
would've been sent to and processed by your lab, is that correct?

53
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,250
-是的  有個...  -謝謝
- Well, yes, there's a...  - Thank you.

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,610
所以當時我委托人的DNA 
So my client's DNA, at that time,

55
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,270
如同老房子里的灰塵
would've been effectively distributed

56
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,680
撒滿了你們的實驗室  對吧
throughout that lab like dust through an old house?

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,520
-法官閣下  -我想你的問話是有目的的吧
- My Lord! - I take it this is leading somewhere?

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,260
馬上就說到了  法官閣下
I'm just arriving now, My Lord.

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,210
蘭伯特醫生  我有份你們實驗室的宣誓證詞
Dr Lambert, I have a sworn statement from your laboratory

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,750
其中指出本月12日  所有的無菌房
that confirms a deep clean was performed in all clean-room areas

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,910
都進行了一次徹底清理
on the 12th of this month.

62
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,680
-你提前進行了清理  為什么  -搞什么
- You brought the schedule forward. Why was that? - Oh, come on!

63
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,000
梅菲爾德先生
Mr Mayfield...

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,780
蘭伯特醫生  請回答
Dr Lambert, if you please...

65
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,700
我們定期進行清理
We conduct regular cleaning.

66
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,460
最近決定要增加
We recently decided to increase

67
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,730
-清理次數  -為什么要提前進行
- the number of cleans... - Why was the schedule brought forward?

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,400
我注意到你們的日常清理都是
I notice that your cleaning schedule is normally

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,440
嚴格按規定執行的  所以肯定有事發生
enacted on a clear and regulated basis, so something must've happened.

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
有這個必要
It was necessary.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
你們是否正在實驗室里
Are you or are you not in the process of an internal investigation

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,180
針對污染程度進行內部調查
into the viability of contaminants within the laboratory?

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,630
請回答是或不是
Please answer yes or no.

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,800
但我怎么回答...
But you can't answer...

75
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,620
是
Yes.

76
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,420
你是擔心你們的錯誤率過高嗎
Are you concerned about your failure rate?

77
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,530
我是不是...誰不擔心錯誤率的問題
Am I...? Everyone's concerned about their failure rate!

78
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,990
-整個行業都擔心  -謝謝
- It's an industry-wide concern! - Thank you.

79
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,690
法官閣下  我們先前可不知道這個
My Lord, this is new information.

80
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,470
確實應該早些公布出來
It should've been disclosed, certainly.

81
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,680
毫無疑問的是
What's clear beyond doubt is,

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,970
該DNA證據是完全不能采信的
this DNA evidence is utterly compromised.

83
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,770
-你得阻止她  -有點為時過晚
- You have to stop her. - It's a wee bit late for that.

84
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,050
她那是顛倒黑白  混淆是非
She's twisting the facts around to make them wrong.

85
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,690
倒是干得挺不錯的
Doing a good job of it, too.

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,430
要是沒有DNA證據  我們還有什么
If we don't have this DNA, then what do we have?

87
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,250
麻煩
A problem.

88
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,550
奶油培根意面
Spaghetti carbonara

89
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,530
餐后甜點是北極雪卷
and an Arctic roll for afters.

90
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,240
莫里斯女士  那是辯方關心的問題
Miss Morris, that's a matter for defence counsel.

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,320
我只想問你儲物間搜查的結果
All I want to ask you about is the search of your storage unit,

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,100
而不是不在場證明  盡管不怎么樣
not the defence alibi, such as it is.

93
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,590
-請如實回答我的問題  -法官閣下
- Please stick to the matter at hand. - My Lord!

94
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,810
趕緊問  梅菲爾德先生
Get on with it, Mr Mayfield.

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,610
莫里斯女士  你租了儲物間嗎
Miss Morris, you maintain a contract with this storage facility?

96
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,980
是的
I do, yes.

97
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,540
幾天前警方搜查你的儲物間時
And when these premises were searched by the police a few days ago,

98
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,200
發現了一雙12號的靴子
a pair of size-12 boots was recovered from your unit,

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,760
-是嗎  -是的  在另一個儲物間
- isn't that right? - Yes, er, the other unit.

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,660
是你的靴子嗎  對你來說好像有點大啊
Are these your boots? They seem rather large for you!

101
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,070
什么另一個儲物間
What other unit?

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,380
法官閣下  這是新證據
My Lord, this is new information!

103
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,770
所有新證據昨天都已經告知辯方律師了
All new information was given to my learned friend yesterday.

104
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,640
證物連續性  法官閣下
Chain of continuity, My Lord...

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,930
庭警
Usher.

106
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,820
那是針對艾琳·莫里斯儲物間內物品的搜查令
The warrant was for Eileen Morris's possessions in the storage unit.

107
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,840
-他們無權搜查F38  只有F37  -如果
- They had no authority to search F38. Only F37. - If...

108
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
搜查F38是不合法的
The search of F38 was unlawful.

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,770
如果辯方對證物有疑問
If defence had a problem with the evidence,

110
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,770
應該在適當時間提出
they should've argued it at the appropriate time.

111
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,610
我們剛得知此事
The issue has only just come to light.

112
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,920
福伊爾以前用過F37的事實與本案有關
Foyle's previous use of F37 connects him to it.

113
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,570
符合證物連續性
It falls within the chain of continuity.

114
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,870
F38則是完全不相關的
F38 was entirely separate!

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,020
法官閣下  我理所應當請您
Judge, obviously I will ask you

116
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,050
依照第78條排除這一非法物證
to exclude this evidence under Section 78.

117
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,280
它們就挨在一起  這...
It was the unit next door! It...

118
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,960
對于你的請求  我當然同意
And should you request, I will no doubt accede.

119
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,640
那我建議  法官閣下
Then, I respectfully submit, My Lord,

120
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,980
無須答辯
there is no case to answer.

121
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,610
由于缺乏可信證據
In the absence of any viable evidence

122
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,700
明明有令人信服的證據
There is compelling evidence!

123
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,810
目擊者證詞來自一個傷心的人
The eyewitness evidence of a broken man,

124
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,850
獨自在黑暗中  情緒失常
alone and devastated in the dark...

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,200
我聽過了辯方律師
Having heard arguments from counsel

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,820
就本次庭審中證據可信度的意見
as to the strength of the evidence at this stage of the trial,

127
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,910
作出以下結論
I have concluded the following...

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,770
供陪審團參考
There is insufficient evidence

129
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,180
繼續庭審的證據不足
for the case to continue for your consideration.

130
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,070
因此我建議
For that reason, on my direction,

131
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,700
你們可作出無罪判決
you will return a verdict of not guilty.

132
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,960
根據法官閣下的建議
On His Lordship's direction,

133
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,230
你們認為被告有罪嗎
do you find the defendant not guilty?

134
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,650
無罪
Not guilty.

135
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,230
-是陪審團的一致裁決嗎  -是的
- And is that the verdict of you all? - Yes.

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,410
全體起立
All rise.

137

福伊爾先生  你可以離開被告席了

謝謝你  我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

141

不客氣  保重
Pleasure. Take care.

142
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,730
你沒事吧  伙計  抱歉  腳滑了
Are you all right there, mate? Sorry, my foot slipped.

143
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,290
你沒事吧
Are you all right? Yeah?

144
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,690
杰米
Jamie...

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,980
她成功了  開酒
Ah, she blows! Pull!

146
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,240
表現完美  一級棒
A consummate performance. First class.

147
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,780
這是給你的
This is for you.

148
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,420
你值得擁有
I believe you've earned it.

149
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,850
還有酒哦
Pretty juicy, too!

150
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,610
謝謝
Ooh! Thank you.

151
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,420
-瓦迪姆  -失陪一下
- Vadim! - Excuse me.

152
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,650
威爾先生
Mr Will.

153
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,190
你看起來不錯
You're looking well.

154
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,000
你妻子的事我很遺憾
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,320
-謝謝  -有什么能幫忙的...
- Thank you. - If there is anything I can do for you...

156
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,140
你幾點下班
What time do you finish work?

157
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,470
我克隆得很快
I clone it fast.

你要的地名  本阿力金
The name you wanted - Beinn Alligin.

162
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,470
抱歉  我就想過來...
Hi. Look, sorry, I just wanted to come and...

163
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,790
我也不知道我到底來干什么
I'm not sure why I came, actually.

164
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,800
那人就是那個誰嗎
Was that who I think it was?

165
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,140
我以為你開慶功會去了
I thought you'd be out celebrating.

166
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,230
沒有
No, just...

167
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,840
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
-只是...  -你的工作
- It's just... - Your job.

169
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,260
我沒有惡意
Look, no hard feelings.

170
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,030
-我想說...  -你自己小心吧  瑪吉

171
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,380
我能...
Can I...

172
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,130
我今晚能去你那兒嗎
Can I come round tonight, please?

173
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,420
我好害怕
I'm freaking out!

174
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,490
我認為這太不合適了
"I think this is most inappropriate."

175
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,120
得了吧  你還認為
Oh, come on, think...

176
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,790
他怎么知道的  他不可能知道
How did he know? There's no way he could've known!

177
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,780
如果你那么擔心
"If you're that concerned,

178
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,490
-我建議你打電話叫警察  -天哪
- I suggest you call the police." - Oh, God!

179
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,030
天哪  我剛才完全...
Oh, God, I've just completely...

180
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,040
我們還有機會可以上訴
We have a window for appeal.

181
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,490
-可能現在不行  但是...  -得了吧
- Maybe not now, but... - Come on!

182
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,610

- No, optimism was never... - Forget it. We lost.

183

威爾
Will!

185
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,340
要來嗎
Are you coming?

186
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,060
-我以前都不知道這地方  -是啊
- I never knew about this place. - Yeah,

187
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,380
凱特的堂兄偶爾借我們一用
Kate's cousin lets us use it every now and again.

188
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,540
不如開瓶酒  想喝嗎
Cracking bottle of wine inside, if you're interested?

189
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,970
找你可真是大費周章
It took some real sleuthing to find you.

190
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,330
你知道我的行事風格  華生
You know my methods, Watson.

191
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,560
-紅的還是白的  -你選
- Red or white? - Er... You chose.

192
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,060
你怎么樣  丹尼
How are you, Danny?!

193
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,870
見了你感覺好多啦  哥們
All the better for seeing you, mate!

194
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,880
-幫忙倒進鍋里  -活的喲
- Pop those in the pot, would you? - That's alive, alive.

195
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,330
活的才對嘛
Now you're talking.

196
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,070
你煮面我做醬料
Ah, here! You pasta, me sauce.

197
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,970
這不需要許可證嗎
Don't you need a permit for those?

198
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,770
潮區打漁是公共權利  1863年馬爾科森
Public right to fish in tidal waters - Malcomson v O'Dea, 1863,

199
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,970
之前還有大憲章
before that, the Magna Carta.

200
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,060
說實話  大憲章里從未提過
To be fair, it's not mentioned at

201
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,020
只是大家都這么以為而已
all in the Magna Carta, everyone just thinks it was.

202
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,770
所以嚴格來講  我們現在是在違法
So strictly speaking, right now, we just broke the law.

203
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,560
準確地說  是你違法
Well, to be precise, you did!

204
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
可你現在也是從犯
Except now, you're an accessory.

205
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,130
那我呢
What about me?

206
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,700
-大概只會警告  -多謝了
- Probably just a caution. - Thanks!

207
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,480
不客氣
You're very welcome!

208
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,900
別唧唧歪歪了  快倒酒
Stop crying and pour some wine.

209
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,910
更別提民事訴訟
Not even a civil suit!

210
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,740
不要往那方向想了
We're not going in that direction.

211
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,760
就算我們告倒他  也沒人是贏家
Even if we get him, no-one wins.

212
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,980
又不能讓她起死回生
It's not going to bring her back.

213
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,430
那我們就這么坐著
So, we're just going to sit here, then?

214
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,710
你最近還忙嗎
Are you keeping busy?

215
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,340
有份事務所經理的工作
I've been offered Chambers Manager at Citadel.

216
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,750
曼徹斯特那邊
Manchester.

217
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,020
你知道那邊怎么對待女王公園巡游者的粉絲吧
You do know what they do to QPR supporters there, don't you?!

218
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,640
讓你受牽連我真抱歉  丹尼
I'm sorry you had to take that fall, Danny.

219
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,530
你突然消失我們可都擔心了一陣子
You had us all worried for a minute, disappearing like that.

220
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,900
為什么
Why's that?

221
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,690
你一向井井有條的
You always seem so planned.

222
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,180
你是沒瞧見我接送孩子上下學
You haven't seen the school run.

223
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,440
閑著不做事不是你的風格
I mean, it's not like you to do anything on the fly.

224
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,460
這才是我  丹尼
Well, that's me all over, Danny.

225
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,980
處處驚喜
I'm just full of surprises.

226
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,080
到愛丁堡要多久
How long does it take to get to Edinburgh?

227
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,940
照你這樣開車  十分鐘
Ten minutes, the way you drive.

228
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,550
別開得飛起來
Try not to take off, OK.

229
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,020
我會盡快回來  替我照顧好奶奶
I'll be back as soon as I can. Look after Granny for me.

230
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,260
-爸爸  -說
- Dad... - Yeah?

231
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,360
你在發抖
You're shaking.

232
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,150
如果你真的考慮過來
Look, I mean, if you really were thinking of coming here,

233
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,900
我們當然非常樂意有你加入
we'd, obviously, be very interested in having you join the set.

234
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,370
不  我來看看  我家人需要換個環境
No, I'm actively looking. My family needs a change of scene so...

235
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,910
全家來住  這可是個好地方
Oh, well, for families, it's a lovely place!

236
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,500
您在這期間不妨租車四處轉轉
You should rent a car and drive around a bit while you're here,

237
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,020
-看看風景  -我或許會的
- see the scenery. - I might just do that.

238
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,340
-要點兒什么  -可以借用下洗手間嗎
- What would you like? - Hi. Do you mind if I use your loo?

239
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,110
多謝
Thanks.

240
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,070
如今的法律怎么界定私闖民宅
What's the law on home invasion these days?

241
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,540
我有點兒不清楚了
I'm a little cloudy.

242
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,570
在自己家中受到陌生人驚嚇
What's a proportionate response to someone

243
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,500
正常的是什么反應
surprised in their home by a stranger?

244
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,930
我有事要問你
I need to ask you something.

245
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,680
我在臉書上
I'm on Facebook.

246
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,900
我知道
I know.

247
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,920
你都來了
You're here now,

248
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,310
想問我什么就問吧
so you can ask me whatever you like.

249
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,710
你什么時候打定主意要殺我妻子的
When did you decide to kill my wife?

250
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,810
拜托了  我想知道
Please, I need to know.

251
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,210
你殺她時  她是不是很快就死了
When you killed her, did she die quickly?

252
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,010
你這是在和我玩角色扮演嗎
Are you playing a character? Are you?

253
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,930
你覺得你現在是居高臨下俯視眾生嗎
Are you all the way up there, looking all the way down here?

254
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,770
還是你覺得我有那么一點弱智
And do you think I'm a little bit stupid?

255
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,870
你這樣子就不對了
You're going about this all wrong.

256
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,410
這種事不是你最在行嗎
Well, you're the expert.

257
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,410
你什么時候決定要殺我妻子的
When did you decide to kill my wife?

258
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,280
你的腦子啊
You and your brain!

259
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,430
近距離看過大腦嗎
Have you ever seen a brain up close?

260
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,110
樣子就像一顆花椰菜
It looks like a cauliflower.

261
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,910
大腦皮層就像糖霜一樣
The neural cortex looks like icing.

262
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,040
據說這一點區分了我們和動物
They say it's what separates us from the animals.

263
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,080
但我們也是動物  哺乳動物
But we are animals. We're mammals.

264
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,260
就像獅子
Like a lion.

265
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,600
你總不會怪一頭獅子野性難馴吧  威爾
You wouldn't blame a lion for being a lion, would you, Will?

266
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,300
而且還是你親手將他放出籠子的
Especially if you were the one who let him out.

267
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,050
你是怎么過下去的
How do you live with yourself?

268
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,790
自我諒解
I forgive myself.

269
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,770
你又是怎么過下去的
How do you live with yourself?

270
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,440
你還真是聰明
You're very clever!

271
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,780
我的筆
My pen...

272
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,920
快把筆拿來
Get the pen!

273
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,090
救護車
Ambulance.

274
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,890
是個橢圓的管子
It's an oval tube.

275
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,170
橢圓管  沒錯  沒錯
Oval tube! Yes! Yes!

276
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,340
-管身是灰色末端是橙色  -沒錯
- It's sort of grey with an orange end. - Yeah. That's it.

277
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,610
我現在開免提
I'm putting you on speaker.

278
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,530
-能聽到我說話嗎  -聽得到
- Can you still hear me? - Yes, I can hear you.

279
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,420
-管子拿好了嗎  -好了
- Are you holding the tube? - Yeah.

280
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,370
-用拳頭握緊管子  -好的
- Now put your fist around the tube. - OK.

281
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,200
把橙色尖端對準大腿
Hold the orange tip near the thigh.

282
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,180
-他穿著褲子  -針能刺進去
- He has his trousers on! - The needle will go through the cortex.

283
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,110
把橙色尖端對準大腿  另一只手
Hold the orange tip near his thigh, with your other hand

284
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,940
-把藍色的安全閥摘掉  -搞定
- pull off the blue safety release. - Ok. Done it.

285
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,250
現在把尖端用力刺進大腿直到聽到咔噠聲
Now, swing and firmly push the tip against the thigh until it clicks.

286
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,410
再保持十秒鐘  明白了嗎
And hold it there for ten seconds. Did you get that?"

287
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,760
刺進去  咔噠聲  等一會兒  我開始了
Swing, click, wait. OK. Here goes.

288
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,710
這是什么聲音
What was that?

289
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,900
應該是針桿裝置的聲音  里面裝了彈簧
You probably heard the needle mechanism. It's spring-loaded.

290
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,380
-好的  -腎上腺素筆里的藥劑
- OK. - The drug in the EpiPen

291
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,850
應該能在救護車到前保持他體征平穩
should keep him steady 'till the ambulance gets to you.

292
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,110
-你還在聽嗎  -在聽
- Are you still with me? - Yeah. I'm here.

293

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,110
-現在呢  -可以拿出來了
- What now? - OK, you can take it out.

295
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,900
看下針管  能看到紅色長條嗎
Look at the barrel. Is there a red strip visible on the barrel?

296
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,050
有的話就說明藥劑打進去了
That will tell you that the drug went in.

297
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,070
稍等下
Er, hang on. Hang on.

298
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,380
我看不清
I can't see it!

299
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,590
刻度上方有個小窗
Just above the writing, there's a window.

病人有反應嗎
Is the patient responding?

302
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,420
先生  先生  還在嗎

Can you hear me?

308
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,810
-沒什么大礙吧  -沒事  就被煙嗆了
- Are you all right? - Yeah, just a bit of smoke.

309
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,710
-只有你們兩個人嗎  -是的

- Is he going to be OK? - Bad shoulder bleed here.

312
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,650

Lucky your friend was there. He used your EpiPen.

321
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,830
我們還備了些腎上腺素供你使用  沒事
We've got some more adrenalin ready if you need it, all right?

322
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,370
一切都好  我知道現在呼吸很困難
Everything is OK. OK I know your breathing's not that easy,

323
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,820
我們五分鐘之內就會到醫院

327
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,470
很好  好的  老兄
OK, well done. All right, mate...

328
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,940
介意我把窗戶打開嗎
Mind if I open a window?

329
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,660
我有點想吐
I think I'm going to be sick.

330
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,180
他的心搏停止了
He's arrested in the back!

331
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,170
心搏停止了

Did you and Mr. Foyle have any interactions?

335
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,450
是的
Yes.

336
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,660
他襲擊了我  然后我刺傷了他
He attacked me and I stabbed him.

337
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,030
用這把刀
With this...

338
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,190
真讓人吃驚啊  對吧
Quite a shock, don't you think?

339
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,500
什么意思

Excuse me. Erm, does Vadim Kumarin still work here?

344
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,070
你知道他現在人在哪兒嗎  你知道
Do you know where he might be? Do you know...

345
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,520

歡迎來到蘇格蘭
Welcome to Scotland.

348
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,310
原來我在這里啊
Oh, is that where I am?!

349
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,840
怪不得周圍都是蘇格蘭人
I wondered why everyone was Scottish.

350
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,930
從檢察官那里傳來好消息
Some good news from the fiscal.

351
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,500
如果你依照第76條
They'd recommend acceptance

352
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,790
承認殺人罪  他們樂于接受
if you offered a Section 76 plea of culpable homicide.

353
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,650
應該能減免三成的刑罰
Probably a 30 percent discount on sentence.

354
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,960
最多被判入獄九年  六年后就能出獄
That's nine years at most. Out in six.

355
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,000
你說是好消息  因為什么
And that's good news because...?

356
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,600
因為你現在麻煩纏身
Because you're in serious trouble.

357
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,480
你想做無罪申辯嗎  這可是謀殺案的審判
If you're thinking of going not guilty, that's a murder trial!

358
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,780
公訴人會讓你死無葬身之地的
The Crown's going to be all out for your blood.

359
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,150
聽著  我替你起草了一份認罪書
Look, I typed up a draft plea offer for you.

360
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,740
這是一條出路
This is a choice.

361
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,680
你可以選擇無期
You've got life,

362
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,850
因謀殺罪最少入獄二十年
with a minimum of 20 years for murder,

363
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,300

六年就能出獄  還有機會看到你兒子畢業
do six years and see your son finish school,

365
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,720
而不是完全錯過他的成長
instead of missing the whole thing.

366
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,570
我一分一秒都不會錯過
I'm not missing a single second!

367
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,340
不要這樣  冷靜點
Don't be like this. Come on.

368
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,560
你得認真考慮下我的話
You need to seriously consider this.

369
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,820
-你認為人是我殺的嗎  -當然不
- Do you think I did it? - No!

370
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,670
不是
No.

371
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,130
我當然不這么想
Of course I don't.

372
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,300
確保你把這張紙扔了
Make sure you recycle that.

373
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,470
很感謝你過來  詹妮
I appreciate you coming down, Jen,

374
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,610
但我會為自己辯護
but I think I'll do it myself.

375
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,630
-你不能這么做  -我可以
- You can't.  - I can.

376
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,140
我完全可以勝任
In fact, I can do all of it myself.

377
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,270
不  你不行
No, you can't!

378
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,200
這里是蘇格蘭法律  你個笨蛋
This is Scots Law, idiot.

379
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,970
跟你所學的完全不一樣
There's a thousand differences.

380
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,340
《蘭頓和布朗  刑事訴訟程序》對吧
Renton & Brown, right?

381
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,700
突擊看一下就行
That's a punchy read.

382
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,460
你一直在努力幫我
You've always been there for me,

383
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,690
但很抱歉  我不需要你為我辯護
and I'm sorry, but this isn't going to work out.

384
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,230
你知道自己在干什么嗎
What do you think you are doing? Eh?

385
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,850
-我是想幫你  -我知道
- I'm trying to help you here! - I know.

386
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,780
謝謝你
Thank you,

387
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,770
但我自己來就行

388
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,050

克爾德森林中的一所房子內
in Kielder Forests in Scotland,

393
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,720

William Burton did assault Liam Michael Foyle

394
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,100
并用一把小刀刺傷了受害者
and did stab on the body with a knife

395
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,400
刀上含有一種物質

396
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,620
能對接受者造成嚴重傷害  即過敏反應

399
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,510
皇家檢察署正式起訴威廉·伯頓
Call the Diet of Her Majesty's advocate against William Burton.

400
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,340
在蘇格蘭法庭上不用做開庭致辭  伯頓先生
We have no opening speeches in Scottish courts, Mr. Burton,

401
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,570
以防你有打算開始演說
just in case you were planning on making one at this stage.

402
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,380
是嗎
Really?

403
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,970
伯頓先生  有人曾強烈勸說過你
Mr. Burton, you know you have been strongly advised

404
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,050
不要為自己辯護
against representing yourself.

405
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,830
我很清楚  法官閣下
It's been made very clear, My Lord.

406
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,970
很好
Very well.

407
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,400
我能把材料拿到律師席嗎
Er, can I move my papers to the table?

408
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,500
不行
No.

409
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,060
我在被告席上不太方便辯護  可以理解吧
I can't very well run my case from the dock, can I?

410
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,430
伯頓先生  那正是你將要做的
That, Mr. Burton, is exactly what you are going to do.

411
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,070
你在搞什么
What are you doing?

412
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,020
-這種過敏癥很常見嗎  -不常見
- Is this a common allergy? - Not really.

413
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,610
患者只對一種腹足類動物過敏
It's an allergy to a particular gastropod.

414
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,950
即笠貝
Specifically, limpets.

415
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,720
他對笠貝嚴重過敏嗎
He was deathly allergic to limpets?

416
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,290
具體說
Well more specifically,

417
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,740
是一種叫原肌球蛋白的活性蛋白質
an active protein known as tropomyosin.

418
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,720
那過敏原是從哪里來的
And where was this allergen?

419
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,860
福伊爾先生是怎么接觸到的
How did Mr. Foyle come into contact with it?

420
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,320
傷口附近的局部腫脹說明
Localised swelling at the wound site suggest

421
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,920
應該是他死前被刺傷時
it may have been present on the weapon

422
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,010
由兇器進入他體內的
used to injure him before he died.

423
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,290
謝謝你  醫生
Thank you, doctor.

424
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,570
伯頓先生
Mr Burton?

425
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,470
沒有問題  謝謝法官閣下
No, thank you, My Lord.

426
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,730
伯頓先生  你想必清楚
Mr Burton, you are aware, of course,

427
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,480
一旦你為自己作證
that once you give evidence on your own behalf,

428
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,320
你需要接受檢察官的交叉詢問
you are opening yourself up to cross-examination by the Crown?

429
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,480
非常清楚  法官閣下
Very well aware, My Lord.

430
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,910
-現在呢  -可以拿出來了
- "What now?" - "OK, you can take it out.

431
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,690
看下針管  能看到紅色長條嗎
"Look at the barrel. Is there a red strip visible on the barrel?

432
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,130
有的話就說明藥劑打進去了
"That will tell you that the drug went in."

433
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,070
稍等下
"Er, hang on. Hang on.

434
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,240
我看不清
"I can't see it!"

435
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,480
刻度上方有個小窗
"Just above the writing, there's a window."

436
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,670
沒錯  找到了  在這兒
"Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes, it's there!"

437
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,400
病人有反應嗎
"Is the patient responding?"

438
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,830
先生  先生  還在嗎  有人在聽嗎
"Sir? Sir? Hello? Anybody hear me?"

439
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,710
這期間你似乎非常冷靜
You appear to be very calm during this interaction.

440
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,760
-是不是  -我試圖保持冷靜
- Were you? - I was trying to be.

441
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,990
你在克爾德森林做什么  伯頓先生
What were you doing in Kielder Forest, Mr Burton?

442
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,020
我在卡萊爾面試工作
I had a job interview in Carlisle.

443
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,180
面試官建議我四處轉轉
The person I spoke to suggested I tour around a bit.

444
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,120
你參加面試時都帶著刀嗎
Do you normally conduct job interviews with a knife?

445
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,400
我娶了一把刀
I got married with a knife.

446
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,680
每個穿短裙的蘇格蘭人都娶了一把刀
Every Scotsman worth his kilt gets married with a knife.

447
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,270
你遇見福伊爾先生純屬巧合嗎
You bumped into Mr Foyle by pure chance?

448
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,180
是的  我在一家酒吧看見他
Yes. I saw him in a pub

449
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,710
我迫切地感到應該和他談談
and I felt compelled to confront him.

450
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,410
你找到了他  想要他認罪
You sought him out to force a confession.

451
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,040
對不對
Isn't that correct?

452
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,910
是的
Yes.

453
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,950
-是嗎  -是的  沒錯
- Yes? - Yes, that's right.

454
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,060
一罪不二審  哪怕是有新證據
Double jeopardy law, pertaining to new evidence.

455
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,560
我認為伯頓先生已經回答了你的問題
I believe Mr Burton has answered the question.

456
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,330
法官閣下
My Lord.

457
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,380
要他認罪
A confession -

458
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,650
這是你最大的愿望
something that you would've desired very much.

459
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,860
-是的  -當他拒絕了你的要求
- Yes. - And yet when he denied you this request,

460
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,390
你就殺了他
you took his life.

461
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,620
-沒有  -你勃然大怒
- No. - You flew into a rage

462
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,830
用小刀襲擊了他  對不對
and attacked him with a knife, didn't you?

463
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,200
-你說什么時候  -你用小刀砍傷了他
- When was this, sorry? - When you slashed him with the knife,

464
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,060
你在供詞里說得很清楚
as you've said clearly in your statement!

465
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,070
是啊  在我把他背出火場之前
Oh, yes, before I carried him out of a burning building.

466
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,470
伯頓先生
Mr Burton!

467
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,250
我只是確認一下時間先后
Just being clear on chronology.

468
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,120
你是在耍小聰明
Flying close to the sun.

469
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,740
腹足類動物過敏
A gastropod allergy,

470
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,680
一種貝類
a specific kind of shellfish -

471
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,330
這不是輕易能得到的信息
not exactly easy information to find out.

472
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,900
我同意
No, I'd imagine not.

473
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,080
你看過委托人的醫療記錄嗎
Have you ever had cause to access a client's medical records?

474
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,870
看過  如果與案件有關的話
Yes, though only if pertinent to the case.

475
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,600
桑德拉·馬林斯一案中
In the case of Sandra Mullins,

476
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,600
-你曾為福伊爾先生辯護  -是的
- you were lead counsel for Mr Foyle's defence. - I was.

477
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,060
你調查過福伊爾先生的醫療信息嗎
Did you ever request any medical information regarding Mr Foyle?

478
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,220
-沒有  -沒有嗎
- No. - You did not?

479
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,230
沒有  我沒接觸過這類文件
No, I did not access his files.

480
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,690
我認為他的回答足夠充分
I believe his "No" was sufficient.

481
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,110
法官閣下  你顯然無法證明這點
My Lord. You cannot prove this, of course.

482
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,030
他是你的委托人
He was your client.

483
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,300
你對他的資料非常了解
You were intimately acquainted with his information.

484
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,330
不  機密醫療文件
No. Erm... Confidential medical files are

485
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,750
全部數字化  被安全保存在事務律師那里
all digitised and kept securely at the solicitors,

486
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,310
想必在他的醫生和醫院也同樣安全
or, presumably, equally securely at his doctors or hospital.

487
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,050
啰嗦這么多  我其實是說沒有
Which is a long-winded way of saying no,

488
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,610
我沒看過他的醫療記錄
I did not access his files,

489
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,210
而且  我可以證明
and, yes, I can prove it.

490
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,290
伯頓先生想要的
What Mr Burton is asking of you

491
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,890
非常簡單  女士們先生們
is very simple, ladies and gentlemen.

492
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,810
他想讓你們相信他編的故事
He wants you to believe his little story.

493
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,370
他想讓你們相信
He wants you to believe

494
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,810
一切都是命運的作弄
that through an ironic twist of fate,

495
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,650
那把錯誤的小刀
this was the wrong knife,

496
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,820
在錯誤的人手里
in the wrong hand,

497
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,960
闖進了錯誤的時間
at the wrong time.

498
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,430
我敬告各位
I respectfully submit to you

499
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,550
他說的一切純屬虛構
that this is pure fabrication.

500
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:23,040
這種先見之明  有著惡毒的目的
This was foreknowledge, with malicious intent.

501
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,160
隨他怎么說  但我要問
He will tell you otherwise, but I ask only this question -

502
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,070
他講了個動聽的故事
he tells a good story,

503
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,920
但我們真的相信他嗎
but do we really believe him?

504
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,330
我是個律師
I'm a lawyer.

505
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,750
我一生信奉法律
I have lived and believed in the law all my life.

506
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,230
但當法律降臨在你頭上
But until the law happens to you,

507
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,500
相信我  你會無所適從
believe me, you don't know which way you're going to go.

508
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,760
我在小屋面對面見到的那個人
The man I faced in that cabin

509
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,510
就是謀殺我妻子的兇手  這毫無疑問
is the man I know, beyond all doubt, murdered my wife.

510
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,390
面對這個人  我本可以有很多選擇
I could've done a lot of things to him.

511
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,460
但是
Instead,

512
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,860
我看到了他的痛苦  為他叫了救護車
I saw him suffer and I called an ambulance.

513
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,220
我挽救他于危險之中
I removed him from danger.

514
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,240
我做了所有正派人都會做的事情
I did what any decent human being should do.

515
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,380
但請不要誤會  我做這些事情
But make no mistake, I did those things

516
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,010
僅僅是出于基本的良心和純粹的道義
out of nothing more than a sincere duty to our common decency.

517
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,740
我這么做  因為這是世上每一個人
I did so because that's what's expected

518
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,610
所應當做的
when you're a person in the world.

519
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,510
我冒險救的這個人  他帶走了我的摯愛
I risked my life to save the man who took away my heart...

520
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,800
我人生的向導
..my compass,

521
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,500
我生活的重心
my anchor,

522
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,090
也是我最好的朋友
my best friend.

523
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,000
他在我面前倒下時  我手里正有一把刀
I faced him down with a knife in my hand,

524
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,440
我本可以任他燒死
I could've let him burn!

525
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,180
在這種情況下  我相信
In the circumstances, I believe

526
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,000
我表現出了非凡的克制力
I exerted an extraordinary amount of restraint.

527
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,890
利亞姆·福伊爾死了
Liam Foyle is dead.

528
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,930
我對他的死亡感到高興
I rejoice in his passing.

529
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,050
但是你不能說我是謀殺他的兇手
But you should not convict me of his murder.

530
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,200
-威爾  -這個是你的
- Will! - That's your one.

531
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,160
威爾
Will.

532
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,190
你好
Oh, hi!

533
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,390
很意外
OK, interesting...

534
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,720
我想和你談談
I wanted to talk to you.

535
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,230
如果我是你就快點說
I'd hurry up if I were you,

536
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,600
你知道陪審團什么樣
you know what juries can be like.

537
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,250
他們不可能深思熟慮
They can't deliberate forever.

538
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,240
你感覺怎么樣
How are you feeling?

539
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,180
我感覺怎么樣
How am I feeling?

540
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,920
當你知道發生的事情后
When you heard what happened.

541
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,140
拜托  你沒有一點釋然的感覺嗎
Come on, you weren't just a wee bit relieved?

542
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,260
我需要和你談談
I need to talk to you.

543
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,910
-精神支持嗎  -是法律意見
- Moral support? - Legal advice.

544
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,780
我一直糾結于一個案子  真的讓我很頭疼
I've been grappling with a case that's been bothering me,

545
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,510
不知道你能不能幫幫我
and wondered if you could help.

546
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,660
我馬上回來
Be right back.

547
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,950
說吧
Shoot.

548
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,040
前幾天我想起了一些事
Something occurred to me the other day...

549
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,510
如果你想打開保險箱
If you wanted to break into a safe,

550
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,110
你第一個要找的人就是鎖匠
the first person you'd call is a locksmith, and, um,

551
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,830
如果你想謀殺又想脫罪的話
if you wanted to commit murder and get away with it,

552
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,390
你也許希望和一個刑事律師談談
you might just want to talk to a criminal barrister.

553
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,630
這是個有趣的想法
That's an interesting idea.

554
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,200
我看過了太多的案件
I see enough cases turn on

555
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,090
最后發現完美的犯罪之所以完美
discovery to know that a perfect crime only stays perfect

556
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,470
是因為它們看似顯而易見  對嗎
if it's done in plain sight, wouldn't you say?

557
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,240
可能吧
Could be.

558
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,230
可能所有人都知道真相了  但還是不知道
Everyone would have all the facts and still have no idea

559
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,850
他到底是怎么做的
how he really did it.

560
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,560
第一步  他找到了要害
Step one - he'd find the Achilles heel.

561
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,460
致命的過敏癥  很罕見的一種
A deathly allergy, say. A rare one.

562
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,900
這個人是怎么發現這件事的
How did this person find out something like that?

563
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,910
刑事律師整天都在做什么
What does a criminal barrister do all day long?

564
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,450
-追蹤單據  -和犯人談話
- Chase invoices. - Talk to criminals.

565
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,150
這不就可以有一本通訊簿
Wouldn't that give him an address book,

566
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,880
寫滿了潛在的線人嗎
full of potential contacts?

567
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,770
以我現在正在辦的案子為例
For example, on the case that I'm working on,

568
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,190
有人目擊到嫌疑人和一個人盡皆知的罪犯談話
the man was seen talking to a known criminal.

569
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,680
怎么確定那個人是他  我是說那個罪犯
How would the person be sure it was him? The criminal, I mean.

570
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,140
當然了  我假設是男的
Presuming it was a he, of course...

571
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,140
他對目擊者來說很熟悉
He was well-known to the eyewitness.

572
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,480
但是當時是白天還是晚上呢
Yeah, but was it day or night?

573
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,550
他是步行還是在車里
Was he on foot, in a vehicle?

574
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,990
目擊者有沒有承受任何壓力
Was the observer under any stress at all?

575
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,680
第二步
Step two -

576
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,310
假設他找到了一個天然的過敏原
what if he found a natural-occurring source for the allergen,

577
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,640
在一個平凡而又日常的去處
somewhere innocent and every day?

578
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,210
如果他們想被判正當防衛
If they argue self-defence,

579
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,180
他們可能會給兇器裝載過敏原
they might load up a weapon with that allergen

580
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,900
達到一定劑量
to administer the dose.

581
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,540
我聽著呢
I'm with you so far.

582
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,330
但是要完全依靠
But to put so much weight on one

583
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,570
一個劑量的過敏原是不夠的  你認為呢
dose of allergen might not be enough, don't you think?

584
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,190
我壓根就不了解這件事
I wouldn't know the first thing about it.

585
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,360
第三步
Step three -

586
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,450
過敏癥會引起過敏反應  而患有
these people with allergies of such severity

587
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,340
如此嚴重過敏癥的人
that they cause anaphylaxis,

588
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,080
他們都會隨身攜帶一種救命的筆狀注射劑
they carry these little life-saving pens with them,

589
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,750
叫做腎上腺素筆  對嗎
don't they, called EpiPens?

590
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,090
你覺得有沒有可能將救命的筆
Do you think it might be possible

591
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,610
變成一支致命的筆呢
to repurpose a pen as a poison pen?

592
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,130
用含有過敏原的注射劑
By replacing the carrier solution

593
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,220
替換原來的注射劑
with a solution of allergen,

594
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,980
那人就能破壞挽救生命的急救藥物
a person might sabotage the very thing that would save a person's life.

595
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,620
-這太惡毒了  -可不是嗎
- That sounds diabolical. - It does, doesn't it?

596
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,320
-這是法律問題  -如果那個人撥打999
- You mentioned a legal question. - And if that person called 999,

597
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,320
{\an8}999  緊急電話

598
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,120
應急中心接線員說
and the emergency services said they

599
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,930
他們在對死者使用注射筆時一直在交談
talked them through administering that pen to the victim,

600
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,000
這可以說就是合謀作案
it's almost collusion in the crime.

601
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,950
他們那是在幫助兇手一步一步完成謀殺
They'd be walking that person, step by step, through the murder.

602
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,820
你是指他們有電話錄音備份
Oh, you mean they'd have a public record of the conversation.

603
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,910
-是的  -啊  可能有用
- Yes. - Ah, that might fly.

604
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,100
但不會真有人這么干吧
But I really don't think anyone would seriously attempt it.

605
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,450
-為什么  -謀殺是犯法的
- Why not? - I think murder's against the law!

606
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,950
上次我親眼所見
I mean, last time I looked...

607
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,250
-威爾  -你畫出了界線  一條大紅線
- Will... - You're drawing a line. A big red one.

608
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,790
知道界線的存在
There's a huge difference between

609
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,540
和跨過界線的差別是很巨大的
knowing where that line is and stepping over it.

610
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,840
我知道我不會
I know I couldn't.

611
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:55,740
為什么
Why not?

612
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,550
我害怕被抓住
I'd be scared of getting caught.

613
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,650
-你剛說這是完美犯罪  -是的
- You just said it was the perfect crime. - Oh, it is!

614
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:03,900
是啊
It is.

615
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,610
除了三點
Except for three things...

616
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,240
三點
Three?

617
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,020
是嗎
Really?

618
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,690
第一
One -

619
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,850
處理兇器
disposing the weapon.

620
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,080
有兩支腎上腺素注射筆  其中一支是兇器
There'd be two EpiPens, the innocent one and the murder weapon.

621
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,830
兇手在現場將正常的那支筆放電
The killer would have to discharge the innocent EpiPen at the locus

622
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,070
造成被使用的假象
so it looked like he'd done

623
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,360
就好像他真的按照接線員的提示做了
what he talked to the emergency services about.

624
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,710
接下來  我推測
Then I imagine he'd have to chuck

625
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,680
他必須把下過毒的注射筆扔進銳物垃圾袋
the poisoned EpiPen into the sharps disposal bags.

626
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,520
但還是有可能
But there's a chance it could be found

627
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,380
在燒毀前被警察搜到
before being incinerated if the police do a search.

628
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,860
很聰明
Ah! Very clever.

629
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,190
第二  事先需要弄到注射筆
Two - obtaining the pen in the first place.

630
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,200
他必須認識某個已經拿到處方的人
He'd have to know someone with a... with a prescription already.

631
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,700
說得好
Hm... Good point.

632
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,590
接下來是第三點
Oh, and then there's number three...

633
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,590
患者免疫球蛋白過敏
"Patient suffered IgE phylum Mollusca allergy,

634
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,540
引發支氣管痙攣和過敏反應
"severe bronchospasm and anaphylaxis and..."

635
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,980
"另據觀察"  這是寫在腳注里的
under 'Additional Observations', hidden away in the footnotes,

636
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,140
局部腫脹的部位有傷口
"..Some local swelling at wound...

637
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,750
和注射部位
"..And injection site".

638
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,270
你知道他們不會查死者的腎上腺素
But, you know, they don't test for epinephrine after death,

639
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,470
所以無從得知注射筆是否真的被使用
so there's no way of knowing if the EpiPen had been used or not,

640
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,830
除了通過針孔判斷
except for the puncture wound.

641
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,400
我的第三點就是
So my number three is this -

642
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,390
再次對注射孔進行組織學檢查
risk of a follow-up histology on local puncture site.

643
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,140
你很有想象力
You have a very creative mind.

644
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,960
如果那人知道隨時會進行尸檢
But would that person be able to sleep soundly,

645
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,440
在針孔處分析過敏原
knowing that at any moment, there might be another post-mortem

646
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,690
他還能睡踏實嗎
that identified allergen at the EpiPen site?

647
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,460
那要看情況
Well, I guess that depends...

648
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,470
什么情況
On what?

649
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,270
尸體是否火化
On whether the body's been cremated...

650
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,330
陪審團主席請起立
Can the foreman stand, please?

651
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,340
-你們達成裁決了嗎  -是的
- Have you reached a verdict? - We have.

652
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:36,160
對于皇家檢察署起訴威廉·伯頓犯謀殺罪一案
In the case of Her Majesty's Advocate against William Burton,

653
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,780
你們認為謀殺罪名是否成立
how do you find the accused on the charge of murder?

654
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,720
證據不足
Not proven.

655
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,120
好
Yes!

656
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,400
肅靜
Silence, please!

657
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,110
肅靜
Silence, please!

658
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,710
伯頓先生  你有何感想  伯頓先生
Mr Burton! Mr Burton! Any comments, Mr Burton?

659
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,810
證據不足
Not proven, of course,

660
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,780
蘇格蘭法律的第三裁決生效
the third verdict available in Scottish law.

661
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,480
最終無罪釋放
Effectively an acquittal,

662
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,430
但這仍然說明有犯罪...
but one which suggests a suspicion of guilt...

663
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,020
你認為自己能
Do you think you would've got away

664
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,880
逃脫英國的法律嗎  伯頓先生
with it in an English court of law? Mr Burton!

665
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,290
-保重  -你怎么看  伯頓先生
- Take care. - What have you got to say, Mr Burton?

666
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,170
好了
Ok...

667
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,960
低一點
..Hold it down.
