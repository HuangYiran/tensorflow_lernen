And "helping the cops" sounds better
而且,我之所以说『我在帮警察』是因为这话听起来要比...

1053
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,800
than "I've been driving aimlessly in my truck
『我开着车在四处游荡』要好得多是不是？

1054
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,340
'cause I don't know what the fuck else to do."
因为我不知道我他妈的还能做点什么

我以为你这么问是因为你也不知道

1065
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,700
'cause the asshole is guilty. Couldn't be that,right?

1066
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,200
'Cause that would mean it would be your fault,right?

Mr. Dover? What?
