1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,212
他们自称为Genii
They call themselves the Genii.

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,882
他们很淳朴，
但擅长农业和商业
They are a simple people,
but good farmers and fair traders.

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,592
离我们从新大陆那儿
We're still months away

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,094
获得收成还有几个月的时间
from producing successful crops on the mainland,

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,805
我们将面临食物短缺的状况
and we're heading towards a food shortage.

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,307
情况越来越糟了
It's getting desperate.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,683
我们的咖啡快用完了
We're almost out of coffee.

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:21,354
也许你该改一下每天喝11杯咖啡的习惯了
Well, maybe you should stop drinking 11 cups a day.

9
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,940
我只是想在咖啡用尽之前用完
自己应得的份额
I'm just making sure I get
my fair share before it's all gone.

10
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:25,983
听起来不错嘛
Sounds fair.

11
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,363
我完全赞成交易
但难道你们不认为
I'm all for trade, but don't you think we should find

12
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:32,198
我们该找到加强防御的方法吗？
a way to help defend ourselves?

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,242
一群农民怎么能做到这一点？
How can a bunch of farmers do that?

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,161
也许他们可以介绍些可以帮助我们的人
Well, maybe they can introduce us
to people who can help.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,664
同时，我们继续守卫好基地
In the meantime, let's take care of the basics.

16
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,124
我认为多了解下自己的邻居没有坏处
I guess it's always good to get to know your neighbors.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,002
Genii人的星际门在他们的村庄的不远处
The Genii's stargate is
a short distance from their village.

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,879
我们可以步行过去
I suggest we walk.

19
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,923
探险者号也许会让他们心生疑惑
The puddle jumper may alarm them.

20
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,175
正如我说的，他们是非常淳朴的
As I said, they are very simple.

21
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,010
看起来颇具挑战呀
Sounds like a mission.

22
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,819
好了
All right.

23
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,696
Teyla，我们现在去哪儿？
Where to, Teyla?

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,485
我们需要让他们靠近先我们
We should allow them to come to us.

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,908
如果你知道他们的村庄在哪里的话……
Well, if you know where the village is...

26
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,579
他们是非常淳朴的人，他们很信任我
但这种信任不是轻易获得的
They are simple people and they trust me,
but that trust was hard earned.

27
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,496
OK
Okay.

28
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,623
你上次说他们都种了些什么来着？
What is it you said they grow here, anyway?

29
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,336
很多啊，最出名的就是一种
叫做“塔瓦”的豆子
Many things, but they are best
known for a bean known as tava.

30
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,379
什么？爪哇？
What, java?

31
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:29,839
是塔瓦
Tava.

32
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,218
那他们怎么能知道我们到这儿了呢
How will they even know we're here, anyway?

33
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,887
他们已经知道了
They already do.

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,307
他们看起来很友好
They look friendly enough.

35
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,017
最老的一个叫做Tyrus
The eldest one is called Tyrus.

36
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,269
我已经有多次和他交易的经验
I've traded with him on many occasions.

37
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,441
Teyla Emmagan
Teyla emmagan.

38
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,109
Tyrus
Tyrus.

39
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,903
好久不见了
It has been many days.

40
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,987
是很久了
Too many.

41
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,030
Teyla
Teyla.

42
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,948
这位是……
This is...

43
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:57,533
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard,

44
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,534
McKay博士
Dr. Mckay,

45
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,244
还有Ford少尉
and lieutenant Ford.

46
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:01,746
我的女儿，Sora
My daughter, Sora.

47
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,457
有这么个女儿你一定很骄傲
You must be very proud.

48
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,002
她已经许配给人了
She is betrothed.

49
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,547
呃，我不是对你的女儿有意
我只是……
Well, I wasn't hitting on your daughter.
I just...

50
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,550
他们是来和你们交易的
They have come to trade for a share of your crops.

51
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,469
但你们带了武器
Yet you bring weapons.

52
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,596
我们只是自卫
Only to defend ourselves.

53
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,849
你穿和他们一样的服装是自愿的吗？
Do you dress as they do of your own accord?

54
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,518
当然，有问题吗？
Of course. Why?

55
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,771
他想知道你是和我们一伙的还是
帮我们的忙而已
He wants to know if you work with us or for us.

56
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,900
Tyrus，他们是我的朋友
These are my friends, Tyrus.

57
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:34,654
如果我觉得他们不值得成为你们的朋友的话
我是不会带他们来的
I would not have brought them if I did not
think them worthy to become yours.

58
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,324
我们带你们去见Cowen
We'll take you to see Cowen.

59
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,034
跟我来
Follow me.

60
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,963
也许我们应该多谢幽默感
Maybe we should offer a sense of humor in trade.

61
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,340
当然，你可以试试
Sure. They can have yours.

62
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,511
哦，伙计，别逗我了
Oh, please, my side.
You slayed me.

63
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,887
我正在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

64
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,849
我现在带他们进去
所有设备进入静音状态
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

65
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:06,006
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第8集 地下基地
Season 1 : Episode 8
Underground

66
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,341
这些药有效吗？
And these medicines are potent?

67
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,052
它可以用来完全防止细菌感染
They are capable of stopping
bacterial infections entirely.

68
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,304
对于度过寒冷的冬天极有帮助
It would help us through a harsh winter.

69
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,351
我们需要比你们提供的更多
We will need more than you offer.

70
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,393
更多？
More?

71
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,938
你们不知道这药有多灵
I don't think you understand how cool this medicine is.

72
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,731
如果不愿意的话你们可以离开
Well, leave if you wish.

73
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,066
离开？
Leave?

74
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,612
你不是说Genii人是很好的交易伙伴吗？
I thought you said the Genii were fair traders.

75
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:45,326
以前我们总是能谈一个
双方都能接受的价格
We have always been able
to achieve a reasonable bargain.

76
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,329
你们要我们收成的大部分
You ask for much of our harvest.

77
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,332
我们需要大量的种植新的作物来补充储藏
New crops will have to be
planted in sufficient quantities

78
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,377
否则饿死的就是我们Genii人
to replenish our stores,
or it is the Genii who will starve.

79
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,713
新作物的种植需要大量的新田地
That amount of planting will
require new land to be cleared.

80
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,342
开垦新田地是一项缓慢而艰苦的工作
Clearing more land is slow, hard work,
and it will lose us a great amount

81
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,845
而我们也将损失许多这个和下个季度
之间的时间
of growing time between now and
the next harvest season.

82
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,846
好吧
Okay.

83
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,431
如果我们能让开垦变得快而容易呢？
What if clearing land was fast and easy?

84
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,689
你们知道怎么能很快地
掘起一棵百年老树的深根吗？
You know a simple way of uprooting
the stump of a 300 year-old tree?

85
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,401
很不幸的告诉你……我知道
As a matter of fact... I do.

86
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,370
捂住你们的耳朵
Cover your ears.

87
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,456
为什么啊
I don't understand.

88
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,583
会有很大声音
It can be quite loud.

89
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,084
快点，否则你们会后悔的
Come on. You're going to wish you did.

90
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,086
少尉？
Lieutenant?

91
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,340
点火
Fire in the hole.

92
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,896
这叫C-4
It's called C-4.

93
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,153
如果你们可以给我们提供足够的C-4
If you can supply us with a sufficient quantity of C-4,

94
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,864
我们就能够向你们提供足够的作物
we will supply you with the crop you require.

95
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,824
那么，就不用那些药了？
So, this instead of the medicine?

96
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,076
药也要
As well as the medicine.

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,494
不会吧？
Really?

98
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,581
这还不够吗？
That wasn't impressive enough?

99
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,875
有需求的是你们
It is you who are in need.

100
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,882
那我得回去和他们商量一下
Well, I'll have to discuss this with my people.

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,926
我相信我们可以达成协议的
I'm sure we can come to terms.

102
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,096
Teyla，很感谢你给我们带来了
新的贸易伙伴
Teyla, thank you for bringing us
these new trading partners.

103
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,349
留下来，我们要好好款待你
Please stay as our guests.

104
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,644
我们稍后有个丰收庆典
There will be a harvest ceremony later.

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,689
棒极了
Wonderful.

106
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,608
Ford?
Ford?

107
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,692
长官？
Sir?

108
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,986
我们在说丰收庆典
We're talking harvest ceremony.

109
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,157
长官，听起来很有趣
Sounds like fun, sir.

110
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,326
我一会儿回来
I'll be back soon.

111
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,371
我要和少校回去一趟
I should go back with the major.

112
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,429
爆炸物？
Explosives?

113
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,473
少校，这可是科学探险
This is a scientific expedition, Major.

114
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,766
我知道
I know that.

115
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,768
但你现在正变成一个军火商
But you want us to become arms dealers.

116
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,687
那你可以用手把树根拔起吗？
Have you ever tried to clear a stump by hand?

117
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,438
可以啊，这是我的业余爱好
Yes. It's a hobby.

118
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,277
他们在考虑把今年收成的
大部分卖给我们
They are taking a chance by giving us
so much of their crop this year.

119
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,905
而且还要加上我上次同意的那些药品？
Plus the medicines I already agreed to?

120
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,036
少校，也许下次我该亲自参与谈判了
I think in the future, major,
I should do the negotiating.

121
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,038
我不是来先请示你了么
I did say I had to ask you first.

122
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:38,541
是啊，请示我那些你已经同意的条款
Uh-huh, to terms you already agreed to.

123
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,168
没错
Yes.

124
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,752
你知道我为什么有意见吗？
Do you see why I have a problem with this?

125
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,129
那我们还需不需要食物了？
Do we need food or not?

126
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,548
我们的配给快用完了
We are on the verge of rationing, and as much

127
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,885
而我也在尽力的在外星探险中寻找塔瓦
as I'd like to devote every off-world mission
to the pursuit of tava beans...

128
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,344
我明白你的意思了
I get your point.

129
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,388
告诉他们我们答应了
Tell them we agree.

130
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,818
我们为了这次丰硕的收成而感恩
We give thanks for a plentiful harvest.

131
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,278
我们感恩
We give thanks.

132
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,198
祝愿下个季节一样收成满满
May next season be as fruitful.

133
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,952
还有为我们的新朋友干杯
And to our new friends.

134
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,038
为新朋友干杯
To new friends.

135
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,837
自酿的烈酒？
Moonshine?

136
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,843
我还以为你够man呢
I thought you were man enough.

137
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,854
你不知道我们该怎么走，是吧？
You have no idea which way to go, do you?

138
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,147
我正寻找发现
Just trying to get my bearings.

139
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
也就是说，“我迷路了”
Translation, "I'm lost."

140
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,318
他们当时走的很果断
They were very clear which route to take.

141
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,736
我喜欢走直路
I prefer a straight line.

142
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,322
是啊，当然，Sheppard少校总能找到捷径
Yes, of course, because everything's
a shortcut in Sheppard's world.

143
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,199
OK，又来了
Okay, there it is again.

144
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,242
什么？
What?

145
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,788
我收到一个从那儿传来的奇怪的信号
I'm picking up a strange reading
from right over there.

146
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,333
怎么个奇怪法？
Define strange.

147
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,502
你不知道奇怪是什么意思吗？
You don't know what strange means?

148
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,962
Rodney，我知道奇怪是什么意思
I know what strange means, Rodney...

149
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,255
怪异，奇特，古怪……
Weird, freakish, odd...

150
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,299
我正在考虑是否值得让我们放弃
寻找回村庄的道路
I'm just trying to determine whether it's worth
getting off the route back to the village.

151
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,301
奇怪的放射信号，你说呢
Radioactive readings on amish world. You call.

152
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,679
——反正我们现在迷路了，不会有什么影响的
——我没有……
- We're lost anyway. What difference is it?
- I am not...

153
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,721
迷路
lost.

154
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,101
好吧，我们来查查看
All right, let's check it out.

155
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,182
哦，现在我们可以说，确实很
Oh, now, that is definitely

156
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,183
奇怪
Strange.

157
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,642
是啊，一点也不原始
Yeah, not that amish, really.

158
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,269
是啊，一点也不
No, not so much.

159
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,229
也许他们不知道有这个么玩意儿
在这
Maybe they don't even know it's here.

160
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,193
这个门最近上过油
This hatch has been oiled recently.

161
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,236
我们得查清楚
We have to check it out.

162
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,362
真的？
Really?

163
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,031
当然了
Of course we do.

164
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,296
好吧
All right.

165
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,380
太好了
Great.

166
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,640
这个建筑从技术角度来说很先进
The construction's architecturally advanced.

167
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,184
我认为这不是Genii人造的
I don't think the Genii could've made this.

168
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,728
我们必须告诉Ford我们在哪儿
We need to tell Ford where we are.

169
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,481
少尉，接进来
Lieutenant, come in.

170
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,400
Ford?
Ford?

171
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,903
这个地方有些像碉堡
This place is built like a bunker.

172
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,821
这一定是为了防护R-F的
It must be shielded for R-F.

173
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,823
这个方向的信号强一些
The reading's stronger this way.

174
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,911
什么信号
What kind of readings?

175
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,205
——手掌信号，这个……
——McKay
- Palm readings. Is that good...
- McKay.

176
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,623
这是中子辐射
It's neutron radiation.

177
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,459
这里显然有个能量源
It's definitely a... a powerful energy source.

178
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,002
OK
Okay.

179
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,129
我们来看看
Let's check it out.

180
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,008
我想我们离开这儿了
I really think we should get out of here.

181
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,249
现在这个才叫奇怪呢
Now, this is strange.

182
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,238
抱歉，我要先去解决一下问题
If you'll excuse me, I must go tend to a dispute.

183
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,907
没事吧，Cowen？
Is everything all right, Cowen?

184
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,450
我很快就回来的
I will return shortly.

185
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,169
也许他们以两种文明方式存在着
Maybe they exist as two separate cultures.

186
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,421
也许了
Maybe.

187
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,508
管它呢
Who cares?

188
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,803
你们打算让我们在这儿等多久？
How long are you boys planning on keeping us here?

189
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,099
如果你们可以把
You know, if people could just learn to keep their

190
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,310
地下基地隐藏的那么好……
secret underground hatches locked...

191
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,860
别在提什么两种不同的存在方式了
So much for two separate cultures.

192
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,539
我现在该怎么办？
What am I going to do?

193
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,590
我心里有种异样的感觉
I'm getting a weird vibe all of a sudden.

194
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,508
同意
I agree.

195
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,760
我从没见过Genii人像现在这样
I have never seen the Genii behave this way.

196
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,769
我们想出去看看
Listen, we're just going to step outside

197
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,605
Sheppard少校和McKay博士是否回来了
and see if Major Sheppard and Dr. Mckay are back.

198
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,148
你们不能离开这儿，外面不安全
No one must leave. It's not safe.

199
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,900
附近有幽灵船出没
There's a wraith ship in the area.

200
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,151
幽灵？
Wraith?

201
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,654
你们不是在开玩笑吧？
Are you serious?

202
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,576
我们要去给我们的伙伴报警
We need to warn our friends.

203
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,952
你们会把幽灵引到这儿来的
You will draw them to us.

204
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,037
所有人都必须留在屋子里
Everyone must stay indoors.

205
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,469
你可以小心一点吗？
Oh. Can we be careful with that?

206
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,680
它很，它很容易摔碎，如果……
It's just, it's rather fragile, and if it, uh...

207
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,851
我们有个问题
We have a problem.

208
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,979
那我们还算有些共同点了
Then we have something in common.

209
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,149
通常情况下，在你们发现了我们的秘密
之后就被射杀了
Normally, you would already have been
shot for discovering our secret.

210
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,152
那样的话，我们的人就会来这儿
向你们讨债
In which case, more of our people would
show up and question our disappearance.

211
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,279
我们只要说是幽灵干的就行了
We would simply tell them the Wraith took you.

212
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,448
因为无以对证
With no evidence to the contrary,

213
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,949
他们只能相信我们
they would believe us.

214
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,494
你刚才想什么？
You were saying?

215
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,041
你们有新技术，新知识
You have technology, knowledge new to us.

216
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,210
你们的这个C-4……
This C-4 of yours...

217
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,212
不是用来拔起树根的
It's not for blowing up stumps.

218
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,175
我们可以用来做更复杂的事情
We have a more sophisticated application for it.

219
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
听着，你们用C-4来干吗
Look, what you people do with your c4

220
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,803
不关我们的事
is none of our business.

221
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,347
我们只要食物
We just need food.

222
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,475
从你们目前这地下基地的情况来看
As far as your little secret down here goes, well...

223
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,312
我们的意思是：多么壮观的地下碉堡啊
we say, "what giant, underground bunker?"

224
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,233
我需要更多的C-4
I want more than that.

225
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,736
呃，也许我们可以给你们……更多
Well, maybe we can give you... more.

226
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,280
你们有比C-4更先进的武器？
You have weapons more powerful than your C-4?

227
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,282
你是在开玩笑吗？武器是我们的
我们……
Are you kidding me? Weapons are us. We...

228
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,577
我们有
We might.

229
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,082
如果我不单要武器呢？
What if I wanted more than weapons?

230
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,418
我是不是说过我知道一切的一切？
Uh, did I mention that I know almost
everything about almost everything?

231
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,630
连Teyla Emmagan都加入你们了
For Teyla Emmagan to have joined with you,

232
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,799
你们一定有更……
you must have something much more...

233
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,217
我们只是想摆脱困境
Look, I'm going to go out on a limb here

234
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,637
我们只是在寻找对抗幽灵的同盟
and just say that we're looking
for allies against the Wraith.

235
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,056
你们觉得怎么样？
How about you guys?

236
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,229
听着，我只是想出去看看
Listen, we just want to take a look outside.

237
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,438
不行
We can't let you.

238
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,898
不安全
It's not safe.

239
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,609
我们会照顾好自己的
We can take care of ourselves.

240
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,071
Tyrus， 请回复
Tyrus, please respond.

241
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,239
收到
Receiving.

242
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,366
带走他们
Bring them.

243
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,034
明白
Understood.

244
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,245
放下武器
Relinquish your weapons.

245
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
我们就不会伤害你们
You will not be harmed.

246
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,963
你们总是给我们惊奇啊
You guys are full of surprises.

247
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,024
你们错过了丰收庆典，长官
You missed a hell of a harvest ceremony, Sir.

248
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,442
可以想见
I can imagine.

249
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,319
哦，Teyla
Oh. Teyla.

250
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,613
少校，我和你一样感到很奇怪
I am as surprised as you are by all of this, Major.

251
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,364
我不知道，我感到太奇怪了
I don't know. I'm pretty surprised.

252
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,368
Teyla和她的人民只知道我们所表现出来的
那一面——淳朴的农民
Teyla and her people know us only
as the simple farmers we show outsiders.

253
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:38,956
我们的身份之谜是我们对幽灵的
最好的防御武器
The secrecy of who and what we are
is the only defense we have against the Wraith.

254
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,295
总有一天，这会改变的
One day, all that will change.

255
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,466
你们以为你们可以造出原子弹吗？
You think you can do that with an atomic bomb?

256
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,596
现在是你们让我们搞到奇怪了
Now it's you who surprise me.

257
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,474
辐射信号
以及你们对C-4浓厚的兴趣
Well, radioactive readings,
your fascination with our C-4...

258
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,059
你现在才发现？
You're just mentioning this now?

259
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,353
他说“总有一天，这会改变”的时候
我才反应过来
It just came to me when he said,
"one day, all that will change."

260
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,774
我想你们是希望C-4能解决你们
面临的超临界问题
I assume you're hoping our C-4
will solve your supercriticality problem.

261
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,816
行得通吗？
Will it?

262
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,734
也许
It might.

263
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,070
跟你们的设计有关
有一些其它需要考虑的事项
Depends on your design.
There's a host of other considerations.

264
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,655
你知道怎么造原子弹？
You know how to make an a-bomb?

265
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,366
少校，我高中的国际象棋队里
大部分的队友都能设计原子弹
Major, most of my high school chess team
could design an a-bomb.

266
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,870
难的是获得足够的
够纯度的可分裂物质
The actual hard part is having
sufficient fissionable materials of appropriate grade.

267
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,497
我们有
And we do.

268
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,998
你们有？
You do?

269
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,002
Genii人以前是一个星球的联邦
The Genii were once a great confederation of planets.

270
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:31,008
几千年以前，幽灵把我们逼到了
灭绝的边缘
Millennia ago, the Wraith had driven us
to the brink of total annihilation.

271
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,720
我们的先祖造出了防御碉堡
就像这个一样
Our forefathers sought the protection
of bunkers such as these,

272
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,682
这里原先是为了战争而建的
originally created for wars long forgotten,

273
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,561
只有在这里，我们的人有一小部分
and it was here that a small number of our people

274
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,313
躲过了被发现的命运
managed to survive undetected.

275
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,987
时间一年年过去
Over the course of many, many years,
generation after generation

276
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,324
我们一代代人在这儿秘密发展科技
we have made technological developments here in secret.

277
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,079
所以那些耕种的东西都只是表象
So the whole farmer thing is just a front.

278
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,747
以使幽灵不会怀疑
So the Wraith do not suspect.

279
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,040
不单是这样
More than that.

280
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,752
我们还要养家糊口
We do have many mouths to feed below.

281
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,671
我想带你看些东西
I want to show you something.

282
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,839
跟我来
Come with me.

283
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,716
对了，那个你随意丢在桌上的东西……
Oh, that thing you so carelessly threw on the table...

284
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,593
我能带着它吗？
Can I take that along?

285
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,181
来吧
Come.

286
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,267
你们守着这里
Stay as you are.

287
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,740
在这地下，我们在这里训练军队
科学家们则在这发明武器
Down below, our military trains
as our scientists create weapons for them.

288
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,618
我们相信，有了核武器
With our atomic weapon, we believe

289
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,537
我们就拥有了将幽灵一举歼灭的
把握
we finally have what we need to defeat
the Wraith once and for all.

290
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,874
你们知道长时间暴露在核辐射下
是很危险的吧？
You do realize that long-term exposure
to these levels of radiation is extremely dangerous.

291
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,418
我们的科学家说的可相反
Our scientists tell me otherwise.

292
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,086
那么他们错了
Well, they're wrong.

293
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,505
我们现在危险吗？
Are we in danger now?

294
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,423
在这个辐射率下需要几天或几周的时间
It would take days or weeks
at these levels of radiation,

295
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,301
但是我相信Genii人在这儿一定不止
几天或几周了
but I assume the Genii spend days or weeks down here.

296
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,054
有许多人一辈子都呆在这儿
Many of our people have spent their entire lives here.

297
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,348
他们整个短暂的生命
Their entire, short lives.

298
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,684
我们没事的，只要我们不打算生小孩就行
We'll be fine, just as long as you weren't
planning on having children.

299
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,357
不错，你们的方向是正确的
Well, you're on the right track.

300
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,775
我们比你们领先60年
We're about 60 years ahead of you.

301
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,151
前提是，你们能活下来
That is, if you survive.

302
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,029
这保护层很遗憾的不够充分
This shielding is woefully inadequate.

303
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,614
现在，铀的问题……
Now, uranium...

304
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,033
你们有多少铀？
How much do you have?

305
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,409
很多
Much more.

306
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,203
远达不到造武器的标准
It's nowhere near weapons grade.

307
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,997
我们碰到了净化的问题
We have had problems in our purifying efforts.

308
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,961
杂质的分子结构和我们要的成分的分子结构
很相近
The molecular structure of the unwanted material
is very similar to that of the desired material.

309
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,505
扩散运动……你们必须把铀235和铀238分离开来
Diffusion... You need to separate the 235 from the 238.

310
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,591
当你把两种成分间的阻碍隔开
When you remove the barrier between two substances,
the slight difference in their mass

311
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,635
它们组成结构上的不同会使它们以不同的速率扩散
causes them to separate at different rates.

312
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,136
你可以做吗？
You could do this?

313
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:39,971
当然，我只是……
Well, of course. I just...

314
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,348
我想当下最主要的问题
I think the real question is, right now.

315
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,641
我们是同盟……
Are we allies...

316
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,269
还是囚犯？
Or are we still prisoners?

317
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,986
我们对新朋友感激不尽
We give thanks to our new friends.

318
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,612
我们感谢
We give thanks.

319
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,743
Please, eat.
Please, eat.

320
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,003
这里没放柠檬吧，是吗？
You don't think there's lemon in this, do you?

321
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,546
我保证这很美味
I'm sure it's delicious.

322
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,756
你见过有人过敏性休克吗？
Have you seen someone in anaphylactic shock?

323
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,716
吃吧
Eat.

324
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:22,054
我希望这顿饭可以
弥补我们以前的冒犯
I hope that by sharing this meal
we can make up in some small way for past offenses.

325
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,307
我相信我们会合作愉快的
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

326
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,229
你们在原型设备上是用
What method did your people use

327
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,481
什么方法来
to initiate fission reaction

328
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,275
启动分裂反应的呢？
in your prototype devices?

329
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,818
实际上，有两种不同的方法
Well, there's two different approaches, actually...

330
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,279
内裂式的和枪型的原子弹
Implosion and a gun-type bomb.

331
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,489
显然，这两个都设计成
能产生超临界质量
Both were designed to create
a supercritical mass, obviously.

332
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,282
显然
Obviously.

333
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,785
不论哪一种方法，你都需要精炼的铀235
Either way you go, you need an amount of refined 235

334
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,623
差不多要我的拳头大小那么多
roughly equivalent to the size of my fist...

335
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,708
或者他的拳头
Or his fist, actually.

336
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,753
我们的梦想就快变成现实了
Well, our dreams may soon be a reality.

337
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,467
有了你们的帮助，在下次提炼之前
With your help, before the next culling,

338
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,762
我们打算在幽灵沉睡之时蒸发
we plan to vaporize the Wraith as they sleep.

339
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,393
你的计划究竟是怎样的？
What exactly is your plan?

340
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,147
我们要利用他们的自负
We intend to take advantage of their overconfidence.

341
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,191
这是他们的弱点
That is their weakness.

342
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,235
自负
Overconfidence.

343
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,196
在提炼物送到他们的飞船的间隙
他们会冬眠
They hibernate between cullings aboard their great ships,

344
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,573
有时长达几个世纪
sometimes for centuries at a time.

345
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,826
他们总会有人守卫着睡觉的人
但那毕竟是少数
There are always Wraith who watch over the sleepers,
but they're small in number.

346
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,703
我们有能力制服
Small enough to be overpowered.

347
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,747
我们准备偷偷的把我们的新武器
送到他们的飞船上
We intend to sneak aboard
their ships with our new weapons.

348
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,374
现在不可能那样做了
That may no longer be possible.

349
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,416
——Teyla……
——少校？
- Teyla...
- Major?

350
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,670
难道你不认为在提意见之前，
我们该先听完他们整个计划吗？
Don't you think we should listen to their whole plan
before we start poking holes in it?

351
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:41,050
如果我们要在一起合作，他们需要相信我们
我们也需要相信他们
If we are to work together, then they need
to trust us and we need to trust them.

352
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,802
请解释一下
Please explain.

353
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,349
我和我的一些人曾被
幽灵抓去过
I and several of my people
had been captured by the Wraith.

354
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,936
你们需要知道
那是我们的救援计划
You must understand,
it was a rescue mission to save us.

355
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,438
我能活到今天要感谢他们
I am only alive today thanks to them.

356
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
那次救援的结果……
As a result of that rescue...

357
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,611
你把其它的幽灵惊醒了
You awakened the others.

358
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,948
他们发现我们的那个地方有更多的人
They found out that there were
more people where we came from.

359
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,616
爸爸，他们会都醒过来的
Father, they will all awaken.

360
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,910
我们活捉了一个幽灵
Look, we took one of them prisoner.

361
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,662
下次提炼被安排在几十年后
The next culling was supposed to be decades away.

362
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,832
他说他们不急
他们会耐心的跟我们周旋
He said they were in no hurry,
that they would take their time to come after us.

363
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:17,170
我们原打算5年后能进行第一次核试验呢
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

364
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,215
我们有那么多时间吗，Sheppard？
Do we have that much time, Sheppard?

365
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,178
有吗？
Do we?

366
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,014
没有
No.

367
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,492
Cowen...
Cowen...

368
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,869
他们会发现辐射
They may detect the radiation.

369
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,247
我们必须关闭反应堆
留下提炼物，然后再作下一步打算
We have to shut down the reactors,
survive this culling, and somehow plan for the next.

370
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,373
你忘记了些事
You're forgetting something...

371
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,751
——我们可以躲过他们
——我们在一条船上！
- We can hide from them...
- We're both on the same side...

372
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,089
一旦我们把需要的榨光了
Once we have extracted all
the information we can from you,

373
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,966
你们会被留在上面
you will be left on the surface.

374
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,552
你们会第一个被幽灵吞食
You'll be the first the Wraith feed upon,

375
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,553
我保证
I promise you.

376
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,639
我碰过幽灵的飞船
而且我赢了
I've gone up against Wraith ships and I won.

377
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,140
我见过你们的武器
I've seen your weapons...

378
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,684
我说的是一艘飞船
可以穿越空间的飞船
I'm talking about a ship,
one that flies through space,

379
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,270
上面有你见都没有见过的武器
with weapons beyond anything you've ever seen.

380
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,357
你真的想拒绝这样一种帮助吗？
Do you really want to turn down that kind of help?

381
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,859
我想你只是在为自己辩解
I think you're trying to save yourself.

382
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,819
是啊，真TMD被你说中了
Well, you're damn right I am.

383
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,490
我想我们一起合作
也许可以互相帮忙
I say we work together,
then maybe help save each other.

384
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,619
我们的目的是一样的
We both want the same thing.

385
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,876
我们开始实验是因为我们原以为
幽灵短期内不会发现
We started our experiments confident the Wraith
would not appear for many years.

386
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,962
现在看来他们会像你们一样发现我们的
They will detect us the same way you did.

387
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,256
——但是如果我们合作……
——你们还嫌不够么？
- But if we work together...
- Haven't you done enough?

388
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,590
我们还没开始合作呢
We haven't even started yet.

389
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,509
我可以使你们走回正轨
I can get your program right back on schedule.

390
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,468
怎么办到？
How?

391
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,055
我为了六年级的科学展
造了一个原子弹
I built an atomic bomb for
my grade six science fair exhibit.

392
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,640
在加拿大他们让你这样做？
They let you do that up in Canada?

393
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,893
那不是工作模型
我还为这个被中情局询问了6个小时
It wasn't a working model.
Still, I was questioned for six hours by the CIA,

394
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,145
他们以为我是一个未成年秘密组织的成员
who believed I was part of
a secret preteen organization.

395
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,730
实际上，这也是我第一份工作的……
Actually, it led to my first job...

396
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,531
Sheppard少校刚刚让我相信我们
还有成功的希望
Major Sheppard has convinced me
that we may yet prevail...

397
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,907
是吗？
He has?

398
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,910
如果我们精诚合作的话
If we work together.

399
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,295
许多年以前，再一次提炼中
Many generations ago, during a culling,

400
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,631
Genii成功的射下了一个幽灵的近程导弹
the Genii were able to shoot down a wraith dart.

401
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,426
虽然那天我们损失了很多人
Although many lives were lost that day,

402
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,638
损失了很多东西
the ability to resist, even in some small way,

403
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,975
但这至少给了我们
Genii人一点希望
gave the Genii the seeds of hope.

404
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,939
这个数据保存器是从击落的
幽灵近程导弹上恢复过来的
This data storage device was recovered
from that downed Wraith dart.

405
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,524
就像飞机失事时的黑匣子
It's like flash memory in a jump drive.

406
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,360
它包含了当初发射它的飞船的信息
It contains information about
the hive ship it was deployed from.

407
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,780
Tyrus和他的女儿已经成功破解了
上面的信息
Tyrus and his daughter have been able
to successfully access that information.

408
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,656
怎么破的？
How?

409
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,158
通过这个界面
Through this interface.

410
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,828
真的么？
Well, really?

411
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,663
我们相信
We believe...

412
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,125
这就是幽灵飞船休眠的地方
This is where a Wraith ship still sleeps.

413
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,669
幽灵善于自毁
The Wraith tend to self-destruct.

414
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,421
拥有这种东西还真是少见
It's probably pretty rare to get ahold
of something like this.

415
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,089
你们破解了其它信息了吗？
Have you been able to access any other data?

416
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,594
通过这个界面
我们相信我们可以破解幽灵飞船的数据核心
With this interface device, we believe
we can access the Wraith ship's data core.

417
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,306
这就是你们整个计划的基础？
So this is what your whole plan is based on?

418
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,934
那能进入幽灵飞船的电脑
对你有什么帮助吗？
Well, how does getting access
to a Wraith ship's computer help you?

419
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,896
通过这个设备，我们可以
知道所有幽灵飞船的方位
With this interface device, we can learn
the locations of all the Wraith ships.

420
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,774
所以你们知道在哪儿放你们的新炸弹了
So you know where to deliver your new bombs.

421
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:25,900
有点道理
Makes sense.

422
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,486
在我们看到的那条飞船仍
在原地的前提下
Assuming, of course, the ship
we're looking at is still there.

423
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:32,698
如果幽灵不急着召集他们的武装
就像你们所说的，它应该还在原处
Well, if the Wraith are in no hurry
to rally their forces, as you claim, it will be.

424
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,535
这飞船离星际门很远
This ship is nowhere near the Stargate.

425
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,579
徒步靠近它而不被发现
是不可能的
Approaching it undetected by foot is impossible.

426
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,041
那是你们的飞船进来的地方，少校
That is where your ship comes in, Major Sheppard.

427
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,299
我还奇怪我的飞船究竟从哪儿飞进来了呢
I always wondered where my ship would come in.

428
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:51,592
不行
No.

429
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,135
这个作为回答怎么样？
How's that for an answer?

430
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,304
简短有力的，拿我来说的话
It's pithy, I'll give you that.

431
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,848
我肯定你已经同意了
I'm sure you already agreed to this.

432
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,933
那也只是因为我们会取得成果
Only because we'll get something out of it.

433
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,309
我们确实需要同盟，长官
And we do need allies, ma'am.

434
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,269
同盟？
Allies?

435
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,271
你们刚刚说那些人想把你们捆起来
You just said these people were ready to string you up.

436
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,647
你们怎么能相信他们？
How can you trust them?

437
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,567
一旦我们不再相信他们
我们可以甩了他们
Hey, I don't trust them as far as I can throw them.

438
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,152
他们坚持让McKay和Teyla
留在那里的有原因的
There's a reason they insisted
that McKay and Teyla stay there,

439
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,863
不仅仅是为了帮助他们制造原子弹
and it's not just to help them with their bomb,

440
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,824
而是因为我们各有所需
but we have something they need and
they have something we need.

441
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,742
我想这就是我们谈判的重点
I thought that's what negotiating was all about.

442
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,077
嗯，是啊
Ioh, well, it is.

443
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,454
我以个人的名义停止向你们
供应核武器
Personally, I stop short of offering nuclear weapons.

444
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,707
无论如何，他们已经在造了
They were building them anyway.

445
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,418
如果他们在造了，那你们为什么这么说？
Oh, if they were building them anyway,
why didn't you just say so?

446
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:30,089
你们知道
我原先派你们去是为了食物的吗？
You realize I originally sent you out for food?

447
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,550
我想我们仍可以得到食物
I think we can still get that.

448
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,010
我不知道为什么不行
I don't see why not.

449
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,971
我们只是更进一步到了
原子弹方面的事而已
We kind of moved past it
with the whole atomic bomb thing.

450
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,851
好吧，最低原则，你们能成功吗？
All right, bottom line, can you pull this off?

451
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,062
我们得当心，但……
We'll have to watch our backs, but...

452
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,150
如果我认为不会成功
我就不会冒险把我的队伍置于其中
I wouldn't put my team at risk if I didn't think so.

453
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:58,576
好吧，去吧，也许我们
还有机会讨论怎么制造核弹头
Okay, go, and then maybe we'll talk
about making nuclear bombs.

454
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,082
那个球形箱体引导
爆炸力向内延伸
The spherical encasement directs
the explosive forces inward,

455
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,419
而最终的爆炸会产生极大的压缩力
and the resulting implosion
creates extreme compression.

456
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,464
这些次临界的物体就会变成超临界的
The subcritical mass becomes supercritical.

457
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,382
太天才了
Ingenious.

458
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,260
我知道，你能够想象
这还不足以赢得科学展吗？
I know, and can you believe
I didn't even win the science fair?

459
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,765
真正的挑战是对现有的仪器和资源
进行相应的改造
So, the practical adaptation of available equipment
and resources will be the real challenge.

460
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,145
McKay博士，你生来就是为了成为我们的英雄啊
You're destined to become a hero
among our people, Dr. Mckay.

461
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,522
没错
Right.

462
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,944
只要Sheppard带着C-4回来
As long as major Sheppard returns with the C-4.

463
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,324
我死定了
I'm a dead man.

464
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,036
我们互相都吃惊不小啊
We have surprised each other.

465
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,413
Genii人跟我想象的不一样啊
The Genii are not the people I thought they were.

466
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,748
而你呢
And look at you.

467
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,584
我可不敢想象你会离开你的人民
I would never have thought
that you'd leave your people.

468
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,337
不，我这样做是为了他们
No. I do this for them.

469
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:55,091
John Sheppard和他的人民给我的星球
带来了新希望，Sora
John sheppard and his people have brought
new hope to our stars, Sora.

470
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,261
他们有探险家的精神和
斗士的心
They have the spirit of explorers
and the hearts of warriors.

471
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,012
他们接受了我
They have accepted me.

472
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,848
但看看你
But look at you.

473
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,600
你还能参加几次我们的丰收庆典？
How many "harvest ceremonies" did I make you endure?

474
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,811
不了，我保证
Never again, I promise you.

475
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,698
你们尊重我们
You respected us for who we were.

476
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,324
那时我们相信你们的原因
That gave us reason to trust you.

477
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,995
你们认为我们不够资格分享你们的秘密
我感到很悲哀
I am saddened that you could not
trust me enough to share in your secret.

478
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,872
那是我们的方式
That is our way.

479
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,750
我们的原则是，而且将一直是，生存
Our deception was and is a matter of survival.

480
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,713
这是我们生来享有的秘密
我们也愿意带到棺材里去
It is a secret we are born into that
we willingly take to our graves.

481
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:34,881
那么……
Still...

482
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,842
难道我们没有跟你们公平交易吗？
Have we not always traded fairly with you?

483
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,345
你应该知道我们没有这么光明正大
的和其他人做过生意
You should know we have not dealt
with others so graciously.

484
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,641
也许新的联盟能让你们看清
Perhaps this new alliance
will help to open your eyes...

485
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,520
只有我们精诚合作
才有可能打败幽灵
That we can only stand against
the Wraith if we do so together.

486
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,234
我们还得观察一下你的朋友们
是不是信守诺言
We'll have to see if your friends
will live up to their promises.

487
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,212
嗯哼？
Well?

488
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,923
看见了吗？
Do you see?

489
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,804
我们的动作必须尽可能的快
We've got to get in and out as fast as possible.

490
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,140
我毕生都在研究这个计划
I've been studying these plans all my life.

491
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,391
好啊
Good.

492
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,101
那我们跟着你走
Then we'll follow your lead.

493
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,437
你们在做的时候我们会掩护的
We'll keep you covered during the breach and download.

494
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,522
撤退计划呢？
Exit plan?

495
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,232
和进入一样，你留在探险者号
Same as we came in. You'll stay with the jumper.

496
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,107
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

497
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,651
我要和你一起去
I should be going with you.

498
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,611
我们很有可能碰到一场战斗
There's a good chance we could end up in a firefight.

499
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:43,491
Ford少尉，Sora是一个
训练有素的战士，并且是个神射手
Sora is a skilled fighter and
expert marksman, lieutenant Ford.

500
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:49,622
尽管如此，她必须留在这儿继续
如果我们回不来的话
Still, she must stay here
to carry on if we don't come back.

501
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:11,143
在行动之前
我们需要你们把承诺的C-4 拿过来，少校
We need you to deliver the C-4 you've promised us,
Major, before we proceed.

502
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,479
我们必须先找到合适的突破口
We need to get the proper intel first.

503
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,316
如果不能投入使用
那我们造出核武器也没用
There's no use in building a bunch of nukes
if we can't put them to use.

504
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,776
这是你的原则？
Those are your terms?

505
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,444
我相信你明白的
I'm sure you understand.

506
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,029
明白
I do.

507
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:26,158
看来我们除了互相信任，别无他选
It seems we have no choice but to trust each other.

508
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,223
你们有多少艘这种船？
How many of these ships do you have?

509
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,894
只有1艘
Just the one.

510
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,571
那里
There.

511
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,242
他们醒过来了吗？
Have they awoken?

512
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:10,203
我看不见任何活动
I don't see any activity.

513
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,663
和上次一样
Same as last time.

514
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,876
好吧，我们出发
All right, here we go.

515
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,544
从前门进去
Right through the front door.

516
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,425
嘿，守住这里
Hey, hold the fort.

517
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:41,718
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

518
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,053
好运
Good luck.

519
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,053
哦，天啊
Oh, god.

520
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:34,562
这些人被茧缠住了，以备以后食用
These people were cocooned for later feeding.

521
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:37,983
他们中有些可能还活着
Some of them may still be alive.

522
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:40,819
我们没时间来管这个
We don't have time for this.

523
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,196
他们可能是你们的人
They could be your people, for all you know.

524
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,953
Teyla，你看好这里
我们飞船上见
Teyla, take care of this.
We'll meet you back at the ship.

525
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:51,454
McKay，给我来
McKay, you're with me.

526
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:00,547
我留着和她一起
I'll stay with her.

527
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,508
走，我们飞船上见
Go.
We'll meet you back at the ship.

528
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:49,846
就是这儿了
This is it.

529
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:55,810
但我记得计划里没有
包括怎么操作这扇门啊
But the ship's plans I memorized did not
include the details on how to operate this door.

530
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,941
如果试图冲破这扇门
会造成很大的声响
If we try to blow this door,
it's going to make too much noise.

531
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,903
所以另寻他法
So find another way.
Okay.

532
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,249
给点亮光
Can I get some light here?

533
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,146
漂亮
Beautiful.

534
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:55,161
求求你……救救我
Please... help me.

535
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:56,663
我们会救你出来
We're going to get you out.

536
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,124
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

537
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:01,084
——我们不能放了他，我们一个都不能放
——什么？
- We cannot free him. We can save none of them.
- What?

538
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,586
求求你……
Please help...

539
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:04,254
你要把他们留在这里等死？
You would leave him here to die?

540
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:06,673
听着，不能让幽灵知道我们来过
Listen, the Wraith must not know we were ever here.

541
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,675
我说不行
I said no.

542
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:19,686
McKay，我们没有……
McKay, we don't have..

543
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:22,188
我不知道这是否……
Look, I don't even know if this is going to...

544
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,485
有用
Work.

545
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,244
瞧
Bingo.

546
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:39,581
好了
All right.

547
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,542
我帮你放风，去吧
I'll cover your six. Go.

548
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:52,510
如果你把他放了，他们会知道的
If you free him, they will know he was taken.

549
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:54,346
我简直不敢相信你是这样一个人
You are not the man I believed you to be.

550
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:55,764
这艘飞船离我们的星球最近
This ship is closest to our world.

551
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,974
如果幽灵醒来，第一个死的是Genii人
The Genii will be the first to die if they awaken.

552
00:35:58,016 --> 00:35:58,975
救救我！
Help me!

553
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,352
我说了离他远点
I said leave him.

554
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:01,353
不！
No!

555
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,771
安静！
Be silent!

556
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,288
少校，我们被发现了
Major, we have been discovered.

557
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:22,958
我们该走了
We've got to get out of here.

558
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:33,593
搞定了
We've got it.

559
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:46,821
幽灵护卫
Wraith guards.

560
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,864
快，后面更多
Hurry. More are coming.

561
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:03,087
Tyrus呢？
Where's Tyrus?

562
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:05,006
他被幽灵武器击中了
He was struck by a Wraith weapon.

563
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,507
他也许只是昏迷了
He may have only been stunned.

564
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:08,634
现在他一定已经被幽灵抓住了
By now, the Wraith will be upon him.

565
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:15,308
走，走！
Go. Go!

566
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:17,143
好吧，别急
All right, hang on.

567
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,232
我爸爸呢？
Where is my father?

568
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:10,613
他没能回来
He did not survive.

569
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:12,698
怎么回事？
How?

570
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,617
发生什么了？
What happened?

571
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,452
我想我们该查查
I think we should find out.

572
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:19,956
瞄准
Take aim.

573
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:38,474
Cowen...我以为我们
已经学会怎么合作了
Cowen...
I thought we were just learning how to get along.

574
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:40,268
她杀了Tyrus
She killed tyrus.

575
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,936
没有
No.

576
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:45,273
你把他留下送死，当时你很可能已经
把他杀了
By leaving him to die, you may just
as well have killed him yourself.

577
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,275
他把我要救的人打死了
He shot the man we tried to save.

578
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,069
尝试去救人是一个错误
It was a mistake to try and save anyone.

579
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,655
这使我们的行动遇到了危险
It jeopardized the mission.

580
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:59,328
我们会留下这些智能信息
We will keep this intelligence information...

581
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:01,497
你才是制造错误的那个人
You're the one making a mistake.

582
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:05,585
你的飞船，以及无论你们拥有多少C-4
And your ship, and whatever quantities of C-4
you have in your possession.

583
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:08,045
这就是你们算计好的
要利用我们
That is all you ever intended, to use us.

584
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,633
为了感谢你们，我们会留你们一命
And for your efforts, I will spare your lives.

585
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,677
多慷慨啊
How generous of you.

586
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:17,263
我想塔瓦豆已经掉下桌子了
I guess the tava beans are off the table.

587
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:18,931
放下你们的武器
Your weapons.

588
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:20,558
不
No.

589
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,351
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

590
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,063
我们的人多，少校
We have the advantage, Major.

591
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,442
是啊
Yeah.

592
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:33,029
你爸爸的死就是为了这个？
This is what your father died for?

593
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:39,035
为了那些可以把朋友拿来出卖以及
洗劫的人们？
In the name of people who would lie and
steal from those they would call friends?

594
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,040
我也撒谎了
Well, I lied too.

595
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,000
探险者2号和3号，执行命令
Jumpers two and three, execute.

596
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:59,221
你们不会真的认为我们只有一艘飞船吧，啊？
You didn't really think we had one ship, did you?

597
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:03,434
让你们的人回去，大家互不伤害
Tell your people to get back and nobody gets hurt.

598
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,857
探险者二号，听我的号令准备开火
Jumper two, prepare to fire on my mark.

599
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:11,442
等等
Wait.

600
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,156
你们保证离开？
Do you promise to leave?

601
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:21,118
是啊，那是计划
Well, that's the plan.

602
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:26,666
我想我们该到其他地方找我们的
塔瓦豆了，但是……
I guess we'll have to go somewhere else
to find our tava beans, but...

603
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,003
我想我们该做个了结才算公平
I think it's only fair we end up with something.

604
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,677
你们不该和Genii人为敌的
You do not want to make an enemy of the Genii.

605
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,221
你知道吗？
Well, you know what?

606
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,099
我们也是
Same here.

607
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,335
少校，我猜你也许想看看这个
Major, I thought you might like to see this.

608
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:16,799
我们从数据存储器上下载的许多数据
是经过加密的
A lot of the information we downloaded
from the data storage device was encrypted,

609
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,342
所以我们仍然在破解它
so we're still working on that.

610
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:19,677
嗯，我知道这不容易
Yeah, I didn't think it would be easy.

611
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,388
但我们可以确定21艘幽灵飞船的存在
But we were able to ascertain
the existence of 21 Wraith hive ships

612
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,557
单单在我们所处的飞马星系的这四分之一
just in our quadrant of the Pegasus galaxy alone.

613
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,850
21艘？
21?

614
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:28,144
而且有暗示说在飞马的
其他地方有更多
And there are indications of
far more elsewhere in Pegasus.

615
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:29,604
那到底有多少？
Well, how many more?

616
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,439
没办法知道确切的数字
Well, there's no way of knowing for sure.

617
00:41:31,814 --> 00:41:34,317
也许60艘，或更多
Perhaps 60... Or more.

618
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,194
那挺多呀
That's a lot of ships.

619
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,071
有些似乎已经开始行动了
Some of them already appear to be on the move.

620
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,489
朝我们来的？
Toward us?

621
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:42,283
我们正研究到这部分
That's the part we're still working on.

622
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:45,161
所以即使我们帮助Genii人建立了
核弹头
So even if were to have helped
the Genii build nuclear warheads...

623
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:48,039
我们也只能同时用
少量的核武器进行攻击
We only could have nuked
a handful of them simultaneously.

624
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,915
没错
Exactly.

625
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:51,918
对于联合攻击
这些幽灵飞船足够了
There's far too many Wraith ships
for a coordinated attack.

626
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:55,379
Genii人的计划注定要失败的
不管有没有我们的帮助
The Genii plan never would have worked,
with or without our help.

627
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,632
我看看还有什么
I'll see what else I can find.

628
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,133
谢谢，Peter
Thank you, Peter.

629
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,101
你也许乐意在你们走后听到Bates军士
成功的谈成了一笔粮食生意
You might be happy to know sergeant Bates was able to
broker a small trade agreement for food while you were gone.

630
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,436
是吗，他谈成了？
Oh, he did, did he?

631
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:12,438
没错，谈成了，但这不是和你们比赛
Yes, he did, but it's not a competition.

632
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,399
对方是什么样的人？
So who are these people?

633
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,275
他们是商人
They're traders.

634
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,361
他们自称为Manarian人
They call themselves Manarians.

635
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:24,784
John，我很抱歉你没有找到
你想要的同盟
I'm sorry you weren't able to find
the allies you're looking for, John.

636
00:42:26,118 --> 00:42:28,621
但我们得到了一些有用的信息
这也算收获
Well, we gathered some valuable intel.
That's something.

637
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:31,457
你是想让我认为你这次行动成功了吗？
You're trying to convince me this is good news?

638
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:35,169
我宁愿我们提前知道面临什么
而不是蒙在鼓里
I much prefer to know what
we're up against than not.

639
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:38,965
60艘飞船……或许更多
60 ships...
Or more.

640
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:45,304
我现在只希望他们不要同时来
528


I just hope they don't all come at once.
