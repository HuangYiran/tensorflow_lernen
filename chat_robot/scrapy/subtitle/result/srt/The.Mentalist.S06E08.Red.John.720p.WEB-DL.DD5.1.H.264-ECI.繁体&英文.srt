自那以后我們一直在追捕他

我們自稱為"布萊克組織"

65
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,010
由你們自己選擇
should you so choose.

66
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,820
我們為何需要律師
Why would we need an attorney?

67
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,740

Well, let's look at this from our perspective, Kimball.

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,450
你們的上司伯特侖是個罪犯
Your boss Bertram is a criminal.

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,130
所以有可能你們也是
Makes sense that you might be one, too.

70
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,360
我們會非常仔細地審視你們每個人
We will be looking very closely at all of you.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,690
如果你們有任何
If you have ever done anything

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,050
只要一點點可疑的舉動
even remotely questionable,

73
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,330
我們都會發現
We will find out,

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,420
然后起訴你們
and we will prosecute.

75
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,480
當然了  除非
Unless, of course,

76
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,010
你們能夠配合  那我們會非常非常滿意
We feel very, very comfortable with your cooperation.

77
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,030
那樣你們就有點回旋的余地
Then you got a little wiggle room.

killed a cop at a gas station in East Sac.

116

我聽說了
I heard.

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,240
那你聽說了伯特侖當時在加油站做什么嗎
Did you hear what Bertram was doing at the gas station?

118
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,190
沒
No.

119
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,230
他在打公用電話
Using a pay phone.

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,750
猜猜他打給了誰
Guess who he was calling.

121
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,560
我猜是簡
I'm gonna guess Jane.

122
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,900
沒錯  那他在哪
Ahh. Yeah. So where is he?

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,880
我不知道
I don't know.

我認為你清楚得很
I think you do.

125

我沒法左右你的想法
I can't help what you think.

126
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,490
我認為你的男朋友和一名危險的逃犯勾結
I think your boyfriend is colluding with a dangerous fugitive.

127
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,710
我認為他已經深陷布萊克組織中無法自拔
I think he is up to his neck in this Blake Association craziness,

128
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,210
可能你也是
and probably you are, too.

129

我不是  他也不是
I'm not. He's not.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,590
簡無法阻止打給他的人
Jane can't help who calls him,

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,610
而且他也不是我的男朋友
and he's not my boyfriend.

132
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,690
真是太遺憾了  特蕾莎
It's a damn shame, Teresa.

133

人人都說
By all accounts...

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,230
你曾是個好警察
You were a good cop.

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,640
我現在依舊是
I still am.

136
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,880
頭兒
Hey, boss!

瑞斯比
Rigsby?

138
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,220
周圍安全嗎
Is it safe?

139
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,910
嗯  你們在干嘛
Yeah. What are you doing?

140
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,220
我們聽說了伯特侖今早干的事
We heard about what Bertram did this morning.

141
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,840
聽說聯調局的人在找我們
We heard the F.B.I. were looking for us.

142
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
所以現在是怎樣  你們就躲在停車場嗎
So what now? You're hiding in the parking lot?

143
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,600
不  我們不是躲起來  只是
No. No, we're not hiding. We're just...

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,460
低調行事
laying low.

145
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,390
我們暫時還安全
Well, we're safe for now.

146
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,770
至少現在還沒有下達對我們的逮捕令
There's no arrest warrant that's put out for us just yet.

147
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,750
他們遲早會的
Give 'em time.

148
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,670
簡在哪
Where's Jane?

149
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,840
別問
Don't ask.

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,870
她剛已經問了
She just did.

151
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,590
聽我說
Listen to me.

152
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,800
如今加調局已經不復存在了
The C.B.I. is gone now.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
我們只能靠自己了  你們得保護好自己
We're on our own. You need to protect yourselves.

154
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,610
你們不知道簡在哪里  他在干什么
You don't know where Jane is, you don't know what he's doing,

155
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,130
也不想知道  明白了嗎
and you don't want to know, you understand?

156
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,550
明白  頭兒
Yes, boss.

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,190
-明白  頭兒  -明白  頭兒
- Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.

158
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,600
那就好
All right then.

159
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,020
但我已經不是你們的頭兒了  關鍵就在這里
But I am not your boss anymore. That's the point.

160
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,320
我們只能靠自己
We're on our own.

161
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,520
我們明白的
Yeah, we get it.

162
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,890
那他在哪
So where is he?

163
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,610
{\pos(191.4,278.4)}加州  薩克拉門托  威廉蘭德公園

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,650
你被通緝了
You're a wanted man.

165
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,610
我想也是
Well, I like to think so.

166
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,020
我說真的  艾伯特給你下了逮捕令
Seriously. Abbott put an actual warrant out on you.

167
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,770
也不是第一次了
Eh. It's not the first time.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,630
所以你到底要不要告訴我
So you gonna tell me, or what?

169
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,010
哦對  伯特侖打給我了
Oh, yeah. Uh... Bertram called me.

170
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,200
我知道
I know.

171
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,210
他說了些什么
What did he say?

172
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,620
不管他想說什么  他那時都沒來得及
Well, whatever he wanted to say, he didn't have time.

173
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,870
為什么他還在城里
Why the hell is he still here?

174
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,170
他想做什么
What does he want?

175
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,660
我猜他會很快再打來告訴我
I'm guessing he'll call back soon and tell me.

176
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,320
你的手機不安全  聯調局...
Your phone's not safe. The F.B.I.--

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,220
對  他們裝了竊聽
Yeah, they have a tap on the line.

178
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,440
但他們還沒追蹤到
But they don't have a trace yet.

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
如果他們追蹤到了  我現在就早該被捕了
If they had a trace, then I'd be arrested already.

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,390
也許如此  但他們早晚會追蹤到你的
Maybe so, but sooner or later, they'll get a trace on you.

181
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,230
我知道
I know.

182
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,940
但在伯特侖打來之前我不能扔掉手機
But I can't get rid of my phone until Bertram calls.

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,460
所以事情就懸在這了
It's all very suspenseful.

184
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

185
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,250
誰
Who?

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,110
伯特侖
Bertram.

187
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,100
到時候就知道了
We'll see.

188
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,070
你在閃爍其詞
Now you're being evasive.

189
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,580
小鳥的眼睛圓又亮
What beady little eyes birds have.

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,330
《小恐龍》[系列童書]  你知道吧
Tiny Dinosaurs, you know?

191
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,130
我知道
I know.

192
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,460
我知道你很清楚他的意圖
I know you know what he wants.

193
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,530
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

194
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,950
-喂  -很抱歉我那時不得不掛電話
- Hello? - Oh, sorry I had to hang up on you.

195
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,300
今天實在太忙了
It's been a busy day.

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,930
沒關系  這個電話不安全
Yeah, no problem. You know, this phone is not safe.

197
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,440
我馬上再打給你
Let me call you back in a moment.

198
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,620
好的
Yeah.

199
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,450
他說什么
What'd he say?

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,750
稍等一下
Just a second.

201
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,300
你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

202
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,970
我出一百塊換你的手機  行嗎
I'll give you $100 for that phone.

203
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,560
什么
Huh?

204
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,830
兩百塊換你的手機
$200 for that phone.

205
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,230
這是什么騙局嗎
What's the catch?

206
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,250
不是騙局
No catch.

207
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,730
三百塊  外加
$300 plus...

208
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,770
一部替代機
a replacement phone.

209
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,850
那好吧
Uh, okay.

210
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,050
哥們  我一會兒再打給你
Yeah, dude, I'll call you right back.

211
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,360
交易愉快
Pleasure doing business with you.

212
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,210
謝了  伙計
Thanks, man.

213
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,130
他剛才到底說了什么
What did he say?

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,020
我覺得我們應該見面好好談談
Look, I think we should meet and talk.

215
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,930
-就我們倆  -就像約會一樣嗎
- Just the two of us. - What, like a date?

216
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,610
是啊
Yes...

217
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,160
不
No.

218
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,830
聽著  游戲結束了
Look, the game is over.

219
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,020
我得說你我確實不分伯仲
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,780
既然現在一切都結束了
And now that it's over,

221
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,940
我真的覺得我們應該好好談談
I really think that we should talk.

222
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,850
停戰  不帶武器  不玩花招
You know, a truce. No weapons, no tricks.

223
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,190
就談談
Just talk.

224
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,040
然后各行其道
Then we both walk away.

225
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,360
談談  談什么
Talk. About what?

226
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,420
談談這一切
Well... everything.

227
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,410
我想我們都需要有個了結  不是嗎
I think we both could use a little closure, don't you?

228
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,880
就在今天  現在
It has to be today. You know, now.

229
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,830
我時間有點緊
I'm kind of pressed for time.

230
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,210
我怎么知道能否相信你呢
How do I know I can trust you?

231
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,570
都到現在了就別膽小了  派翠克
Ah, don't be timid now, Patrick.

232
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,710
我有那么多機會殺你  卻都沒下手  不是嗎
I could have killed you many times, and I haven't, have I?

233
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,340
好吧  時間  地點
Okay. When and where?

234
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
非常好
Excellent.

235
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,720
半小時后弗里蒙特公園的噴泉邊見
I'll be at the Fremont Park fountain in half an hour.

236
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,470
不行  我不知道那個地方  中央汽車站見
No. Don't know it. Central bus station.

237
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,810
-北入口  -不行  那里人太多
- North entrance. - Nah, There's too many people.

238
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,920
而且警察太多
There's too many cops.

239
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,970
你知道亞歷山大公墓嗎
You know Alexandria Cemetery?

240
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,050
我當然知道
Of course I do.

241
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,040
西門那邊有個小教堂
Yeah, there's a chapel by the western gate.

242
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,620
行啊  半小時之后見
That--that'll do. Half an hour.

243
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,290
別遲到  我不能待太久
Don't be late. I can't wait around.

244
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,430
半小時之后見
Half an hour.

245
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,090
他說什么
What'd he say?

246
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,030
他想見我
He wants to meet with me.

247
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,330
這是個陷阱
It's a trap.

248
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,100
可能吧
Probably.

249
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,390
你準備怎么辦
Well, what are you gonna do?

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,900
我去見他
I'm gonna meet him.

251
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,930
不行
You can't.

252
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,880
相信我  我知道自己在干什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

253
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,750
簡  別去  你想想
Jane, don't do this. Think about it.

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,190
聯調局馬上就要抓到伯特侖了
The F.B.I. is gonna get Bertram soon enough.

255
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,130
我不想他落在聯調局手上
I don't want the F.B.I. to get him.

256
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,790
你知道這一天早晚會來
You knew this day was coming.

257
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,110
就是今天了
It's here.

258
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,120
那我和你一起去
Let me come with you.

259
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,600
不行  我不想讓你牽扯進來
No, I don't want you involved.

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,140
牽扯  我早就深陷其中了
Involved? I am involved.

261
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,090
不能再這樣了
Not anymore.

262
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,100
我要借你的槍
I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

263
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
我的槍
My gun?

264
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,920
是  你的槍  我不會開槍的
Yes, your gun. I'm not gonna use it.

265
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,030
就是壯壯膽
Just a prop.

266
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,330
特蕾莎  請你相信我
Teresa, trust me, please.

267
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,430

謝謝
Thank you.

269
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,640
那邊吧
Like that way.

270
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,770
謝了
Thanks.

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,860
疑犯逃跑
The suspect got moved.

272
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,900
負責人呢  艾伯特在哪兒
Where's the man in charge here? Where is Abbott?

273
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,040
跪下
Get down on your knees.

274
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,690
把手舉到我能看見的地方
Keep your hands where I can see them.

275
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,410
艾伯特在哪兒  我必須得走了
Where is Abbott? I-I have to go.

276
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,350
好了  淡定點  伙計們
All right, take it down a notch, people.

277
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
他又不是阿爾·卡彭
He's not Al Capone.

278
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
{\an8}著名黑幫老大

279
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,700
艾伯特  請聽我說
Abbott, please listen to me.

280
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,000
我看得出來你是個正人君子
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

281
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,830
我以我的名譽發誓  我一小時之后就回去自首
On my honor, I will give myself up in an hour.

282
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,650
但是現在  我...  我要
But right now I just-- I just need...

283
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,780
只要
Just...

284
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,760
算了
Forget it.

285
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,970
別別別  告訴我
No. No, no, no, no. No, tell me.

286
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,860
起來
Come on.

287
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,950
你要干什么  你需要什么
No, what do you need? What do you need, huh?

288
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,420
你需要一小時
You need an hour?

289
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,100
干什么
For what?

290
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,920
你要去哪兒
Where are you going?

291
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,170
去見誰
Who are you gonna go meet?

292
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,710
不說嗎
No?

293
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,230
那回局里說怎么樣
Well, let's take a trip downtown, shall we?

294
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,210
沒事  讓她過來吧
No. You can let her go.

295
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,270
你好  里斯本女士
Hi, Miss Lisbon.

296
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,400
就算是咱們兩個警察間幫個忙  艾伯特
Do me this one favor, Abbott, cop to cop.

297
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,910
放他走  我發誓到時候一定把他帶回來
Let him go, and I swear I will bring him back later.

298
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,360
不可能
Not happening.

299
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,580
你們到底有什么緊急的事
And what is all this urgency I'm hearing here?

300
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,020
你們是跟伯特侖有約吧
You made a plan with Bertram.

301
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,790
是嗎  是這樣嗎
Is that it? Is that what you did?

302
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,410
拜托了  艾伯特
Please, Abbott.

303
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,500
聯調局  退后
FBI! Back it off!

304
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,690
-加調局  你給我退后  -怎么回事
- CBI. Back it up yourself. - What's this?

305
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,390
放他走  艾伯特  他什么也沒做錯
Let him go, Abbott. He's done nothing wrong.

306
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,620
好啊  各位
Hey, guys.

307
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,430
很高興見到你們
You know, I-it's good to see you.

308
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,030
我本來不想打擊你們的  但加調局已經不存在了
I hate to bring you down, but there is no CBI.

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,610
你們的警徽就是個玩具
That badge is a toy,

310
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,040
而你們只是在假扮警察
and you're all impersonating officers of the law.

311
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,470
隨你怎么說  放他走
Whatever. Let him go.

312
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,920
你是纏上我了是嗎
Are you mad-dogging me right now?

313
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,470
纏上聯調局了
The F.B.I.?

314
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,610
你說你是真的聯調局探員  有什么證據
You say you're legit F.B.I., but how do we know?

315
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,200
對  你們也許是布萊克組織的成員
Yeah, you could be members of the Blake Association

316
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,660
也不是沒可能
for all we know.

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
我們不是
We're not.

318
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,030
拿出證明來
Prove it.

319
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,960
你的手下里德·史密斯就是其中之一
Your man Reede Smith was a member.

320
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
你為什么不可能是
Why not you?

321
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
而且我們怎么知道簡會不會有危險
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

322
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,520
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

323
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,770
抱歉 艾伯特探員
I'm sorry, Agent Abbott,

324
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,610
但是在確保他的安全之前
but it is our duty to protect this man

325
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,000
保護好他是我們的責任
until we're assured his safety.

326
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,990
放他走
Let him go.

327
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,560
別這樣  別這樣
No, no, no, no, no.

328
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,950
沒事的  放下槍
It's all right. Just stand down.

329
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,020
各位都放下槍  沒必要起沖突
Stand down, guys. No bloodshed required.

330
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,340
沒事的
It's cool.

331
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,250
讓他走
Let him go.

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,980
開我的車
Take my car.

333
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,760
長官
Sir?

334
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,960
沒關系  讓他走
It's okay.

335
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,060
謝謝各位了
Thank you, guys!

336
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,280
沒事了
We done?

337
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,110
他走了  就沒事了
He's gone. We're done.

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,870
逮捕他們
Arrest them.

339
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,450
把你們的槍都放到地上
Put your guns down on the ground...

340
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,720
慢慢地
slowly.

341
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,770
照他說的做
Do as he says.

342
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,700
去追蹤里斯本探員的車
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

343
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,840
是  長官
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,570
你在我車上裝了追蹤器
You put a bug on my car?

345
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,610
要不我們怎么能找到簡
How do you think we found Jane?

346
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,150
我說過認識你們這些人我很高興
I said I was glad to see you people

347
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,700
因為我知道你們早晚要出簍子
because I knew you would screw up

348
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,760
能省我不少事
and make my life easy.

349
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,910
你們這不就照做了嗎
And you did just that.

350
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,540
謝謝
Thank you.

351
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,740
逮捕她
Arrest her.

352
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,820
走吧
Come on.

353
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,370
他還沒準備好呢
He wasn't ready for it.

354
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,740
沒錯
No.

355
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
瞧啊
Check it out.

356
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,830
瞧瞧這個
Check this out.

357
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,060
你好嗎
What's up?

358
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,170
能幫我看會兒車嗎
Uh, could you guys keep an eye on my car for me, please?

359
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,880
當然了  會看好的
Sure, I'll watch it.

360
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,040
謝謝
Thank you.

361
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,210
動手
Let's go.

362
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,100
好  伙計  別擔心
Yeah, man, no worries.

363
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,780
等等
Hey there.

364
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,600
抱歉麻煩你了  女士
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

365
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,010
說來話長
Uh, long story.

366
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,830
你愿不愿意載我一程
Uh, I need--I need a ride, if you're willing.

367
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,590
這里是四隊  我們發現目標車輛了
This is Unit 4. We have the vehicle in sight,

368
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,860
停在第五大道和謝爾曼街交會處
stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

369
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,530
退后  先退后  他們可能就在那兒接頭
Stay back, stay back. This could be the meet.

370
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,340
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

371
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,780
四隊  什么情況
Unit 4, what's the situation?

372
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,140
四隊  回答  該死的
Unit 4, respond, damn it.

373
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,070
頭兒  里斯本車里就幾個孩子
Boss, it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

374
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,450
簡不在里面
Jane wasn't there.

375
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,640
沒有發現簡  重復  我們沒發現簡
We don't have Jane. Repeat. We don't have Jane.

376
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,510
是否收...
Do you co--

377
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,780
別再越錯越多了
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

378
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,350
他去哪兒了
Where did he go?

379
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,840
不知道
I don't know.

380
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,820
你們是不見棺材不落淚是吧
You guys really have a death wish, don't you?

381
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,080
長官  我們真的不知道
Sir, we really don't know.

382
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,080
長官  你居然還叫他長官
"Sir"? Why the hell are you calling him "Sir"?

383
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,560
別激動  "頭號公敵"
Oh, calm down, Dillinger.

384
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,560
{\an8}約翰.迪林杰是蕭條時期聯調局追捕的最著名的黑幫頭目  曾兩度越獄

385
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,440
我們現在是階下囚  還是識相點吧
We're under arrest here. We might as well be civil.

386
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,550
干嘛  你以為能弄到個好點的牢房
Why? You think you'll get a nicer cell?

387
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,520
非常感謝[西語]  奧雷利奧
Muchas gracias, Aurelio.

388
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,710
別客氣  祝你好運[西語]
De nada. Buena suerte.

Hey, Patrick.

392
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,430
得先得搜搜你身上有沒有武器
I'm gonna need to search you for weapons.

393
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,510
然后你才能進去  把手舉起來
So you can go ahead, put your hands up.

394
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,330
試下也無妨
Worth a shot.

395
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,120
你可以進去了
You can go in now.

396
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,790
派翠克
Patrick.

397
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,510
謝謝你這么準時
Thank you for being so punctual.

398
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,800
你騙了我
You lied to me.

399
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,690
你不也是
Oh. Well... as did you.

400
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,340
我們還真是倆無賴  對吧
What a couple of scamps we are, huh?

401
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,180
我保證  這是最后一次騙你了
I promise that is the last lie that I will ever tell you.

402
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,500
先說正事
So... first things first.

403
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,520
你和聯調局犯了個嚴重的錯誤
You and the feds have made a big mistake.

404
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,150
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

405
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,260
你說什么
What?

406
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,470
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

407
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,010
很抱歉讓你失望了
I-I'm sorry to disappoint you,

408
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,660
但是我只是布萊克組織
but I'm just a humble foot soldier

409
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,890
一員卑微走卒罷了
in the Blake Association.

410
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,470
血腥約翰可是高層
Red John is one of the top brass.

411
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,310
我不是很相信你
I'm not sure I believe you.

412
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,300
信不信是你的權利  但
Well... that's your privilege, but--

413
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,060
但是我說的是真的
But I am telling you the truth.

414
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,610
你們的結論都是錯的
You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.

415
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,310
那么誰是血腥約翰
Okay, so who is Red John?

416
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,900
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

417
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,240
真的
No, h-honestly.

418
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,840
不知道
No idea.

419
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,720
組織嚴格遵循的原則是只須知道必需的信息
The association works on a strictly need-to-know basis.

420
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,190
假設你說的是真的
Supposing what you say is true,

421
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,610
那么我們完全可以在電話里說
then we could have had this talk on the phone.

422
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,270
但是如果我們在電話里說
Yeah, but if we talked on the phone,

423
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,870
那你  你可能就不會來見我了
Then you... you probably wouldn't have come to meet me,

424
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,990
不是嗎
Would you?

425
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,930
我接到命令要打電話給你
And I was told to call you,

426
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,040
告訴你游戲結束  安排和你見面
tell you the game's over, and arrange a meeting.

427
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,130
為什么
Why?

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,460
為什么要我過來
Why am I here?

429
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,110
請你千萬不要以為
Please... don't think for a moment

430
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,650
我樂意這么做
that I am happy about this.

431
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,880
組織不想有遺留問題
The association doesn't like loose ends.

432
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,040
他們討厭留下把柄
Just hates them.

433
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,550
所以
So...

434
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,270
動手吧  奧斯卡
Go on, Oscar.

435
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,790
別  別  聽著  聽著
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,250
我們談談  等等
Let's--let's talk about this. Just... w-wait.

437
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,860
我很抱歉  這不是我能決定的
Now I am truly sorry, but it is totally out of my hands.

438
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,540
我一直都很喜歡你  派翠克
I always liked you, Patrick.

439
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,350
別  別  不需要這么做
No. No. This is not necessary.

440
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,560
我們不
We don't--don't--

441
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,820
什...
H-hey...wh-

442
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,330
謝謝  奧斯卡
Thank you, Oscar.

443
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,640
你可以出去等著了  就...
You can wait outside. Just, uh...

444
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
確保沒人來打擾我們
Make sure we're left in peace.

445
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,610
你好  派翠克
Hello, Patrick.

446
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,360
你好
Hi.

447
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,460
現在什么情況
Hey, what's going on?

448
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,010
格蕾斯  你在干
Grace, what are you--

449
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,450
你  別這么做
What--please don't do that.

450
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,510
你還不如周呢
You're worse than Cho.

451
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,140
他們必須告訴我們到底怎么了
They need to tell us what's going on.

452
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,120
他們不需要做任何事
They don't need to do anything.

453
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,460
我們也什么都做不了  行行好就放松點吧
And we can't do anything, so please just relax.

454
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,500
放松  我怎么放松得下來
Relax? How can I relax?

455
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,250
你有時候表現的好像你很享受無助感
You know, sometimes I think you like being helpless.

456
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,140
好了  我收回  別放松
Okay, fine, I take it back. Don't relax.

457
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,340
就用額頭把車窗撞破
Just break the window with your forehead

458
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,420
我們就可以跳車跑了
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it.

459
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,370
伙計們  團結一點好嗎
Guys, let's try to keep it together, okay?

460
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,170
好的  很抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

461
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,280
"抱歉"
"Sorry."

462
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,410
莫林斯  你是本地人  對嗎
Mullins, you're from here, yes?

463
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,680
是的  長官  林肯高地的
Yes, sir. Over to Lincoln Heights.

464
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
-給我弄一張薩克拉門托的地圖  -是  長官
- Get me a map of Sacramento. - Yes, sir.

465
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,270
車里的電腦上就有
There's one on the computer in the car.

466
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,770
紙質地圖
Paper map.

467
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,930
紙質  地圖
Paper... map.

468
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,570
快點去找
Come on. Let's go.

469
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,530
你有紙質地圖嗎
Hey, do you have a paper map?

470
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,910
派翠克  終于又見面了
Well, Patrick, here we are.

471
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,560
可憐的家伙
Poor fella.

472
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,940
說他聰明他又傻
Smart but dumb.

473
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,460
他從來沒想到
It never occurred to him

474
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,160
我也是布萊克組織的一員
that I am the Blake Association.

475
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
你為什么要殺他
Why'd you have to kill him?

476
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,720
每個人都認為他是血腥約翰  不是嗎
Everyone thinks he's Red John, don't they?

477
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,890
所以你們兩個同歸于盡
So... it would seem a fitting end to the story

478
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,220
會是這個故事完美的結局
if you two were found dead together.

479
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,770
沒人會再深究下去
No one will look any deeper.

480
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,700
所以我也必須死  是嗎
So I'm supposed to die, am I?

481
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,390
耗了這么多年
After all these years,

482
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,530
是不是不太公平
seems kind of unfair.

483
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,470
很公平
It's totally fair.

484
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,220
游戲結束  我贏了
The game's over, and I won.

485
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,060
這可不是游戲
It's not a game.

486
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,070
有人輸  有人贏  這就是游戲
There's a winner and a loser. That's a game.

487
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,120
我可沒要玩這個游戲
It's not a game I asked to play.

488
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,190
即使如此  你還是玩得很好
No, but you played it very well nonetheless.

489
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,250
你很有趣  很有挑戰性  謝謝
You were fun, challenging. Thank you.

490
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,690
你肯定有很多問題想問我把
You probably have a lot of questions for me, huh?

491
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,270
我們多得是時間  想問就問吧
We have time, if you want.

492
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,980
我沒什么要問的
I have no questions.

493
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,680
你是個邪惡  性變態的反社會人渣
You're an evil, sexually perverted sociopath

494
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,860
還很可悲地妄自尊大
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

495
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
本質如此  其余的只是細節罷了
The rest is just details.

496
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,320
邪惡  性變態的反社會人渣
"Evil, sexually perverted sociopath"?

497
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,610
這一點我到是承認  但是
Well, I guess I have to own that, but, uh...

498
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,380
妄自尊大
"delusions of grandeur"?

499
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,440
我不承認
No.

500
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,920
我從沒有妄想
I have no delusions.

501
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,240
我建立了這個地下帝國
I built a secret empire.

502
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,150
我控制著千萬人的生命
I control the lives of thousands of people.

503
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,840
我說的話可以決定生死
My word is life and death,

504
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,220
卻沒有人知道我是誰
and nobody knows who I am.

505
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,050
如果這還不算偉大
Now if that's not grandeur,

506
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,420
那你說算什么
I don't know what you call it.

507
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,330
我會說這是卑鄙的自大狂的胡言亂語
I'd call it the ravings of a squalid egomaniac.

508
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,840
瞧
You see?

509
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,540
你總是這樣沒來由地粗魯  目空一切
For no reason at all, you... you're rude and contemptuous.

510
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,410
這就是害死你老婆孩子的原因
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

511
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,730
你又有什么資格
Who are you to butt in here

512
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,740
在這對我評頭論足
and make obnoxious judgments about me?

513
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,760
你算什么
Who are you?

514
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,500
你算得上什么
Who are you?

515
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,560
誰也算不上
Nobody.

516
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,060
誰也算不上
Nobody.

517
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,990
你以前不了解我
You didn't know me.

518
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,730
現在也不了解我
You don't know me.

519
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,990
你一無所知
You have no idea.

520
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,810
派  你的問題在于
Here's your problem, Pat.

521
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,390
你很聰明  但是太傲慢
You're a smart man, but you are arrogant.

522
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,920
你想不到別人會比你聰明
You can't imagine someone smarter than you.

523
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,770
這就是為什么每一步
Which is why I've been ahead of you

524
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,260
我都能搶在你前面
at every step along the way.

525
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,370
你有槍  想自吹自擂
You're holding the gun. You want to brag?

526
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,300
盡管吹吧  我不會阻止你
Go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you.

527
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,050
你還是不知道我怎么騙過你的  是嗎
You still don't know how I fooled you, do you?

528
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,120
我怎么從爆炸中逃脫的
How did I survive that bomb?

529
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,790
我怎么猜出你的名單的
How did I know all the names on your list?

530
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,650
你一直缺少的就是這個對吧  有人能欣賞你
Is this what you've been missing? Appreciation?

531
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,640
想讓我為你喝彩嗎
Do you want me to applaud?

532
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,530
你一無所知  是嗎
You have no idea, do you?

533
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,400
我不知道你是怎么猜到嫌疑人名單的
I don't know how you got the list of suspects.

534
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,940
干得漂亮
That was a good trick.

535
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,310
但是炸彈那事很簡單
But the bomb gag is simple.

536
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,590
有兩次爆炸
There were two explosions.

537
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,990
第一次是個震央炸彈  為了把所有人炸暈
The first was a concussion bomb, knocked everyone out.

538
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,990
第二個
The second

539
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,770
才是那個炸死哈弗內和斯特爾斯的致命炸彈
lethal bomb that killed Haffner and Stiles

540
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,810
你把我  伯特侖和史密斯
only went off after you dragged Bertram,

541
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,270
拖出爆炸傷害范圍之后才引爆的
Smith and me out of harm's way.

542
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,610
沒錯
Correct.

543
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,180
偽造你的死亡就更簡單了
Faking your own death was easy.

544
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,060
布雷特·帕特里奇是布萊克組織的
Brett Partridge was Blake Association.

545
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,340
他可以接觸到原始DNA數據庫
His job gave him access to the primary D.N.A. database.

546
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,050
他把你的DNA記錄
He switched your D.N.A. Records

547
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,310
和你留著的一具尸體的記錄對調了
with a body that you had on ice.

548
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,570
一具替代品
A surrogate.

549
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,690
你用把尸體放在汽車后備箱
And you brought the body to my house

550
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,840
帶到了我家
in the trunk of your car

551
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,990
然后把尸體放在哈弗內和斯特爾斯旁邊
and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

552
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,170
很好
Very good.

553
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,120
好個出色的事后諸葛亮
Your hindsight is 20/20.

554
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,090
能給你看件東西嗎
Can I show you something?

555
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,830
當然
Sure.

556
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,240
面包屑
Bread crumbs?

557
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
鳥
Birds.

558
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,080
真聰明
Very clever.

559
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,630
炸彈是你犯的一個錯誤
The bomb was a mistake.

560
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,640
是你演的一出戲
It was theater.

561
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,950
我知道不管事實看起來如何
I knew that whatever the truth looked like,

562
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,720
與之相反的才是真相
The opposite must be true.

563
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,740
求你別
Please don't.

564
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,590
別殺我
Don't kill me.

565
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,700
現在你來祈求寬恕了
Oh, now you want mercy?

566
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,100
在你犯下那么多惡行之后
After all you've done?

567
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,860
你和我不一樣

我只是在享受這一刻
