00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's still a bit early.We won't be open for another hour.

105
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

106
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(GASPING) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

107
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what the hell you think you're doing, boy?

108
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get that nigger outta here!

109
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Help!

110
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Innkeeper!Remember, get the sheriff,not the marshal.

111
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alas.

112
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we must act as our own bartender.

113
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down, my boy.

114
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What kind of dentist are you?\n(CHORTLES)

115
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.

116
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But these days,I practice a new profession...

117
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bounty hunter.

118
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what a bounty hunter is? -No

119
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

120
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash,a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

121
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prost.

122
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The state places a bounty on a man's head.

123
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I track that man, I find that man,I kill that man.

124
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities.

125
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes that's easier said than done.

126
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I show that corpse to the authorities,proving yes, indeed,I truly have killed him,

127
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.

128
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, like slavery,it's a flesh for cash business.

129
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a bounty?

130
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a reward.

131
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You kill people? And they give you a reward?

132
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certain people, yeah.

133
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad people?

134
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! Badder they are, bigger the reward.

135
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which brings me to you.

136
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.

137
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On one hand, I despise slavery.On the other hand, I need your help.

138
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not in a position to refuse,all the better.

139
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.

140
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

141
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.

142
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

143
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, at this endeavor,I'm at a slight disadvantage in

144
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so far as I don't know what they look like.

145
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you do. Don't ya?

146
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what they look like all right.

147
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. So here's my agreement.

148
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You travel with me until we find them.

149
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where we going?

150
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

151
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I don't know where.

152
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

153
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them.

154
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do that, I agree to give you your freedom,

155
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

156
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.

157
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

158
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right, folks, calm down.

159
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go about your business，These jokers will be gone soon.

160
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?

161
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And scare all these nice people.

162
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ain't got nothing better to do than to come into Bill Sharp's town

163
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and show your ass?

164
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What'd you just do to our sheriff?

165
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you can get the marshal.

166
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marshal! Marshal!

167
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Should we wait inside?

168
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can we just leave? After you.

169
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.

170
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want six men, six rifles behind it.

171
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want two men,two rifles up on this roof，Two men, two rifles on that roof.

172
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the barrels aimed at that front door.

173
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.

174
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You in the saloon!

175
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'.

176
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got one chance to get out of this alive.

177
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head,and I mean right now.

178
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?

179
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it is.

180
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

181
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Na wunderbar, marshal.

182
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have relieved myself of all weapons,and just as you have instructed,

183
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am ready to step outside，with my hands raised above my head.

184
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America,

185
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies

186
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before I've had my day in court.

187
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean like you did our sheriff，Shot him down like a dog in the street.

188
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

189
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?

190
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that,

191
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.

192
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.

193
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're a little tense out there.

194
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.

195
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come ahead.

196
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You unarmed? -Yes, indeed we are.

197
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies,and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey,

198
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as to the incident that just occurred?

199
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go on.- Thank you.

200
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Dr. King Schultz.

201
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court.

202
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man lying dead in the dirt,

203
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

204
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,

205
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a price on his head of $200.

206
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's $200, dead or alive.

207
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hell, you say!

208
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.

209
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:49,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?

210
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

211
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this because three years ago,

212
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he was rustling cattle from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.

213
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this is a warrant made out by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

214
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're encouraged to wire him. He'll back up who I am

215
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and who your dear departed sheriff was.

216
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In other words, marshal, you owe me $200.

217
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be damned.

218
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man,

219
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a horse, $75 in your back pocket...

220
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your plan after that?

221
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

222
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Django, I had no idea you were a married man.

223
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do most slaves believe in marriage? - No

224
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, me and my wife do.

225
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old Man Carrucan didn't. That's why we, uh... we

226
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}run off.

227
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Django.

228
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Django, Django.

229
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got sand, Django.

230
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy's got sand.

231
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got no use for a nigger with sand.

232
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to burn a runaway "r" right here on his cheek.

233
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the girl, too.

234
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

235
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both of 'em.

236
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Separately.

237
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this one， you will sell him cheap.

238
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Greenville...

239
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there should be some sort of a records office.

240
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know when she was sold...

241

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know where she came from,

242
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,490

243
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is her name? Broomhilda.

244

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?\n- Broom-hilda.

245
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Broomhilda?\n- Hm-mm.

246
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Were her owners German? - Yeah, how you know?

247
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation，She was raised by a German mistress,

248
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Von Shafts，She speak a little German, too.

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to speak German with.

251
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let me get this straight.

252
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your slave wife speaks German

255
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They call me Hildi.

256
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,370


257
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

258
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be playing a character.

259
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm?

261
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}During the act, you can never break character.

262
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand?

263
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,540

264
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your character is that of The Valet.

265
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:43,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What that is? That's a fancy word for servant.

266
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Valet? - Hm-mm.

267
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume.

268
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes? -But of course.

269
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.

270
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my valet. My valet does not walk.

271
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,660

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not on my property. Not around my niggers, he can't.

274
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

275
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allow me to unring this bell.

276

280
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.

281

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn. Now what you got to say about that?

285

400
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,020

405
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's way too simple for these jokers.

406
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.

407
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.

408
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn.

409
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.

410

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ready or what?

411
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}BIG DADDY: Aw, hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

412
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh... Oh, shit.I just made it worse.

413
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who made this goddamn shit? - Willard's wife.

414
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

415
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

416
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,\nI coulda cut it better than this!

417
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about you, Robert? Can you see? -Not too good.

418
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less.

419
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over,

420
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm ridin' blind.

421
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.I just made mine worse.

422
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody bring any extra bags? - No, nobody brought an extra bag!

423
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just askin'.Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

424
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, shitfire! If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,\nthat just defeats the purpose!

425
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing!I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing

426
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

427
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

428
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I watched my wife work all day

429
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}gettin' 30 bags together for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches ！

430
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize!

431
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

432
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, look, let's not forget why we're here.

433
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a killer nigger over that hill there! And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

434
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, I'm confused. Are the bags on or off?

435
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we all think the bag was a nice idea.

436
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better.

437
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how 'bout no bags this time,

438
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:05,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia.

439
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I like that idea a lot. - You get my vote, Robert.

440
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute! I didn't say no bags.

441
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody can see. - So?

442
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it'd be nice to see. - Goddamn it! This is a raid!

443
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see, you can't see! So what?

444
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

445
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sons of bitches!

446
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see shit!

447
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}BThere he is! Get that nigger out from under that wagon!

448
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And get that nigger-lover outta the wagon!

449
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy! What ？

450
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They tricked us! Well, where are they?

451
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Auf Wiedersehen.

452
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bull's-eye.

453
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at 'em run.

454
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

455
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn it!

456
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you care to?

457
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't see shit outta this!

458
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's getting away. - I got him.

459
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big Daddy's getting away. I got him.

460
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got him.

461
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid's a natural.

462
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?

463
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broomhilda is a German name.

464
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

465
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?

466
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broomhilda is the name of a character in the most popular\nof all the German legends.

467
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a story about Broomhilda?\nOh, yes, there is.

468
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you know it?\n- Oh, every German knows that story.

469
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like me to tell you?

470
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

471
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods.

472
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, her father is really mad at her.What she do?

473
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't exactly remember.She disobeys him in some way.

474
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he puts her on top of the mountain.Broomhilda's on a mountain?

475
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a German legend,there's always going to be\na mountain in there somewhere.

476
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he puts a fire-breathing dragon\nthere to guard the mountain.

477
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.

478
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:44,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

479
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:49,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.

480
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does a fella arise?

481
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.

482
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A fella named Siegfried.Does Siegfried save her?

483
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite spectacularly so.

484
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.

485
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.

486
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he walks through hellfire，because Broomhilda's worth it.

487
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how he feel.

488
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm just starting to realize that.

489
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, look, Django

490
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love

491
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I can't let you go to\nGreenville in a good conscience.

492
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A slave auction town in Mississippi\nisn't the place for you to visit.

493
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

494
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But let me ask you a question.

495
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you like the bounty hunting business?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So ,the man walks up to the farmer's farm , he knocks on the farmer's door

597
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and asks not to buy the horse,but the farm.

598
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And makes an offer so ridiculous,the farmer is forced to say yes.

599
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?\n- No, it's far too big.

600
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.

601
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:23,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much do you know about Mandingo fighting? -What ?

602
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:28,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

603
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

604
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,

605
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}here in Greenville to buy my way\ninto the Mandingo fight game.

606
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it

607
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They call that "One-Eyed Charley."

608
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,300


609
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bonjour.

614
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger

615

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, buddy,that's pretty fuckin' low.

616
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then play him that way.Give me your black slaver.

617

626
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Calvin's father and I were about 11 when we went to\nboarding school together.

627
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calvin's father's father put me through law school.

628
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

629
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One could almost say youse a nigger.

630
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say? - I said

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

632
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie that I should know before I meet him?

633
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.What civilized people aren't?

634
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr. Candie.

635
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,810


636
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't speak French. Don't speak French to him,

637
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it'll embarrass him.

638

640
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?

641
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?

642

659
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,210


660

01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:56,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.

700
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've heard tell about you.

701
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

702
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'.

703
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm curious... what makes you such a Mandingo expert?

704
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm curious what makes you so curious.

705
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you say, boy? - Calm down, Butch.

706
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No offense given，none taken.

707
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:29,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsieur Candie，I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.

708
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One，you do not have anything to drink.

709
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get you a tasty refreshment? - Yes! I'll have a beer.

710
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wunderbar.Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,

711
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver. Do not spare the rum.

712
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

713
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are, well, you are a neophyte.

714
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this\ncowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

715
01:09:56,370 --> 01:10:02,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all due respect, Monsieur Candie，I didn't seek you out for your advice.

716
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top-dollar market price.

717
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I was under the impression, when you granted\nme an audience,it would be to discuss business.

718
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.We were discussin' my curiosity.

719
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

720
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roscoe, Coco,go outside and play.

721
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheba... you stay right there.I know you didn't mean me.

722
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Prost!- German.

723
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, according to Moguy,if I do business with\nyou,I'm doing business with both y'all.

724
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He does the eyeballin',you the billfold? Is that it?

725
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

726
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So，Bright Boy

727
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh，and you was none too impressed, huh?

728
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for top dollar.

729
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:07,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then,we got nothin' more to talk about.

730
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me,\nthose are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so

731
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.\nHe wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.

732
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.

733
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you won't sell your best.You won't even sell your second best.

734
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But your third best ? You don't want to sell him either.

735
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I made you an offer so ridiculous\nyou'd be forced to consider it

736
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who knows what could happen?

737
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what do you consider ridiculous?

738
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:52,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?

739
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much would you say, Django?

740
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twelve thousand dollars.

741
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:11,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,but now you have my attention.

742
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Willie. Willie.Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

743
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning, gentlemen. - Good Dr. Schultz.

744
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Beautiful morning, isn't it? - You couldn't have picked a better one.

745
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria.

746
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank you very much.

747
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can tie your horse up back there.

748
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Django.

749
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:02,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues

750
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is I believe there is a level

751
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:11,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}above bright, above talented,above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

752
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000.

753
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The exceptional nigger.

754
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

755
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:24,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sun is up.

756

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have a seat, doc.

758
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite an honor.- The honor is all ours.

759

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you.

760
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,230

764
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.

765
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Touch your guns, you die. - Everybody, calm down!

766
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I saw the whole thing. No harm done.

767
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? This nigger just， I said no harm done!

768
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now take your hand off your pistol!

769
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Butch, that means you too.

770
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:35,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

771
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:40,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoot! Get back up on your horse.He broke my collarbone!

772
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:45,760

773
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:46,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yessir, boss.

774
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.You better listen to your boss,white boy.

775
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you.\nYou wanna hold my hand?

776
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Willie, take us home.

777
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start moving!

778
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a problem with your eyeball, boy? - No，sir

779
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want a boot heel in it? - No，sir

780
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

781
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You flash that bad look at me again,\nI'll give you a reason not to like me.

782
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now move, nigger!

783
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You niggers are gonna understand something about me.

784
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worse than any of these white men here.

785
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get the molasses out your ass,\nyou keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

786
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is a rambunctious sort,ain't he? - Indeed

787
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?

788
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm expecting to fall in love\nonce I see the specimens at Candyland,

789
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so before that moment,

790
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it would be good if I could have a confidential\nstrategy meeting with my confidant.

791
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mind telling me what the hell you doing?

792
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.

793
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're sure it's her? - He didn't call her by name,

794
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German.

795
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, while it's not wise to assume,in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.

796
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:16,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution.

797
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lose sight of why we're here.

798
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You think I lost sight of that?\n- Yes, I do.

799
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop antagonizing Candie.

800
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to blow this whole charade,\nor more than likely get us both killed.

801
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I, for one, don't intend to die\nin Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

802
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not antagonizing him. I'm intriguing him.

803
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.

804
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son

805
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he didn't bat a eye.

806
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember that?

807
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, of course I remember. - What you said was that

808
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is my world，and in my world you gotta get dirty.

809
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:04,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that's what I'm doing. I'm gettin' dirty.

810
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:15,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but that was the general gist.

811
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you at Candyland.

812
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, niggers, back at it.

813
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means you too, Moonlight.

814
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be. D'Artagnan!

815
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:27,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?

816
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.Yes, you can

817
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:34,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might not be able to win,but your ass can fight.

818
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Stonesipher, would you please\nshut these goddamn dogs up?

819
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I cannot hear myself think!

820
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Quiet down, Marsha!Marsha, hush up! Marsha! hush up!

821
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey，Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!

822
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on now, boy，get on out that tree.- Yes，sir

823
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long was he loose? A night. Day.Half the other night.

824
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How far he get off the property? 'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

825
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty far considering that limp he got.

826
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?

827
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One-a this new lot.

828
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian\nwouldn't bet a bead on him.

829
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

830
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now, now, no beggin'.No playin' on my soft heart.

831
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You in trouble now, son.- Yes，sir.

832
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I done paid $500 for you.

833
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger\n- fore he roll over and play dead.

834
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to understand that I'm runnin' a business here.

835
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You fought three fights. - But I won every one.

836
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you did. Yes, you did.But that last one,

837
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'.

838
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, the fact remains:

839
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

840
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what about my $500, huh?

841
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:50,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about my $500? You gonna reimburse me?

842
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You even know what "reimburse" means?

843
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

844
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll reimburse you!

845
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will?  - Yep

846
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll pay $500 for practically a one-eyed old Joe\nain't fit to push a broom?

847
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he won't.

848
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just tired of you toyin' with him is all.

849
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Matter of fact, so am I.

850
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny.Ain't got no use for him.

851
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't that right, doc?

852
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard him.

853
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to excuse Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

854
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.

855
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

856
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That right.

857
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:10,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For that matter，nor have I

858
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now，seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here，

859
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit?

860
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's your nigger.

861
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Stonesipher?

862
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:41,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

863
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:45,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

864
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your boss looks a little green around the gills\nfor a blood sport like nigger fighting.

865
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah, he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

866
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm.

867
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are used to it?

868
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.

869
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hm. Now, Monsieur Candie，whenever you're ready.

870
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.

871
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get to it.

872
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

873
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

874
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:07,260

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

876
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,490

879
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who this nigger up on that nag? Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?

880
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's-a matter? Why you so ornery? - You miss me, huh?

881
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, yessir.I miss you like a hog miss slop!

882
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

883
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.

884
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I asked you: Who this nigger on that nag?

885
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Snowball?

886
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:52,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.

887
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just who the hell you callin' "Snowball," horse boy?

888
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there

889

01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:33,480


1000
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,210


1001
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:39,440


1002
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,690


1003
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:44,560


1004
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:51,720


1005
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,000


1006
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:00,050


1007
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:10,770


1008
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,170


1009
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,650


1010
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:39,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1011
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:51,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You silver-tongued devil, you.

1012
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hurry up, girl.

1013
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.Go downstairs, get the\nbig jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1014
01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get your big pretty ass out the way.- You know you like it.

1015
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because you knows what I like. - Ooh!\nCome on with these biscuits, girl.

1016
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:12,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1017
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:17,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the best three by far were Samson

1018
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's that other one's name? - Goldie.

1019
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1020
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1021
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:29,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.

1022
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name was Joe, maybe one day\nhe said he was cold. Who knows?

1023
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, regardless, Samson's your best.\nWe all know that.You will never sell him,

1024
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can see why. He's a champion.- Hm-hm. All three are champions.

1025
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Samson's the champion.Them other two pretty good.

1026
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calvin, now what's this nigger you let,It's all right.

1027
01:41:57,830 --> 01:42:03,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to understand,Monsieur Candie,while admittedly\na neophyte in the nigger fight game,

1028
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.

1029
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right?

1030
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.

1031
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm.

1032
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need something more than just a big nigger.

1033
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1034
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Need to have what? What?

1035
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Panache. Uh,- A sense of showmanship.

1036
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Showmanship, yes.I want to be able to bill him as

1037
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:31,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Black Hercules.

1038
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Black Hercules,isn't that clever? - More like Nigger-les.

1039
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said, and I quote:

1040
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:45,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I would pay top dollar for the right nigger."

1041
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger,

1042
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:54,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But is he right as rain?

1043
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Dr. Schultz,I will have you know

1044
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates\nthe value of showmanship

1045
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie here.- Nobody.

1046
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game.

1047
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is a nigger that can win fights.

1048
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that should be your first, second,\nthird, fourth, and fifth concern.

1049
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, after you have that,and you know you have that,

1050
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then you can start to implement a grand design.

1051
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In other words, first thing is first.

1052
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1053
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Famously.

1054
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like\nnot to hear your native tongue in four years.

1055
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:50,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1056
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:55,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two weeks in Boston!- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1057
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two weeks in Boston!

1058
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.

1059
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.

1060
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, be careful now,Dr. Schultz.You might-a caught yourself\na little dose of nigger love.

1061
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.

1062
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a pool of black tar.Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1063
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yessir, you stuck.

1064
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:27,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, doctor.You can lay on all the\nGerman sweet talk you want,

1065
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:31,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.

1066
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, naturally.

1067
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention,\nnot the plucked chicken.

1068
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Schultz, don't be so down on yourself.

1069
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are quite the dapper European gentleman.

1070
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:51,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to clean these dishes,you got to put your elbow\nin these dishes, you hear me?

1071
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that nigger, don't you?

1072
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who? - "Who?"

1073
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't "who" me, bitch. You know who I'm talkin' about.

1074
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the table?I don't know him.

1075
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't know him.- No.

1076
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "No," what? - No, sir.

1077
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1078
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:28,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.Yeah. If you say so.

1079
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,no doubt about it.

1080
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:44,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if it was my money,I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1081
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would your price be?

1082
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if I was inclined to be generous,and I don't know why\nI would be inclined to be generous

1083
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}9,000. Maybe.

1084
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.

1085
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger. - Sure wasn't.

1086
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was you who approached me to buy one.- - Sure was.

1087
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,\nthat ain't too far off from right.

1088
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,

1089
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I could do so any day of the week. - Any day.

1090
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, like you said in Greenville, doctor,I don't want to sell him.

1091
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:30,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000 - that made me even consider it.

1092
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Monsieur Candie, you do posess the power of persuasion.

1093
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:52,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal. - Eskimo Joe, $12,000.

1094
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooray, doctor.Hooray.And a wise decision that is.

1095
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, that is a tremendous amount of money.

1096
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the way you have your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1097
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1098
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I would need my Mr. Tuttle to draw up a legal contract

1099
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:11,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm-mm.

01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my choosing.

1102
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Naturally.

1107
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1113
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:58,300

1118
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or\ndraggin' your ass through a bramble bush.

1119
01:48:22,660 --> 01:48:25,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1120
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- huh, sugar bear? - Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1124
01:48:39,190 --> 01:48:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Schultz,when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1125
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:45,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off?

1126
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we just talked and - Oh, so you haven't seen her back?

1133
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:07,670

01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure it would fascinate him ,the niggers' endurance for pain.

1135
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These niggers are tough , Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you gettin' all this?

1196
01:53:55,050 --> 01:54:00,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger\nwith a chewed up back, ain't worth $300?

1197
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.

1198
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She probably his wife.

1199
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch\nis in love with,

1200
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure I don't know.

1201
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:21,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If she's who they want，why this whole snake oil pitchabout Mandingos, then?

1202
01:54:21,810 --> 01:54:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.

1203
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that 12,000? That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?

1204
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it did.

1205
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His Wife, huh?

1206
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it had been a snake, it would have bit me.

1207
01:54:51,360 --> 01:55:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those lying，goddamn time-wastin' sons of bitches.

1208
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sons of bitches!

1209
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types.

1210
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:11,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, there you are.

1211
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.

1212
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1213
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window.

1214
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1215
01:55:26,650 --> 01:55:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1216
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:32,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Of course, brother. - Thank you, darling.

1217
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. Business never sleeps. - Hm-mm.

1218
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:52,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apropos,

1219
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:58,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before your exit,we were discussing the possibility\nof my purchasing Broomhilda.

1220
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.And we will again. In a moment.

1221
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's your little friend?

1222
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Ben.

1223
01:56:30,370 --> 01:56:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.

1224
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I do mean a long damn time.

1225
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:45,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old Ben here took care of my daddy and my daddy's daddy.

1226
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Till he up and keeled over one day

1227
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old Ben took care of me.

1228
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi

1229
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:05,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces.

1230
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spent my whole life here,right here in Candyland

1231
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}surrounded by black faces.

1232
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, seeing them every day,day in, day out,

1233
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only had one question:

1234
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why don't they kill us?

1235
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years,

1236
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1237
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1238
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither.

1239
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he never did.

1240
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

1241
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, the science of phrenology

1242
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:12,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species.

1243
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the skull of the African here,

1244
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the area associated with submissiveness is larger than any human\nor any other subhuman species on planet Earth.

1245
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:47,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you examine this piece of skull here

1246
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will notice three distinct dimples.

1247
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, here and here.

1248
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now，if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1249
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull\nmost associated with creativity.

1250
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1251
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in the skull of Old Ben,unburdened by genius,

1252
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:31,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with servility.

1253
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Bright Boy，I will admit you are pretty clever.

1254
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I took this hammer here

1255
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I bashed in your skull with it

1256
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you would have the same three dimples in the same place as Old Ben.

1257
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

1258
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:00,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!

1259
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop,

1260
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1261
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight,

1262
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:12,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that you can believe!

1263
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Moguy,

1264
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would you be so kind as to collect the pistol hanging off these boys' hips here?

1265
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you ever so much.

1266
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor.

1267
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where were we?

1268
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jackass.

1269
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, yes.

1270
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1271
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I right?

1272
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

1273
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring Out Hildi!

1274
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get over there yonder.

1275
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1276
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.- Now shut your mouth!

1277
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,you yourself said that

1278
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the right nigger，you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1279
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To which me myself said, "What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1280
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To which you said, "$12,000."

1281
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, considering y'all have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1282
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}went through a whole lot of trouble,

1283
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:43,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and done spread a whole lot of bull to purchase this\nlovely lady right here,

1284
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact，the right nigger.

1285
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda,

1286
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the price is $12,000.

1287
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I take it you prefer the "take it or leave it" style of negotiation?

1288
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do, doctor.

1289
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County,Broomhilda here is my property.

1290
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire!

1291
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if y'all think my price，for this nigger here is too steep

1292
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:30,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what I'm gonna desire to do is

1293
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!

1294
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right in front of both y'all! - Easy, big fella.

1295
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:44,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!

1296
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,

1297
02:02:45,910 --> 02:02:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what's it gonna be, doc? Huh?

1298
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's it gonna be?

1299
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?

1300
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you may.

1301
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That 12.

1302
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sold!

1303
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the man with the exceptional beard and his unexceptional nigger.

1304
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. Moguy. - Yes, Calvin?

1305
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?

1306
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:39,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$12,000.

1307
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a pleasure doing business with y'all.

1308
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, gentlemen

1309
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you care to join me in the parlor we will be serving white cake.

1310
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, Calvin.

1311
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:27,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.Excuse me, ma'am?

1312
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you please stop playing Beethoven?

1313
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:32,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your hands off the harp!

1314
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor!

1315
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Doctor, you can't go in there! - Stephen, Stephen.

1316
02:05:40,690 --> 02:05:43,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't got no business going in there. Let it be.

1317
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just a little upset, that's all. I'll handle this.

1318
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White cake? I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1319
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You brooding about me\ngetting the best of you, huh?

1320
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1321
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}D'Artagnan.

1322
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I was wondering What Dumas would make of all this.

1323
02:06:42,370 --> 02:06:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come again?

1324
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,810


1325
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, of course, doctor.

1326
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figured you must be an admirer.You named your slave\nafter his novel's lead character.

1327
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today,I wonder what\nhe would have made of it.

1328
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:09,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1329
02:07:11,030 --> 02:07:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.

1330
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1331
02:07:22,280 --> 02:07:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alexandre Dumas is black.

1332
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:31,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are these Broomhilda's papers? - Yes, they are.

1333
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- May I? - Of course.

1334
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1335
02:07:36,770 --> 02:07:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is her bill of sale, her ownership history,and, of course,\nher freedom papers, doctor.

1336
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you have ink and pen for me?

1337
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right over there on that little table.\n- Thank you.

1338
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1339
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broomhilda Von Shaft

1340
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:21,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}consider yourself a free woman.

1341
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Candie

1342
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1343
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:46,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is "till I see you again"

1344
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and since I never wish to see you again,to you, sir

1345
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:53,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, "goodbye."

1346
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1347
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1348
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:04,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more moment, doctor!

1349
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1350
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a custom here in the South

1351
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:20,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.

1352
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It implies good faith.

1353
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not from the South.

1354
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But you are，in my house, doctor.- So I'm afraid I must insist.

1355
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Insist? On what? That I shake your hand?

1356
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.

1357
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know what I think you are? - What you think I am? No, I don't.

1358
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:50,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think you are a bad loser. - And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1359
02:09:50,930 --> 02:09:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County,

1360
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a deal ain't done until the two parties have shook hands.

1361
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even after all that paper signin',don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.

1362
02:10:07,650 --> 02:10:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1363
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

1364
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Pooch?

1365
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1366
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you cut her ass down.

1367
02:10:48,070 --> 02:10:51,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really want me to shake your hand?

1368
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I insist.

1369
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you insist.

1370
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Calvin!

1371
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calvin!

1372
02:11:27,070 --> 02:11:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1373
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1374
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help, he's killing everyone!

1375
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit! Son of a bitch!

1376
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1377
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:21,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}MAN: Damn it, son of a bitch! What...? Fucking...

1378
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:23,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What the fuck is going on?

1379
02:12:25,570 --> 02:12:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shot me!

1380
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You stupid son of a bitch!- Sorry, Jessie!

1381
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?

1382
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aim low!

1383
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1384
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:14,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! Oh, my God!

1385
02:13:14,190 --> 02:13:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motherfucker!

1386
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1387
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold your fire!

1388
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:41,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold your fire!

1389
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:45,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1390

1391
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1392

02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then everybody there decided to blame me,

1519

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so here I am.

1520
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:47,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1521
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1522
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:53,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted,

1523
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that 11,500 is up for grabs,

1524
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:59,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back in there\nand gettin' it.

1525
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the deal?

1526
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell us who they are and we turn you loose?

1527
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:07,990

1528
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:11,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses,

1529
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:15,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and $500 of that 11,500,

1530
02:26:15,140 --> 02:26:16,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll point 'em out to you.

1532
02:26:18,350 --> 02:26:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now just 'cause it's a real handbill doesn't mean that other\nbunch of malarkey is.

1533
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now why would a slave have a "Wanted Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1534
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:36,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?
