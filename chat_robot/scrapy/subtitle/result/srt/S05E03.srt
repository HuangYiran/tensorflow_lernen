1
00:00:02,323 --> 00:00:03,983
星际之门亚特兰帝斯
前情提要
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,787
Ara Rakai
ara, rakai.

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:08,281
哦 耶!
Oh yeah!

4
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:10,347
我 Raikai和Ara 都是你的朋友
Me, rakai, ara, we're your friends.

5
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:11,542
你应该和我们在一起
You belong with us.

6
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:12,831
你们想要袭击一个Wraith实验室?
You want to hit a wraith lab?

7
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:15,244
如果有一艘飞船的话
我们就能在增援赶到之前
Having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out

8
00:00:15,364 --> 00:00:17,366
全身而退
before any reinforcements arrive.

9
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:19,030
我们走这边 你们走哪边
We'll go this way. You go that way.

10
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,695
找到什么的话就联系我们
Contact us if you find anything.

11
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,862
哦 是你们三个 谢天谢地
Oh, oh, thank god it's you three.

12
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,593
你们是Wraith崇拜者...
它们给你们什么了?
The wraith worshipers-- they did you.

13
00:00:25,816 --> 00:00:28,753
他们赋予了我们永恒的生命
They rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.

14
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,722
- Rakai 不要!
- 不准使用武器
- Rakai, no!
- No weapons.

15
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:34,766
Rodney 尽可能躲得远一点
因为我们下次再见的时候
Rodney, get away while you can, because the next time we meet,

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,875
就不是朋友了
it will not be as friends.

17
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,064
你最近几天睡着了吗?
You getting any sleep these days?

18
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:45,611
恐怕没有
Not much, I'm afraid.

19
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:51,294
但是Kanaan被允许从大陆回归以后
情况已经好多了
Although things are a little easier now that kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return from the mainland.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,169
他喜欢大城市中的生活吗?
How's he liking life in the big city?

21
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,677
他很乐意能和Torren和我团聚
Well, he's happy to be reunited with torren and I,

22
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:58,291
但是要适应Atlantis上的生活有些困难
but he's having difficulty adjusting to life on atlantis.

23
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,408
嗯 我听说淋浴把他给吓坏了
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.

24
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,724
在你的生日惊喜派对上
你还把Gero博士给击昏了呢
And you once stunned dr. Gero at your own surprise birthday party.

25
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,001
他吓到我了
He spooked me.

26
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:07,267
啊哈
Uh-huh.

27
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,869
反正这对Kanaan来说很困难
It's difficult for kanaan.

28
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,634
当然 他有我和Torren 但是...
He has torren and me, of course, but

29
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:15,013
我还是觉得他很孤独
I still think he feels isolated.

30
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,671
嗯 他需要交一些新朋友
Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends.

31
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,475
你应该叫他有空到健身房来玩玩
You should get him to come by the gym sometime.

32
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,530
我们可以练练拳击
We could spar.

33
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:24,960
谢谢你的好意 但是在一段时间内
我不希望他缺胳膊少腿
Thank you. That's very kind of you, but I need him in one piece for the foreseeable future.

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,882
啊 你太无趣了
Ah, you're no fun.

35
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:32,999
嘿!
hey!

36
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,073
Ronon!
Ronon!

37
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,024
Tyre
Tyre.

38
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,380
星际之门 亚特兰蒂斯
第5季 第3集
<font color=#38B0DE>Stargate Atlantis
Season 05 Episode 03</font>

39
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,407
Daedalus号已经确认了
你们初步搜索的结果
The daedalus confirms the results of your preliminary search.

40
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:59,153
那个星球上没有Ronon
皮下追踪器的信号
There's no sign of ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet.

41
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:57,911
心结
{\a6}<font color="#ffff00">Broken Ties</font>

42
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:01,239
这就意味着他还活着
That means he's still alive.

43
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:04,369
如果Tyre只想杀了他
我们应该能找到尸体了
If tyre wanted him dead, we would have found the body.

44
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,615
除非他把Ronon带到了什么地方慢慢折磨
Unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge.

45
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,544
我不想说的太消极
I don't mean to sound overly negative,

46
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,298
但是我听说他的思想已经很扭曲了
but from what I've heard, his mind is seriously warped.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,009
但是他没有杀我
And yet he didn't kill me.

48
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,529
杀光目击者应该对他来说更安全些
It would have been safer for him to leave no witnesses.

49
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:20,047
那么 虽然Wraith对他进行了改造
So perhaps, despite what the wraith did to him,

50
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,872
但可能他还保留着Satedan人的荣誉感
tyre still possesses his satedan sense of honor.

51
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,673
但这并没有阻止他埋伏你们
It didn't stop him from ambushing you.

52
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:28,763
也许我们可以利用Satedan人的荣誉感
来帮助我们找Ronon
Maybe we can use that satedan sense of honor to help us find ronon.

53
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,122
你准备怎么做?
How do you propose we do that?

54
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,927
我们得找一个Satedan人来帮我们
We get a satedan to help us.

55
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,907
你不会正巧认识一个吧?
You happen to have one handy, do you?

56
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,673
Teyla知道在哪能找到
Teyla knows where one is.

57
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,821
Solen Sincha
Solen sincha.

58
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:38,794
谁?
Who?

59
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,325
他是Wraith攻击Sateda后的幸存者
He is a survivor of the wraith attack on sateda.

60
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:44,396
两年前我和Ronon
在Belkan执行交易任务时碰到过他
Ronon and i encountered him on a trade mission to belkan two years ago.

61
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,853
根据你的描述
他不太像会呆在一个地方的人
By your description, he isn't exactly the settle-down kind of guy.

62
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,071
有多大可能他还在那呢?
What are the chances he's still there?

63
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:51,638
实践是检验真理的唯一标准咯
There's only one way to find out.

64
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,666
Woolsey先生 我们请求进行星际旅行
Mr.Woolsey, permission to go off-world?

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,756
- 批准
- 太好了
- You have a go.
- Great.

66
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,023
哦 还有 Teyla
Oh, and teyla,

67
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,469
你会和Sheppard中校
和McKay博士一起去吗?
will you be accompanying colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay?

68
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,559
我还没有正式收到你的复职请求
所以问一下
I only ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty.

69
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,750
她当然会归队了 是吧?
Of course she'll be returning. Right?

70
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,914
我还没有决定是否归队
I'm yet to make a decision about my future with the team.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,141
哦
Oh.

72
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:27,840
好吧
Okay.

73
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:32,410
但是我还是会和中校博士一起去Belkan
However, I would still like to accompany colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay to belkan.

74
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,016
当然
Of course.

75
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,048
Teyla!
Teyla!

76
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,412
Teyla去哪了?
Where's teyla?

77
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,509
我把她留在那个星球上面了
I left her back on the planet.

78
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,443
别担心 她很好
Don't worry. She's fine.

79
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,142
你知道我不会伤害她的
You know I wouldn't hurt her.

80
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:18,943
我不知道
Do I?

81
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:22,002
我知道你不再相信我了
I accept the fact that you no longer trust me,

82
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,451
但是时间会改变一切
but I'm hoping that will change in time.

83
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:27,123
Sateda已经毁灭了
Sateda is gone.

84
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,111
我们是最后的Sateda人了
We're the last of our kind, ronon.

85
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,599
我们是兄弟
We're brothers,

86
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,035
不是敌人
not enemies.

87
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,453
我们是兄弟?
We're brothers?

88
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,554
那我是不是应该原谅你
去年给我设套?
So I should just forgive you for setting me up last year?

89
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,839
如果你懂道理的话
事情就不会发展到今天这一步
If you had just listened to reason, things could have been different.

90
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,496
Ara和Rakai就不会死了
Ara and rakai would still be alive,

91
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,687
我们就能团圆了
and we'd all be working together again.

92
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,652
我们要以Wraith崇拜者和叛徒的身份
来纪念Sateda吗?
As wraith worshipers and traitors to the memory of sateda?

93
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:54,234
不
Hell, no.

94
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,800
当然不是
Of course not.

95
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,265
我懂了
I see that now.

96
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,211
你是被过去蒙蔽了
You're blinded by the past,

97
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,703
被你在Atlantis上那些所谓的朋友
给欺骗了
lied to by your so-called friends on atlantis.

98
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,277
但我还对你有信心 老朋友
But ilst fhaaith in you, old friend.

99
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:10,605
你需要敞开双臂 拥抱事实
You just need to open your eyes to the truth.

100
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:13,033
好吧
All right.

101
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:17,205
给我松绑 我就听听你有什么要说的
Just untie me and I'll listen to what you have to say.

102
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:22,795
那是在你把我...
Would that be before

103
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,350
打昏之前还是之后?
or after you try to beat me unconscious?

104
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:26,627
我不知道
I don't know.

105
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,033
你来选
You choose.

106
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,951
或者我可以给你来个突然袭击
Or I could just surprise you.

107
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,623
我不怀疑
I don't doubt it.

108
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,541
你怎么了?
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,365
我不太好
I'm not well.

110
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,295
但是我还有更糟的时候
But I've been worse.

111
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,037
你知道我们在哪吗?
You know where we are?

112
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,959
你还记得Sarif Sur吧?
You remember sarif sur, don't you?

113
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,314
嗯 那一次你差点死了
Yeah. You almost died on that run.

114
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,771
我们都差点死掉 就因为你不愿丢下我
We botnearly died because you refused to leave me behind.

115
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,923
你冒着生命危险来救我
You risked your life to save me.

116
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:12,411
今天...
Today...

117
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,465
我还你这个人情
I return the favor.

118
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,146
Solen Sincha?
Solen sincha.

119
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,490
走开
Go away.

120
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,634
你看不出来我在睡觉吗?
Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?

121
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,408
我么需要你的帮助
We need your help.

122
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,166
Ronon Dex有麻烦了
Ronon dex is in trouble.

123
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,936
Ronon Dex总是有麻烦
Ronon dex is always in trouble.

124
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:47,787
他有生命危险
Well, his life is in danger.

125
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,647
还有什么新一点的没?
Again. What else is new?

126
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,361
他这次又给自己惹上什么麻烦了?
What kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?

127
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,115
他被一个Satedan绑架了
He was abducted by a fellow satedan,

128
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:59,951
一个名叫Tyre的Wraith崇拜者
a wraith worshiper by the name of tyre.

129
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,721
你是说前Wraith崇拜者
You mean former wraith worshiper.

130
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:09,420
据说那条狗让它的主人失望了
于是它们把它抛弃了
Word is the dog disappointed his masters, so they turned him loose.

131
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,588
那它们真是难得的仁慈啊
Well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.

132
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,900
也不尽然
Not exactly.

133
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:16,686
只要他还在逃 他就是
让Wraith失望的下场的
So long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing example

134
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,346
活生生的例子
of what happens to humans who disappoint them.

135
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,998
Tyre现在是过街老鼠
Tyre's a marked man now.

136
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,420
我认识的大多数人见他就会杀
只是时间问题了
Most anyone I know would kill him on sight.
It's just a matter of time.

137
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,748
他曾经是一个自豪的Satedan人
和你差不多
He was once a proud satedan, not unlike yourself.

138
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,799
他们对他进行了不可想象的折磨
He was subjected to unimaginable torture.

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,924
也许他没有选择
Perhaps he had no choice.

140
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,647
总会有选择的
There's always a choice.

141
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,565
他可以像真正的Satedan一样选择死
He could have chosen death like a true satedan.

142
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,518
知道我们到哪可以找到他吗?
Any idea where we can find him?

143
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,823
如果我知道的话 他就已经死了
If I knew that, he'd already be dead.

144
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:46,272
好吧 Tyre的脑子不太好使 对吧?
All ght. Tyre's not thinking straight, right?

145
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:47,058
嗯
Sure.

146
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,897
那么他说漏嘴很有可能只是时间问题
So it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up.

147
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:52,952
他透露以后 我想你会知道的
And when he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.

148
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:54,136
有可能
Probably.

149
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:57,194
那听到风声以后就联系我们
So what do you say, you contact us when you hear something.

150
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,878
我们会处理Tyre 免得劳您大驾
We'll deal with tyre and save you the trip.

151
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,069
好的
All right.

152
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,632
敬Ronon
To ronon.

153
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,368
看看你
Look at you.

154
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,489
你连路都走不了
You can barely walk.

155
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,044
让我帮你吧
Let me get you some help.

156
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,950
你帮不了我
I'm beyond your help.

157
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,016
这是Wraith弄得吧?
It's the wraith, isn't it?

158
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,208
它们对你做了什么?
What did they do to you?

159
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,962
到了这个时候
At this point,

160
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:34,993
不是它们对我做了什么
而是它们没对我什么
it's not so much what they did to me as what they aren't doing to me.

161
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,692
给你生命吗?
Giving you life?

162
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:38,602
反向取食什么的?
Reverse-feeding or whatever the hell it's called?

163
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,997
很难形容
It's hard to describe.

164
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,712
那带来的幸福感简直是...
The sense of euphoria it offers is...

165
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,637
你上瘾了
you became addicted to it.

166
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,801
你不试一下的话是不会理解的
You can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself.

167
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,219
那是一个礼物
It was a gift,

168
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,766
但自从我让你和你的朋友逃跑以后
就无法享用了
one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to escape us.

169
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,973
嘿
Hey,

170
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,973
放了我 我能找人帮你
free me, and I'll get you some help.

171
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,543
我保证
I promise.

172
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:05,489
已经有人要来帮我了
Help is already on the way.

173
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,750
帮我们两个
For both of us.

174
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,672
什么意思?
What does that mean?

175
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,747
你做了什么?
What the hell did u do?

176
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,052
我救了我们的命
I've saved us.

177
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,193
Ronon Dex
ronon dex.

178
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,967
我一直期盼着你能为我服务的那一天
I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve me.

179
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,838
很遗憾要让你失望了
Well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.

180
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,017
哦 我知道你会努力的
Oh, I'm sure you'll try.

181
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,010
但最终
But, in the end,

182
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:50,908
你会改变主意
you'll come around.

183
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,670
Woolsey先生
Mr. Woolsey

184
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,381
Teyla
Teyla.

185
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:01,045
有Ronon的消息吗?
Any news on ronon?

186
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,229
没有
Not yet.

187
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,752
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:09,061
想一想他的生存能力
我们可以放心一些
I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a proven survivor.

189
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,659
他做流浪者的时候
和命运搏斗了很多年
He defied the odds for many years as a runner.

190
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,049
是的
Yes, he did.

191
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:18,530
我能帮你什么吗?
How can I help you?

192
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:25,397
我想为没有尽早告诉你
我的决定的事道歉
I wanted to apologize for not having come to you sooner with a decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.

193
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,389
你想什么时候告诉我都可以
Take whatever time you need.

194
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,241
如果有必要
If necessary,

195
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,784
我可以有找人顶替你
I can assign someone to fill in for you.

196
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,420
哦
Oh...

197
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,925
Woolsey先生 你有孩子吗?
mr. Woolsey, do you have children?

198
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,647
没有
Uh, no.

199
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,096
不过Yorkie陪了我很多年
But I did have a yorkie for many years.

200
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,268
一只小狗
It's a small dog.

201
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:51,049
但离婚的时候我妻子把它带走了
But my wife got him in the divorce.

202
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:55,631
我爱那条狗
I loved that dog.

203
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,545
却连说再见的机会都没有
I never really had the chance to say goodbye.

204
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,135
所以 没有...
So, no.

205
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,022
没有孩子
No children.

206
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:09,377
那么 你可能理解不了
这对我来说有多么困难
Then, with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this is for me.

207
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,264
我活到现在
For most of my life,

208
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:17,416
从没有想过离开我的人民
I never imagined the possibility of leaving my people,

209
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,760
一刻都没有...
not even for a moment...

210
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:23,932
然后情况发生了变化...
and then circumstances changed.

211
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,654
在了解了我在Sheppard的小队
中的重要性后
And after realizing a far more important role on colonel sheppard's team,

212
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:33,190
我从没想到该放手的时间已经到了
I never imagined the day would come when I would have to let it go.

213
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,002
那个时间就是现在
And now here that day is.

214
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:38,979
5年前
Five years ago,

215
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:44,100
如果有人问我会不会接收一个
银河系外的工作
if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the milky way,

216
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,268
我的回答肯定是不
my answer would have been a definite no.

217
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:48,412
而现在...
And now...

218
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,486
看看我
look at me.

219
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,490
嗯...
So...

220
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,756
虽然我不能和你产生共鸣...
while I can't empathize,

221
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,588
但是我同情你的处境
I certainly do sympathize.

222
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,588
相信我 我知道...
Believe me, I know--

223
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,862
有时候目标是会变的
priorities change.

224
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:10,819
有的时候不会
And sometimes they don'T.

225
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:18,082
Teyla 我相信Kanaan会支持你的
Teyla, I'm sure kanaan will support you

226
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,906
不管你作出什么选择
whatever decision you make.

227
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:24,703
是的 他会的
Yes. Of course he will.

228
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,918
谢谢你 Woolsey先生
Thank you, mr. Woolsey.

229
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,637
生命被偷了的感觉怎么样?
How does it feel to have your life stolen?

230
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:49,828
离黑暗那么的接近...
To be pushed so close to the darkness,

231
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,219
直到边缘才被拉回来的感觉如何?
only to be pulled back from the brink?

232
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:55,160
据我所知
From what I understand,

233
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,160
这是很神奇的感觉
it's a magnificent sensation.

234
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,457
老实说
To be honest,

235
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:02,250
感觉不错
I've felt better.

236
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,899
随便你怎么否认
Defy me all you want.

237
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,723
你们这些Satedan人都是一样的
Your fellow satedans were no different.

238
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:11,848
和他们一样 你最终会屈服的
Like them, you'll eventually submit.

239
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:15,574
在那之前我就死了
I'll die before I submit.

240
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,981
不
No.

241
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,043
不会的
You won'T.

242
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,411
嘿
Hey.

243
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,157
你起得好早啊
You're up early.

244
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,786
已经10点了
10:00 A.M.

245
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:35,180
是吗?
It is?

246
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:36,879
哦 天那
Oh, god.

247
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,661
我昨晚一点都没睡
I didn't sleep at all. I was up all night

248
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,122
一直在想Ronon的情况
thinking about this ronon situation.

249
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,454
- 想到什么吗?
- 没有 我试过所有的方法...
- Got anything?
- Nothing. I tried everything--

250
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:46,518
踱步啊 吃东西啊 泡澡啊...
pacing, snacking, bathing--

251
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:47,479
泡澡?
bathing.

252
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,558
是的
Yeah.

253
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,952
就像阿基米德
Like archimedes.

254
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,167
你指那个喜欢Teyla的希腊科学家?
You mean that greek scientist who had a crush on teyla?

255
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,956
不 我指到发明阿基米德原理
No, like the greek mathematician who came up with the archimedes principle,

256
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:56,561
也就是浮力定律的希腊数学家
the physical laws of buoyancy.

257
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:57,710
据传说
According to legend,

258
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,604
他在浴缸里面想到了这个点子
the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so...

259
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:06,545
关键是他在放松的情况下
想到了这个关系
look, the point is that the revelation occurred while he was relaxing.

260
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,776
他没在想这个问题
He was not thinking about the problem.

261
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:10,154
而答案却一直在他眼前
And the solution, as it turns out, was right in front of him all along.

262
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,373
你觉得我们忽视了什么东西?
You think we've overlooked something?

263
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,334
我不知道
I don't know.

264
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:16,518
我整晚都没睡 反复想这件事 却一无所获
Maybe. Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it and I'm drawing a blank,

265
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,565
所以我采取了一个新的视角
so I could use a fresh perspective.

266
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,346
我不是在和你谈洗澡
I'm not taking a bath with you.

267
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,842
我们过一下我们知道的东西吧
Let's just go over what we know.

268
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,842
Solen说 Tyre在逃
According to solen, tyre's on the run.

269
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,596
我们可以假设他是独自行动的
And we can assume he's operating alone because

270
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:31,998
因为如果他有后援的话
在埋伏的时候应该出现
if he had backup, they would have been in on the ambush.

271
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,694
对 他一个人 带着Ronon 在逃
Right. He's alone, with ronon, on the run.

272
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:36,850
那么这样的人会到哪去呢?
So where would someone like that go?

273
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:40,541
我能想到200个无人居住的理想星球
Well, I can think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect.

274
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:41,268
你想从哪开始?
Where do you want to start?

275
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,979
Sarif Sur怎么样?
How about sarif sur?

276
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,834
什么?
What?

277
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:45,850
我们刚从Ronon的伙计Solen那收到消息
We just got a message from ronon's buddy, solen.

278
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:49,682
他听说Tyre和Ronon被关在
一个叫Sarif Sur的星球上
He hears that tyre and ronon are holed up on a planet called sarif sur.

279
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,838
谢谢你 阿基米德
Thank you, archimedes.

280
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,268
中校 让你的小队准备出发
Major, get your team and gear up.

281
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,346
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

282
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:58,342
没有什么理由好坚持的
There's just no point in holding on.

283
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:00,569
你只是在逃避现实
You're just putting off the inevitable.

284
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:05,197
你接受的话会更好些
It's better if you just accept it.

285
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:09,368
是对你来说更好些吧?
You mean better for you, don't you?

286
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,110
Wraith不要你了
The wraith cut you off

287
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:18,005
而你把我当成牺牲品
and this is your way back in,

288
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,731
来重新回到它们的怀抱
by offering me up as a sacrifice.

289
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,360
不
No.

290
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,220
你不是我冒险救出来的人
You're not the man I risked my life for.

291
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:35,871
你是我们人民的叛徒
You're a traitor to the memory of our people.

292
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:40,535
不值得他们尊敬
You have no honor.

293
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,308
进展太慢了
Things are progressing too slowly.

294
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,417
我还有其他事要处理
I have other matters to attend to.

295
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:50,065
我们可以回到实验室进行
We can continue this process back at the lab.

296
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,062
那我什么时候可以得到奖赏?
And when will I receive my reward?

297
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,202
奖赏?
Your reward?

298
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:00,995
我按照协议把他带来了
I brought him here as we agreed.

299
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:04,323
作为交换 你答应恢复我们先前的协议
In exchange, you promised to restore our previous arrangement.

300
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,975
呃 有吗?
Huh. Did I?

301
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:07,979
你承诺过!
You promised!

302
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:16,218
恐怕我得让你失望了
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint,

303
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:19,230
没有利用价值的东西
since your usefulness has come to an end.

304
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:36,464
我们会找到他的
We'll get him.

305
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,144
敬候佳音 中校
See that you do, colonel.

306
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,587
没人
Nothing.

307
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,200
我们搞错了
So we were wrong.

308
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,262
早就知道会这样
It has been known to happen.

309
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,430
嘿 我早就说了这个消息不可靠
Hey, I always said this was a longshot.

310
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,153
中校 我是Lorne
Colonel, this is lorne.

311
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,231
我们发现点情况
We've got something.

312
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:12,696
我就知道
I knew it.

313
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,994
这里
Over here.

314
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,722
我们检查了他的脉搏
We checked his pulse.

315
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,667
非常微弱 我们得把他抬走
要不然他就没命了
It's barely there. We've got to move him or we lose him.

316
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:32,022
- Ronon呢?
- 问得好
- Where's ronon?
- Good question.

317
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,356
他的伤势不重
His injuries are minor,  but

318
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:40,192
但是心率和血压都很高
both his heartrate and blood pressure are elevated.

319
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,180
带他回来后一个小时 他醒过一次
He woke up about an hour after you brought him in.

320
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:47,997
精神混乱 发汗 恶心呕吐 浑身发抖
He was delirious, he was sweating, nauseous, trembling.

321
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:52,617
所以我给他注射了镇静剂
然后做了些检查
So I sedated him and ran some tests.

322
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:56,256
在使用阻塞阿片样物质受体的药物后
After giving him a drug that blocks opioid receptors,

323
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:59,607
我注意到这个区域的多巴鞍值有所下降
I noticed a drop in dopamine levels here--

324
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,596
这里是大脑的犒赏回路
a central link in the brain's reward circuit.

325
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,471
什么意思?
Right. Meaning?

326
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:11,068
意味着这种神经化学品所造成的影响
和吸毒者完全一样
Meaning this type of neurochemical activity is identical to that of reforming substance-users.

327
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:13,541
他正在经历戒毒的过程
He's going through withdrawal.

328
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:17,619
你一定要救他 医生
I need you to save him, doc.

329
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:21,322
现在他是我们唯一的希望
如果他挂了 找到Ronon的线索也就没了
Right now, he's our only lead.
If he dies, our chances of finding ronon go with him.

330
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:25,974
当然 可要想让恢复到足够清醒
并告诉我们一些信息 可能需要些日子
Of course. But it could be days before he's coherent enough to tell us anything.

331
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:30,392
John!
为什么没通知我参加Ronon的营救任务?
John! Why wasn't I informed about the mission to rescue ronon?

332
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,047
我们是临时决定的 没来得及通知
We were playing on a hunch. We had to act fast.

333
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,410
我先走了 呃 看看午餐准备好了没
I'm going go, um, see if they're still serving lunch.

334
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,313
星期二供应小卷饼
It's taquito tuesday.

335
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:41,883
我觉得我该和你一起去
I think I'll join you.

336
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:46,489
我很惊讶你居然丢下我行动
I'm surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without me.

337
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,090
别让我背黑锅
Don't put this on me.

338
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:51,574
你可以对回归小队这件事改变主意
You're the one having second thoughts about returning to the team.

339
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:56,332
我不能每次出去探险都让你做选择
I cannot give you the option every time we're going off-world.

340
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,676
这对我来说也不是轻松的选择
This is not an easy decision for me.

341
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,680
你认为你是唯一一个有压力的?
You think you're the only one feeling pressure?

342
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,376
我也被Woolsey逼的很紧
他叫我找一个人代替你
I've got woolsey pushing me hard to find a replacement for you.

343
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,408
那你怎么跟他说的?
What did you tell him?

344
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,740
我告诉他在我和你谈过之前我
不会采取任何行动
I told him that I wasn't going to do anything until I talked to you.

345
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,365
现在 如果你想要加入小分队 很好
Now, if you want to join the team, great.

346
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,064
我通知Woolsey 我去跟他说
I'll call woolsey. I'll make it happen.

347
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,704
但是如果你想要花时间陪儿子的话
我理解 真的 我真的理解
But if you want to spend time with your son, I understand. I do. I really do.

348
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,282
你得做出取舍
You've got to make a decision.

349
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,428
你终于醒了
You're finally awake.

350
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:32,311
过程会很辛苦
The procedure can be very taxing.

351
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,143
大部分时间你会失去意识
You've been unconscious for the better part of a day.

352
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:39,049
你在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

353
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:41,744
在我转变前我会先死掉
I'll die before I turn.

354
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,807
就像Marika和Hemi一样
Just like marika and hemi.

355
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,424
恐怕你弄错了
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

356
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:51,658
你的朋友并不是因为太强壮而死掉的
Your friends didn't die because they were strong.

357
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:56,217
他们死掉是因为过于虚弱
而受不了转化过程
They died because they were too weak to withstand the process.

358
00:20:56,334 --> 00:21:00,459
他们的意识和身躯最终紧张到完全关闭
Their minds and bodies eventually shut down under the strain.

359
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:02,861
但是你...
But you...

360
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:07,502
你更加强壮
you're stronger.

361
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:13,662
你的强壮会证明你的破坏力
And it is your strength that will prove your undoing.

362
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,544
他今早上破坏了束缚器 打伤了两个守卫
He broke through his restraints this morning and injured two guards,

363
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:26,684
我认为最好把他隔离起来
so I thought it would be best to put him in isolation.

364
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:31,512
至少这样做 就算他再次逃脱
也不会伤到别人
At least this way, if he breaks free again, he won't be an immediate danger to anyone.

365
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,196
要多久他才能恢复过来?
How long is it going to take him to go through this?

366
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,622
说老实话 我都不能确定他可以恢复
To be honest, I'm not even sure he will.

367
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:38,028
拜托!
Please!

368
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,809
杀了我!
You're killing me!

369
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,958
拜托!
Please!

370
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,055
可以减缓他的痛苦吗?
Can't you give him something for the pain?

371
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,411
镇静剂可以让他舒服些 但是
Sedatives will make him more comfortable, but

372
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:47,684
也同样会减缓他的恢复
they'll also slow down his recovery.

373
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,766
我希望他恢复得越快越好
不要用镇定剂
I want this to go as quick as possible. No sedatives.

374
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,233
他睡了?
He's already sleeping?

375
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,901
为什么我要半天才能让他安静下来?
Why does it take so much longer when I try to put him down?

376
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:06,069
你想得太多了
You worry too much.

377
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,811
可能他感觉到了你的不安
Perhaps he senses your anxiety.

378
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,786
可能他觉得妈妈在身边更舒服
Maybe he prefers the comfort of his mother's presence.

379
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:21,977
总有一天他要自立的
Well, there may be times when he will have to learn to do without.

380
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,015
这是不是代表你已经做出决定了?
Does that mean you've decided?

381
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,500
我考虑过...
I thought so...

382
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,783
明知道回到小队后 每次踏过星门
就有可能回不来了
how can I return to the team with the knowledge that every time I step through the gate,

383
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,420
我怎能做出这个选择?
there is a chance that I might not come back?

384
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:40,822
考虑到这些危险
That, given the dangers,

385
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:45,111
有可能我们的儿子
要在没有母亲的关怀下成长
there's a possibility that our son will grow up without a mother?

386
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,064
你要对他负责
You have a responsibility to him.

387
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:58,142
但是你同样也要对这个星系的人民负责
But you also have a responsibility to the people of this galaxy.

388
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:04,455
只管跟随你心中的选择
不要犹豫
Follow your heart without remorse.

389
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:09,823
你要宽慰于
这样做是为了守护千万生命的未来
And take comfort in knowing that you'll be doing so to safeguard the future of many,

390
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,643
包括你的儿子
including your son.

391
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,862
答应我在战场上 时刻要小心
Just promise me you'll be careful out there.

392
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:22,362
他清醒了 据现在差不多已经10分钟了
He's been awake and lucid for about 10 minutes now.

393
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:23,464
他说了什么?
What did he say?

394
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,546
只想要和你对话
Only that he wanted to talk to you.

395
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:35,077
我知道他们把Ronon带到哪去了
I know where they've taken ronon.

396
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,116
可以提供星门的地址吗?
You can give us a gate address?

397
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,758
不止如此 我可以带你们到
设施的中心去
Better. I'll lead you right into the heart of the facility.

398
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:41,621
你还在恢复中
Well, you're still recovering.

399
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:45,219
Keller医生告诉我 我身体系统里的
Wraith酶已经全部消失了
Dr. Keller told me there were no longer any traces of the wraith enzyme in my system.

400
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,691
- 重点不是这个
- 上校 拜托
- That's not the point.
- Colonel, please.

401
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:50,850
让我帮忙把Ronon救回来
Let me help you get ronon back.

402
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:58,804
战斗中永不退缩
No retreat in the face of battle.

403
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,831
绝不同情失败者
No sympathy for the fallen.

404
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,042
对敌人毫不留情
No mercy for our enemies.

405
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:09,648
战斗中永不退缩
No retreat in the face of battle.

406
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,933
绝不同情失败者
No sympathy for the fallen.

407
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,523
对敌人毫不留情
And no mercy to your enemies.

408
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,003
我们的敌人
Our enemies.

409
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,750
Atlantis
Atlantis.

410
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:27,993
Atlantis
Atlantis.

411
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,082
毫不留情
No mercy.

412
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:42,312
他看起来很理智
说他想帮助我们
He seems rational, says he wants to help us.

413
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,937
我认为只有我们
不得以的情况下才会相信他
I say we trust him only as much as we have to.

414
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:47,703
可以利用他的消息
但他得留在这被看管
Use his intel, but he stays here, under guard.

415
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,414
如果你想要攻击那个Warith设施
If you want to hit that wraith facility,

416
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:52,766
我们就需要所有可能的帮助
而且很显然他知道怎么进出那个地方
we'll need all the help we can get, and apparently he knows that place inside and out.

417
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,473
没错 所以这是个完美的引你上当的陷阱
Yes, and is thus in the perfect position to lead you right into a trap.

418
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:58,507
好吧 听着 我认为他更多希望我们相信
All right, look, I think, as much as he'd like us to believe it,

419
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:03,043
这不是为了赢回失去的荣耀
或者Satedan的复仇
this is not about regaining some lost honor, or some satedan revenge thing.

420
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:06,968
纯粹是一个绝望到不顾一切的男人
愿意做任何事情只为救回他的兄弟
Pure and simple-- this is about a desperate guy who's willing to do anything to help his buddy.

421
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,668
你怎么能这么肯定 上校?
And how can you be so certain of that, colonel?

422
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,250
因为我经历过
Because I've been there.

423
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:16,004
现在 有一个救回Ronon的机会摆在面前
我要抓住它 你必须要相信我
Now, we have a chance to get ronon, and I'm going to take it, and you're going to need to trust me on this.

424
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,843
好吧
All right.

425
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,504
Lorne少校的队伍和你一起出发
Major lorne's team will be accompanying you.

426
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:21,875
怎么了? 发生什么了?
What is it? What's happening?

427
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:23,422
我们查到Ronon在哪儿了
We know where ronon is.

428
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,687
我和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

429
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:25,765
准备行动
Gear up.

430
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,886
呃 Teyla 我们是出于善意的决定
Uh, teyla, this is exactly the kind of decision we were--

431
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,347
我正要去餐厅见Kanaan
I was about to meet kanaan in the cafeteria.

432
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,519
你可以帮我给他解释下情况吗?
Would you please explain to him the situation?

433
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:34,171
没问题
It's all right.

434
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,472
拜托
Please.

435
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:37,534
好吧
All right.

436
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,061
乖 乖 乖
Well, well, well,

437
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:45,077
这还有谁?
who have we here?

438
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,928
餐厅
Cafeteria.

439
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,546
餐厅
Cafeteria.

440
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:04,107
这边
This way.

441
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:18,392
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

442
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:22,106
你们不是要找能让炸药发挥
最大威力的地方么?
You were looking for a target area that would maximize the effects of your explosives.

443
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:25,153
就是这儿了 这个设施的能量中转舱
Well, this is it, the facility's power relay cham R.

444
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,910
把炸药藏好 别让他们发现了
Hide your charges to avoid discovery.

445
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,679
我们走
Let's go.

446
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,966
我猜你肯定有能够远程引爆的方法
I assume you have a means to remote-detonate from a safe distance?

447
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,240
当然 掀开保险
Well, just flip...

448
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:49,619
按这个
click.

449
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:55,970
这边
This way.

450
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:29,844
Ronon
Ronon.

451
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:31,016
Sheppard
Sheppard.

452
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,762
来的正是时候
It's about time.

453
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,457
发生什么了 伙计?
What's going on, buddy?

454
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,258
我们还以为你们不会来了呢
We were beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up.

455
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:42,629
你们的力量已经处于下风
You're at a disadvantage.

456
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:47,352
想逃走也可以 不过这样
你们朋友的小命就保不住了
You could attempt an escape, but you'll have to sacrifice your friend's life to do so.

457
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,792
Ronon 快让开
Ronon, get out of the way.

458
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:52,690
办不到
I can't do that.

459
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,323
Ronon 让开
Ronon, step aside.

460
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,262
会送命的不只是他一个
His life wouldn't be the only one forfeit.

461
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:05,938
Tyre...
Tyre...

462
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:08,071
放下武器
lower your weapons.

463
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,274
把他们带下去
Take them away.

464
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,407
Ronon 到底是怎么回事?
Ronon, what's happening here?

465
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:17,516
Ronon!
Ronon!

466
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,232
这个价码可以换回你的奖赏了吧?
I assume this is a prize worthy of reward?

467
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,974
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

468
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:46,244
噢
Well, you know,

469
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:50,428
从好的方面讲 我们不用回Atlantis
听Woolsey唠叨 "早跟你们说过"
on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go back to atlantis and hear woolsey say "I told you so."

470
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:51,600
我们会离开这里的
We're going to get out of here.

471
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:54,283
噢 当然 我们要做的
只是从这个牢房逃走 是吧?
Oh, sure, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right?

472
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:58,947
然后从全副武装的Wraith卫兵身边溜走
I mean, get past all of the armed wraith that are guarding the facility

473
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:02,146
另外还要去把Lorne和他的人解救出来
逃回到Jumper飞船那里
and free lorne and his team from wherever they're being held, get back to the jumper,

474
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,584
在我们说话这会 可能早就被拆掉了
哦 当然
which is probably being disassembled as we speak, and of course

475
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,264
我们还要去解救Ronon 不知道你们
注意到没有 他像是变了一个人似的
we've got to rescue ronon who, I don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself.

476
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:11,639
我们会救出Ronon 并返回Atlantis的
We're going to get ronon and we're going to go back to atlantis.

477
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,924
即便我们做到了 然后呢 嗯?
And even if we do, then what, huh?

478
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,693
Tyre的恢复情况
并没有我们想象中的那么成功
Tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.

479
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:22,877
我们一定要救出Ronon
We're going to get ronon back.

480
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,342
是的 当然
Yeah. Of course.

481
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,119
我们要救他出来
We're going to get him back.

482
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,524
杀了他们你就浪费了一个极好机会
You waste a huge opportunity by killing them.

483
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:45,310
要不是他们知道的那些信息
这些人对我来说一点用都没有
They have no use to me beyond the information they can provide.

484
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,056
你低估了他们的价值
You underestimate their value

485
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:51,087
到底是我低估了他们的价值
还是高估了你对我的忠诚?
Is it their value I underestimate, or your loyalty I overestimate?

486
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:52,200
Ronon说得没错
Ronon's right.

487
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,610
让他们活着并跟你合作
对你来说利用价值更高
They're much more useful to you alive and cooperative.

488
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:58,774
只需要好好开导开导
They just need some convincing.

489
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,532
有办法了
All right, I've got it.

490
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:06,579
跟他们说 我们有些重要的信息
We tell them we have some vital information that we're willing to give up,

491
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:08,220
不过只会告诉Ronon一个人
but we will only share it with ronon.

492
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:12,110
他们派Ronon过来 等他出现后
我们请求他...
So they send ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him--

493
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:15,005
我是说 他还没有完全变坏
I mean, the part of him that's still him.

494
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:18,743
你的这个方案里我只想出三个缺陷
接着讲吧
Well, I can only think of three things wrong with that plan, but go on.

495
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:22,657
他被洗脑的时间没有Tyre长
也许更容易受到我们的影响
He hasn't been brainwashed as long as tyre, which means he might be more susceptible to our influence.

496
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,388
我们可以说服他放了我们 或带我们出去
We convince him to let us out or lead us out of here, and then,

497
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,403
即便做最坏的打算
我们没能完全说服他...
worst-case scenario, he's not entirely convinced--

498
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:29,407
这就是你估计的最坏的打算?
that's your worst-case scenario?

499
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:31,165
我也没有想好 不过
Hey, I'm just spinning here, but,

500
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:34,153
我们可以利用当时不确定性
然后 然后...
you know, we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and-- and--

501
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:35,747
Sheppard
Sheppard.

502
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,704
他要见你
You've been summoned.

503
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,856
要再复习一下我们的计划么?
Do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?

504
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:46,704
不 我想我能应付
No. No, I think I'm good.

505
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:50,138
看来轮到我上肉案子了
I guess it's my turn for the sales pitch, huh?

506
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,199
等等
Wait.

507
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,121
我们要去取点东西
We need to get something.

508
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:27,719
跪下
Kneel.

509
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:32,125
真有意思 你怎么不跪呢?
You know what would be really creepy and unexpected, is if you knelt instead.

510
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:36,063
老天啊...
God...

511
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:37,938
我想你是不会吧
I guess not.

512
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:43,152
那好吧 我会尽力帮你
All right, I'll try and make it work.

513
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,871
我很欣赏你的桀骜不驯
I appreciate your defiance.

514
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,527
Ronon 真希望你能快点醒来
Ronon, I really need you to snap out of it about now.

515
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:53,863
这会让转变你的过程更有乐趣
It will make turning you all the more enjoyable.

516
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,776
Teyla! Mckay! 你们是怎么出来的?
Teyla! Mckay! How'd you get out?

517
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:42,164
Tyre 放我们出来的 快走
Tyre freed us. Let's go.

518
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:44,367
OK 快点 伙计们
Okay, come on, guys.

519
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:17,837
快 快 快!
Go, go, go!

520
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:20,099
情况怎样?
How's it going?

521
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,634
不是很好!
Not so good!

522
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,966
我的人正挡着他们 不过撑不了多久了
My guys are holding them off, but not for much longer.

523
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,028
把这个给我
Give me that.

524
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:36,450
命令他们撤退
Tell them to back off.

525
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,766
相对于你和你的队员们来说
My life will be a small price to pay

526
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:43,083
我这条小命算不了什么
for the lives of you and your team.

527
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:49,223
那如果我们炸掉这整个设施呢?
Then how about the destruction of this facility?

528
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,106
是不是也算不了什么?
Is that a small enough price as well?

529
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,052
你骗人
You lie.

530
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:56,606
我告诉过他们 把炸药埋在哪里
可以发挥最大威力
I told them where to hide the charges for maximum effect,

531
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,606
足以炸掉这整个设施
包括所有研究成果
enough explosives to destroy this place and all of its research.

532
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,477
所有你们取得的领先成果
Any advantage your hive may hold over its rivals

533
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,868
在我按下这个按钮后
就都将灰飞烟灭
will be gone with the push of a button.

534
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:09,790
等等!
Wait!

535
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,753
跟他们说 放我们过去
Tell them to let us through.

536
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,605
怎么保证你们跑远后 不会按下那个按钮
What's to stop you from triggering the explosives from a safe distance?

537
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,738
我留下
My presence here.

538
00:35:35,992 --> 00:35:38,417
放他们走 我留下
You let them go. I'll remain behind.

539
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,855
- Tyre...
- 等他们到星门那里后
- Tyre...
- once they've reached the gate,

540
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:44,295
我会用这个装置
来换取我自己的自由
I'll trade you this device for my freedom.

541
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:48,408
再不走我们就都会死在这里
Or we all die together.

542
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,039
放他们走
Let them go.

543
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:11,478
我稍后就会跟上
I'll be right behind you.

544
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,446
我们走
Let's go.

545
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:47,398
你这样做等于是放弃了一份
难以想象的大礼
You turn your back on an incredible gift.

546
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:50,632
事实上 是你首先抛弃我的
Actually, you turned your back on me first.

547
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,788
我还没好好感谢你呢
And I thank you for it.

548
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,534
我们出来了
We're clear.

549
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:58,167
我可以宽恕你
You're not beyond forgiveness.

550
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:01,050
现在还不是太晚
It's not too late for you.

551
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,066
不 已经太迟了...
Yes, it is...

552
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:05,468
对我们双方而言
for both of us.

553
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:28,309
恢复周期大概需要多长?
What kind of a timeframe for recovery are we looking at?

554
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,453
很难估计
It's impossible to predict.

555
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:34,766
他体内的酶素太多
几乎超过了机体能承受的极限
He has so much of the enzyme running through him that his body can hardly process it.

556
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,555
在机体代谢完这些酶后
When it eventually does,

557
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:39,594
他就会安静下来
that's when he'll come down,

558
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:41,996
而这是个艰巨的过程
and he'll come down hard.

559
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,375
我要去跟他谈谈
I'm going to talk to him.

560
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,373
打开
Open it.

561
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,072
看谁来了
There he is.

562
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,213
嘿 伙计
Hey, buddy.

563
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:01,123
伙计
Buddy.

564
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:04,849
你还准备把我关多久?
So, how long are you planning on keeping me prisoner?

565
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,017
在你头脑彻底清醒之后
As long as it takes to clear your head.

566
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,260
我的头脑很清醒
My head is clear.

567
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:10,826
你现在可能感觉很好 不过
Well, you may be feeling fine right now, but

568
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:13,556
这一过程对你来说可能会非常痛苦
things are going to get pretty rough for you.

569
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:16,017
我们会一直陪伴你的
We're going to get you through this.

570
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,947
不管你打的是什么主意
都不会奏效的
Whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work.

571
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:20,658
你有两个选择
You've got a choice--

572
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,705
要么杀了我 要么就放我走
you'd better kill me or you let me go.

573
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:28,814
如果放我走 我保证不会再来
找你和Atlantis的麻烦
And if you let me go, I promise I won't come after you or atlantis.

574
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,842
跟Tyre说 我也不会去找他的麻烦
Tell tyre I won't come after him either.

575
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,338
Tyre死了
Tyre's dead.

576
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:37,099
他牺牲了自己 炸掉了Wraith的实验室
He sacrificed himself taking out the wraith lab.

577
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,560
这个叛徒
Yeah, well, he was a traitor.

578
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,529
不 他是我们的好朋友
No, he was a good friend.

579
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:43,650
我们都是好朋友
We all are.

580
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:48,052
你很快就会意识到这一点的
You're going to realize that pretty soon.

581
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:50,267
嘿 你要么杀了我 要么就放我走
Hey, will you just kill me or set me free.

582
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:51,919
Sheppard!
Sheppard!

583
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,982
杀了我 或者放我走!
You kill me or set me free!

584
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:56,513
Sheppard!
Sheppard!

585
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,024
杀了我吧!
Kill me please!

586
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:11,590
求你们了!
Please kill me!

587
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,430
不!
No!

588
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,355
我拥有他们所称之为的钢琴指
纤细 灵巧
I had what they called piano fingers-- slim, nimble.

589
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,331
难怪我父母给我报了钢琴课
It's really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons.

590
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:54,210
我的首任老师 跟往常一样
向我打招呼
My first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural.

591
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:57,034
一个俄国女人 忘了她是叫
普兰斯基还是巴兰斯基
Big russian woman, polanskii or baranski or...

592
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:57,901
Sheppard...
sheppard...

593
00:39:57,948 --> 00:39:59,518
反正是个什么"斯基"
definitely a "ski".

594
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:03,409
Ronon?
Ronon?

595
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:06,983
感觉怎样?
Hey, uh, how do you feel?

596
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:12,057
感觉想打人
Like hitting someone.

597
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:15,139
选好对象了没?
Anyone in particular?

598
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,003
你 如果你不给我松绑
并给我带点吃的过来的话
You, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.

599
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,018
这是个好兆头
That is a good sign.

600
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:23,202
这是个好兆头!
That's a good sign!

601
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:26,741
他好了! 他好了!
He's back! He's back!

602
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,717
这么说他已经完全恢复了?
So he's fully recovered?

603
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,307
他的身体仍很虚弱
Well, physically he's still weak,

604
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:36,212
不过血液检查显示 他体内
已经没有酶素了
but his bloodwork shows no traces of the enzyme in his system, so

605
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,915
不用多久 他就能恢复原样
he should be back to his old self in no time.

606
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,450
真是好消息
Good to hear.

607
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:42,857
好了 很晚了
Well, it's late.

608
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:46,337
我要回房间 换一身休闲一点的衣服
I think I'll head back to my quarters and change into something a little more relaxed.

609
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,814
晚安
Good night.

610
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,400
John 能和你谈谈么?
John, may I have a word?

611
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,627
当然
Yeah. Sure.

612
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,232
Teyla 请进
Teyla. Come in.

613
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:12,850
你不是说过换一身休闲一点的衣服
I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed.

614
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,401
对我来说 这就是休闲服
For me, this is more relaxed.

615
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,874
- 想来一杯么?
- 不 谢了
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

616
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,524
我和John谈过了
现在想获得正式的批准
I just spoke with john, and now I would like to make it official.

617
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:25,259
希望能让我立即归队
I'm requesting a return to active duty.

618
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,798
回到Sheppard中校所在小队中的位置
I would like to resume my position on colonel sheppard's team.

619
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:30,884
你确信要这么做?
You're sure this is what you want?

620
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,513
非常希望
Very much so.

621
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:35,079
那好吧 欢迎归队
Well, then, welcome back.

622
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,341
谢谢 Woolsey先生
Thank you, mr. Woolsey.

623
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,110
- 晚安
- 晚安
- Good night.
- Good night.
