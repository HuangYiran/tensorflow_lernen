00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:04,987
彼岸是天堂 第二季 第四集

2
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,187
多谢你能来见我 芬顿先生
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Mr Fenton.

3
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:01,255
莫里知道你来这么? 
Does Moray know you're here?

4
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,186
不知道 先生 按之前的约定
No, sir. As we agreed,

5
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:07,187
这场会面只有你知我知
this meeting is between you and I.

6
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,913
我好像还不能走
I can't seem to leave.

7
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:42,261
总有做不完的事
There's always something else to do.

8
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:44,261
我只是想为上任的第一天做好准备
I just want to be prepared for my first day.

9
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:46,262
噢 你行的
Oh, I don't doubt you will be.

10
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:52,119
你是来祝我好运的? 
Have you come to wish me luck?

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,262
你要是需要的话
 I would, if I thought you needed it.

12
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:08,262
- 我们如愿以偿了 - 是的 差不多
- We have everything we wished for. - Yes. Almost.

13
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,261
抱歉 艾德蒙 我能帮什么忙?
I'm sorry, Edmund. What could I do?!

14
00:02:25,262 --> 00:02:28,261
我看见门被砸碎了 来里头看看
I saw the door was smashed, had a look inside

15
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:33,262
却没有人 就只好叫你来了
but I couldn't see anyone. So all I could think of was send for you.

16
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:39,261
你觉得是谁干的?
Who do you think it was?

17
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,261
窃贼? 不像是偷了很多东西的模样 是吧?
Robbers? Doesn't look like they've taken much, does it?

18
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,356
我经营这家店多少年了 
How many years have I taken care of this shop,

19
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,261
从无到有一点点地积累
 built it up from nothing?

20
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:48,621
我的小店 洛维特的帷帐 
My shop. Lovett's Drapery.

21
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:52,261
看这一团糟! 谁会做这事?
 Look at this! Who would do this?

22
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:52,976
是谁闯进来
Who would come in here 

23
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:55,261
这么肆意践踏一个男人的心头肉?!
and not give a care for a man's life?!

24
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,261
我们会整理好的 然后修好门!
We'll tidy it up, get the glass fixed!

25
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,261
再然后我就满心担忧地回到我的小屋去
But then I go back to my cottage with a head full of worries.

26
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,261
那干脆卖了它不就好啦 是不是?
You'll just have to sell it then, won't ya?

27
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:04,262
是不是林子大了什么鸟都有 山姆?
What kind of people live in this world now, Sam?

28
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:14,261
德妮丝!
Denise!

29
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:18,261
我... 我可不会假装这是我人生中
I'm... Look, I'm not going to pretend that this is the happiest

30
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,261
最快乐的一天
day of me life.

31
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,261
我也不会说我觉得这很公平
I'm not going to stand here and say I think it's fair,

32
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,261
因为老实说...
because honestly...

33
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:26,261
哎呦喂 注意喽 德妮丝 梅尔托在找你呢
Oh, you'd better watch out, Denise. Myrtle's looking for you.

34
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:30,261
我想她一定给你特制了一份腌鱼
I do believe that she got hold of a kipper especially for you.

35
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,261
我只想告诉你...
Look, I just want you to know that...

36
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,896
噢! 差点忘了 你叔叔回来了
Oh! Nearly forgot. Your uncle's back. 

37
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,261
但小店出了点问题
Problem at the shop.

38
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:39,461
瞧 一直以来我都知道我没希望 就像...
Look, I knew all along I didn't stand a chance, like, so...

39
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:42,261
早 我都搞不清自己是饿还是不饿了
Morning. I don't know whether I'm hungry or not hungry.

40
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:46,262
我太激动了 可否亲吻一下女装部主管呢?
I'm so excited. Am I allowed to kiss the Head of Ladieswear?

41
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,261
我永远也不会像你俩那么出色 但是我可以说
I'll never be as fine as you two, but I can say now,

42
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,261
苏西・贝尔 来自女装部
Susy Bell - Ladieswear.

43
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:56,261
- 那对我来说就够威风了 - 你在这儿!
- Well, that's fine enough for me. - There you are!

44
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:57,826
我给你煮了一份腌鱼 真他娘的好吃  
I have cooked a bloody lovely kipper for you 

45
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,261
但要变得真他娘的冷了
and it's going bloody cold.

46
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,261
我马上就去 梅尔托
I'll be along in a minute, Myrtle.

47
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:04,261
不是因为你有权把我调去店里而奉承你的
I'm not doing this because you're in a position to put me front of house.

48
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,430
我永远不会干这种事
I would never do such a thing.

49
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:07,261
早 梅尔托! 我也在呢!
Morning, Myrtle! I'm here too!

50
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:11,261
碰巧手边有腌鱼就做了 就这样而已
Just happened to get me hands on a kipper, that's all.

51
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,261
好吧 在亚瑟向你脱帽致意之前
Well, I'd better say it quick,

52
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:15,261
我得速战速决
before Arthur comes doffing his cap at you.

53
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:19,262
我不会为难你 只是 尽量...
Look, I won't make it difficult for you. Just, try and...

54
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:23,261
我发现真的挺难接受 如果你对我说...
I'd find it really hard if you spoke to me...

55
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,565
克莱拉 我不会一夜之间就变成奥德丽女士
Clara, I'm not going to turn into Miss Audrey overnight.

56
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,261
我保证
 I promise.

57
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:28,261
以后还需要请你多多关照
I'm going to need your help.

58
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:32,261
可最重要的是 我从来都不想失去你
But most of all, I never want to lose your friendship.

59
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,261
德妮丝! 你的腌鱼!
Denise! Kippers!

60
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,443
我压根就不喜欢腌鱼 
I don't even LIKE kippers.

61
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,262
苏西肯定能帮上忙
 - I'm sure Susy'll help you out.

62
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:53,261
你在我店里干什么?
What are you doing in my shop?

63
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,386
听见没? 你在我商店干什么?!
Did you hear me? What are you doing in my shop?!

64
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:56,261
当时又没人
It was empty.

65
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,261
你打破了门! 看看你做的好事!
You broke the door! Look at the mess you've made!

66
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:01,262
哪条沟里来的滚回哪去! 你听见没?!
Get back to the gutter you came from! Do you hear me?!

67
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,262
- 上帝保佑你 - 滚蛋!
- God bless you. - Get out!

68
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,261
真是难以置信地乏味 他们谈论的尽是
It's tedious beyond belief. All they talk of is

69
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:18,261
会热卖的是印花还是条纹
whether prints or stripes will sell,

70
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:21,761
这个秋天哪种丝绸会热销
what kind of silk might sell this autumn.

71
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:23,160
爸爸 凯瑟琳跟我说 
Papa, Katherine told me how, when she was a girl, 

72
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:24,261
她小时候常常
she used to

73
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:28,261
跑到森林里去找神秘人
run off into the woods here searching for The Secret People.

74
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,261
神秘人是我想象出来的朋友
The Secret People were my imaginary friends.

75
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:33,948
对独生子女的孤独的一种慰藉 
An only child's compensations for her loneliness. 

76
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,261
- 爸爸 我们能... - 沿街扩建店面
- Papa, could we...? - It was Moray's intention

77
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:38,262
是莫里的主意 没错吧?
to expand along the whole street, wasn't it?

78
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:45,262
汤姆 亲爱的 芙罗拉在问你问题
Tom, my darling, Flora was asking you a question.

79
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:50,261
你的问题是什么 芙罗拉?
What is your question, Flora?

80
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:53,308
我喜欢听凯瑟琳讲她少女时期的故事
I loved hearing about when Katherine was a girl.

81
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,262
你能不能也给我讲讲你年轻的时候
 Would you tell me about when you were a boy?

82
00:05:58,262 --> 00:05:59,262
大概可以
Possibly.

83
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:07,261
我认为我们应该在莫里没做到的点上找突破口
I think we should do what Moray so patently failed to achieve.

84
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:11,261
我有三个目标 第一个是找机会重返天堂百货
I have three objectives - to find a way back into the store.

85
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,261
- 你做到了 - 是"我们"做到的
- You've done that. - WE'VE done that.

86
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:15,261
没你里应外合 什么事都完不成
Nothing would be possible without you keeping it together here.

87
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:18,261
另外两个是 筹集资金 然后劝服
And the other two are, to find the funds, and persuade

88
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,261
- 威斯顿夫妇卖了商店 - 卖给我
- Mr and Mrs Weston to sell. - To sell to me.

89
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,261
莫里先生 达德利先生
Mr Moray. Mr Dudley.

90
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,261
我有个关于女装部促销的建议
I have a proposal for a promotion in Ladieswear.

91
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:28,261
点子来得挺快啊
You didn't waste much time.

92
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:33,030
下午茶 实际上 是办个茶宴 
Afternoon tea. Indeed, a tea party. 

93
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,261
放些桌子 铺上洁白的桌布
Tables. With white tablecloths.

94
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,261
加上茗茶 蛋糕和烤饼
Fine teas. Cakes and scones.

95
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:40,261
女士们会被吸引进来 然后坐下闲聊...
The ladies would come in, to sit and gossip...

96
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:42,261
那由谁来上蛋糕和茗茶?
And who would serve the cakes and fine teas?

97
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,262
梅尔托可以
I thought Myrtle.

98
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:48,261
不错! 你心肠真好 德妮丝
Right! Oh, it is good-hearted of you, Denise.

99
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:51,261
我们都知道梅尔托唠叨着调到店里来的事
We all know that Myrtle nags away to come front of house.

100
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:54,261
但是好心肠可不是运作一个部门最需要的品质
But good-heartedness is not the best quality for running a department.

101
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,594
梅尔托绝不能派去服务我们的客户 
Myrtle must never be let loose on our customers.

102
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:59,261
女装部上蛋糕?!
 Cakes in Ladieswear?!

103
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:03,779
你真以为那是我们苦心要塑造的形象吗?
Do you honestly suppose - that is the impression we are trying to make?

104
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,261
不是 先生
No, sir.

105
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,261
就这样吧
No. Right.

106
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,928
事实就这样 德妮丝 
It's true, Denise, what he says.

107
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,261
他没说错 你需要立刻进入角色
 You need to step into the role now.

108
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,261
那意味着你做的决定可能不招人喜爱
That means making decisions that others won't like.

109
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:16,261
你必须自信坚定
You have to be strong.

110
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:17,179
最终 他们一定会尊重你
In the end, they will respect you, 

111
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,200
但是一开始
but to begin with,

112
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:21,262
你不能总担心他们是否喜欢你
 you can't let yourself worry whether they'll like you or not.

113
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:50,261
德妮丝小姐 这些帽子是要展览的吗?
Miss Denise, are these hats to go on display?

114
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,261
是的 苏西 放在窗户旁边
Yes, Susy. Put them by the window.

115
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:55,261
德妮丝小姐 我该把它们都取出来吗 女士?
Miss Denise, shall I put all of them out, ma'am?

116
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,261
对了! 德妮丝小姐
Oh! Miss Denise,

117
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:59,261
我是否需要给试衣间添些鲜花?
shall I fetch some fresh flowers for the changing closet?

118
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:02,261
摆弄鲜花一向是克莱拉喜爱的活
Clara usually likes to do the flowers.

119
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:04,262
来吧 我们一起去取花
Come on, we'll fetch them together.

120
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:11,262
德妮丝小姐 梅尔托在找你
Miss Denise, Myrtle's asking for you.

121
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:15,566
但是你答应了的 
But you promised.

122
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,262
我说了我试过了 梅尔托
 I said I'd try, Myrtle.

123
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:20,625
好吧 你没有尽力 对吧? 
Well, you didn't try hard enough, did you?

124
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,261
苏西都有了个职位
 Susy has a position.

125
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,261
怎么苏西有的我就没有?
What's Susy got that I haven't?

126
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,261
就因为她是你室友 对吗?
She shared a room with you, is that it?

127
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:27,326
我真的很希望我们依然是朋友
I so want us to remain friends.

128
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,261
朋友? 朋友是这么当的?
Friends? Is that what you call it?

129
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,261
你对我来说是朋友
I know I'm a friend to you.

130
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,261
我就不确定你是否当我是朋友了 因为
I'm not so sure you're a friend to me, now that

131
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,261
你名字后还有个"小姐"尊称呢
you have a Miss before your name.

132
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,261
好了 我还有活要干 德妮丝"小姐"
Well, I have work to do, MISS Denise.

133
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,262
炉子得擦干净
There's stoves to be scrubbed.

134
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:58,261
这个旧理发店收购了有一年多了是吗?
This old barber's shop was purchased over a year ago, I understand?

135
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:01,261
是的先生 本是计划着扩展店面用
Yes, sir. I believe the plan was to expand.

136
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,261
那怎么现在是这个样子?
Then why does it stand like this?

137
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:06,261
莫里先生重新考虑了 先生
Mr Moray reconsidered it, sir.

138
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,690
叫他到这来见我 
Ask him to come out here to join me. 

139
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,261
恐怕莫里先生这会儿
I'm afraid Mr Moray's

140
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,261
去见我们的供应商了 先生
gone out to meet with one of our suppliers, sir.

141
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:15,261
- 要多久? - 我不知道
- How long will he be? - I don't know.

142
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:18,261
也许他约见的不止一个
I think perhaps he is visiting more than one merchant.

143
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:20,262
那我就等着
Then I will wait.

144
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:28,661
嘿 看这个老巫婆 
Hey, look at this old witch.

145
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:30,261
从这都能闻到她的味道
Ugh, smell her from here.

146
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,261
你觉得她是要进去买件皮草吗?
Do you think she's coming in to buy a fur?

147
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:34,262
我们该问问她 给她量量尺寸
We should ask her. Measure her up.

148
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:12,262
很抱歉当时对你那种态度 我做得太过了
I'm sorry I spoke to you that way. There was no call for that.

149
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,262
你饿吗?
Are you hungry?

150
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,261
你想要的很明显 莫里
It's clear what you want, Moray.

151
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:37,261
你和我都渴...渴望同样的事
You c-crave the same thing as I do.

152
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:42,261
威斯顿夫妇挡着咱...咱们的路了
Mr and Mrs Weston stand in the way of b-both of us, do they not?

153
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:46,261
也许在这件事上我们有着相同的利益
Perhaps you and I may be of benefit to one another in this matter.

154
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:49,261
这件事怎么行得通 芬顿先生?
How might that be possible, Mr Fenton?

155
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,261
我有资金 你有手...手段
I have the funds. You have the m-means.

156
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:54,166
你借钱给我?
You would loan me the money?

157
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,261
别急 莫里 先别着急
Slowly, Moray. Slowly. Please.

158
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:58,404
我会买下天堂百货 
I would purchase The Paradise 

159
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,261
那么我们就是它的共有者了
and we would become joint owners.

160
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:03,262
这就是我的提议
That is what I offer.

161
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,261
开诚布公地说
Let us be forthright.

162
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:10,261
你我都想完全拥有这家百货
Each of us intends to own the store outright.

163
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,261
这场仗就在眼前
That battle lies ahead.

164
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:15,261
我建议我们彼此都接受这个提议
I suppose each of us would take that on rather than

165
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:17,261
总好过任凭威斯顿夫妇摆布
be at the mercy of Tom Weston and his wife.

166
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:20,261
- 不是吗? - 是的
- Is that so? - It is so.

167
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,261
那么如有你能请到一个好律师的话
And if you have the price of a good lawyer,

168
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:25,261
我们就能达成协议了
we can proceed to an agreement.

169
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:28,261
那么你觉得我们该如何除掉他们?
And how do you propose we might remove them, sir?

170
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:31,118
不用我们动手 他们自己就会除掉自己
WE don't. They remove themselves,

171
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,261
只要我们能介入他们之间
 if we come between them.

172
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:37,261
介入他们? 但是我们怎么能做到 先生?
Between them? But how might we do such a thing, sir?

173
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,183
就像我说的
As I say, 

174
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:43,025
我有资金 你有手段
I have the funds, you have the means.

175
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,261
嫉妒
Jealousy.

176
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:47,217
人都会憎恶他的对手 还不止是憎恶 
A man detests a rival, but more than this,

177
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:51,262
他一定受不那个人和他的妻子眉来眼去
he cannot bear the sight of the man who has enjoyed intimacy with his wife.

178
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,262
我知道了
I see.

179
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,262
我要奚落汤姆・威斯顿
I must taunt Tom Weston.

180
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:06,261
对凯瑟琳示好 表示出我对她的关心
Show kindness to Katherine. Exhibit concern for her.

181
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:11,262
并且提醒她 提醒他们俩 我们的亲密关系
And remind her, remind them both of our closeness.

182
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:21,261
我做不到 先生
I cannot do such a thing, sir.

183
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:24,262
做不到还是不...不想做?
Cannot or w-will not?

184
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,261
感谢你的考虑 芬顿先生
Thank you for your consideration, Mr Fenton.

185
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:31,261
我以为你是个认真的人 莫里
I thought you were a serious man, Moray.

186
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:32,961
我当你是个有目标 有野心的人
I took you for a man of purpose, ambition.

187
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:36,261
你只要调调情就能拿回你...你的商场
You could have your store back for the sake of a l-little flirting.

188
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:38,261
可你连玩弄威斯顿夫人都做不到
Yet you find it beyond you to toy with

189
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:41,262
莫非是出于感情上的原因?
Mrs Weston, perhaps for sentimental reasons?

190
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:47,262
我的原因我自己清楚就好
My reasons are for me to know.

191
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:54,262
如果你能重新考虑 我随时为你准备着
If you should reconsider, I'm always available to you.

192
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:08,262
去吧
Come on.

193
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:16,261
我相信女装部一切都好 克莱拉
I trust that all is well in Ladieswear, Clara.

194
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,261
既然你问了 先生 我可决不会引起骚乱
Since you ask, sir, far be it for me to cause a stir.

195
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,261
什么?
Yes?

196
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:23,261
我们相处的很好
We are getting along splendidly.

197
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,261
奥德丽小姐浑身是刺 让大家都心情不好
Miss Audrey had a prickle about her that could make the air sour.

198
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,261
德妮丝小姐总是贴心又开朗
Miss Denise is all sweetness and delight.

199
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,262
不是太贴心 我希望
Not too sweet, I hope.

200
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:36,261
我不想我们在错误的影响下犯错
I would hate to think we'd made a mistake under the wrong influence.

201
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:38,415
哪来的错误的影响 先生?
What influence might that be, sir? 

202
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,262
德妮丝是莫里的爱人
Denise is Moray's lover.

203
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:46,261
我相信德妮丝能赢得这个职位是因为她的才能
I choose to believe that Denise won the position because of her talents.

204
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:49,261
我很钦佩你对人性如此相信 克莱拉
I admire your faith in humanity, Clara.

205
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,262
虽然我不能苟同
Even if I cannot share it.

206
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,594
莫里先生今天去哪了?
Where is Mr Moray today? 

207
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,261
我又不是他的记事本 先生
I don't keep his diary, sir.

208
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,262
这不是像我这样的人能知道的
It's not for the likes of me to know.

209
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,187
你怎么了 威斯顿先生?
What is it, Mr Weston?

210
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,261
一会就过去了 你走吧!
It will pass. Go! Be on your way!

211
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,262
我不能让你这么痛苦地一个人在这 先生
I can't leave you here in such pain, sir.

212
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,262
苏西...
Susy...

213
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:21,262
苏西
Susy.

214
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,262
有客人来了
We have a customer.

215
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:33,261
他在你的办公室 他在这儿待了一上午了
He's in your office. He's been here all morning.

216
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:35,261
我不得不编个理由解释你为什么不在这
I had to make up a story to explain why you were not here.

217
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:37,262
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

218
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,261
威斯顿先生
Mr Weston.

219
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:45,261
抱歉我没在 我没想到你今天会来
Forgive my absence. We weren't expecting you today.

220
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:48,261
等了很久了吗 先生?
Have you been waiting long, sir?

221
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,261
你的会面有成效吗?
Did your meeting prove to be fruitful?

222
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,262
这些事还是要小心处理的
These things take delicate handling.

223
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:57,261
达德利告诉我你和新的客户会面了
Dudley told me you were meeting with new clients.

224
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:59,262
我有很多会面
I had various meetings.

225
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:04,262
和我说说那个理发店
Tell me about the barber's shop.

226
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,261
它看着不顺眼
It's an eyesore.

227
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:12,262
一个运转良好的企业需要持续发展
A well-run enterprise would get on with developing it.

228
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:17,262
我的计划是把那做成珠宝店
My plan is to use the premises as a jewellery department.

229
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,861
你打算扩建店面吗 先生?
Are you intending to expand, sir?

230
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:23,261
整个街道 两边都要
The whole street. Both sides.

231
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:24,261
我要成为
I intend to be the owner

232
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:27,262
这个国家最大的的百货商场的拥有者
of the largest department store in this country.

233
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:35,262
你是怎么变成这样的 拉比?
What brought you to a life like this, Ruby?

234
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:40,202
我本来有个女儿 现在仍然有 我猜 
I had a daughter. I still do, I suppose. 

235
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,261
她跑了 离开了我
She ran off. Left me.

236
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,206
我生病了 
I was ill and, 

237
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:50,261
她那时才15岁 还是个孩子
well, she was only 15, she was still a child.

238
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:53,261
她是个不负责的家伙 但是你依然要爱她
She's a flighty thing. But you had to love her.

239
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,261
这不是一个女儿该做的事
She's not much of a daughter to do such a thing.

240
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:58,261
哦 我是她的负担 我知道
Oh, I was a burden to her, I know I was.

241
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:01,262
一个只能照顾生病母亲的女孩没法生活
A girl can't live only to take care of her sick ma.

242
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:09,261
我只想告诉她... 我已经好了
I just want to tell her that... that I am on me feet

243
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:13,261
- 不需要她来照顾我 - 你是在找她吗?
- and she don't have to look after me. - Are you searching for her?

244
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,261
- 我找到她了 - 在这个城市?
- I've found her. In this city?

245
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:16,262
就在这条街
In this street.

246
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,261
她给我妹妹写信了 
She wrote to me sister, and I was

247
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,261
我很高兴她现在能有自己的生活
so glad to hear that the child has a good life for herself now.

248
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,261
她自己的! 连她母亲都不管?
For herself, yeah! Not a care for her mother!

249
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:28,262
你会原谅你孩子的任何错
Your own bairns can be forgiven anything.

250
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,261
如果你需要这还有很多吃的
There's more food if you want it.

251
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:36,313
你知道现在什么能让我感觉好点吗? 
You know what would help the way I'm feeling? 

252
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,261
喝点酒
A little drink.

253
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:40,262
我只想安抚下我的灵魂
You know, just to soothe the soul a touch.

254
00:16:45,262 --> 00:16:48,261
我一整天都在琢磨 你错了 约翰
It's been on my mind all day. You're wrong, John.

255
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:51,261
我要在女装部办茶宴的做法才是正确的
My motives for staging the tea party in Ladieswear are the right ones.

256
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:55,261
我们的顾客最喜欢看别人购物
More than anything, our customers like to see each other shopping.

257
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,261
我要她们产生嫉妒心
I want to feed their jealousies

258
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:59,261
这样一来她们就会开始闲聊
and the tittle-tattle that comes with them.

259
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,261
如果斯皮罗夫人买了一个带丝带的凉帽
If Mrs Spiro buys the summer hat with ribbons,

260
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:03,261
那么沃恩夫人也会想要同样的帽子
then Mrs Vaughan wants the same hat.

261
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:06,261
她们本来想随便逛逛 但是感觉太引人注目了
They try to loiter as it is, but they feel conspicuous,

262
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:09,261
所以才会离开 我想让她们留下来
so they leave. I want them to stay.

263
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,261
如果有很多女人在看着
If there are tables of women watching,

264
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:14,261
那么这些购物的女人为了炫耀会购买更多
those who are shopping will buy more in order to show off.

265
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,218
你是对的 对不起 
You're right. I'm sorry. 

266
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:19,261
那么是梅尔托来给茶宴服务吗?
And will Myrtle be serving the tea?

267
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:22,261
她要做的就是给每个桌子端端盘子
All she will have to do is take a tray to each table.

268
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,428
我不能让我的人做这些 
I can't ask my girls to do it.

269
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,262
那就放手去做吧
Then by all means go ahead.

270
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:34,261
汤姆・威斯顿想要扩张商场
Tom Weston is intent on expanding the store.

271
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,186
这难道不是件好事吗? 
But that's a good thing, isn't it?

272
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,261
不 对我们来说不是
No, not for us it isn't.

273
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:40,261
我绞尽脑汁地想办法来筹集资金
I've been racking my brains to find a way to raise the funds to

274
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:43,261
买下目前的天堂百货
buy The Paradise as it stands.

275
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,689
如果他沿街建更多的店铺 
If he builds more, builds along the street, 

276
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,261
就超出我的能力范围了
it will be beyond my reach.

277
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:51,261
我以为我会有时间 但我没有了
I thought I had time on my side. I don't.

278
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:56,261
德妮丝 如果我能找到办法现在就行动 马上
Denise, if I was to find a way to act now, soon,

279
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:58,261
如果这个办法有风险...
if it was precarious....

280
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:01,262
你必须把握机会 约翰 一定要
You must take it, John. You must.

281
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,261
我们得让你试试新制服 梅尔托
We'll need to get you fitted for a new uniform, Myrtle,

282
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:22,261
如果你要在女装部端茶倒水的话
if you're to be serving tea and cakes in Ladieswear.

283
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:27,262
娘的我就知道 我就说德妮丝不会让我们失望
I bloody knew it! I said Denise would not let us down.

284
00:18:29,262 --> 00:18:33,261
姑娘们 姑娘们 我有好消息
Girls! Girls! Wait until you hear about this!

285
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,261
你忘了自己的身份 德妮丝小姐
Oh, you're forgetting yourself, Miss Denise.

286
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,262
你的桌子在那边
Your table's over there.

287
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:42,261
没人介意的话 我跟朋友坐一起
I'll sit with my friends, if no-one minds.

288
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:43,261
真搞不懂你叔叔 德妮丝
There's no fathoming your uncle, Denise.

289
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:46,261
有人闯进了他的商店 搞得一片狼藉
His shop is broken into, the place is a mess.

290
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,261
他找到了那个犯事的流浪女
He finds some tramp woman who's responsible,

291
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:51,261
发誓要掐死她 可后来我再见到他
swears he'll strangle her. The next time I see him

292
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,261
他正带着那个流浪者去他的店里安身了
he's escorting the very same vagabond into his shop for shelter.

293
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:56,501
一定是我们在街上见到的老巫婆
Must be that old witch we saw on the street,

294
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,261
苏西 你叫她什么来着
 Susy. What did you call her?

295
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,262
无牙老太婆 这里都能闻到她的味儿
Toothless hag. Smell her from here.

296
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:09,261
今天我问莫里昨天他在哪儿 他为什么要撒谎
Why would Moray lie to me about where he was today?

297
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,261
这重要吗
Why does it matter?

298
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:14,262
重要 因为他有事隐瞒
It matters because he has something to hide.

299
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,261
亲爱的 没有什么秘密可言
My darling, there is no secret.

300
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:22,261
莫里不是回来顺从我们想法的
Moray did not come back to serve our purpose.

301
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,261
他是打算从我们手中夺走天堂百货的
He intends to try to wrest The Paradise from us.

302
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:28,261
他到处奔走想借点钱
He has been scurrying around trying to borrow money,

303
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:30,262
但是没人会考虑他
but no-one will so much as consider him.

304
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,785
我已经确定过了 
I have made sure of that. 

305
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:37,261
爸爸的银行朋友知道如果有人
Papa's banking friends know I would be

306
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:40,261
把莫里当回事儿 我会非常生气的
most upset if any of them so much as considered Moray for a meeting.

307
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,261
那他今天去见谁了
Then who was his engagement with today?

308
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,261
- 太漂亮了 - 你拿着它干什么?
- It's so beautiful! - What are you doing with that?

309
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:48,261
你能穿上吗 求你啦
Will you put it on? Please.

310
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:50,261
你从哪儿拿的 从哪儿拿的?!
Where did you get it? Where did you get it?!

311
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:53,261
芙罗拉一天到晚都缠着我
All day, every day, Flora keeps asking me

312
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:55,261
让我讲你年轻时候的事 我想她...
questions about when you were younger. I thought she...

313
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,897
你绝不能碰我的东西
You NEVER touch my belongings!

314
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,261
知道"绝不"是什么意思吗
 Do you know what "never" means?!

315
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:01,262
永远都不能
It means NOT EVER!

316
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,261
你爸爸不是有意的 宝贝
Your papa did not mean to be so harsh, darling girl.

317
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:15,262
他只是一时没缓过来 就是这样 是我的错
You shocked him, that's all. It's my fault.

318
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:24,261
也许那件上衣承载了他的记忆
Perhaps that tunic has memories for him.

319
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,262
战争的记忆
Memories of the war.

320
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:30,261
这是我的错 让我来弥补吧
I made a mistake. Let me make it up to you.

321
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,261
我们来弥补下 你和我 就在早上
We'll have a treat. You and I. In the morning.

322
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:35,261
我们做些什么 去骑马吗
What shall we do? Shall we go riding?

323
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:38,262
- 或者去野餐 - 去天堂百货
- Perhaps a picnic? - The... The Paradise.

324
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:42,261
没错 我们去天堂百货
Yes. We'll go to The Paradise

325
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,262
去好好放纵一下
and we will indulge ourselves.

326
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:53,262
晚安 苏西
Good night, Susy.

327
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:23,262
你在这儿干什么
WHAT are you doing here?

328
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:29,261
- 我来看你 孩子 - 我不希望你在这儿
- I've come to see you, child. - I don't want you here.

329
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:32,261
你不能给你妈一个道歉的机会吗?
Can you not give your ma a chance to say that she's sorry?

330
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:35,261
道歉 我应该相信吗?
"Sorry"? Am I supposed to believe that?

331
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:38,261
这么多年 你就想说句对不起吗?
All these years and that's all you want "sorry"?

332
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,261
我一直在找你
I've been looking for you.

333
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,261
我没那么难找 贝拉姑姑知道我在哪儿
I'm not so hard to find. Aunt Bella knows where I am.

334
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:44,261
我没有一天不在想我的女儿
There's not a day goes by where I don't think about my girl!

335
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,261
要我告诉你我怎么想的吗?
Shall I tell you what I think of?

336
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:51,261
我自己的声音祈求你不要离开我 不要让我走
My own voice pleading with you not to leave me, not to let me go.

337
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:55,261
我亲妈却喝得太醉听不到
And my own mother too drunk to hear me.

338
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:57,261
甚至不会亲我
Too drunk to even KISS me.

339
00:21:57,262 --> 00:22:00,262
我现在有了自己的生活 而你不在其中
I have a life now, and you are no part of it!

340
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:07,261
跟我进去 来吧 跟我进去坐坐
Come inside with me. Come on. Come and sit with me.

341
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:11,261
让你妈妈好好看看你 就一晚
Let your ma feast her eyes on her beautiful girl just for one night.

342
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,261
坐在一起看你喝酒
Sit with you while you drink,

343
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:17,262
听你讲故事骗我让我相信你不算坏吗
tell me some story that will trick me into believing you're not so bad?

344
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:24,261
我妈妈对我撒谎 一向如此 她满嘴谎话
My mother lied to me. That's what she does, she lies.

345
00:22:24,262 --> 00:22:26,261
你去喝吧 妈
You go and drink, Ma.

346
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,261
喝了多少瓶才会忘了自己曾有个女儿?!
How many glasses till you forget you even HAVE a daughter?!

347
00:22:29,262 --> 00:22:32,261
你去喝个够吧
You... you go and drink your fill.

348
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:33,690
如果你还有慈悲之心 
If you have any mercy,

349
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,261
今晚就沿着这条街一直走
 you will walk down that street tonight

350
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,262
永远不要回来
and NEVER come back!

351
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:35,262
有些事情我们自认为无法承受
There are things we believe we cannot bear.

352
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,262
但其实我们可以
But we can bear them.

353
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:41,262
我们可以承受
We do bear them.

354
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:04,261
早上好
Morning.

355
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:07,261
我们得让你女儿看到最好的你
We need your daughter to see you looking at your best,

356
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:10,261
让她知道你病好了 恢复了
if she's to know you're back on your feet and well again.

357
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,261
你人真好
That is kind of ya.

358
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,261
你可以去后面洗漱一下
You can wash and clean up in the back.

359
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,261
这是我最爱的颜色
It's me favourite colour.

360
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:19,262
我已经很多年没穿过新的漂亮的衣服了
It's many years since I wore a dress new and pretty.

361
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:26,261
拉比 我得回到我妻子身边了
Ruby, I need to be getting back to my wife.

362
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:29,261
我们刚结婚 在海边有一间小屋
I'm newly married. We have a cottage by the sea.

363
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:33,261
我不能呆在这儿了 所以我怎么安排你好呢?
I can't stay here. So what are we to do with you?

364
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,261
我没地方去
I've nowhere to go.

365
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:37,262
你女儿呢 跟她谈过了吗?
What about your daughter? If you talk to her?

366
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:45,261
我会穿上这衣服 让我看起来精神点
I'll put the dress on and I'll smart meself up.

367
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:48,262
她会看到我不再那么体弱多病了
And she will see that I'm not sickly no more.

368
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:53,262
你确定你没事吗?
Are you sure you're well enough?

369
00:24:55,262 --> 00:25:00,261
如果我能留下 直到和她说话
If I could stay until such time as I speak with her.

370
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,261
我想保持最好的状态
I would like to be at my best.

371
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:05,262
当然 你当然可以
Course. Course you can.

372
00:25:10,262 --> 00:25:12,261
乔纳斯
Jonas!

373
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,262
我想和你谈谈
I want to talk with you.

374
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:18,636
汤姆・威斯顿在考虑...
Tom Weston is considering...

375
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,261
他打算扩张商店 先生
 He intends to develop the store, sir.

376
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:26,261
如果我要求进一步与芬顿先生谈谈
If I were to request further discussions with Mr Fenton...

377
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:28,261
如果您愿意的话 我可以今天为你安排 先生
I could arrange that for you today, if you wish, sir.

378
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:30,261
或只是给他带个信
Or I could simply convey a message to him

379
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,261
说您愿意重新考虑他的要求
saying you're willing to reconsider his offer.

380
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:36,262
如果您真的愿意重新考虑
If you are indeed willing to reconsider his proposition?

381
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:39,261
我们如何
How would we, er...?

382
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,737
威斯顿先生是个反复无常的人
Mr Weston is a volatile man, sir.

383
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,261
他做事比较轻率
 He is capable of behaving rashly.

384
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:45,261
甚至粗暴
Wildly, even.

385
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:49,261
那你猜他会轻率地解雇我还是粗暴地摆脱我?
Suppose he rashly dismisses me, or wildly decides to get rid of me?

386
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:50,716
让我说的话 先生
If I may, sir, 

387
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,262
他的妻子不会让这一切发生的
his wife would not permit that to happen.

388
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,261
是 是 我明白
Yes. Yes, I understand.

389
00:25:57,262 --> 00:26:01,262
您需要我去联系芬顿先生吗
Do you wish me to contact Mr Fenton, sir?

390
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,262
是的
I do.

391
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:11,261
我要让大家看看...
I will show 'em all...

392
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:15,261
我要让莫里先生知道他错了 让达德利先生
I'll show Mr Moray he was wrong. I'll show Mr Dudley

393
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:18,261
知道我真正的模样
what I am truly made of.

394
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:21,261
我看起来美吧 本就这样
Well, don't I look pretty? Made for it.

395
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:24,262
管好你的嘴 不然大家都跟你一起丢人
Well, just watch your mouth or you'll put us all to shame.

396
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:31,261
德妮丝 随她去吧
Denise! Erm, leave her be.

397
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:34,262
她准备好了会来找你的
She'll come to you when she's ready to.

398
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,897
威斯顿夫人 芙罗拉小姐 
Mrs Weston! Miss Flora.

399
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,261
什么风把您二位吹来了
 What brings you to see us today?

400
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,261
我打算让芙罗拉今早好好玩玩
I am intent on spoiling Flora this morning.

401
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:43,261
那您来对地方了 夫人
Then you have come to the right place, ma'am.

402
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:45,261
你将享受我们最棒的服务
You shall receive only the finest service from our ladies,

403
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:47,261
我向您保证
I can assure you.

404
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:48,976
威斯顿夫人 
Mrs Weston.

405
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:53,261
呃 凯瑟琳 抱歉 我忘乎所以了
 Er, Katherine. Forgive me, I forgot myself.

406
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:55,262
您今天非常美丽动人
May I say how lovely you look today?

407
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:00,261
我的意思是 商店的大门永远向你敞开
What I mean is, it's always a delight to see you in the store.

408
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:01,261
还有你 芙罗拉小姐
And you, Miss Flora.

409
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,690
凯瑟琳 既然你来了 
Since you're here, Katherine,

410
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,261
可以和我一起喝杯咖啡吗?
perhaps you'll join me

411
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:08,261
还有你的丈夫 如果他也来了的话
for coffee. And your husband, if he is to visit us today?

412
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:12,261
你今天心情很好啊 莫里
You're in fine spirits today, Moray.

413
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:14,261
我承蒙你的关照
I owe you the courtesy of kindness.

414
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:16,261
虽然你没有必要非得答应
You do not owe me any such consideration,

415
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:19,262
但如果有这机会我会很感激
but I'd be grateful for the chance to earn your forbearance.

416
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:27,261
我很高兴和你一起喝咖啡
I'd be delighted to join you for coffee.

417
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:28,261
芙罗拉!
Flora!

418
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:30,262
加了肉桂的咖啡
Coffee. With cinnamon.

419
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:48,261
威斯顿夫人 女士 芙罗拉小姐
Mrs Weston. Ma'am. Miss Flora.

420
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:51,261
我希望你今天尽管宠着芙罗拉 德妮丝
I want you to utterly spoil Flora today, Denise.

421
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:53,341
她想要什么就给她什么 
Anything she wants, she can have.

422
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:55,261
这是我们的荣幸 夫人
It would be our pleasure, ma'am.

423
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:57,262
苏西 请招待这位年轻的女士
Susy, please attend to the young lady.

424
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,262
我和莫里喝咖啡的这段时间 她就交给你了
I will leave it with you while I have a coffee with Moray.

425
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:12,261
我想要一件这种有羽毛的衣服
I want one of these dresses with the feathers.

426
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:15,261
恐怕这些礼服是给大人穿的 小孩不能穿
I'm afraid these gowns are for adults, not children.

427
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,261
但我想要
But I want one.

428
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,732
让我给你看一些
Let me show you some of the things

429
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:23,261
更适合小女孩的东西
 we have that might be more suitable for a girl.

430
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:27,455
我设想了一下把扩展区建成珠宝部的事
I had myself thought of making the extension a jewellery department.

431
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:30,229
我想象客人们在街道上走时
I imagined that as customers approached along the street

432
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,261
他们最先看到的
the first thing they would see

433
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:36,261
是充满了贵气和色彩的橱窗
would be windows bursting with colours and extravagance.

434
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:39,261
但光是储存展品的费用就超出了我的预算
But the cost of stocking the display alone was beyond me.

435
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:43,261
不过 现在情况不同了
However, things are different now.

436
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,211
咖啡还可以吗 凯瑟琳?
How's your coffee, Katherine?

437
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:48,261
不错 很美味
It's fine. It's delicious.

438
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:51,261
我第一次发现肉桂咖啡是在 呃  
I first discovered cinnamon coffee whilst in, erm,

439
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,261
印度 对吧 凯瑟琳?
was it India, Katherine?

440
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:56,261
- 不 不 我想是摩洛哥 - 是在锡兰
- No, no, no, I think it was Morocco. - It was Ceylon.

441
00:28:56,262 --> 00:29:00,261
对 对 我费尽口舌才说服凯瑟琳尝尝
Yes, yes! I had the devil to convince Katherine to try it,

442
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:02,262
但她喝过一次之后 就再也喝不够了 
but once she did, she could never have enough.

443
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:08,262
你喝咖啡的时候还会放肉桂吗? 凯瑟琳
Do you still drink your coffee with cinnamon, Katherine?

444
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:15,262
- 有时候会 - 是的 她会
- Sometimes. - Yes, she does.

445
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:23,261
我已经找到了红宝石和绿宝石的供货商
I've already sourced suppliers for rubies and emeralds, if you'd

446
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,965
你希望我叫他们带着样品和报价来拜访我们吗
care for me to have them call on us with samples and prices,

447
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,262
威斯顿先生?
 Mr Weston?

448
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:36,261
我计划所有的柜台都用玻璃来制作
I'd planned for all the counters to be made of glass.

449
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:40,261
还有吊灯 玻璃灯 整个商场要像宫殿一样
And chandeliers, glass lamps, the whole place is like a palace.

450
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:45,261
闪亮的东西多了会显得太花哨
So much dazzle sounds positively garish.

451
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:48,262
是啊 或许你是对的 先生
Yes, well, perhaps you're right, sir.

452
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:55,261
我希望你旅行之后睡眠质量有所改善 凯瑟琳
I hope your sleep has improved after your travels, Katherine.

453
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:59,261
我曾告诉她是因为咖啡的作用 但她不听劝
I used to tell her it's the coffee, but she wouldn't have it.

454
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:03,261
如果女人可以不睡觉地活着...
If ever a woman could live without sleep...

455
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:08,261
我曾被迫在花园里度过漫长的一夜
I was pressed into spending long nights in the garden.

456
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:11,262
嗅着月光下木兰花香
The scent of magnolias under the moon...

457
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:22,261
我觉得扩展区应该做成餐厅
I think the new extension should be a food hall,

458
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:27,261
或卖鞋 或一些不带感情色彩的东西
or shoes or something without sentiment.

459
00:30:27,262 --> 00:30:30,261
我本来打算和你一起看看那里 莫里
I had meant to look over the place with you, Moray.

460
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,043
但你当时不在 我们现在去看吧
But you were elsewhere. Let's take a look now.

461
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:34,261
好 当然
Yes, of course,

462
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:37,261
只是我不想把你的妻子单独留在这喝咖啡
although I would not wish to leave your wife with her coffee.

463
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,262
我准备好走了
I am ready now.

464
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:50,261
- 我要那双银色的鞋 - 我解释过了
- I want the silver shoes. - As I have explained,

465
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:52,261
我们没有你的尺码 小姐
we don't have your size, miss.

466
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:55,261
这双 我要这条带羽毛的裙子
These ones. I want the dress with the feathers.

467
00:30:55,262 --> 00:30:57,261
你不能穿这条有羽毛的裙子
You can't have the dress with the feathers.

468
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,261
但那是我想要的
But that's what I want!

469
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:01,261
妈妈说我想要什么都可以
Mama said I could have anything I wanted.

470
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:04,261
你就是个被宠坏的无关紧要的人 这就是你
Oh, you're just a spoiled little NOTHING, that's what you are!

471
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,261
你招招手 全世界都要围着你转!
You wave your hand and the rest of the world is supposed to pamper you!

472
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:09,261
你想过没有?! 你是个小孩!
Do you even give a thought?! YOU ARE A CHILD!

473
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:12,261
苏西 下楼去饭厅 马上!
Susy, go down to the refectory right now!

474
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:14,261
快点 苏西! 下去
Come on, Susy! Go on.

475
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,221
我要妈妈
I want Mama.

476
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,261
我很抱歉 芙罗拉小姐 让我...
 I am so sorry, Miss Flora. Let me...

477
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:21,262
不! 我要妈妈! 我要妈妈!
No! I want Mama! I want Mama!

478
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:25,261
我很抱歉 夫人 不知道为什么...
I'm so sorry, ma'am. I don't know why...

479
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,261
苏西一向是那样亲切的女孩!
Susy is usually such a sweet girl!

480
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:32,261
我从来不知道她会... 她是我们的朋友
I've never before known her to... She's a friend,

481
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,261
她平时那么善良又十分殷勤
usually full of kindness and so eager to please.

482
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:38,547
达德利 请你把芙罗拉带出去一下好吗?
Dudley, do you think you could take Flora outside for a moment for me, please? 

483
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,262
当然 夫人
Of course, ma'am.

484
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,761
你准备怎么处理这事?
What do you propose to do?

485
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:56,261
我会和莫里先生和达德利先生讲...
I will speak to Mr Moray and Mr Dudley...

486
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:59,262
不 我想知道你准备怎么做
No. I want to know what YOU intend to do.

487
00:32:00,262 --> 00:32:04,497
你是女装部主管 不是吗?
You're Head of Ladieswear, are you not? 

488
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:06,262
你要负责
You ARE responsible.

489
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:10,261
是你让我的孩子受到如此羞辱
It was you who presided over this humiliation of my child.

490
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,262
这个孩子!
THIS child!

491
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:16,261
你准备怎么处理这个人?
What do you propose to do about this girl?

492
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:18,261
- 她叫什么名字? - 苏西 夫人
- What is her name? - Susy, ma'am.

493
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:21,262
那回答我 你的打算是什么?
Then answer me, what is your intention?

494
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:30,261
我会跟苏西严肃说明
I will speak with Susy MOST severely.

495
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:33,262
我会警告她对顾客这种态度...
I will warn her that to address customers in this way...

496
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:47,761
我们不能做些什么吗? 
Can we not do something? 

497
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,261
一定有什么原因使苏西...
There must be a reason Susy was...

498
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:53,261
是有原因 她提升得太早了 她还没准备好
There IS a reason. Susy was promoted too early. She's not ready.

499
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,011
但我们一定可以做点什么!
But there must be something we can do!

500
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:57,228
现在是紧要关头 德妮丝 
These are the most delicate of times, Denise.

501
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,261
我承受不起凯瑟琳的怒火
 I cannot afford to rile Katherine.

502
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:01,261
我们必须顺着她意愿
We must be seen to follow her will.

503
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:04,261
这是你的工作 德妮丝 你必须这么做
It's your job now, Denise. This has to be done.

504
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:09,262
你想要这职位 这职位可不是办办茶宴就行
You wanted this position. It's not all tea parties.

505
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,262
我试过了 苏西
I tried, Susy.

506
00:33:38,262 --> 00:33:39,261
我也不想这样
I wanted to avoid this.

507
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:44,261
但你的所作所为使我没有退路
But what you did, you've left me with no choice.

508
00:33:44,262 --> 00:33:49,261
员工被解雇的时候必须马上离开宿舍
When a girl is dismissed, she must leave the premises right away.

509
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:52,262
你必须收拾好行李... 然后走
You must collect your belongings... and go.

510
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,166
或许别走远了 苏西 
Perhaps stay close by, Susy. 

511
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,262
我们不知道会不会有变数
We never know what might change.

512
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,262
我无处可去了
I have nowhere to stay.

513
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:22,261
毕夏普街 迈希尔先生
Bishop Street. Mr Myhill.

514
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,012
告诉他  乔纳斯・弗兰克斯说
Tell him jonas Franks said 

515
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,262
你跟着他或许有个住处
you might find lodgings with him.

516
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:51,261
蛋糕 夫人?
Cakes, madam?

517
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:53,261
我像个女人吗?!
Do I look like a madam to you?!

518
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:56,261
还有 我看这个更像脆骨而不是蛋糕
And THAT looks more like gristle to me than a cake.

519
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:59,262
我在练习 您要茗茶吗? 还是阿萨姆茶?
I'm practising. Fine teas? Assam?

520
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:04,261
大吉岭茶呢? 马德拉蛋糕呢?
Darjeeling? Madeira cake?

521
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:07,262
我表现得还不赖吧?!
Aren't I the picture of restraint?!

522
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,261
德妮丝!
Denise!

523
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:35,262
德妮丝! 他们都明白苏西是自己引火上身
Denise! They all know that Susy brought this on herself.

524
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,261
他们只是在演戏
Their reactions are for show.

525
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:43,261
相互证明他们是亲信 他们在反抗我们
To prove to each other they are cronies. Them against us.

526
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:46,261
这不是长久的 这是恐惧 仅此而已
It won't last. It's fear, that's all.

527
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:49,261
你现在对他们的生活有影响了
You have influence on their lives now.

528
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:52,261
你要表现得不是你的错 
Act as though you're not to blame. Don't apologise

529
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:55,261
别为你的所作所为道歉 让他们说去吧 
for what you've done. Let them raise the matter if they want. Not you.

530
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:58,261
表现得你有你的威严
Behave as though you take on your authority

531
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:01,261
但他们要对自己的命运负责
but they are responsible for their own destiny.

532
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,261
谢谢你 达德利先生
Thank you, Mr Dudley.

533
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:06,261
你知道这事不怪你 不是吗 德妮丝?
You do know you're not to blame, don't you, Denise?

534
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:07,261
但我本可以做更多的
But I might have done more.

535
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,261
我看到苏西有什么烦心事
I saw there was something the matter with Susy.

536
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:12,262
我希望我可以说一切都会好起来的
I wish I could say that it gets easier.

537
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:23,261
克莱拉 有人看见你和威斯顿先生在海湾
Clara. You were seen in the bays with Mr Weston.

538
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:25,261
你就是这样看我的吗?
Oh! Is that what you think of me?

539
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,744
只要是穿着西装的男人我就会对他抛媚眼
Any man in a suit and I'll flutter me eyes

540
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:29,262
然后掀起自己的裙摆吗?
 and lift me skirts?

541
00:36:30,262 --> 00:36:32,261
他想从你身上得到什么?
What did he want with you?

542
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:33,352
他让我把他的名字
He asked to put his name 

543
00:36:33,353 --> 00:36:35,261
写在最后那首华尔兹的舞伴卡上
on me dance card for the last waltz,

544
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:38,261
但我告诉他我已经有约了
but I told him I was all spoken for.

545
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,261
那我不得不叫莫里先生来问你
Then I have no option but to ask

546
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:43,262
为什么你会握着威斯顿先生的手
Mr Moray to ask you why you were holding Mr Weston's hand.

547
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:53,262
他那时背痛
He had a pain in his back.

548
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:00,262
非常痛
Terrible pain.

549
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,262
而他的眼里却不止是痛苦
Something in his eyes. Something more than pain.

550
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:10,261
- 他看起来就像... - 像什么?
- He looked like a man who'd... - Yes?

551
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:14,261
像被人谋杀然后在等待死亡
Well, like a man who'd been murdered and was waiting to die,

552
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:16,262
就像...
it was the same as...

553
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:22,261
继续说下去克莱拉 你快说完了
Go on, Clara. You're almost done now.

554
00:37:22,262 --> 00:37:25,261
就像看烟火的那晚一样
It was the same as the night of the fireworks.

555
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:26,262
它的噪音
The noise of it.

556
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:31,262
让他像吓坏的小孩蜷缩着
He was cowering like a frightened child.

557
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:38,261
乔纳斯先生 感觉不错吧?
Will that do you, Mr Jonas?

558
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:42,261
又窥探到世上另一个阴暗的角落
Feel better now you've peered into another dark corner of this world?

559
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,262
谢谢你 克莱拉
Thank you, Clara.

560
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:35,261
当你对我隐瞒事情时
When you hide things from me, it is

561
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:39,261
就是你想逃避这些事
because you prefer not to face them yourself.

562
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:40,701
和乔纳斯躲躲闪闪的
Skulking around with Jonas.

563
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:43,261
跟凯瑟琳调情 嘲弄汤姆・威斯顿
 Flirting with Katherine. Taunting Tom Weston.

564
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,262
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

565
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:48,261
无论你在做些什么
Whatever it is you are doing,

566
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:49,534
我都知道你有多么想要回百货 
I know how much you want this store back, 

567
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,261
但如果你的计划
but if your schemes

568
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:55,261
对得起良心的话 你会告诉我的
can be admitted in good conscience, then you will tell me.

569
00:38:55,262 --> 00:39:00,261
莫里先生 你有消息要带去贝尔维尔大厅么?
Mr Moray, sir, you wanted a message taking out to Bellville Hall?

570
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:03,262
今天不了 亚瑟 下次吧
Not today, Arthur. Perhaps some other time.

571
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:15,716
德妮丝女士 
Miss Denise... 

572
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:18,261
乔纳斯 拜托请叫我德妮丝
Please, Jonas, call me Denise.

573
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:20,261
我更想尊重
I prefer to honour the tradition that has been

574
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:22,261
流传了那么多年的传统
observed down the years.

575
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:25,262
这是你赢得的 小姐 这个头衔代表着尊重
You've earned your place, ma'am, the title is a gesture of respect.

576
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:29,261
好吧 谢谢你
Yes. Well, thank you.

577
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:30,595
恕我直言...
If I may... 

578
00:39:30,596 --> 00:39:33,261
对于我们这种地方 忠诚很重要
there is much talk of loyalty in a place like this.

579
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:35,261
没有比它更重要的
Most of it is talk and no more.

580
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:37,261
我真的不希望苏西...
I had no wish for Susy to...

581
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:42,261
小姐 请让我说下去 忠诚像是特别的礼物
Please, ma'am, let me go on. Loyalty is a special gift.

582
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:46,261
是唯一能做到凝聚人心的 但需要你鼓起勇气
It binds people like no other cause. But it CAN take courage.

583
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:49,511
如果你找得到办法让苏西复职
If you can find a way to win Susy her place back here in the store, 

584
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,261
你就证明了
you would have proven that you're

585
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:53,261
你是这里所有员工的忠诚伙伴
the staunchest ally of everyone who works here.

586
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:55,696
你会变成他们权益的捍卫者
You would be their champion.

587
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,261
但这不可能啊
It is not possible.

588
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,880
不是你亲口和莫里先生说
Was it not you yourself told Mr Moray

589
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:02,261
"这必须可能"的吗?
 it must be possible?

590
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:03,261
但我不知道该怎么做
But I don't know how.

591
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,261
我也不知道 小姐
 Nor do I, ma'am.

592
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,262
但我相信你会想到方法的
But I trust you'll find a way.

593
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:20,262
杜松子酒
Gin.

594
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:36,261
没想到会在这里见到你
I didn't expect to see you here.

595
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,262
真希望我也能这么说 妈
I wish I could say the same of you, Ma.

596
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:45,262
我留下来是想和你再谈一下
I stayed so that I might speak with you one more time.

597
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:57,261
苏西我不怪你恨我
I don't blame you for hating me, Susy.

598
00:40:57,262 --> 00:41:01,261
把自己的孩子送走一定是世上最严重的罪
It has to be the worst crime in the world to give your child away.

599
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,976
我知道你不会相信我
I know you don't believe me, 

600
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,262
但我是为了你才这么做的
but I did it for you.

601
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,840
你怨我的理由 
The reasons you use to blame me

602
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:16,261
就是我不得不送走你的原因
 are the reasons that i had to give you away.

603
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:18,262
跟着我这样的妈妈你会过怎样的生活?
What kind of life would you have with a ma like me?

604
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:25,261
每天我都告诉自己不能再喝醉
Every day I promise myself I won't be drunk,

605
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:30,261
但是每天都会发现自己手中又拿着酒杯
and then every day I find meself with a glass in me hand.

606
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:33,261
我不得不放手让你离开我
I had to free you from me and the only way that

607
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,262
又继续再喝酒
I could do that was to have another drink inside me.

608
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:40,261
我是对你撒了谎
I have lied to you, yes.

609
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:44,261
但你老实回答我 你如果留在我身边
But you tell me, if you can tell the truth, would it've been

610
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:48,262
会比现在过的好么?
a better life if you'd stayed with me than the one that you've had?

611
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:57,262
不 不会
No. No, it wouldn't.

612
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:05,261
我人生里唯一能给你的
There's only one thing in this life that I could give you

613
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:08,262
就是放手让你离开我
and that was to be free of me.

614
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,261
虽然我知道 或许有那么一天
I knew, though, that there'd come the day

615
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:17,262
我可以看着你
when I'd look at ya...

616
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:22,262
告诉你我爱你
..and I'd tell ya I love you.

617
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:41,262
我... 我爱你 妈妈
I... I love you, Ma.

618
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:02,261
我为你能在那种地方工作而骄傲
I'm so proud of you working in that place.

619
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:03,262
那儿多豪华
It's so grand.

620
00:43:07,262 --> 00:43:11,261
我不在那里工作了
I don't work there no more.

621
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:16,262
- 为什么? - 我被解雇了 自找的
- Why? - I was sacked. Made a disgrace of myself.

622
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,261
不会的 我的苏西不会的
No, not you. Not my Susy.

623
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:24,261
我冒犯了一个小孩
I offended a child.

624
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:28,011
天啊 他们就没点宽容的心吗?!
Oh, have they no mercy?! 

625
00:43:28,012 --> 00:43:30,261
他们该有多卑鄙啊?!
What kind of swines are they?!

626
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:32,262
不是的... 都过去了 妈妈
No, it... it's done now, Ma.

627
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,261
我再去拿杯酒
I'm just going to get one more.

628
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,262
女儿认回我可不是天天都有的事
It's not every day you get your daughter back.

629
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:58,262
干杯
Cheers.

630
00:44:04,262 --> 00:44:06,261
让他们下地狱去
Well, to hell with them.

631
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:07,822
他们都不值得我用口水吐他们
They're not worth a spit 

632
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:09,262
竟能对我女儿做这样的事
if they'd do that to my girl.

633
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:20,262
我现在在干嘛?
What am I doing?

634
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:25,261
我为了什么要和你坐在一起?
What am I doing here sitting here with you?

635
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:30,262
没有变 你什么都没变 还是酒 够了!
It's the same, it's always the same, the drink, that's all!

636
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:34,262
苏西! 苏西!
Susy! Susy!

637
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:41,261
夫人 午安 您是想喝阿萨姆茶呢?
Good afternoon, madam. Assam?

638
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,262
还是大吉岭茶?
Darjeeling?

639
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:47,261
苏西你到这干嘛?
Susy, what are you doing here?

640
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:49,261
哦 我忘了!
Oh! I forgot!

641
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:52,261
我... 我急着回家却忘了我不住在这了
I... I was hurrying home and I forgot I don't live here no more.

642
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:54,261
噢 你最好在乔纳斯先生看到你前离开
Oh, you best go, girl, before Mr Jonas finds ya.

643
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:58,262
苏西不要走 我有话想跟你说
Susy! Don't go! I want to speak to you.

644
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:04,262
你想复职么?
Do you want your position back?

645
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:09,261
我是说 你想试着争取复职么?
What I mean is, do you want to try and get it back?

646
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:10,961
当然
I should say so.

647
00:45:10,962 --> 00:45:14,261
我不敢保证一定会成功 这需要我们鼓起勇气
I can't promise we'll manage it, it'll take courage.

648
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:16,962
你可以按我说的做么?
Will you do exactly as I say?

649
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,261
明早的第一件事就是
Then first thing tomorrow morning,

650
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:22,262
穿上你最好的衣服在街上等我
put on your finest outfit and meet me in the street.

651
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,262
威斯顿夫人
Mrs Weston.

652
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,262
夫人 谢谢你肯见我们
Thank you for seeing us, ma'am.

653
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:12,261
这么唐突地打扰你我很抱歉
I'm sorry to intrude upon you in this way,

654
00:46:12,262 --> 00:46:14,262
但 夫人 我希望能和您谈谈
but if we might speak with you for a few minutes...

655
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:20,261
在和芙罗拉小姐发生不愉快的那天
Ma'am, on the day of these embarrassing events with

656
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:24,261
苏西当时很痛苦
Miss Flora, Susy was in a state of considerable distress.

657
00:46:24,262 --> 00:46:26,261
我不该让她值班的
It was my fault she was on duty.

658
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:27,710
我该让她休息的
I should have excused her.

659
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:32,261
那天苏西的妈妈突然出现在街上 她从...
 Susy's mother turned up on the street. She hasn't seen her since she was...

660
00:46:32,262 --> 00:46:34,262
从我七岁起就没再见过我妈妈
Since I was seven years old.

661
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:38,261
她妈妈意外地出现...
It was an unexpected arrival...

662
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,261
苏西还发现她的妈妈处境很糟糕
Susy found her mother in awful circumstances.

663
00:46:41,262 --> 00:46:44,261
所以 夫人 我们恳求
We're asking, ma'am,

664
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:48,261
苏西能有次机会向芙罗拉小姐道歉
that Susy be given the opportunity to apologise to Miss Flora and the

665
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:52,261
和证明她值得您的再次信任
chance to prove to you that she's worthy of your trust in the future.

666
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:53,262
- 您的宽恕... - 宽恕?!
- Your mercy... - Mercy?!

667
00:46:57,262 --> 00:46:59,262
你真觉得我该原谅她?
You think I should forgive her?

668
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:11,261
芙罗拉小姐 我真心为我所说的话道歉
I am truly sorry for what I said to you, Miss Flora.

669
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:14,262
每个孩子都不应得到这样的对待
No child should be spoken to so cruelly.

670
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,166
我只想向你道歉 
I only want to say I am sorry.

671
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:21,262
这就是我来的原因 没别的
 That is why I am here. No more.

672
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:32,262
请你原谅她吧 妈妈
Please forgive her, Mama.

673
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:51,261
你跑去跟凯瑟琳・格伦德宁说之前
You might have asked before you ran off to speak with

674
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,261
应该先来问我 德妮丝
Katherine Glendenning, Denise.

675
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:55,261
是你自己说的我们要跟她搞好关系
You said yourself we must keep good relations with her.

676
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:57,260
即便她拒绝了我们的请求
Even if she'd said no to our pleas,

677
00:47:57,262 --> 00:48:01,000
我们也得向她表示悔悟和尊敬
we would have shown her contrition and respect.

678
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:03,261
是啊 是啊 当然
Yes. Yes, of course.

679
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:05,261
威斯顿
Weston.

680
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:07,261
她现在是威斯顿夫人了
Her name is Mrs Weston now.

681
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,262
我不是那么说的吗?
Isn't that what I said?

682
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:17,261
姑娘们
Girls.

683
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,262
谢谢 德妮丝
Thank you, Denise.

684
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:31,261
- 他娘的给她们看看 梅尔托 - 我会的
- Bloody show 'em, Myrtle. - I will.

685
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:33,261
- 他娘的给她们都看看 - 会的
- Bloody show 'em all. - I will.

686
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:35,171
你看起来很漂亮 梅尔托 
You look so lovely, Myrtle.

687
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:36,262
对 可不是嘛
I do, don't I?

688
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:41,262
她们坐好了
They're ready.

689
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,261
- 我不行! 我做不了! - 你当然可以
- I can't! I can't do it! - Of course you can.

690
00:48:56,262 --> 00:48:58,261
只是给一些爱闲言碎语的时髦女人上茶而已
It's only serving tea to a few posh gossips.

691
00:48:58,262 --> 00:49:03,261
我这样的人怎么能站在她们面前呢
How can the likes of me stand before the likes of them?

692
00:49:03,262 --> 00:49:05,261
她们这么漂亮
They're so beautiful.

693
00:49:05,262 --> 00:49:07,261
你也很漂亮 梅尔托
You're the one who's beautiful, Myrtle.

694
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:10,261
不 我不漂亮 站她们旁边我像块破布
No, I'm not. I'm a rag next to them.

695
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:14,262
我只适合在农场工作 这个我做不了
I'm fit for the farmyard. I can't do it.

696
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,262
对不起 德妮丝
I'm sorry, Denise.

697
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:29,262
梅尔托
Myrtle.

698
00:49:41,262 --> 00:49:45,261
我还记得男士们排队理发的场景
I remember the queues of men standing waiting for a haircut.

699
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:47,262
- 乔纳斯 - 威斯顿先生
- Jonas. - Mr Weston, sir.

700
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:54,261
- 你不舒服? - 旧伤发作了
- You have pain? - It's an old wound.

701
00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:58,262
我告诉自己忽略疼痛 但还是感受的到
I tell myself I should feel no pain. But there is.

702
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:03,261
我是个傻子
I am a fool.

703
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:04,262
每当感受到疼痛
Whenever I feel it,

704
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,262
我就斥责自己说这是我的弱点
 I chide myself it is weakness.

705
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:10,261
人们害怕我 因...
People fear me, bec...

706
00:50:10,262 --> 00:50:13,261
请原谅 先生 我多嘴了
Forgive me, sir, I am speaking out of turn.

707
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:16,261
没有 继续说
Not at all, go on.

708
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:20,262
我有残疾 人们因此害怕我
I have a disfigurement, people fear me because of it.

709
00:50:22,262 --> 00:50:23,928
但这是个礼物 
But it is a gift. 

710
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:27,261
我到了这个年纪才意识到这一点
I have realised that at my age.

711
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:29,928
那些畏惧一个独臂者的人
People who flinch from a man with one arm 

712
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,489
因他们所见而断想他们了解我
imagine they know me, know the worst of me 

713
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,262
了解我最坏的一面
because of what they see.

714
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:37,262
这只会让我知道什么人可以信任
That just tells me whom I can trust.

715
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:45,261
这是件好事 去找回那些
It is a fine thing, sir, to restore that which has been

716
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:46,262
完全被忽视了东西
so sorely disregarded.

717
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:52,262
我向你脱帽致敬 尽管我没有戴帽子
I take my hat off to you. Even though I'm not wearing one.

718
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:55,530
你觉得我该如何处理它呢 乔纳斯
What do you think I should do with it, Jonas?

719
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:58,214
我觉得我无法胜任
Oh, I do not think I can be trusted

720
00:50:58,276 --> 00:51:00,316
替您做这么大的决定 先生
with the likes of such a decision, sir.

721
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:04,724
我相信你
I trust you.

722
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:12,123
也许可以卖食品 先生 各式面包和馅饼
Perhaps food, sir. Breads and pies and buns.

723
00:51:12,124 --> 00:51:13,764
它们的香味会弥漫在街上
The smell of it on the street.

724
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:49,404
我想我可以... 给你讲故事
I thought I might... read to you.

725
00:51:53,164 --> 00:51:57,444
- 你想要听我讲故事吗 - 好的 爸爸
- Would you like me to read to you? - Yes, Papa.

726
00:52:08,604 --> 00:52:12,244
从前有一个士兵
There was a soldier.

727
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:17,084
一个年轻的军官
A young officer.

728
00:52:19,164 --> 00:52:24,044
他驻扎在印度
He was stationed in India.

729
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:29,124
德里发起了一场攻城战
And there was a siege. At Delhi.

730
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,404
你知道什么是攻城战吗
Do you know what a siege is?

731
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:40,884
攻城战就是...
Well, a siege is, erm...

732
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:45,564
就是一种...
It's a kind of...

733
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:50,644
...攻击
...attack.

734
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:05,884
死了很多人
Lots of men died.

735
00:53:12,164 --> 00:53:15,804
死了很多人
Lots of men died.

736
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:26,804
听我说 苏西 对于一个母亲来说
Let me tell you how it is, Susy. For a mother.

737
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:31,484
要做很多艰难的抉择
There are hard choices to be made.

738
00:53:33,324 --> 00:53:36,164
你不原谅她 她就无法原谅自己
She can't forgive herself until you forgive her.

739
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:40,403
她的所作所为不可原谅
What she did was unforgivable.

740
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:42,443
任何事都能被原谅
Nothing is unforgivable.

741
00:53:42,444 --> 00:53:44,245
而如果你抓着她不放的话 
But you'll be bitter 

742
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:48,126
你余后的人生会更痛苦 充满怨恨  
and filled with hatred the rest of your life if you don't let go of her.

743
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:49,964
是她抓着我不放
It's HER that won't let go of me.

744
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:57,083
- 我该对她说什么 - 说实话
- What would I say to her? - The truth.

745
00:53:57,084 --> 00:53:58,764
带着你对她的一点爱
With a bit of love in it.

746
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:29,563
他们让你回来了
They took you back, then.

747
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:33,044
- 他们让我回来了 - 这就对了
- They took me back. - It's only right.

748
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:39,323
如果你说的都是真的 妈妈
If it's true what you said, Ma,

749
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:42,763
你想给我一个机会
that you want to give me

750
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:46,444
从此摆脱你 那就现在吧
a chance to be free of you, then do it now.

751
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,484
让我摆脱你 我会因此而爱你
Do it and I will love you for it.

752
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:03,204
我只想让你亲一下我的脸颊
I only want one kiss on the cheek.

753
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:27,563
如果哪天你清醒了
If there is a time when you are sober,

754
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:30,083
我会在这里
I will be here.

755
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:32,124
那时候你就能回来了
There's the time you can come back.

756
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:03,163
茶宴非常成功
The tea party was a splendid success.

757
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:04,564
谢谢
Thank you.

758
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:10,323
每当我想告诉你我的想法
When I came to you with my idea,

759
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:15,043
总觉得无论我想说什么 你都会反对
it felt as though whatever I brought to you, you wanted to turn it down.

760
00:56:15,044 --> 00:56:17,643
你说得轻巧
It was simply the way you presented it.

761
00:56:17,644 --> 00:56:20,683
一旦我看到效益 我会同意的 不是吗
Once I saw the benefits, I consented, didn't I?

762
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:22,524
你同意了吗 你没有...
You consented?! You didn't...

763
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:28,763
我要求的只不过是... 
All that I ask is...

764
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:33,683
我知道我们在一起工作会非常艰难...
 I see how difficult this is going to be for us, working together...

765
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,438
但我来找你的时候 
But when I come to you, 

766
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:38,363
我不是德妮丝 我不是你的未婚妻
I'm not Denise, I'm not your fiancee.

767
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:39,924
我是女装部的主管
I am Head of Ladieswear.

768
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,629
你知道那该是什么样吗
Can you see that's how it has to be? 

769
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,084
是的 是的 当然知道
Yes. Yes. Of course.

770
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:52,963
对不起 德妮丝 我为我之前的行为道歉
I'm sorry, Denise, for the way I have been.

771
00:56:52,964 --> 00:56:57,483
为苏西的事和拜访凯瑟琳的事
For the way I spoke to you about Susy and about visiting Katherine.

772
00:56:57,484 --> 00:57:00,444
就该这样 这是你的职责
That's how it has to be. That's your job.

773
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:04,923
我本该告诉你我要去见她
I should have told you I was going to see her,

774
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:07,403
但是我怕你会制止我
but I was afraid you would refuse me.

775
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,844
我什么时候才能懂 没有秘密
When will I learn? No secrets!

776
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:18,763
我们不能让任何事横亘在我们之前
We cannot let anything come between us, Denise.

777
00:57:18,764 --> 00:57:20,804
为什么那些事会横亘在我们之间
Why would anything come between us?

778
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:32,483
我想让你沉浸在我的爱里
I want to shower you with love,

779
00:57:32,484 --> 00:57:36,083
珍爱你
and treasure you.

780
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:37,684
这才我的职责
That is my job.

781
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:10,496
我爸爸的手表
My father's watch?

782
00:58:10,497 --> 00:58:12,576
对我来说它是无价之宝
It is precious to me beyond reckoning.

783
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:15,736
那个手表有魔力 催眠的魔力
That watch has powers. Hypnotic powers.

784
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:17,457
我可以爱上一个像你那样的男生
I could fall for a lad like you.

785
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,541
苏西一直跟着我缠着我
I've got Susy following me around like a sop,

786
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,625
无论我怎么做 都摆脱不了她
