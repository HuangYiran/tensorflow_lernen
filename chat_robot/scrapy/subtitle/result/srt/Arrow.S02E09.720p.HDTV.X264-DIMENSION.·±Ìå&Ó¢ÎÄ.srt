10
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,920
我的名字叫奧利弗·奎恩
My name is Oliver Queen.

11
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,700
五年里  我被困在地獄一般的小島上
After five years on a hellish island,

12
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,950
我回來只有一個目標
I have come home with only one goal--

13
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,200
拯救我的城市
to save my city.

14
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,240
但要達到目標  我不能像過去一樣成為兇手
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

15
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,560
為了紀念我的朋友  我只能偽裝成另一個人
To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else.

16
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,880
{\an8}深切懷念托馬斯·梅林
孝子

17
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,590
成為另一個存在
I must be something else.

18
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,550
《綠箭》前情回顧
Previously on "Arrow"...

19
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,810
我是巴里·阿倫  來自中心城市警局
I'm Barry Allen, from the Central City Police Department.

20
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,790
是犯罪現場調查組的工作人員
I'm with the Crime Scene Investigation Unit.

21
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,520
我有朋友能夠幫我
I have friends that can help.

22
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,440
-這奇跡可能會殺死你  -動手吧
- This miracle could kill you. - Do it.

23
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,080
一種用來制造人體武器的血清
It was a serum designed to create human weapons.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,540
你覺得有人找到了配方
You think someone found the recipe?

25
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,440
離心機和血庫被盜
A centrifuge and a large supply of blood.

26
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,760
我覺得有人想要生產更多的血清
I think someone wants to make more of it.

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,640
-奧利弗  -他還活著嗎
- Oliver! - Is he alive?

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,330
-費利西蒂  我們救不了他  -對  我們救不了
- Felicity, we can't save him! - I know. We can't.

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,600
求你救救我朋友
Please save my friend.

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,740
按住他
Hold him!

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,190
他沒法活下來了
He's not going to make it.

32
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,490
他會活下來的  只要找到他體內有什么
He will. We just have to find out what's in his system.

33
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,790
一般我只處理死人
I--I--I usually only work on dead people.

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,990
-巴里  -好  他的身體做出這樣的反應
- Barry! - All right, I can think of four possible diagnosis

35
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,570
我能想到四種可能的診斷
for what's causing his body to react this way.

36
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,680
現在只有三種可能的診斷了
Make that three possible diagnosis.

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,120
兩種
Two.

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,200
開始胸部按壓
Start chest compressions.

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
我要抽血檢查
I need to get to his arm.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,350
好了
Got it.

41
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,990
-他的靜脈正在內凝結  -什么
- He's suffering from intravenous coagulation. - What?

42
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,550
血液里有異常腫塊  就像楓糖漿一樣
His blood is unnaturally clotting. It's like maple syrup.

43
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,020
你能救他  對吧
You can save him, right?

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,270
對
Right.

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,730
{\an8}殺鼠靈

46
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,810
幸虧你們這里老鼠成災
Lucky you guys have a rat problem.

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,630
你開玩笑嘛  那東西有毒
Are you kidding? That'll kill him!

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,360
如果我不這樣做  他就會死
He dies if I don't.

49
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,770
-費利西蒂  -動手吧
- Felicity... - Do it!

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,460
一定量的老鼠藥會稀釋他的血液
Just the right amount of this stuff will thin his blood enough

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,200
讓其重新循環
to get it circulating again.

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,660
放棄吧  奧利弗
Let go, Oliver.

53
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,860
他在衰弱
He's crashing.

54
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,010
別再掙扎了
Don't fight anymore.

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,550
奧利弗  保持清醒
Oliver, stay with me!

56
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,290
跟我走吧
Stay with me.

57
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,470
綠箭
第二季第九集

58
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,290
-奧利弗  放開他  -奧利弗
- Oliver, let him go. - Oliver!

59
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,010
出什么事了
What the hell is going on?

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,310
你被注射了一種強效凝血劑
You were injected with a strong-acting blood coagulant.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,590
你本來快死了
You would have stroked out,

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,960
但幸運的是  你們這里有十分有效的血液稀釋劑
but fortunately you had a very effective blood thinner handy.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,280
華法令阻凝劑
Warfarin.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,340
又叫殺鼠靈
Better known as rat poison.

65
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,180
他救了你的命  奧利弗
Kid saved your life, Oliver.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,390
按照救生事件的情節發展
This is the point in a lifesaving emergency

67
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
你現在應該感謝救命恩人
where you thank the person that did the lifesaving.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,750
-你把我的身份告訴了他  -對
- You told him who I am. - Yeah, I did.

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,390
這秘密輪不到你來泄露  費利西蒂
That's not your secret to tell, Felicity.

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,330
由我來決定誰能知曉我的身份
I decide who finds out my identity.

71
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,640
我們沒時間等你投票
Well, we didn't have time to get your vote,

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,530
你當時昏迷不醒  即將死去
what with you unconscious and dying.

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,300
如果他離開這里  然后直接去找警察怎么辦
What happens if he leaves here and goes right to the police?

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,210
-他不會那樣做的  -我不會那樣做的
- He wouldn't do that. - I wouldn't do that.

75
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,550
-我信任他  -我不信
- I trust him. - I don't!

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,940
你打算怎么辦  朝他射箭嗎
What are you going to do, put an arrow in him?

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,950
-我在考慮  -別擔心  他開玩笑的
- I am considering it. - Don't worry, he's kidding!

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,860
你媽媽開槍打了你  你不是也來找我幫忙了嗎
How is this any different from when your mother shot you and you came to me for help?

79
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,220
你媽媽居然開槍打你
Your mother shot you?

80
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,600
狄格中了箭毒  你不是也把他帶來了這里嗎
Or when you brought Dig down here when he was poisoned with curare.

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,350
區別在于我調查過你們兩個
The difference is that I did my homework on both of you!

82
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,970
我從來不會隨便告訴別人
I don't just tell people easily.

83
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,200
我不會告訴別人的
I'm not going to tell anyone.

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,170
你沒必要感謝我
And you don't have to thank me,

85
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,650
但你該感謝她  別這么混蛋好嗎
but you should thank her instead of being kind of a jerk.

86
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,550
奎恩先生
Mr. Queen.

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,490
{\an8}來自媽媽
你能回家嗎

88
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,600
我得回家了
I have to go home.

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,570
我在避難室里與之搏斗的男人
That man that I fought in the bunker,

90
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,170
他有能力批量生產島上的血清
he has what he needs to mass produce the serum from the island.

91
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,510
我們得阻止他
And we have to stop him.

92
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,450
他抓住你脖子時  碰了你的皮膚
He touched your skin when he grabbed your neck.

93
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,960
我吸取了他皮膚中的殘油
I was able to absorb the residual oils from his skin,

94
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,750
將其放入凝膠聚合物中
which, when added to a gel-based polymer,

95
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,540
也許能夠重建他的指紋
might be able to recreate his fingerprint.

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,380
與偶像見面后總是會幻滅  對吧
Never meet your heroes, right?

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,270
媽媽
Mom?

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,410
謝謝你回家來  親愛的
Thank you for coming home, sweetheart.

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,980
發生什么事了嗎
Is everything all right?

100
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,560
我不知道  你妹妹把自己鎖在房里
Well, I don't know. Your sister has locked herself in her room

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,230
不肯和我說話
and she won't talk to me.

102
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,420
-別擔心  我和她談談  -好
- Don't worry, I'll talk to her. - Ok.

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,530
今天是圣誕節啊
It's Christmas.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,670
是的
Yes.

105
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,540
但考慮到我們最近舉辦的盛會
But given the last gala that we threw,

106
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,280
今年還是不要舉辦圣誕派對了
I think we're going to skip this year's Christmas party.

107
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,740
西婭  我是奧利  開門
Thea, it's Ollie. Open the door.

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,570
現在不行  奧利
Not--not now, Ollie.

109
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,080
閃電妞  快開門
Speedy, open the door!

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,650
媽媽和你一起來了嗎
Is mom with you?

111
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,110
沒有
No!

112
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,680
發生什么事了
What's going on?

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,190
-我不想讓媽媽看到  -看到什么
- I didn't want mom to see. - See what?

114
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,010
他怎么了
What happened to him?

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,450
他做了治安維持者的靶子
Vigilante decided to use him as target practice.

116
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,870
你是對的
You're right--

117
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,470
那人是個瘋子
the guy's a psycho.

118
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,180
你為什么不去醫院
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

119
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,840
在這座城市
In this city,

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,390
中箭會像中槍一樣引來警方的注意
an arrow's the same as a bullet if you want the cops involved.

121
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,850
雖然媽媽挺喜歡羅伊的
And mom actually likes Roy,

122
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,210
但要是她發現他和兜帽男糾纏不清
but something tells me she'd revoke his tree trimming invitation

123
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,190
她一定不會讓他裝飾圣誕樹了
if she found out he was messing around with the hood.

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,550
羅伊
Roy.

125
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,280
會很疼的
This is going to hurt.

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,210
我的憤怒能沖淡疼痛
My anger's dulling the pain.

127
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,820
這個能沖得更淡
This will dull it better.

128
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,580
然后用力按住  就這樣
Going to put pressure on it. Right there.

129
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,050
狄格爾  我需要你來一趟奎恩宅邸
Diggle, I need you to come to the Queen mansion.

130
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,250
羅伊被射中了
Roy's been shot.

131
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,440
中的是箭
With an arrow.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
說來話長
It's a long story.

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,620
先把急救箱拿來西婭的房間
Look, just bring the first aid kit to Thea's room.

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,850
謝謝
Thank you.

135
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,970
羅伊  我的司機狄格爾先生
Roy, my driver, Mr. Diggle,

136
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,500
在部隊的時候受過醫療訓練
he has medical training from his time in the army.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,650
-他會幫你包扎  -謝謝
- He's going to patch you up. - Thank you.

138
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,960
不過是盡我所能
It's the least I can do.

139
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,780
我不知道你們三個想干什么
Look, I don't know what the three of you are up to,

140
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,840
但也許治安維持者只是想保證你們的安全
but maybe the vigilante was just trying to keep you safe.

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
所以他才射了羅伊嗎
By shooting Roy?

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,100
我只是猜測
I... i'm just saying.

143
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,120
也許你們應該放手
Maybe you should let this go.

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,280
所以  你會放手嗎
So... are you going to let this go?

145
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,330
不
No.

146
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,450
但現在起一切聽我的
But now we're going to do things my way.

147
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,460
媽媽
Mom!

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,050
有人嗎
Hello!

149
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,170
你好  我的愛人
Hello, my love.

150
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,800
莎朵
Shado?

151
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,240
你不可能是真的
You can't be here.

152
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,390
我必須來見你
I had to see you.

153
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,000
-我得警告你  -警告我
- Had to warn you. - Warn me?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,420
你無法抵抗接下來要發生的事
You can't fight what's coming.

155
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,150
放下你的弓
Put down your bow.

156
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,080
脫下我父親的兜帽
Take off my father's hood.

157
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,590
我戴兜帽是為了紀念你父親
I wear that hood to honor your father.

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,310
也為了紀念你
And to honor you.

159
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,310
如果你想紀念我
If you want to honor me,

160
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,250
停止爭斗  好好生活
stop fighting...and live.

161
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,550
不然所有你愛的人都會死
Or everyone you love will die.

162
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,650
奧利
Ollie?

163
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,780
你剛剛在和誰講話
Who were you talking to?

164
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,750
放下武器
Put off your weapons.

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,630
滾過去
Get over there!

166
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,430
奇跡
Mirakuru.

167
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,340
把他們帶走
Take them.

168
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,800
安東尼
Anthony...

169
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,000
你已經得償所愿了
you got what you wanted.

170
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,070
你可以放了他們
You can let them go.

171
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,340
要是你真正在乎過我
If you ever cared about me.

172
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,490
我確實在乎你  莎拉
But I do care about you, Sara.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
所以我不會選擇殺你
Which is why I won't choose to kill you.

174
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,880
但是他可能會
But he might.

175
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,880
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,850
是時候做出選擇了  奧利弗
Time to choose, Oliver.

177
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,260
選出誰生  誰死
Who lives, and who dies.

178
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
不過你得選快點  因為30秒后
But pick quickly, because in 30 seconds,

179
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,500
我會把她們都殺了
I will shoot them both.

180
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,450
孵化已經開始了
The incubation process has begun.

181
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,940
48小時后就可以散播血清
Serum will be ready for distribution in 48 hours.

182
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,780
只要兩天
Two days.

183
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,800
我們就能創造上百個像你一樣的人
And we will be able to create a hundred more like you.

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,460
這座城市的掌權人
And the people who run this city

185
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,270
終于能見識到真正的力量了
will see what real power looks like.

186
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,840
我就知道治安維持者有同伙
I knew the vigilante had partners.

187
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,270
他現在比較喜歡綠箭俠這個稱呼
He likes to be called the Arrow now.

188
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,290
你們三個和一些真正的人渣較量過
You three have messed with some really nasty people.

189
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,350
娃娃制造者  迷魂伯爵
The Doll Maker, Count Vertigo,

190
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,700
幕后者還有女殺手
Dodger, the Huntress.

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
我們沒有記錄在案
We weren't keeping score.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,660
我記著呢
I was.

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,650
巴里
Barry.

194
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,680
你給我用的老鼠藥  有沒有副作用
The rat poison that you gave me... are there any side effects?

195
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,050
有  可能出現幻覺
Um, yeah, I think hallucinations, maybe.

196
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,940
以及大量出汗
And excessive sweating.

197
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
你有沒有出很多汗
Are you sweating excessively?

198
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,430
你產生幻覺了嗎
You're hallucinating?

199
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,730
你看到什么了
What are you seeing?

200
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
一個叫莎朵的女孩  和我一起在島上待過
A girl named Shado that was with me on the island.

201
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,570
莎朵
Shado.

202
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,760
莎拉
Sara.

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,270
你和多少女人一起被困島上
How many women were you marooned with?

204
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,820
你確定那個島不是虛構嗎
Are you sure this wasn't fantasy island?

205
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
你果然是在森林或者叢林里接受的訓練
You did train in a jungle or forest environment,

206
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,990
所以才選了綠色
hence the green.

207
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,770
讓我抽點血  看看怎么樣了
Hey, let me draw some blood, see what's up.

208
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,120
我能問你個事嗎
Hey, can I ask you something?

209
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,820
為什么不戴面具
Why no mask?

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,380
我不是想教你該怎么去維持治安
Not to tell you how to do your vigilante...ing,

211
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,320
只是涂油彩
but the grease paint thing?

212
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,800
不是個隱藏身份的好辦法
It's a poor identity concealer.

213
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,860
那你去幫我找個既能完美適合我的臉型
So find me a mask that conforms perfectly to my face

214
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,380
在我奔跑的同時又完全不妨礙到瞄準力的面具
and doesn't affect my ability to aim while I'm on the run.

215
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,900
你可以試試可壓縮的超細纖維
You should look into a compressible micro fabric.

216
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,340
-會非常好用的  -發現塞勒斯·戈爾德
- It could be great. - Found Cyrus Gold.

217
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,660
塞勒斯·戈爾德是誰
Who's Gyrus Gold?

218
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,370
那天晚上差點把你弄死的那個人體武器
The human weapon that left you nearly dead the other night.

219
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,900
那家伙從你脖子上取下了他的指紋
The kid did manage to pull his print off your neck.

220
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,440
我用人臉識別軟件
I've had facial recognition software

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,730
掃描全城的閉路式攝像機
scanning closed circuit cameras all over town.

222
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,110
他現在在德爾加多大街和第二十五大道處
He's at the corner of Delgado and 25th right now,

223
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,940
但是馬上要跟丟了
but we're just about to lose him.

224
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,180
那個十字路口上還有什么
What else is at that intersection?

225
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,960
停車場  超市  汽車旅館
A parking lot, a market, a motel.

226
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
很可能就是他的藏身之所
Could be where he's holed up.

227
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,840
-我來搞定  -奧利弗
- I got this. - Oliver...

228
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,710
這件事我來處理吧
Why don't let me handle this one?

229
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,470
只是偵察而已
It's just recon.

230
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,690
好吧
Fine.

231
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,570
我做你的后援
But I'm going as your back-up.

232
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,080
別擔心
Don't worry.

233
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,840
我會查出奧利弗到底怎么回事的
I'll figure out what's wrong with Oliver.

234
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,290
你盡早吧
You'd be the first.

235
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,660
{\an8}需要議員陪你一起去做圣誕節采購嗎

236
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
神秘的愛慕者嗎
Secret admirer?

237
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,450
不是的  是我爸送來的
No, actually, they're from my father.

238
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,200
什么風把你吹來了
What brings you by?

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,340
我們需要你的幫助  辛迪的朋友被殺了
We need your help. Cindy's friend was murdered,

240
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,890
但是警方不肯介入調查
but the police aren't going to investigate.

241
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,440
說是吸毒過量致死  就這樣
They said that he ODed, end of story.

242
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,700
看看這個
Check this out.

243
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,520
他獻血賺外快
He earned extra money donating blood.

244
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,450
{\an8}貧民區救災獻血活動

245
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,140
我們在馬克斯房間里找到的
We found it in Max's apartment.

246
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,850
如果他吸毒  他們不會要他的血  對吧
They wouldn't have accepted his blood if he was using, right?

247
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,120
馬克斯和獻血車同天消失的
Max went missing the same day as the blood drive.

248
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,940
如果他真的去那獻血了
If he did donate blood there,

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,520
至少他們會知道點馬克斯的情況吧
maybe they at least know something that happened to him.

250
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,930
我去打聽一下
I'll ask around.

251
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,370
謝謝你  勞蕾爾
Thank you, Laurel.

252
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,040
{\an8}帕特麗夏飯店

253
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,650
如果無聊  儲備箱里有本填字游戲的書
If you get bored, I keep a book of crossword puzzles in the glove box.

254
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,910
這話一點都不好笑
That's not funny.

255
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,180
你看到什么了
Ok, what do you see?

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,110
房間很干凈
It's clean.

257
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,550
非常干凈
Really clean.

258
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
"所羅門·格蘭迪  周一出生..."
"Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday..."

259
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,700
周二洗禮
Christened on Tuesday.

260
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,490
我知道那首詩  象征著生命的七個階段
I know the poem. It symbolizes the seven stages of life--

261
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
從出生到死亡
From birth to death.

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,600
這家伙現在處于哪個階段
What stage is this guy in?

263
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,750
快走快走  快  快
Go, go, go, go, go!

264
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,250
他輕而易舉地就能把我拎起來
He picked me up like I was nothing.

265
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,040
-費利西蒂  請求支援  -馬上來
- Felicity, call for back-up.  - On it.

266
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,800
是莎拉的事嗎
This about Sara?

267
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,820
你有她的消息嗎
You heard from her?

268
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,360
沒有
No.

269
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,810
抱歉  這是...
I'm sorry, this is...

270
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,390
是別的事
This is something else.

271
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,170
塞勒斯·戈爾德
Cyrus Gold.

272
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,710
上周他到奎恩聯合企業的
He robbed the Applied Sciences division

273
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,510
應用科學部門偷了東西
of Queen Consolidated last week.

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,320
警探
Detective...

275
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,330
他是個危險分子
He's extremely dangerous.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,940
從中心城市派來的現場調查員
The CSI kid from central city,

277
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,210
他說這人就像某種怪物
he said this guy was like some kind of monster.

278
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,870
確實是
He is.

279
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,160
是什么東西  用了類固醇嗎
Well, what is it, steroids?

280
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,470
更糟糕  是...
Worse. It's--

281
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,400
那個是...
It's...

282
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,070
好吧  就算我相信你  你為什么來找我
Well, assuming I believe you, why come to me?

283
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,860
我妥協了
I've been compromised.

284
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,800
什么意思
What does that mean?

285
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
意思是我現在是個累贅
It means I'd be a liability.

286
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,610
這事你必須相信我  警探
You have to take my word on this, detective.

287
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,970
盡可能召集多的人手
Gather as many men as you can,

288
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,870
能殺死塞勒斯·戈爾德的時候一定不要猶豫
and do not hesitate to kill Cyrus Gold.

289
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,390
因為如果他有機會
Because if given the opportunity,

290
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,960
他也會毫不猶豫地殺了你
he'll do the same to you.

291
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,650
你不需要這么做
You don't have to do this!

292
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,040
你拿到了你想要的東西
You got what you came for!

293
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,730
拿上東西走吧
Just take it and go!

294
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,430
還剩十秒
10 seconds.

295
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,360
你這變態的神經病
You freaking psychopath!

296
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,890
歷史自有決斷
History will make that judgment.

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,180
還剩五秒
Five seconds.

298
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,970
時間到
Time's up.

299
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,890
不  不
No, no!

300
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,410
我想你已經做出了選擇
I guess you made your choice.

301
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
不
No!

302
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,930
你來這里干什么
What are you doing here?

303
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,380
我是來找西婭的
I came by to see Thea.

304
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,200
進來吧
Go on in.

305
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,210
她在樓上她的房間里
She's upstairs in her room.

306
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,620
我開車過來的時候注意到
I noticed on the drive up that your house

307
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,630
你們家沒有布置圣誕裝飾
wasn't festooned with Christmas decorations.

308
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,090
我們今年不是
Well, we didn't feel very much like

309
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,780
很想布置
festooning this year.

310
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,950
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

311
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,200
我記得去年圣誕節
I remember last Christmas,

312
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,900
湯米和我來參加你們的聚會
Tommy and I came here for your party.

313
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,960
那是我很長時間以來過的最好的節日
It was one of the best holidays I'd had in a really long time.

314
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,050
我該去找西婭了
Anyway, I should probably go talk to Thea.

315
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,690
我調查了獻血活動
I checked into the blood drive,

316
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,220
是完全合法的
and it's all legitimate.

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,460
實際上  塞巴斯蒂安的工作
In fact, what Sebastian's done

318
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,130
已經幫忙拯救了許多生命
has helped save a lot of lives.

319
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,010
如果獻血活動是合法有益的
So if the blood drive is on the up and up,

320
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,040
那我們該怎么找到殺馬克斯的兇手
then how are we supposed to find Max's killer?

321
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,040
還有一件事
There's one other thing.

322
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,170
所有參加活動的獻血者
All of the blood donors at the drive

323
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,700
都參加了蘭福德研究所的
were subjected to a psych evaluation

324
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,160
精神評估
by the Langford Institute.

325
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,810
那是合法的嗎
Is that, like, legal?

326
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,450
這并不是完全不合常理
It's not entirely out of the norm.

327
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,300
研究所的人
And while someone at the

328
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,880
應該知道馬克斯有沒有被下毒
institute might know if Max was on drugs,

329
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
{\an8}貧民區救災獻血活動

330
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,520
沒有搜查令是沒法查出來的
There's no way of finding out without a warrant.

331
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,580
我們又沒法拿到搜查令
Which we're certainly not going to get.

332
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,890
很抱歉我只能幫到這里了
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

333
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,630
你在干什么
What are you doing?

334
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,860
只是隨便弄點東西
Uh, just messing around with something.

335
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,740
你不是應該在查奧利弗
Shouldn't you be trying to figure out

336
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,540
產生幻覺的原因嗎
what's causing Oliver's hallucinations?

337
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,270
樣本還在掃描  應該快好了
Sample's still being scanned. Shouldn't be too much longer.

338
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,320
很好
Good.

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,890
你真的很擔心他  對吧
You're really worried about him, huh?

340
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,680
他總是冒很大的險
He takes crazy chances.

341
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,360
即使是在他不幻想
Even when he's not hallucinating

342
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
島上那些漂亮姑娘的時候
about beautiful island girls.

343
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,080
那天晚上  我問你是不是喜歡奧利弗
The other night, I asked you if you liked Oliver.

344
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,260
我跟你說了  我不喜歡
I told you. I don't.

345
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,120
我記得
I remember.

346
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,710
但如果你喜歡...
But if you did...

347
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,980
我能看出原因
I could see why.

348
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,610
我是說  奧利弗·奎因
I mean, Oliver Queen.

349
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,890
白天他是個百萬富翁
He is a billionaire by day

350
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,200
晚上他拯救城市
and saves the city by night.

351
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,790
聽起來你想跟他約會啊
Sounds like you want to date him.

352
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,970
我是剛剛開始喜歡一個
I just have a little experience with liking someone

353
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,920
用不同于他人的眼光看我的人
who doesn't see you the same way.

354
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
今晚粒子加速器的啟動進入倒計時
Protests continue into the final countdown

355
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,630
對尖端科技研究實驗室頗具爭議的
for tonight's ignition of S.T.A.R.

356
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,040
抗議活動還在繼續
Lab's controversial particle accelerator.

357
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,440
尖端科技研究實驗室的創始人哈里森·威爾斯
S.T.A.R. Lab's founder Harrison Wells promises a new era

358
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,580
{\an8}硬粒子加速器開啟倒計時

359
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,070
聲稱科技進步的新紀元即將到來
of scientific advancement is at hand.

360
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,270
我想我來不及回去看他們開啟加速器了
I guess I won't be back in time to see them turn it on.

361
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,000
我知道  是聽起來很瘋狂
I know, it sounds crazy.

362
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,010
人體武器
Human weapons?

363
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,140
他的名字叫塞勒斯·戈爾德
Look, his name is Cyrus Gold.

364
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,640
他就是上周闖入奎恩聯合企業的人
He's the one that broke into Queen Consolidated last week.

365
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,090
就是他搶了血庫
He's the one that robbed the blood bank.

366
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,810
也是他殺了那些人
And he killed all those people.

367
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,900
等等
Wait, hold on a second.

368
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,600
你怎么知道這些的
Where are you getting all this intel?

369
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,330
伙計  你是怎么了
Oh, man, what's a matter with you?

370
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,170
你就是因為跟治安維持者聯系而降職的
Talking to Wigilante's what got you demoted in the first place.

371
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,230
聽著  我們帶一支小隊去
Look, we take a small squad.

372
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,840
特警隊的麥卡西和埃文斯  還有瓊斯
Mccarthy and Evans from SWAT, Jones.

373
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,260
我們可以抓住這個家伙的
We can bring this guy down.

374
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,510
我答應過珍妮帶她去圣誕采購
I promised Jeannie I'd take her Christmas shopping.

375
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,440
盧卡斯
Lucas.

376
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
拜托
Please.

377
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,260
好吧
Fine.

378
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,340
但你得給珍妮打電話告訴她
But you get to call Jeanie and tell her

379
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,430
我沒法帶她去購物了
I'm not taking her shopping.

380
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,730
長官
Hey, Sir.

381
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,830
我不想越級
I don't mean to overstep,

382
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,290
但你能多帶一個人嗎
but could you guys use an extra man?

383
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,280
去穿件防彈衣  戴利警官
Grab a vest, Officer Daily.

384
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,060
警察盯上戈爾德了
The police are onto Gold.

385
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
他們在找他
They're looking for him.

386
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,080
我確信已經混進了隊伍
I made sure I'm in the loop.

387
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
現在絕對不能讓警察影響到我們
We are too close to let the police interfere.

388
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,990
塞拉斯兄弟
Brother Cyrus.

389
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
警察很想見你
The police are eager to meet you.

390
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,010
介紹一下你自己
Introduce yourself.

391
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
圣誕節有什么計劃嗎
So, any plans for Christmas?

392
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,250
點亮我的燭臺[猶太節日所用]
Lighting my menorah.

393
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,610
感覺怎么樣
Hi. How are you feeling?

394
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,830
還行
Fine. Just...

395
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,490
家里人多擁擠
It's a little bit crowded at my house,

396
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,050
我就想過來  一個人靜靜
and I wanted to come down here to get a little privacy.

397
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,450
沒問題
Yeah.

398
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,950
走吧  巴里
Come on, Barry.

399
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,580
去大胃王漢堡店看倒計時也行
We can watch the countdown at big belly burger.

400
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,260
你的血液分析快完成了
Your blood analysis is almost done.

401
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,510
謝謝
Thank you.

402
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,940
怎么了  小子
What's the matter, kid?

403
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,850
一臉看到鬼的樣子
You look like you've seen a ghost.

404
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,480
你確定他在里面嗎
Are you sure he's in there?

405
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
是的  長官
Yes, sir.

406
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,360
有人看到塞勒斯·戈爾德進去
Sector car spotted Cyrus Gold entering.

407
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,170
一直沒有出來
He hasn't left.

408
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,370
手槍保險都打開
Safeties off.

409
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,900
他在那邊  包圍過去
Over there. Surround him.

410
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,010
這地方不錯啊
This is a nice place.

411
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,010
比荒島上的破碎機艙
It's a bit more comfortable

412
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,740
稍微舒服點
than the fuselage on the island.

413
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,430
你不是真的
You're not real.

414
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,790
你也不是
Neither are you.

415
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,340
你對別人說  掀起這場變革
You told everyone when you started this crusade

416
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
是為了
that it was about

417
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,250
彌補你父親犯下的罪惡
making up for your father's sins.

418
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,210
真是謊話連篇
That was a lie.

419
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,260
你是為自己贖罪
This charade is to atone for your sins.

420
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,920
你已經死了
You're dead.

421
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,510
你不是什么英雄
You are not a hero.

422
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,290
也不配當朋友兄弟  你屁都不是
Or a friend. Or a brother. You are nothing.

423
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,900
不要背對著我[背叛我]
Do not turn your back on me,

424
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,940
第二次了
not again.

425
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,890
你已經去世了
You're gone.

426
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,170
不管我現在在哪...
Wherever I am...

427
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,950
你應該加入我
It's time you joined me.

428
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,430
莎翁說過懦夫一生千次死
They say a coward dies a thousand deaths.

429
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,850
可是你死一千次也不夠
But even that wouldn't be enough for you.

430
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,310
我試過救你
I tried to save you!

431
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,670
還有她
And her.

432
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,040
可你沒做到
But you couldn't.

433
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,620
正如你也救不了這座城市
Just like you couldn't save this city.

434
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,890
那座島根本沒讓你變強
The island didn't make you strong, kid.

435
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,120
反而暴露出你的軟弱
It revealed you to be weak.

436
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,850
謝謝你當我的購物指導
Thank you for being my shopping guide.

437
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,010
你還好嗎
Are you ok?

438
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,380
我沒事  那個
Uh, yeah, it's just, um,

439
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,870
我可以問你個問題嗎
can I ask you a question?

440
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,350
關于你發起的獻血活動
It's about the blood drive you sponsored.

441
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,150
當然  那是好事一樁
Of course. It's a wonderful cause.

442
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,900
尤其是對于那些資金不足的醫院來說
Especially with the underfunded hospitals we're dealing with.

443
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,150
怎么了
What about it?

444
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,530
喂
Hello?

445
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,950
什么
What?!

446
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,190
好的  我馬上過來
Ok, I'll be right over.

447
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,040
怎么了
What happened?

448
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,810
我爸爸
My father.

449
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,740
他受重傷住院了  抱歉
He's in the ICU. I'm so sorry.

450
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,710
非常抱歉  我得先走了
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

451
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,400
不好意思
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,110
發生什么事了
What happened in here?

453
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,300
有人闖進來過嗎
Did someone break in?

454
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,520
沒有
No.

455
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,780
你的血液分析結果出來了  好消息
Your blood analysis is done. Good news.

456
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
查到里面有什么了嗎
So you know what's in my system?

457
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,750
問題就在這里  你的血液很干凈
That's the thing-- your blood's clean.

458
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,690
沒有任何問題
There's nothing wrong with you.

459
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,270
那我為什么會產生幻覺
Then why am I hallucinating?!

460
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,510
我不知道
I don't know.

461
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,630
不管問題出在哪
But whatever your problem is,

462
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,060
肯定不是生理原因  而是心理問題
it's not pharmacological. It's psychological.

463
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,470
-是你的臆想  -是我的臆想
- It's in your head. - It's in my head.

464
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,260
老天
Oh, my god.

465
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,430
奧利弗
Oliver.

466
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,200
爸
Dad!

467
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,180
寶貝
Honey.

468
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,870
寶貝
Honey.

469
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,670
我的腳趾還能動  應該是個好跡象
Well, I can wiggle my toes, it must be a good sign.

470
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,270
我沒事  親愛的
I'm all right, honey, I'm fine.

471
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,810
盧卡斯怎么樣  他還好嗎
How's Lucas, is he all right?

472
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,560
對不起
I--I'm sorry.

473
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,210
你這是什么意思
What do you mean?

474
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,930
我得打電話告訴他妻子珍妮
I got to call Jeannie. I got to call his wife.

475
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,340
爸  你待著別動  我去打
No, dad, I'll do it. You just...stay here.

476
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,310
你好好休息
Get some rest.

477
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,800
你來這里干什么
What are you doing here?

478
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,850
來看看你爸爸有沒有事
Wanted to make sure your father was ok.

479
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,080
他沒事
He is.

480
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,760
順便也看看你還好嗎
I wanted to make sure you were, too.

481
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,680
你怎么樣  警探
How are you, detective?

482
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,670
沒死
I'm alive.

483
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,730
我的同伴就沒這么幸運了
Unlike most everyone else in my unit.

484
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,500
關于您搭檔的事我很遺憾
I'm sorry about your partner.

485
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,310
是我帶他進去的
I took him in there.

486
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,310
是因為我
Because of me.

487
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
我不想讓你失望
I hate to disappoint you,

488
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,380
但你沒必要對這城市的每樁命案負責
but not every death in this city is on you.

489
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,260
從戈爾德身上拿到的
I got this off Gold.

490
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,230
希望能幫到你
Hopefully you can do something with it.

491
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,670
開始我還不相信  但這個人
I didn't believe it at first, but this guy,

492
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,400
根本不像是人類
I mean, it's like he's not human.

493
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,110
他是人類
He's human.

494
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,800
那就殺了他
Well, then you can kill him.

495
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,960
為希爾頓  也為我
For Hilton. And me.

496
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,090
我覺得夠鋒利了
I think those are sharp enough.

497
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,140
很顯然我不這么認為
Apparently I'm not.

498
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,200
狄格爾  你覺得我是神經錯亂了嗎
Diggle, do you think I'm losing my mind?

499
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,270
沒比我們差多少
No more than the rest of us.

500
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,610
我看到
I saw...

501
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,230
斯萊德·威爾遜
Slade Wilson.

502
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,330
斯萊德是我在小島上的朋友
Slade was my friend on the island,

503
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,510
而且
and...

504
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,490
他和莎朵一樣  因我而死
like Shado, he is dead because of me.

505
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,440
蘭斯先生說
Mr. Lance just told me

506
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,140
我沒必要對這城市的每樁命案負責
that not every death in this city is my fault.

507
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,560
確實
Fine.

508
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,100
但確實有很多是我的責任
There are plenty that are.

509
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,910
當我從阿富汗回來時  我
When I got home from Afghanistan, I...

510
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,200
也看到了個鬼魂
saw a ghost, too.

511
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,050
幸存者的內疚
Survivor's guilt.

512
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,020
為什么我們獨活
Why us, not them.

513
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
我知道為什么
I know why.

514
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,310
那這"為什么"就不是你的問題
Then the "Why's" not your problem.

515
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,700
你是怎么趕走鬼魂的
How'd you make your ghost go away?

516
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,870
我明白了他們想告訴我的意思
I figured out what they were trying to tell me.

517
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,990
是什么
Which was?

518
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,810
那是說給我聽的  奧利弗
That's for me to hear, Oliver.

519
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,380
你得搞清你的那鬼魂想告訴你什么
You have to figure out what yours is trying to tell you.

520
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,030
伙計們  有新發現
Guys, we got something here.

521
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,920
我掃描了蘭斯給你的鑰匙
I scanned the key Lance gave you,

522
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,150
通過序列號查到了它的生產商
and traced its serial code back to the manufacturer.

523
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,070
這把鑰匙和貧民區新月環路某處
This particular key fits a locked gate

524
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,070
一個上鎖的門相匹配
somewhere on Crescent Circle in the glades.

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,890
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

526
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,890
你這身體狀況不能隨便跑出去
You can't go out there in your condition.

527
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,680
我必須阻止他們
I have to stop this.

528
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,170
奧利弗  戈爾德沒直接把你打死
Oliver, Gold left you half dead,

529
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,480
比起希爾頓警探的遭遇可真是手下留情了
which is 50 percent better than how he left detective hilton.

530
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,490
費利西蒂
Felicity...

531
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,150
我別無選擇
I don't have a choice.

532
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,620
我會回來的
I'll come back.

533
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,830
你發誓
Promise me.

534
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,150
{\an8}蘭福德研究所

535
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,820
馬克斯
Max.

536
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,550
{\an8}米拉庫魯

537
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,360
萬事俱備
It's ready.

538
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,810
這就是你殺馬克斯·斯坦頓的地方嗎
Is this where you killed max stanton, hmm?

539
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,450
你要干嘛  敢用它扎我  我就殺了你
What are you doing? If you stick that in me, I'll kill you.

540
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,930
不  羅伊兄弟
No, Brother Roy.

541
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,320
你會為我殺人
You'll kill for me.

542
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,980
勒斯兄弟說他已經把你殺了
Brother Cyrus told me he killed you.

543
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,380
也許他沒你想得那么強大
Guess he's not as strong as you'd hoped.

544
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,370
你從哪里得到的米拉庫魯  誰給你的配方
Where'd you get the Mirakiru? Who gave you the formula?!

545
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,380
那是一件可以用來拯救這座城市的禮物
It was a gift. A gift I would use to save this city from itself.

546
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,710
另一件失敗品
Another failure.

547
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,830
站起來  奧利弗
Get up, Oliver.

548
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,630
湯米
Tommy?

549
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,420
你不能死在這里
You're not going to die down here.

550
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,820
湯米  對不起
Tommy, I'm sorry.

551
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,330
你是因我而死
I let you die.

552
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,230
我不是因你而死  奧利
You didn't let me die, Ollie.

553
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,520
你為了救我而戰
You fought to save me.

554
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,570
因為你就是這樣的人
Because that's what you do.

555
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,050
一如既往
What you have always done.

556
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,540
為生存而戰
You fight to survive.

557
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,830
我知道我曾叫你殺人犯
I know I called you a murderer,

558
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,240
但你不是
but you are not.

559
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,350
你是個英雄
You are a hero.

560
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,970
你戰勝了那座小島
You beat the island.

561
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,040
你戰勝了我父親
You beat my father.

562
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,420
戰斗下去  奧利弗
So fight, Oliver.

563
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,350
站起來
Get up,

564
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,650
以牙還牙
and fight back.

565
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,070
殺了他
Kill him.

566
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,640
我不會再眼睜睜看著別人死去
Hey. I am not leaving anyone else to die!

567
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,340
你很堅強  孩子
You're strong, kid.

568
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
加油  加油
Come on! Come on!

569
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,960
加油  羅伊
Come on, Roy!

570
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,780
戰勝它  加油  戰勝它
Fight. Come on, fight!

571
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,060
羅伊
Roy?!

572
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,560
羅伊
Hey, Roy!

573
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,430
你去哪了  我到處找你
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you!

574
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,640
我
I was...

575
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,430
我去追蹤一條線索
I was running down another lead.

576
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,540
似乎不太成功
It didn't pan out.

577
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,250
我還以為你又去找治安維持者了
I thought you were chasing after the vigilante again.

578
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,960
我嚇壞了  還以為你出什么事了
I got so scared. I thought something happened to you.

579
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,500
聽我說  別擔心
Hey, hey, don't worry.

580
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,890
我活得好好的
I'm alive.

581
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,530
我要為星城的人民大眾服務
I want to serve the people of Starling,

582
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,740
{\an8}布拉德宣布參選市長

583
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,250
而不是為那些自以為擁有這城市的人
not the men and women who think they own it.

584
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,830
攜起手來  重建我們的城市
Together, we can help rebuild our city

585
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,330
不再有階級  不再有壓迫
into a place where there are no elites and no oppressed.

586
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,440
人人都是兄弟姐妹
Where we are all brothers and sisters.

587
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,410
看來你的競選開始了
So your campaign begins.

588
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,430
星城需要領袖
The city needs a leader.

589
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,250
讓冒牌兜帽男刺殺市長
And putting the copycat hoods up to assassinating the Mayor

590
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,850
只是第一步
was just the first step.

591
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,150
治安維持者
The vigilante...

592
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,160
他摧毀了離心機
He destroyed the centrifuge

593
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,580
也破壞了血清
and the serum along with it.

594
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,730
我會再給你提供一份我的血樣
I will arrange for you to receive another sample of my blood,

595
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,180
然后你就可以再次大批量制血清
and then you can begin to mass produce the serum again.

596
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,770
如果我不允許你與治安維持者對峙
When I ask you not to confront the vigilante,

597
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,260
你要聽令
you will listen.

598
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,620
記住  你的面具別人也可以戴
Remember, your mask can be worn by another.

599
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,290
你知道兜帽男是誰  對吧
You know who he is under that hood, don't you?

600
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,140
我再清楚不過了
I know exactly who he is.

601
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,250
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

602
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,060
怪不得你不希望他死
That's why you don't want him dead.

603
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,630
死亡是一種解脫
Death would be a release from this life,

604
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,740
他還沒有接受審判
and his sentence is yet to be carried out.

605
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,840
我要摧毀他所在乎的一切
I am going to tear everything he cares about away from him.

606
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,570
制裁所有追隨他的人
Destroy those who choose to follow him.

607
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,090
蹂躪他至愛之人
Corrupt those he loves.

608
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,980
待他失去了
Once he has lost everyone

609
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,420
所有至親至愛
and everything he values...

610
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,460
我再用箭刺穿他的頭顱
I will drive an arrow through his eye.

611
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,150
莎朵
Shado...

612
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,240
莎朵
Shado!

613
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,950
不
No!

614
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,230
為什么
Why?

615
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,720
我...
I...

616
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,840
艾沃開槍打死了她
Ivo just shot her.

617
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,720
不知道為什么
He didn't say why.

618
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,070
不管是誰做的
Whoever did this to her...

619
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,410
我要他血債血償
has got to suffer.

620
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,570
還有幻覺嗎
Still have a ghost problem?

621
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,590
沒有了
No.

622
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,120
我明白意思了
I got the message.

623
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,430
不過...
But we...

624
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,370
還有其他問題
We have other problems.

625
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,980
要沒問題就奇怪了
Wouldn't be us if we didn't.

626
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,430
羅伊被注射了血清
Roy was injected with the serum.

627
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,940
天啊  他怎么樣了
Oh, my god, is he ok?

628
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,750
還活著
He's alive.

629
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,670
不過我們得看著他
But we are going to have to keep an eye on him.

630
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,930
塞勒斯·戈爾德呢
And Cyrus Gold?

631
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,150
死于周六  周日安葬
Died on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

632
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,990
但他還有個同伙
But he was working with someone.

633
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,340
我看見他戴了一副面具
I saw him, he wore a mask

634
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,080
上邊畫著  骷髏
with the image of a...of a skull.

635
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,960
他想大批量生產血清  然后建立軍隊
He's trying to mass produce the serum to build an army.

636
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,880
為什么
For what?

637
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,590
你是一名軍人
You're a soldier.

638
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,430
軍隊的首要天職是什么
What's the primary purpose of an army?

639
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,780
戰爭
War.

640
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,280
巴里呢
Where's Barry?

641
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,990
他回中心城市了
He went back to Central City.

642
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,150
想及時趕回去
Wanted to get home in time

643
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,230
看他們打開粒子加速器
to see them turn on the particle accelerator.

644
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,300
我接個電話
I should take this.

645
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,300
到了嗎
Did you make it?

646
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,500
我及時趕回了中心城市
I made it back to Central City in time,

647
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,900
不過我很懷念尖端科研實驗室與世隔絕的生活
But I missed the cut off in line at S.T.A.R. Labs.

648
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,120
跟往常一樣  我遲到了
I was late, as usual.

649
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,660
但是我可不想再遲到了
But in spirit of not being late again,

650
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,810
你什么時候覺得
uh, if you ever decide that

651
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,970
奧利弗·奎恩不適合你
Oliver Queen isn't the guy for you;

652
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,560
或者覺得
if you decide that

653
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,660
想跟不一樣的人
you want to go on a date with

654
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,440
約會
