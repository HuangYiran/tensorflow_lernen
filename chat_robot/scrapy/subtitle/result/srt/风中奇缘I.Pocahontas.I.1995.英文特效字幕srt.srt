205
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was her dream to see you wear it at your own.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, child, you were saying.

266
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,440
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm running through the woods...

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,450
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow.

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,180
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As I look at it, it starts to spin.

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,630
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow...

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I ever going to find it?

278
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told her to listen.

280
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,580
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They live in the earth, the water, the sky.

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,060
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you listen, they will guide you.

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,770
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. What is it telling you?

284
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,400
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

307
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,820
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The water's deep enough. We can pull right up to shore.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey there, Percy.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm counting on you to make sure...

314
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,790
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission.

315
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,670
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before,

316
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,260
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's nothing I can't handle.

317
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right. That'll be all, Smith. - There's a good man.

318
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,910
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you, Percy.

319
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,910
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The men like Smith, don't they?

320
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never been... a popular man.

321

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't think I don't know...

323
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,250
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what those back stabbers at court say about me.

324
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,920
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, all that talk about

325
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,950
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}being a pathetic social climber who's failed at everything...

326
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.

327
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,120
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But mark my words, Wiggins.

328
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,930
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When King James sees the gold these peasants unearth...

329
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,230
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}success will be mine at last.

330
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,770
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up! Shake a leg!

331
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,670
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's incredible!

332
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,410
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's all ours.

333
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,180
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen anything like it.

334
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,740
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could look like Ratcliffe's knickers, for all I care...

335
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,410
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just as long as I get off this stinkin' boat.

336
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, men.

337
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't come all this way just to look at it.

338
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,070
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it taut, lads. Keep it taut. Steady! Steady! Hold up! That's far enough.

339
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right... now. Tie her off.

340
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,210
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, John, tie off this end.

341
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,750
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John? John?

342
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,420
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing up there?

343
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,760
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting a better look.

344
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,830
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a strange-looking fellow.

345
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you hungry?

346
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go. Ah, it's a biscuit.

347
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,400
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's food. Well, sort of.

348
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like it, eh?

349
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, try eating it for four months straight.

350
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a friend back there?

351
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,800
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Wh... What? Watch out.

352
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Get... No, get... Uh, look out.

353
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,630
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John, you better get down here!

354
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,500
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The governor's coming ashore.

355
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right. I'm leaving.

356
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see their skin? They have hair on their faces like dogs.

357
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brothers, we must know more about these visitors.

358
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,000
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kekata, what do you see?

359
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are not men like us...

360
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,490
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun...

361
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

362
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,500
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They prowl the Earth like ravenous wolves...

363
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}consuming everything in their path.

364
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,950
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors

365
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,140
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the river and attack.

366
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will destroy these invaders...

367
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,490
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

368
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,860
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy...

369
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But these pale visitors are strange to us.

370
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,090
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take some men to the river to observe them.

371
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,790
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

372
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,270
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hereby claim this land and all its riches...

373
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,240
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the name of His Majesty King James the First...

374
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and do so name this settlement Jamestown.

375
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,840
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bravo! Bravo! Beautifully spoken, sir!

376
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,210
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry now, Percy.

377
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,120
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.

378
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,190
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain Smith,

379
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,000
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it appears I've selected the perfect location, eh?

380
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,230
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a savage in sight.

381
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,460
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because we don't see them...

382
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,160
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

383
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then perhaps you should venture forth...

384
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,370
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

385
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,900
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.

386
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,440
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, gentlemen, to work.

387
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,280
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You men, get the ship unloaded. - Right, sir.

388
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You men, build the fort.

389
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,420
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rest of you, break out the shovels!

390
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,290
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to start digging!

391
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Digging? - Digging?

392
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,920
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, of course!

393
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,950
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not forget what the Spanish found...

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,790
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when they came to the New World.

395
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gold! Mountains of it.

396
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, for years they've been ravaging the New World...

397
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,900
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of its most precious resources...

398
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,930
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but now...

668
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,830
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The drums. They mean trouble.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please, don't leave. - I'm sorry.

00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,770
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go.

673
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,880
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! This one's ready to hoist!

674
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,450
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Two on each side. - Ready now? Push!

675
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch it. It's slippery.

676
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, lads. It's only a little picket fence.

677

679
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,810
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something wrong, John?

680
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,070
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

681
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been awfully quiet the last few days.

682
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,240
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action.

683
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,870
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, don't worry, John.

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we'll take care of them...

686
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like we did last time, eh, mates?

687
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,160
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# We shot ourselves an Injun #

{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you howling nutter, get to work!

690
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

691
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,000
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

692
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,300
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at us. No gold, no food.

693
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,300
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day...

694
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,830
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}happy as a clam.

695
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,310
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am doomed!

696
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,440
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be wallowing in riches by now...

697
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,380
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I haven't found as much as a speck!

698
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think. Think!

699
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,710
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got to be around here somewhere.

700
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,190
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where could it be?

701
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,520
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've mined the forests and the hills

702
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,120
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the swamps... And nothing!

703
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,390
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't I find it? What am I overlooking?

704
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I...

705
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,230
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made it myself.

706
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that silly...

707
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,870
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course! The Indians.

708
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,780
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wiggins, why do you think...

709
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,370
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those insolent heathens attacked us?

710
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,580
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we invaded their land

711
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,880
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and cut down their trees and dug up their earth?

712
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the gold! They have it...

713
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they don't want us to take it from them.

714
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,350
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'll just have to take it by force, then, won't I?

715
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You there! Where's Captain Smith?

716
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,720
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he's gone.

717
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,860
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Your singing must have scared them off.

718
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,530
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake!

719
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,400
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if we run into the Indians?

720
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,240
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what guns are for.

721
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,570
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now arm yourselves and get moving!

722
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,970
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas.

723
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,940
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be inside the village.

724
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,530
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be all right.

725
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,770
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.

726
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:54,970
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go far.

727
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,740
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now is not the time to be running off.

728
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,410
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Father.

729
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I see you wear that necklace...

730
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you look just like your mother.

731
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss her.

732
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,060
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she is still with us.

733
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,560
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whenever the wind moves through the trees...

734
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,330
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel her presence.

735
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,300
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength.

736
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,070
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someday, they will look to you as well.

737
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,940
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would be honoured by that.

738
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,740
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't be out here alone.

739
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,940
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll send for Kocoum.

740
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. What is it?

741
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - You're hiding something.

742
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,950
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not hiding anything.

743
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,150
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise

744
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,180
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!

745
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,090
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's one of them! I'm going to get...

746
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

747
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to see you again.

748
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,090
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas!

749
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas!

750
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! Don't say anything.

751
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! this way!

752
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,700
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But... - Nakoma.

753
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,440
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is Pocahontas?

754
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,270
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I haven't seen her.

755
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,440
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas can't keep running off.

756
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,310
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's dangerous out there.

757
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,750
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell her that. She listens to you.

758
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh! Sure she does.

759
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,040
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is incredible.

760
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,340
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to think we came all this way...

761
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to dig it up for gold.

762
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,170
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gold?

763
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:36,880
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Meeko. - What's gold?

764
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's, uh... it's, it's yellow.

765
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,380
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It comes out of the ground. It's really valuable.

766
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Here, we have lots of it.

767
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,720
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gold.

768
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,560
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No No! Gold is this.

769
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing like that around here.

770
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No gold? - Not that I've seen.

771
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,730
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this way for nothing.

772
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,570
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.

773
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will they leave? - Some of them might.

774
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you go home?

775
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,070
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.

776
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,520
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never really belonged anywhere.

777
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,350
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could belong here.

778
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?!

779
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:26,930
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see something?

780
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,870
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. I just, uh... I...

781
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,170
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't see anything, did I?

782
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,700
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look again.

783
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,710
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Let it break upon you #

784
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:44,380
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Like a wave upon the sand #

785
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,390
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, John Smith.

786
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

787
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you should talk back.

788
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,560
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be frightened, young man.

789
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,500
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My bark is worse than my bite.

790
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say something.

791
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,620
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say to a tree?

792
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,660
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything you want.

793
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,540
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, uh...

794
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,170
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come closer, John Smith.

795
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,810
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a good soul.

796
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's handsome too!

797
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, I like her. - I knew you would.

798
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smith!

799
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,620
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smith Where are you, mate?

800
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,850
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't let them see us.

801
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,330
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! Over here.

802
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,120
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place gives me the creeps.

803
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Savages could be hiding anywhere.

804
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions. Just shoot.

805
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,370
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your feet, you big oaf!

806
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't me. It was the tree.

807
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,400
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, of course!

808
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,880
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The tree just felt like lifting its roots and...

809
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get out of here.

810
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,810
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ow! Run! - Ow!

811
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about Smith?

812
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:57,190
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a big lad. He can take care of himself.

813
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,520
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad you're on our side.

814
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,620
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's still some snap in these old vines.

815
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,390
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd better get back before they send the whole camp out after me.

816
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When will I see you again?

817
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet me tonight. Right here.

818
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,310
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.

819
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.

820
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I want to see him again.

821
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

822
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,520
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But still, something inside...

823
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is telling me it's the right thing.

824
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,390
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps it's your dream.

825
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:35,120
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dream? Do you think he's the one...

826
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,530
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the spinning arrow was pointing to?

827
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warriors are here!

828
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,150
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, are you crazy? What were you doing with one of them?

829
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There you are. - Kocoum!

830
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,750
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at them! Now we have enough warriors...

831
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to destroy those white demons!

832
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that we are joined by our brothers...

833
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,990
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will defeat this enemy.

834
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,340
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, I need to speak with you.

835
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,850
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now, my daughter. The council is gathering.

836
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,410
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have to fight them! There must be a better way.

837
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,210
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

838
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,780
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe we should try talking to them.

839
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,480
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They do not want to talk.

840
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if one of them did want to talk...

841
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

842
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,420
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pocahontas. - Wouldn't you?

843
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,760
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I would. But it is not that simple.

844
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing is simple any more.

845
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,450
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, Thomas. It's me.

846
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,280
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, John. I could've killed you.

847
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

848
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

849
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,920
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see twice as well.

850
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smith, there you are!

851
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were looking all over for you.

852
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,490
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smith! Where have you been?

853
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,300
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

854
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,700
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts.

855
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,330
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll need that information for the battle.

856
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,570
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What battle?

857
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,580
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will eliminate these savages once and for all.

858
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! You can't do that!

859
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, can't I?

860
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we don't have to fight them.

861
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,820
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- John, what's gotten into you? - I met one of them.

862
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,340
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You what?! - A savage?

863
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not savages. They can help us.

864
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,250
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They know the land.

865
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,560
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They know how to navigate the rivers.

866
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And look. It's food. - What is it?

867
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,960
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.

868
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,190
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like gruel.

869
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

870
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to kill us! All of us!

871
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,740
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got our gold...

872
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,500
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they'll do anything to keep it!

873
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,030
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there is no gold.

874
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No gold?

875
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,410
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I suppose your little Indian friend told you this?

876
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,920
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

877
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lies! Lies! All of it! Murderous thieves!

878
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,820
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

879
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,290
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is their land!

880
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,730
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my land! I make the laws here.

881
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,060
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian...

882
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,660
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without killing him on sight...

883
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,900
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will be tried for treason and hanged!

884
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas!

885
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,860
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nakoma! - Don't go out there.

886
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,220
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lied for you once. Don't ask me to do it again.

887
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,730
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to do this.

888
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,960
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's one of them! - You don't know him.

889
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,160
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you go out there...

890
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,030
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be turning your back on your own people.

891
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to help my people.

892
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,030
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend.

893
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you to get hurt.

894
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't. I know what I'm doing.

895
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, no!

896
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratcliffe wouldn't take us...

897
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,850
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}halfway around the world for nothin'.

898
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if Smith is right?

899
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if there is no gold?

900
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,890
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you ask me...

901
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,790
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.

902
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,760
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.

903
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.

904
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,030
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're hidin' somethin'.

905
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,700
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they do have the gold...

906
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,530
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

907
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either too hot or too cool.

908
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,510
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't been comfortable since we got here.

909
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,350
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I know. I've been itching a lot.

910
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Follow him. - Yes, Governor.

911
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,990
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know where he's sneaking off to.

912
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,190
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

913
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,460
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you happen to see any Indians,

914
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,090
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot them.

915
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,600
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor

916
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,270
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a poor excuse for a soldier.

917
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,470
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't disappoint me again.

918
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kocoum. - What is it?

919
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,780
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Pocahontas.

920
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong? Is she all right?

921
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,590
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's in trouble.

922
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,130
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Earth is trembling, child. What's happened?

923
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,610
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warriors are here!

924
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,770
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pocahontas! - John!

925
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,240
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me.

926
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My men are planning to attack your people.

927
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,840
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to warn them.

928
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,350
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

929
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,320
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to come with me and talk to my father.

930
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,080
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good.

931
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,920
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already tried talking to my men...

932
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but everything about this land has them spooked.

933
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,200
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the strangest creature I've ever seen.

934
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,860
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Percy?!

935
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,810
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, Percy! Come here!

936
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,040
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meeko, come back!

937
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,540
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see what I mean?

938
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,880
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.

939
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,310
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come Come here, both of you!

940
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,210
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend!

941
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,550
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

942
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,650
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? Meeko! - Percy, get back here!

943
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,990
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Stop that!

944
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,520
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, that's enough!

945
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,830
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's enough to make your sap boil.

946
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,970
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now then, there's something I want to show you. Look.

947
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,970
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ripples.

948
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,210
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about them?

949
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,340
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So small at first,

950
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:34,050
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then look how they grow.

951
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,820
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But someone has to start them.

952
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,330
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not going to listen to us.

953
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,660
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young man, sometimes the right path

954
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,490
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is not the easiest one.

955
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,530
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see? Only when the fighting stops...

956
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:50,560
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can you be together.

957
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,430
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's go talk to your father.

958
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,910
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kocoum! No!

959
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,980
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kocoum!

960
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,960
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him alone!

961
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,940
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kocoum! Stop!

962
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,280
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both eyes open.

963
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,460
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thomas! - Is he...

964
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,360
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You killed him.

965
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,370
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought that... - Get away from him!

966
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,490
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only...

967
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,800
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He killed him!

968
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,640
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thomas, get out of here!

969
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

970
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,010
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who did this?

971
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,140
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocahontas was out in the woods.

972
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:47,840
{\fnCandara\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked him.
