1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,530
Stealing Han's dishes,so we don't
have to clean our at home is genius.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,990
And a little sad.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,170
You kidding? This is the greatest thing that's
happened to me since I got my period this morning.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,210
Max,Caroline,you're stealing my dishes?

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,750
Damn it,I didn't think
you could see up this high.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,580
And I didn't think you
could sink this low.

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,120
Okay,stop,you're already robbing me
blind with your "I'm a waitress" scam.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,480
Sorry,but things have
gotten kind of messy at home.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,380
Yesterday,I had to take a shower
to shower off the shower I took.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
You two should get a cleaning lady.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,270
I have a woman I pay
to clean my apartment.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,010
She is expensive,but she may charge you
less if you don't also have sex on her.

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,350
I'll look into it.

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,730
My grandmother cleaned
the house free of charge.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,370
Of course she didn't
have a say in the matter.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,140
Let's just ask Sophie.
She has a cleaning service.

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,440
We have to do something.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,820
Yesterday,I saw a roach
walk out of our apartment.

19
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,470
Look.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,880
I'm gonna tell you what I told that guy who
asked me to use my butt to smuggle opium.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,500
I'll do it!

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,550

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,880
Be ready,Max.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,250
We have to leave as soon as
the cleaning lady gets here.

27
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,600
It's housekeeper etiquette.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,950
In my old life,I go to spin class and lunch
with friends,but you and I will just go outside

29
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,540
and watch the guy who just got out
of jail do pull-ups on the light post.

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,360
Calvin's out?

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm not gonna leave.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,150
I want to watch her clean up my mess.

33
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,970
Yeah,baby.

34
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,590
I've waited my whole
life to have a servant.

35
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,370
I thought you were gonna be it for the first few
weeks and then I realized you can't do anything.

36
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,730
And even though Sophie gave us a discount,the
maid still has to call me "Your Highness."

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,930
Mostly because I'm pretty
"highness" right now.

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,700
Hi,girls.

39
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,510
Here I am.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,340
Sophie from Sophie's
Choice Cleaning Service.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,940
Meet your cleaning lady Paulina.

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,670
Paulina,meet the girls.

43
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,400
She'd shake hands,but
she only has one arm.

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,200
Sophie,she can hear you.

45
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,090
So what? I know I'm missing arm.

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,030
It's not news.

47
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,910
So she lost an arm.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,240
I lost my gold earring
down the garbage disposal

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,190
but I was too afraid to reach
into it because,well,yeah.

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,590
Don't worry.

51
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,780
I have one arm but I
clean like I have three.

52
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,890
I put on more makeup,then I start.

53
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,540
I'm sorry. I didn't realize when I ordered a cleaning
lady I had to specify I wanted one with two arms.

54
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,090
You can't afford two arms.

55
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,270
You said you wanted a good price.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,830
Half the arms,half the price.

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,210
Is that how she lost the arm,Sophie?

58
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,800
You cut it off so we
could get a discount?

59
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,510
Oh,yeah,sure. Yeah,I sawed off her
arm so I could save you 10 bucks.

60
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,080
I start in bedroom.

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,900
Wait,before you do,one question.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,490
How'd you lose it?
James Franco situation?

63
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,530
You had to cut it off to get loose?

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,700
You're not saying no.

65
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh,you know what,let's not go there.

66
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,700
You know,it happened,it was in the past.

67
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,990
I was trapped under this big truck.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
We get it.

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,240
I drove over your arm.

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,990
Hey,don't even bother looking for my good jewelry
in there because I'm already wearing all of it.

71
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,530
Oh,I'm jealous I don't have
arm to wear cheap jewelry.

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,500
Max,I feel bad for her.
See? This is why you leave.

73
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,710
In case they show up with too
much makeup and not enough arms.

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,290
Relax,she's tough.
Reminds me of a young me.

75
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,910
Which means I better go
hide my pills from her.

76
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,520
Max,she scares me.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,940
<i>Oh,come on,she's armless.</i>

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,520
Everything okay? You need any help?

79
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,520
I didn't get this far in
this business by taking help.

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,090
Help me! Can't you see I got one arm?

81
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,690
Not gonna be a problem.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,760
I would occasionally help my maid...

83
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,380
- You're not interested.
- Lift!

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,010
Lift,weak girl. Lift.

85
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,160
Max,come here. We need
help lifting your mattress.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,620
<i>Can you give us a hand?</i>

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,390
No! Leave it alone! Leave it
alone! Don't lift up the mattress!

88
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,620
Porno.

89
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,330
Your mind is as dirty as your apartment!

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,950
Yes,it's porn. So what?
What's the big deal?

91
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,150
It's just the body in its natural
form,spread-eagle on a motorcycle.

92
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,870
Why is so much of it from the '80s?

93
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,190
I like mustaches,okay?

94
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,940
And it's multitasking.
I'm looking for my father.

95
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,210
Stop looking. Stop looking right now.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,770
Why are you suddenly embarrassed?
Porn hub is your homepage.

97
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,360
Hey,is this a brochure
for pastry school?

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,160
Why are you hiding a
pastry school brochure?

99
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,880
Your face is a pastry school brochure!

100
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,330
Max,it's great you're
interested in pastry school.

101
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,570
- I don't know why you're embarrassed.
- Your face is embarrassed!

102
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,280
Come on,I really think that this
is something we should talk about.

103
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,730
Your face is something
we should talk about!

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,090
You made the scary one mad.

105
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,860
That was dumb move.

106
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,160
Your face was a dumb move!

107
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,330
Max?

108
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,740
Max,you never came home after you
stormed out,so I brought you your uniform.

109
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,000
Max?

110
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,400
I live here now.

111
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,690
My new roommates,the broom and the
mop,don't sneak around looking at my stuff.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,520
I got everything I need.

113
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,600
Whiskey,toothbrush,toothpaste.

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,640
<i>Well,maybe your new broommatewill hold
back your hair when you drink too much.</i>

115
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,350
Which,from the looks of
it,will be in about an hour.

116
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,040
Max,we really need to
talk about this brochure.

117
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,410
Look,just because I have a pastry school brochure
doesn't mean I'm actually gonna go to pastry school.

118
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,260
Just like having those porn magazines doesn't
mean I'm actually gonna ride around on a tiger

119
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,460
performing unspeakable
acts with sailors,probably.

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,090
Pastry school is the same as porn.

121
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,620
It's just a dumb fantasy.

122
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,520
Pastry school is not like porn.

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,040
There is nothing in this brochure
about a girl-on-girl croissant.

124
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,760
That's good toothpaste.

125
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,350
Please stop brushing your teeth.
We have a shift to do later.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,580
Okay,the Manhattan school of pastry...

127
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,950
Your face is the
Manhattan school of pastry.

128
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,990
You know it isn't.

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,450
Max,you could go here for real.

130
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,020
Tuition is only $3,000
a year. A lot,but doable.

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,690
"A lot but doable?"

132
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,340
Are we talking about pastry
school or fat guy at last call?

133
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,630
Here we are,Max. Your dream starts now.

134
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,610
What,the one where I'm a black mermaid?

135
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,620
Would you relax? We're just gonna
look around and get an application.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,330
See all that gorgeous equipment
you get to use if you went here?

137
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,530
Finally you'd have a mixing bowl
that's not a hollowed-out watermelon.

138
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,290
Can you help me? She's
holding me against my will.

139
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,940
She's kidding.

140
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,400
If you keep this up,young lady,you
are not getting ice cream after.

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,460
Fine!

142
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,740
- Come on,here's the office.
- Whatever. Are we almost done here?

143
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,860
I got a court date later.

144
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,270
I'm not sure we're in the right place.

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,720
Are any of us,really?

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,610
We'd like an application.
Could you help us?

147
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,880
Oh,God,I hope so.

148
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,300
I wasn't expecting something this
high-pressure my first day back.

149
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,600
Let's just say I've been under
observation at the nuthouse.

150
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,780
Okay,application.

151
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,630
It's for Max,here. She was
very impressed by your brochure.

152
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,350
Oh,pastry school. Exciting,right?

153
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,130
I was a chef here
once. And then I wasn't.

154
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,550
Oh,look. Found the application.

155
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,550
Really didn't think I was
gonna be able to handle that.

156
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,380
Bebe,if you...

157
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,330
<i>Bonjour. Good morning.</i>

158
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,010
Chef Nicolas,these girls
are here for an application.

159
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't worry,I handled it.
Almost didn't,then I did.

160
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,720
Nice work,Bebe.

161
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,370
<i>Oh,do I detect a French accent? Oui?</i>

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,620
Oh,my God,I can't watch.

163
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,020
<i>French,indeed. I'm chef Nicolas
Saintcroix,owner and head chef. Bienvenue.</i>

164
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,150
Caroline Channing.

165
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,720
Is it over yet?

166
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,050
This is Max. The application's for her.

167
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,360
'Sup,Frenchie? You eat snails?

168
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,550
It looks like Bebe
forgot the second page.

169
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,510
Oh,boy,forgot the second
page. That's not good.

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,820
I thought I handled
it. Didn't handle it.

171
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,550
It's okay,Bebe. Breathe in.

172
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,460
Breathe out.

173
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,480
That's good stuff.

174
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,090
She was quite brilliant.

175
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,290
Then she wasn't.

176
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,360
Here. Fill that out. And the
next step is the pastry exam.

177
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,340
Applicants will have to make a classic
tart,bring them in tomorrow for me to taste,

178
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,050
and we will go from there. Sound good?

179
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,860
Whatever. Maybe I'll think about it.

180
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay,well,maybe you will.
Nice meeting you both.

181
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,900
Hope to see you tomorrow,chef.

182
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,120
He called me chef!

183
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,410
- Yay! Let's go get ice cream!
- No!

184
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,270
You should get started on
that tart. It's due tomorrow.

185
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,520
I got plenty of time.
Besides,pressure ups my game.

186
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,340
I perform my best when
there's a gun to my head.

187
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,330
Ask any of my ex-boyfriends.

188
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,990
This is so not how I prepare for tests.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,680
I studied three weeks for a pap smear.

190
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,520
Don't worry,I got this.

191
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,160
A tart's just like a cookie
with some pudding on it,right?

192
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,600
Max,what is going on in here?

193
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,810
Turns out a tart's more than a
cookie with some pudding on it!

194
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,620
You've been in here six
hours. You said you had this.

195
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,260
I thought I had this! Turns out I
don't! I haven't even finished a shell.

196
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,950
I didn't know there was a shell.
Did you know there was a shell?

197
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,110
Everybody knows there's a shell!

198
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,570
What the shell is wrong with you?

199
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,210
I'm a tart who can't make a tart!

200
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,030
You could've made nine shells by now.

201
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,540
I did. They're all in here. Look.

202
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,570
<i>It's like Shell-mageddon!</i>

203
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,230
Oh,screw it. This one's
gonna be there in a minute.

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
Let's just get it over with.

205
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,630
No,you can do this. Here. Here.
This still looks ready to go.

206
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,500
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm a waste of two arms.

207
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,980
I can't make a tart!

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,010
How's the tart coming?

209
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,220
Han,you're not safe. Leave.

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,140
You haven't even finished the
shell? That's the easiest part!

211
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,970
Han,this is your face.

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,090
Well,I should get going.

213
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,230
<i>I didn't know she could
take bitch to the next level.</i>

214
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,730
I am so screwed!

215
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,230
I finally found a situation
my boobs can't get me out of!

216
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,640
Hey,Max. Now,I have all the
faith in the world in you.

217
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,540
<i>But here's a tart from Stop 'n Shop
in case you wanted to hand this one in.</i>

218
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,970
No,Earl. Max is not a cheater.

219
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,850
Since when?

220
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,030
She is going to make her own tart.

221
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,940
You,out.

222
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,030
I am never gonna make this shell. I
can't even get it in the pan right.

223
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,940
Max,that looks right.

224
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,820
Oh,my God! I got it in the
pan right! I can do this!

225
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,990
You did it! I knew it! I
helped you. We're besties.

226
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,670
You're not safe. Leave.

227
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,430
I'm telling you,Max,I've tasted a
lot of tarts,and yours is delicious.

228
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,140
You are not the first
man to tell me that.

229
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,180
The first man to tell
me that is in jail.

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,050
Here he comes. Look
at him. Here he comes.

231
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,710
Afternoon,ladies.

232
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,960
<i>Bien fondue,Eiffel Tower.</i>

233
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,350
Okay.

234
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,440
Thank you for coming.
Shall we begin the tasting?

235
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,870
This is exciting?

236
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,300
Keep it in your pants.

237
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,070
And now for the tart.

238
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,420
It's Max's first ever.

239
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,970
I ate a slice earlier and it was
like Having a little piece of heaven.

240
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,090
Don't do anything you're doing.

241
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,010
It's flaky,creamy...

242
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,010
For a first attempt,I am very impressed.

243
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,240
Don't be. I made a tart.

244
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,260
It's not like I cured herpes or invented a
reverse microwave to instantly chill sodas.

245
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,390
Okay,Max.

246
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,630
I will talk it over with my
faculty and we will let you know.

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,930
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

248
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,680
Nailed that.

249
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,240
Max!

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,280
Stop stealing my things!
You got a cleaning lady!

251
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,910
Relax. I am returning what I took.

252
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,210
Here's your plates.

253
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,150
Oh,and here's your ATM card.
I lifted it from your wallet.

254
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,650
Oh,and here's your wallet.

255
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,610
There was $40 in here.

256
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,300
There sure was.

257
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,940
At least give me back my
gift card from Sephora.

258
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,520
Caroline,Han wants his
Sephora gift card back.

259
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,450
Oh,that's not happening.
It's already on my face.

260
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,490
- Max,look,it's from the pastry school.
-  My acceptance letter!

261
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,020
Lot of people talking about
my chili in that bathroom.

262
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
Oleg,come here. Han,Earl,stay.

263
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,400
You guys are about to owe me big.

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,330
I am gonna let you witness
something extremely rare.

265
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,470
More rare than a sighting of
Bigfoot or a UFO or Han's penis.

266
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,830
You held me here so I could hear that?

267
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,870
Behold,the rarest sight of them all.

268
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,990
You are about to see something
good actually happen to me.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
Listen to this.

270
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:27,540
"Dear Ms. Black,after careful consideration"of our
large pool of applicants,we regret to inform you..."

271
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,350
Oh,I guess I didn't get in.

272
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,940
Looking back,we probably should have
insisted she read that to herself,first.

273
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,850
I know why she didn't get in. Her name.

274
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,810
They saw the word "Black"
and stopped reading.

275
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,590
That's why I didn't get into law school.

276
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,990
I also didn't apply.

277
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,010
This is terrible. I'm
gonna go see if she's okay.

278
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,330
Who does that French frog think he is?

279
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,950
He thinks he can have the time of his life
tasting my tart and then never see me again?

280
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,210
He won't let me into his school?

281
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,110
Well,I won't take no for an answer.

282
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,280
I am going down there right now
and giving him a piece of my mind.

283
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,130
I am storming out.

284
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,240
And I am storming back in.

285
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,460
It is dark outside.
That school's not open.

286
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,990
Hey,you. Tart tease,we need a word.

287
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,760
Oh,boy.

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,630
What? You love my pastries

289
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,520
and then regret to inform me I'm
not good enough for your school?

290
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,600
Well,I regret to inform you that I am good enough
and I want to know why you won't let me in here.

291
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Okay,your voice is an
anxiety trigger for me.

292
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,390
I'm going to have to remove myself from
the situation and go sit in the hallway.

293
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,300
Can you come with me? You
have a very calming presence.

294
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,340
Thank you. So few people
think that about me.

295
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,630
But I should stay with Max.

296
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,660
No,I got this handled. You can have her.

297
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,250
This is the last time
you give me to someone.

298
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:07,460
Max,your tart was excellent.
The problem was your attitude.

299
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,140
You showed no passion of
wanting to be in this school.

300
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,760
And that is why you didn't get in.
It seemed like you didn't want it.

301
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,490
No,no,no,that's just my attitude.

302
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,800
I act like I don't want anything
because I never got anything I wanted.

303
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,220
But I do want to go to this school
more than I've ever wanted anything.

304
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,380
It's my fantasy and my dream,and please stop
making me use these horrible,horrible words!

305
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,340
Just let me in,okay?

306
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,500
Okay.

307
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,620
Wait,for real?

308
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,720
Yes. I needed to see if your passion was as good
as your pastry and you just showed me it was.

309
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,900
I'm thrilled to have you on board,chef.

310
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,360
Thanks,chef.

311
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,740
Bebe is having a panic attack
and needs to hold her lemon.

312
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,700
Has anyone seen her lemon?

313
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,080
Caroline,he let me in.
I'm going to pastry school.

314
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,100
Everybody has to call me "chef" now!

315
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,430
You did it,chef!

316
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,600
You're going to the pastry
school from the brochure!

317
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,120
Aren't you glad I looked at your porn?

318
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,960
<i>We're roommates. Both
single. Quelle surprise.</i>

319
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,350
So Max,once you fill out these,you
will be officially enrolled.

320
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
And of course we will
need your tuition check.

321
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,900
Yup. $3,000. It's a lot for us.

322
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,640
But if we make some
cutbacks,1/2-ply toilet paper.

323
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,290
Who am I kidding? No
toilet paper,diner napkins.

324
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,380
No,tuition is 24,000.

325
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,900
But the brochure said $3,000 a year.

326
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,600
You misread it. It's $3,000 a unit.

327
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,610
There is eight units per year. 24,000.

328
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,360
It costs $24,000? We can't pay that.

329
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,940
Oh,my God,now I'm never gonna be able to
come here and I just admitted I wanted to!

330
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,780
I take back everything I ever
said about wanting anything.

331
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,470
- Max,you can't just storm out.
- Your face can't just storm out!

332
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,790
Look,I will do anything for
that girl to go to this school.

333
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,990
In exchange for tuition,I
could work in the office.

334
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,630
Bebe clearly needs someone to help take the pressure off and
who better than a mentally stable Wharton graduate like myself?

335
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,610
But I'll do anything. I'll
even wash your floors,okay?

336
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,450
Although I'm sure there's
something better than that.

337
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,410
But if you need me to wash the
floors,I will wash the floors.

338
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,210
Really would prefer to do anything else,but I'll do
it,'cause I'll do anything to get her into this school.

339
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,080
Please no floors.

340
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay,I will talk it over with
my staff and I will let you know.

341
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,330
Oh,no,no.

342
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,850
I've seen what happens when you
give people the "I'll let you know."

343
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,440
I'm not going anywhere until
you let me know to my face.

344
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,020
With your face. Your
beautiful,beautiful face.

345
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,820
Max,we're not poor enough?

346
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,280
You're starting a hobo
trash fire in our apartment?

347
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,500
Yup. I'm burning my porn
and pastry school brochure.

348
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,610
You know,all my fantasies.

349
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,070
If I learned anything in life it's that
nothing's more flammable than my dreams.

350
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,110
- Are those my slipper socks in there?
- Yeah,those needed to die too.

351
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,660
Well,while you were in our living
room hosting a burning man festival,

352
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,700
I was at the pastry school getting
us a work-study arrangement.

353
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,330
And...

354
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,960
- You're going to pastry school.
- No way!

355
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,320
Here you go. Your school uniform.

356
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,370
This is where my name's gonna go!

357
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,280
My chef name,Conchita Bonfire.

358
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,400
Thank you for this.

359
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,830
And for everything.

360
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,790
You don't have to thank me.

361
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,520
'Cause with your new skills I'm
gonna use you like Kim uses Kanye.

362
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,280
Or Kanye uses Kim. I'm not
sure which of them is winning.

363
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,790
What kind of work-study
arrangement did you make for me?

364
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,870
It's more of a work-study
arrangement for us.

365
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,680
I'll be working in the office helping
out Bebe,so I'm working,you're studying.

366
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,400
You're working at my school? Mom!

367
