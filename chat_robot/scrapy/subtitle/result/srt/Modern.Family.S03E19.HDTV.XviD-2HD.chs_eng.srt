1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:03,376
邓菲女议员  请问你如何回应
Councilwoman Dunphy, how do you respond

2
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:06,675
外界认为你穿着新套装性感非凡的观点
to allegations that you look super sexy in your new suit?

3
00:00:06,725 --> 00:00:08,580
我还没当选呢
Uh, I haven't been elected yet.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,740
快点  孩子们  我们得去投票了
Come on, kids! We gotta vote!

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,185
-亲爱的  拜托你别拍了  -人家太兴奋了嘛
- Honey, come on. Please stop filming. - I'm just excited!

6
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:16,646
从今以后  你就要当上女议员了
After today, you are going to be a councilwoman,

7
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:18,842
而我则会成为第一丈夫
and I am going to be a first husband.

8
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,145
你要是再不停拍
And if you don't stop filming,

9
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:21,977
你就将成为我的前一任丈夫了
you're going to be my first husband.

10
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:23,326
好了  大伙儿都赶紧的
All right, everybody, come on!

11
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:24,846
你们记住自己的职责了吗  孩子们
Do you know what you're doing, kids?

12
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:27,046
你们几个负责电话银行[电话联络选民拉票]
You guys are manning the phone banks.

13
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:28,210
艾丽克斯  你是他们的头儿
Alex, you're in charge of that.

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,962
凭什么该她当头儿啊  什么是电话银行啊
Wh-why is she in charge? And what's--what's a phone bank?

15
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,130
这就是原因
That's why.

16
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,252
-菲尔  -我知道
- Phil. - I got it.

17
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:36,259
我负责接送50名十佳老人去投票站  
I will be driving 50 of our finest senior citizens to the polls,

18
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,436
当然  前提是  他们还能记得这件事
assuming, of course, that they remember that I'm coming for them.

19
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,156
-"你这是在哪儿呀"  -说得好
- Where you at? - High-five.

20
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,156
老年人就爱忘事
Old people occasionally forget things.

21
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:43,638
好了  各位  我们出发吧  出发吧
Okay. All right, everybody, let's go. Let's go.

22
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:44,926
等等等等等等  马上就好
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Real quick!

23
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:47,706
抱歉  大家都围过来  快点
Sorry. Everybody get in there. Jump in there.

24
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,606
我要说的是  我们为你倍感骄傲
I just want to say how proud of you we all are.

25
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:52,456
你就是鼓舞人心的榜样
You're an inspiration.

26
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:53,925
谁能想到20年前
Who would have thought that 20 years ago

27
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,452
当你正值青春大好年华时
when you were still in the bloom of your youth--

28
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,668
够了  我要去开车了
Okay, I'm gonna go start the car.

29
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,126
克莱尔喜欢争强好胜
Claire likes to win.

30
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,276
她8岁时  一个参加女童子军的朋友
When she was 8, a little girl scout friend of hers

31
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:03,486
吹嘘自己能卖出最多的饼干
bragged she could sell the most cookies.

32
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,436
结果克莱尔挨家挨户推销
Damn if Claire didn't walk the neighborhood

33
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:08,826
走到脚板起泡  比她多卖了10盒饼干
till she got blisters on her feet and won by ten boxes.

34
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:10,116
最精彩之处是
Best part is

35
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:12,739
克莱尔甚至都不是女童子军
Claire wasn't even a girl scout.

36
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,086
克莱尔  您的用心之选
The choice is Claire!

37
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,412
镇议员选举  请投克莱尔・邓菲一票
Vote Claire Dunphy for town council.

38
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,076
爱死这个了
Aw, I love it!

39
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,594
-怎么样  -我太喜欢了
- What do you think, huh? - I love it.

40
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:26,496
我们从克莱格分类广告网站上买的
We got it on Craigslist.

41
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:31,312
原本是小贩吆喝玉米饼的
Came off a taco truck.


42
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:32,091
-真的  -我很感激你们为我做的一切
- It did. - I love that you're doing this for me.

43
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,846
-多谢了  -没事
- Thank you! - You're welcome.

44
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:36,541
我知道克莱尔把输赢看得有多重要
I know how important winning is to Claire.

45
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,405
而我又喜欢装饰打扮
And I love to festoon things.

46
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:39,526
我们就是她的梦之队
We're her dream team.

47
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,495
所以我们专门腾出今天  送莉莉去学校后
So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily off at school,

48
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:42,866
马上就去投票了
and voted first thing.

49
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,866
尽管某人"基"情爆发  难以自控
Although, uh, one of us had a bit of a dimpled chad situation.

50
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,776
能请你再演示一次如何使用这机器吗  基德
Can you tell me how this machine works again, Chad?

51
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,653
当然  没问题
Oh, sure. No problem.

52
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:54,319
我就看一眼  就看一眼
Just wanna look in here. Just--

59
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:05,016
摩登家庭
第三季 第十九集

60
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:08,435
谢了  谢了
Thank you. Thank you.

61
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,775
-再见  再见  -有劳了各位
- Bye! Bye!- Thank you, guys!

62
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:14,166
我"克"以肯定杜恩输定了
I can see Clairely now that Duane is gone.

63
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,430
再见  谢了  我的妈呀
Bye! Thank you! Oh, my gosh.

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,218
行了  大伙儿快上车  出发  出发
Okay, everybody, get in the car. Let's go. Let's go.

65
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:20,420
祝你好运  克莱尔
Good luck today, Claire.

66
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,086
劳莉  谢谢你
Oh, Laurie, thank you.

67
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:24,797
随带一提  我们家有天大的好消息
Hey, by the way, we have some really good news.

68
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,966
-怎么了  -贝琦被俄勒冈州大学录取了
- What's that? - Becky got into the University of Oregon.

69
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,846
恭喜了
Oh, congratulations!

70
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,035
你有什么消息吗  海莉
Any news, Haley?

71
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,576
暂  暂时还  还没有
Uh, uh, no, not-- not yet,

72
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:33,846
不过  真为你感到开心呢
but, you know, super psyched!

73
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,096
等待录取的过程就如同一场噩梦
This whole waiting-to-hear thing has been a nightmare

74
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,206
从收到第一封回信开始就缠绕着我
since the very first letter.

75
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,103
我太紧张了  我不敢看
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.

76
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,406
亲爱的邓菲小姐
"Dear miss Dunphy,

77
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,415
我们抱歉地通知你
we regret to inform you..."

78
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,156
然后呢  别吊我胃口啊
What?! Don't leave me hanging!

79
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,675
从那以后  我决定只把好消息带回家
After that, I decided to only tell my parents good news.

80
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,636
就只剩一所学校没回信了
I have one school left,

81
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,966
而我唯一收到的好消息
and the only good news I've gotten

82
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:00,265
就是我那烦死人的邻居贝琦
is that my annoying neighbor Becky

83
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,390
要搬去俄勒冈了
is moving back east to Oregon.

84
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,136
-曼尼  拿笔记下来  -我身上没带笔
- Manny, write this down. - I didn't bring a pen.

85
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,216
选举日就是美国最辉煌的时刻
Election day is America at its finest.

86
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,646
人民当家做主  政府俯首听命
The people speak, and the government listens.

87
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:11,916
我不知道你们哥伦比亚是怎么运作的
I don't know what they do in Colombia.

88
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,186
鬼才晓得  别问了
No one does, and don't ask.

89
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,706
虽说投票本身就是一项特权
I mean, we know that voting's a privilege,

90
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,726
可当选票上出现我女儿的名字时
but for my daughter to have her name on that ballot,

91
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,900
意义就特别重大了
it just means so much more--

92
00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:21,946
算了  我还是晚点再投票吧
You know what? I think I'm gonna vote later.

93
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,216
为什么  你要去哪里啊
What? Where are you going?

94
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,985
队伍排太长了
Ah, the line is too long.

95
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,246
就3个人而已  而且又没人带枪
It's only three people! And nobody has a gun!


97
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,806
我们在这里  我叫克莱尔
We're here, we're Claire,

98
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:34,506
接受这个事实吧
get used to it!

99
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,056
我不确定那口号能让人记得住
You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking.

100
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:38,635
来  让我试一试
Here, let me try one.

101
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:42,726
无需千里眼  也"克"看出"莱"该选谁
You don't have to be Clairevoyant to know who to vote for.

102
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,236
镇议员选举  请投邓菲一票
Vote Dunphy for town council.

103
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:47,296
是克莱尔・邓菲
Uh, uh, uh, Claire Dunphy.

104
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,426
她名叫克莱尔
Uh, C-Caire's her first name.

105
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,776
抱歉我说得不太清"克"[楚]
I'm sorry if that wasn't Claire.

106
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:55,166
我的天  你看  明明眼前就是垃圾桶
Oh, my God. Look at that. There's a trash can right there,

107
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:57,886
那男的还随手乱丢废纸
and that guy just threw his paper on the sidewalk.

108
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,196
喂  穿黄夹克的那个
Hey! You in the yellow jacket.

109
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:02,706
捡起来  丢进垃圾桶里
Pick it up and put it in the trash.

110
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,896
-我的妈呀  他还真照做了  -是的
- Oh, my God. He did it. - Yes, he did.

111
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:11,196
来  让我试一下
Ooh, here. Let me try one.I'll try...

112
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:14,006
喂  龙纹身的女孩  不要随意乱穿马路
Hey, dragon tattoo, no jaywalking!

113
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,265
亲娘啊
oh, my gosh.

114
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,406
小喇叭真有威力
This is an instrument of power.

115
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,176
用来卖玉米饼怎么就不畅销呢
How could they not sell tacos?

116
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,746
你知道我们可以怎样利用这玩意吗
You know what we could do with this thing?

117
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,365
小卡  我们绝对可以造福社会啊
Cam, we could really make a difference.

118
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,876
我们可以化身为"改变之声"
We could be the voice of change.

119
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,216
我懂了
Ooh, I got it!

120
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,353
立刻去那家弄丢我衬衫的干洗店吼吼看
Let's go yell at the dry cleaner that lost my shirt.

121
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:31,966
快过来  伙伴
Come on, gang.

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,651
今天邓菲一家要全力出击
Today is the Dunphys at their best.

123
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,945
我是《每周救星》报的记者  介意我
I'm from the "Weekly Saver." Mind if I ask you

124
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:43,396
-问几个有关选举的问题吗  -随便问
- a couple questions about the big election? - Not at all.

125
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,414
向我开炮吧
Fire away.

126
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,766
你今天会投谁一票呢
Who are you voting for today?

127
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,166
克莱尔・邓菲
Claire Dunphy.

128
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,156
总算听到有人提这名字了
Finally. I've been waiting for someone to say that name.

129
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,166
为什么
Why?

130
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,636
因为在下就是克莱尔・邓菲
Uh... Because I am Claire Dunphy.

131
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:56,556
抱歉  我是从广告营销部调过来的
Oh, sorry. They moved me over from ad sales.

132
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:57,576
我们轮流报道新闻
We take turns reporting.

133
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:59,316
你对于今天的胜算有多大把握
How do you feel about your chances today?

134
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,232
比我几分钟之前预想的要差了很多
Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.

135
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:02,636
不  她信心满满
No, she feels great.

136
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:05,456
志在必得  全家人都志在必得
Um, her spirits are high. The whole family's high.

137
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,216
-拿去编头条新闻吧  -菲尔  别
- There's your headline. - Phil, no.

138
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,456
来张全家福怎么样
Uh, how about a photo of all of you?

139
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,400
-当然没问题  -妈妈  标签
- Yeah. Sure. Yes. - Mom, mom, mom. Tag.

140
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,446
-衣服标签还在呢  -我的天
- Tag's still on. - Oh, my Goodness.

141
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,025
谢了
Thank you.

142
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,100
不然拍照可就尴尬了  好
That would have been a really awkward picture. Okay.

143
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:18,716
天啊
No!

144
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,466
那是什么啊
What is that?

145
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,395
是牙齿吗
Is that a tooth?

146
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,866
-好恶  -太强悍了
- Ew! - Awesome!

147
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,010
你都多大了
How old are you? No!

148
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,641
-再来一次  -怎么会这样啊
- Do it again! - How does that even happen?

149
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,374
以前溜冰时摔的  就装了颗假牙
It's a-a fake tooth from an old ice-skating injury.

150
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,446
-现在松脱了  -天呐  干嘛非得是今天啊
- It just fell out. - Oh, my gosh. Why today?!

151
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,096
-怎么办啊  -别大惊小怪
- What about the... - Let's not overreact.

152
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,906
-让我看看  -好吧  好
- Let's--let me see it. - Okay. All right.

153
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,969
拍好了  谢谢
Got it. Thanks.

154
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:42,603
你刚刚怎么了
What happened back there?

155
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,513
太多人排队  我懒得等
Line was too long. I couldn't wait.

156
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:47,433
你买冰沙还等过45分钟呢
I've seen you wait 45 minutes in line for sherbet!

157
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,503
那是因为我喜欢吃冰沙  行吗
Well, I happen to like sherbet, okay?

158
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:50,823
我带你去的那地方
That place I take you

159
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:52,452
有全西海岸最好吃的冰沙
has the greatest sherbet on the west coast.

160
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,282
他们有柠檬冰沙  椰子冰沙
They got lime sherbet, they got coconut sherbet.

161
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:56,373
怎么聊到冰沙去了
Why are we talking about sherbet?

162
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,713
他明显是在转移话题
He's clearly changing the subject.

163
00:05:57,763 --> 00:05:58,823
你怎么没上学啊
Why aren't you in school?

164
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:00,303
他又转移话题了
He's doing it again.

165
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,863
曼尼说得对  你就像只"阿迪亚"
Manny's right. You're being very ardilla.

166
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,853
-"阿迪亚"  -没错  就是那种
- "Ardilla"? - Yeah, you know, the--

167
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:06,533
就是那什么
The one that--that--

168
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,902
-兔子吗  我像兔子吗  -不  不是
- Rabbit? I was being rabbit-y? - No, another one

169
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,803
-是大脸蛋  大尾巴的  -花栗鼠吗
- With the cheeks and the tail and... - Chipmunk?

170
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,863
-负鼠吗  -她说的明显是松鼠
- Possum? -Okay, obviously she means squirrel.

171
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,963
你之前"古怪如松鼠"
You were being squirrely then,

172
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,703
-现在也是"古怪如松鼠"  -总比像老鼠好
- You're being squirrely now. - Better than being a rat.

173
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,926
曼尼  让我和他谈谈
Manny, give us a minute.

174
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,653
当然好  我毫不费力就戳穿了他
Oh, sure. I served him up on a silver platter.

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,653
怎么了
What?

176
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:28,591
好吧  没什么大不了的
All right, it's no big deal.

177
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,402
有个女人在那儿工作
There was a woman working there.

178
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:31,773
我不想让她见到我
I didn't want her to see me.

179
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,423
-她是谁  -她叫多蒂
- Who is she? - Her name is Dottie.

180
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,182
她是我离婚后的第一任女友
She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.

181
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:38,032
你跟迪迪离婚后勾搭上了多蒂
You dated a Dottie after Dede?

182
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:39,503
你搞错重点了
Y-you're focusing on the wrong thing here.

183
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:41,613
重点是  我和她不是好聚好散的
The--the point is it ended badly.

184
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:44,228
我试图和平分手  可是
I tried to let her down easy, but, uh,

185
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,043
她没能坦然接受
she didn't take it too well.

186
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,333
其实  我也不知道她是怎么接受的
Actually, I don't know how she took it,

187
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,081
因为我没看见
'cause I wasn't there.

188
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,223
我们谈了几周恋爱  然后就  你懂的
We dated a few weeks, then after we... You know,

189
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,542
我趁她没醒  从她家偷偷溜了
I slipped out of her house before she woke up

190
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,983
再也没联系过她
and never called her again.

191
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,503
我把裤子扔在她家院子  把汽车挂的空挡
Put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral,

192
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,462
使之缓缓驶出车道  车灯都没敢打开
let it roll down the driveway, lights off.

193
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,553
哎呀  可耻历史我说不下去了
Hey, I can't talk about this anymore.

194
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:04,433
所以就因为那个女人
So because of this woman,

195
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,433
你没给你女儿投票
you didn't vote for your daughter?

196
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,953
那是克莱尔啊  我们要让她赢
It's Claire! We need her to win!

197
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,993
我可不希望她肺都气炸掉  把怒火都撒在我们头上
I don't want to be around when something that tight comes unraveled.

198
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:13,112
我会想办法的
I'll figure out something.

199
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:14,882
也许工作人员是轮班的
Maybe those poll workers take shifts.

200
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:17,853
别胆小地躲在自己的窝里
Stop hiding in your little cave like a--

201
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,923
像那啥一样  那什么...
Like, you know. Like the-- the--the--

202
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,212
-别再让我猜了  -不是
- I really don't wanna do this again. - No, the--

203
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,503
不不不  那种大家伙  浑身长毛的
No. No. The big one, like, uh, the monster furry one.

204
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,441
唉  我怎么老是记不住动物名字
Ay, why can't I remember any animal names?

205
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:32,313
欢迎乘坐邓菲快车
Climb aboard the Dunphy Express.

206
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,913
下一站――民主
Next stop--democracy.

207
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:36,022
-别  别  -请留步
- Well--no, no... - Please don't go.

208
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,113
我保证  不再开玩笑了
I won't do that anymore. I promise.

209
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,533
对了  我们半路停一下
Oh. Uh, we need to make a quick stop.

210
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,783
我要取我的新眼镜
I gotta pick up my new glasses.

211
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,413
不行啊  我...
No can do. I, uh...

212
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,183
还有很多人等着我呢
I got a lot of people waitin', so...

213
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,953
就两分钟而已
It'll just take two minutes.

214
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,636
没有眼镜  我连选票都看不清
I can't even see the ballot without my glasses.

215
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,003
我要是投错了票
I mark the wrong box,

216
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:55,100
新一届议会就会叫我和男人结婚了
next thing you know I'll be married to a guy.

217
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,633
允许同性婚姻  不代表强制同性结婚  沃特
Yeah, I-- I don't think it's mandatory, Walt.

218
00:07:57,683 --> 00:08:00,493
我跳舞风度翩翩  基佬们不会放过我的
I'm a good dancer. They'll come for me.

219
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:02,353
必须的
Oh, yeah.

220
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,382
他们会把你的衣服扣子弄坏
They will break all your buttons...

221
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,462
然后说你们送来时就是这样
and say you brought it in that way.

222
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,073
好  快跑  快跑
Okay, go, go, go!

223
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:10,628
世间不平事太多  正好趁机泄私愤
Turns out we had a lot of axes to grind.

224
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,993
而且装备齐全  所以我俩就玩个不停了
And a hybrid, so there was virtually no stopping us.

225
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,023
别看那电影
Do not see that movie!

226
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:18,388
那电影会让你哭笑不得
You will neither laugh nor cry!

227
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,543
"全市最棒披萨"
"Best pizza in the city"?

228
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,623
其实连"全街最棒"都算不上
Not even the best pizza on this street.

229
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,991
宣传照上的发型根本不是在这家店做的
They do not do the hair of the people on those pictures!

230
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,532
"完全免费检查"
"Totally free checking"?

231
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,863
别做梦了
Don't bank on it!

232
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:30,413
好了  刚刚很好玩
Okay, that was really fun,

233
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,583
但我们得回去帮克莱尔拉票了
But now we gotta go back to campaigning for Claire.

234
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,982
这话我们说了两小时了
We've been saying that for two hours.

235
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,973
没错  但现在我是说真的
Yes, but now I-I really mean it.

236
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,043
-天呐  那是桑迪  -桑德拉・布洛克吗[名演员]
- Oh, my god, there's Sandy! - Sandra Bullock?

237
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,293
是啊  桑德拉・布洛克
Yeah, Sandra Bullock.

238
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:41,604
我和她是好朋友  所以我叫她桑迪
We're such good friends, I call her "Sandy," So...

239
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,483
逗你的  是莉莉幼儿园的桑迪啦
No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool.

240
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,422
-她在那儿  -哦  对
- Right there. - Oh, yeah.

241
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,567
-你知道吗  她订婚了  -不是吧
- You know, she got engaged. - No!

242
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,496
-跟她那基佬男友吗  -是啊
- To the gay boyfriend? - Totally.

243
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,405
不是吧  她怎么没看出来啊
Oh, how does she not see it?

244
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:51,583
要是我男朋友也那么帅
If I was with somebody that gorgeous,

245
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,063
我也不会在乎他的"口味"了
I'd overlook a few quirks, too.

246
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,510
首先  谢谢夸奖
First of all, thank you.

247
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,663
其次
Second of all...

248
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,161
说得太有道理了
point well taken.

249
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:59,813
唉  可怜的桑迪啊  真替她伤心
I don't know. Poor Sandy. I feel so bad for her.

250
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,753
-还不如单身一人呢  -是吗
- Well, it's better than being alone. - Is it?

251
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,213
她看过来了
She's looking over here.

252
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:05,033
-我的天呐 -米奇尔  你坐到按钮了
- Oh, my god. - Mitchell, you're sitting on the button.

253
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,647
什么  我没有  没坐到
What? No--no, I'm not. No, I'm not!

254
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,027
它卡住了
The--it's stuck!

255
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:09,053
最后一次是你用的
And you're the one that had it last

256
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:10,862
-你用它向奶酪店喊话  -因为啊
- when you were talking to the cheese shop! - Because you know what?

257
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,236
如果你要推销松露奶酪
If you advertise truffle cheese,

258
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,003
-就要抓住顾客的期望  -你好啊  桑迪
- there are certain expectations... - Hi, Sandy.

259
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,993
我代表克莱尔・邓菲致电给您
Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy.

260
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:21,523
-多美的名字啊  -她曾是普通百姓
- What a beautiful name. - She used to be a citizen.

261
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,377
我代表镇议会候选人克莱尔・邓菲致电给您
I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy for town council.

262
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:25,253
好  要不这样吧
All right. How about this?

263
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,942
如果你投票给克莱尔・邓菲
if you vote for Claire Dunphy...

264
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:30,673
你这辈子都不用交税了
You won't have to pay taxes for the rest of your life.

265
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:32,164
投克莱尔一票
Vote for Claire!

266
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,643
卢克  你这是干嘛
Luke! What are you doing?

267
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:35,602
你不能这么说
You can't say that!

268
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:37,683
政客都是这样的
Oh, like she'd be the first politician

269
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,413
竞选承诺向来不用兑现
to make a promise she can't keep.

270
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:41,882
是吗  也许我也不想跟你说话
Well, maybe I don't want to talk to you, either.

271
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,943
也许是你在烦我
Maybe you are the one that is bothering me!

272
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:45,608
你觉得好受不
How do you like that? Eh?

273
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:49,032
歌洛莉亚  我得再次提醒你
Gloria, I'm gonna have to ask you again

274
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,682
请照着稿子读
to please stick to your script.

275
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:53,313
可是每个人都拒绝我
But everybody's saying no to me!

276
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:54,373
我搞不懂
I don't get it.

277
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,203
平时我叫别人干嘛
Usually when I ask someone to do something,

278
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:57,252
别人就干嘛
they just do it!

279
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,562
也许是因为那些人通过电话无法看到你的美貌
Maybe it's because these people can't see you.

280
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,859
我不喜欢
I don't like it.

281
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:04,323
你不能给我弄个视频电话吗
Can't you just hook me up to some sort of camera?

282
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:06,313
谢谢你  麦琪  谢谢支持
Well, thank you, Maggie, for the vote.

283
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:07,777
好的  再见
Okay. Bye-bye.

284
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,413
请坐在这儿
Here's your seat.

285
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,073
谢谢  请原谅
Thank you. Um, you'll have to excuse me.

286
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:16,793
我有点儿紧张  我从没上过电台
I'm a little nervous. I've never been on the radio before.

287
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:17,923
别担心
Don't worry about it.

288
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:20,253
-就当是聊天好了  -好的
- Just think of it as a conversation. - Okay.

289
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,533
这是耳机  音量控制
Here are your headphones. Volume control.

290
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,513
-别离麦克风太远  -好的
- Don't get too far from the mike. - Okay.

291
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,003
请确认手机关闭
Make sure your cell phone's off.

292
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:27,483
哦  关掉手机  对...  
Oh. Cell phone. Right. Um...

293
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,843
确认下你没在嚼口香糖  对吧
And you're not chewing gum, are you?

294
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,283
没  我没在  只是刚做了些临时性的
No, I'm not. I just had some temporary

295
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:31,953
牙科类小手术
dental work done.

296
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,747
最后我只需要...
The last thing I need--

297
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,213
欢迎回到《时事记录》
And welcome back to "A matter of record."

298
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,173
我是希瑟・范・甘迪
I'm Cecil Van Gundy.

299
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:43,543
今天来到演播室的是来自43区的
Joining us now in studio is district 43

300
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:47,163
镇议会候选人克莱尔・邓菲
town council candidate Claire Dunphy.

301
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,022
谢谢  希瑟
Thank you, Cecil.

302
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,413
很高兴能参加这个节目
It's a pleasure to be here.

303
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:54,703
那么...你本次是首次参选
So... You're a first-time candidate.

304
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,313
跟大家说说你是怎么有这个念头的
Tell us what got you involved.

305
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,503
一切都始于一个...
It all started with a, um...

306
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:00,003
一个停车标志
With a stop sign.

307
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:04,130
我忧心于我家周围的街道安全
I was concerned about safety in our neighbourhood

308
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,763
并且我没有从市政厅得到满意的答复
and I was not getting any satisfaction from city hall.

309
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:10,273
老妈是抽什么风了
What's wrong with mom?

310
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:11,693
哦  这下可不妙
Oh, this isn't good.

311
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,213
她听起来跟醉了一样
She sounds drunk!

312
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,713
你是没听过她喝醉后的声音
That's not her drunk voice.

313
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:17,253
再说说咱们镇上存在的其他问题吧
Tell us about some of the other issues facing our town.

314
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,623
你对本市针对污水和可持续发展的
Where do you stand on the city's

315
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,513
倡议提案持什么样的观点
sewage and sustainability initiative,

316
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:24,013
就是所谓的"污持案"
the so-called S.S.I.?

317
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:25,843
如果我们要讨论
One cannot really talk about

318
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,153
"淤"...淤水和可持续发展的问题
s-s-sewage and sustainability

319
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:31,440
就不得不先探讨...循环利用的问题
without first discussing... recycling.

320
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,452
政府方面可以做得更多...
This city can do more...

321
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,990
-她是想闹哪样  -针对循环利用问题
- What the hell's wrong with her? - with the recycling program...

322
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,133
跟喝醉了一样
She sounds drunk!

323
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:38,510
-当前...  -都是牙给闹的
- ...currently... - It's a tooth thing.

324
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:39,883
怎么了
What's wrong?

325
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,943
氧气快吸完了  天啊
Oh, I'm almost out of air. Oh, boy.

326
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,193
那很要紧吗
Is that serious?

327
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,402
你觉得氧气要紧吗
Is oxygen serious?

328
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,643
说实话  帮你取眼镜耽误了我大把时间
You know what? I lost a ton of time getting your glasses.

329
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:48,903
我还是把你丢家里吧
I'm just gonna drop you at home.

330
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:51,303
你能好好吸氧  我也好去接其他人
You can get your air. I can drive other people.

331
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,273
我家里没有多余的氧气瓶了
I don't have any more tanks at home.

332
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,253
怎么会  你要学会未雨绸缪啊
Why? That seems like bad planning.

333
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,723
我忘记再多订点了
Well, I forgot to order them.

334
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,294
服的药总让我很健忘
My pills make me forget things.

335
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,393
哦  靠  我该吃药了
Oh, shoot! I gotta take my pill!

336
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:02,683
你别告诉我你药也忘带了
Please tell me you have it with you.

337
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,087
当然带着了  但我必须和食物一起服下
Of course I do, but I have to take 'em with food.

338
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,803
-是的吧?  -你问我我问谁去
- Don't I? - Are you asking me?

339
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:08,978
对的  我就是和食物一起服下的
Uh, yes! I do take them with food!

340
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,003
哦  我感觉不大好
Ooh. I don't feel so well.

341
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,753
好的  你要什么我都给你弄来
Okay, I'll get you whatever you want!

342
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:14,873
给你去搞氧气  给你去搞食物
I'll get you the air, I'll get you the food.

343
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:16,553
然后我去给你的醉媳妇儿投上一票
Then I'll vote for your drunk wife.

344
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,863
那可不是她酒醉的声音
That is not her drunk voice!

345
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:21,653
非常感谢你参与投票
Thank you so much for voting.

346

We appreciate it.

347
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,623
嗨非常抱歉打扰下  我是杰・普里契特
Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me. Jay Pritchett.

348
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,473
能不能让我速战速决
Uh, can I get in-- in and out really quick?

349
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:32,233
谢谢  给张选票就成
Thank you. This is all I needed.

350
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:34,736
非常感谢  非常感谢
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

351
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,723

All right. Claire, Claire, Claire.

352
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,813
克莱尔  克莱尔  在这里
Claire, Claire-- ahh, ahh. Here.

353
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,745
抱歉  抱歉  抱歉
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

354
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,410
好啊  多蒂
Hello, Dottie!

355
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,738
杰  见到你可真开心
Jay! It's so nice to see you!

356
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,208
-是吗  -哦  为什么不开心
- Is it? - Oh, why wouldn't it be?

357
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:57,958
都是陈年旧事  过眼云烟了
That was a long time ago. Water under the bridge.

358
00:12:58,008 --> 00:13:00,058
-没关系的  -哦  那就好
- We're good. - Oh, that's great.

359
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,168
非常感谢你参加投票
Thank you so much for voting.

360
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:04,238
还记得我女儿克莱尔吗  她现在...
You remember my daughter Claire. She's--

361
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,748
正在参选镇议会议员
She's running for town council.

362
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,978
-哦  真是不错啊  -我真为她骄傲
- Oh, isn't that neat? - Yeah, I'm so proud.

363
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,008
你该把选票放进去吧
So you're gonna put it in there, huh?

364
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,408
是啊当然  当然要放进去
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. Definitely.

365
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,568
每一票都很重要  是吧
cause every vote counts, you know.

366
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:18,931
非常感谢你能参与投票
Thank you so much for voting.

367
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:20,498
-我说...  -是啊
- You know... - Yeah.

368
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,668
天啊  我要亲眼看到我这宝贵的
Boy, I'd sure like to see the sweet sight

369
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,448
一票...计算在内
of my vote... counting.

370
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,040
我为什么要许诺某事却不履行呢
Why would I say I'd do something and not do it?

371
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,128
我这不就成了个骗子了嘛
That would make me a liar...

372
00:13:30,178 --> 00:13:31,788
我只是个容易轻信别人的寡妇
instead of a trusting widow

373
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,798
曾经睡倒在一个男人温暖的怀抱中
Who fell asleep in the warm embrace

374
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,908
他可答应我  要给我做早餐呢
of a man who promised to make breakfast.

375
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,538
很好  该来的躲不掉
Okay, here it is.

376
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,808
听着  我十分抱歉
Look, I am so sorry.

377
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:43,708
和前妻离婚后你是我遇到的第一个女人
You were the first woman I'd been with besides my ex--

378
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,038
35年的婚姻
35 years.

379
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,258
我慌了手脚
I panicked.

380
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,818
我倒不是说你脱光了就不漂亮
An-and it wasn't 'cause y-you weren't pretty naked

381
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:49,829
或者类似的什么原因
or anything like that.

382
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,359
我要躲着安琪・迪金森啊
I'd have run from Angie Dickinson.

383
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,240
-哦  她可真幸运  -多蒂
- Oh, lucky her. - Dottie--

384
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,856
-回见  杰  -多蒂  多蒂  拜托
- Good-bye, Jay! - Dottie, Dottie, please.

385
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:56,648
我就是想把我的票塞进"洞"
I'm just trying to get my ballot in the box.

386
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:58,218
果然还是老样子
oh, yeah, that sounds familiar.

387
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,958
恩  都不用麻烦你做什么
Yeah, but you don't have to do anything.

388
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,468
让我自己把它"插进去"
Just let me put it in!

389
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,374
我这话听起来真别扭
Uhh. Shouldn't have said that.

390
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,118
我们实在太对不起了
We are so sorry.

391
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:09,068
我们不是故意让你听到那些话的
We did not mean for you to hear any of that.

392
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:09,688
对  其实
Yes, and you know what?

393
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,610
我们一开始就不该八卦你的
We shouldn't have been gossiping in the first place.

394
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,861
万一你们是对的呢
But what if you're right?

395
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,868
格雷戈里就是个同性恋怎么办
What if Gregory is gay?

396
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:16,458
我妈跟我说过  我没敢信她
When my mom said it, I didn't believe her.

397
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:17,208
毕竟她住在爱荷华[允许同性婚姻]
She lives in Iowa.

398
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,446
不过要是你们也这么认为
But coming from you two!

399
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,611
-完全证明不了什么  -对
- Means nothing. - No.

400
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,464
我们对你的未婚夫一无所知
We barely know your fiance.

401
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:24,538
-他说自己是直男  他就是  -直男
- If he says he's straight, he's straight. - Mm. Straight.

402
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:25,998
我们下个月就要结婚了
We're getting married in a month.

403
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,228
人们都往这儿赶来了
People are flying in.

404
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:28,718
他为我俩报了舞蹈课
He signed us up for dance classes.

405
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,008
哦  天啊
Oh, my god!

406
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:31,508
别  不要这样  嘿
No. No, no, no. Hey.

407
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:32,828
-基佬就爱这样  -对  
- This is what gays do. - Yeah.

408
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:33,938
-喜欢聊八卦  -大聊特聊
- We gossip. - We gossip a lot.

409
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,148
他也爱八卦
He gossips!

410
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,538
不是的  你没理解我的意思
No. No. You're missing the point, okay?

411
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,178
每当我们看到像格雷戈里那样的美男子
We see a great-looking guy like Gregory,

412
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:42,048
就会说他是基佬  因为我们希望他是
and we say he's gay because we want him to be gay!

413
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,988
-是吗  你们确定吗  -是这样的
- Really? Really? Are you sure? - Yes. Yes.

414
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,178
就是这样  见过我们怎么对待影星吗
Absolutely. Look at what we do with movie stars.

415
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:46,618
对
Okay.

416
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,948
知道吗  休・杰克曼  他又会唱又会跳
You know? Hugh Jackman-- he sings, he dances,

417
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,228
真是梦中情人
He's dreamy!

418
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,338
很明显我们特想他与我们站在"同"一战线
So obviously we would want him on our team!

419
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,668
-对  -但他就是个直男
- Yeah. - But he's straight.

420
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,648
相信我  我很清楚的
Trust me, I know.

421
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,448
有一次我在餐厅里跟他打招呼
I said hello to him once in a restaurant,

422
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,168
那一刻我嗅不到丝毫的基情
and there was absolutely no chemistry.

423
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,319
是啊  说到这份儿上你要还不信...
Well, if that isn't proof...

424
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,748
三个星期后  桑迪和格雷戈里结了婚
Three weeks later, Sandy and Gregory got married,

425
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:07,928
每个人都说那婚礼美极了
and everyone said the wedding was beautiful.

426
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:10,027
那些花可都是格雷戈里布置的
Gregory did the flowers....

427
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,453
对于一个直男来说  其实一点都"不奇怪"
Which is perfectly normal for a straight guy.

428
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,848
希腊人就一件事做得靠谱  就这羊肉
The Greeks do one thing right, and it's lamb!

429
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,588
好了  咱赶紧去投票吧
All right. Let's go vote.

430
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:23,368
你家媳妇儿哪根经搭错了非要跑去当政客
Why the hell does your wife want to be a politician, anyway?

431
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,058
她不刚说过  她就想在布里斯托路和
You heard her. She wanted to put up

432
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,748
绿叶路那放块停车标志
a stop sign at Bristol and Greenleaf,

433
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:27,658
然后她遇到...
But then she ran into--

434
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,398
等等  慢着
Wait, wait, wait!

435
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:29,908
我住的地方就离那不远
That's near where I live!

436
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,208
对啊  我们是邻居呢  走吧
Yeah. We're neighbors. Let's go!

437
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,988
我才不会给这事投票呢
No way I'm voting for that!

438
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,128
政府已经管得太宽了
Too much government already.

439
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:37,798
我为国上战场可不是为了让政客来告诉我
I didn't fight a war so some politician

440
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:40,526
我该在哪个地方停车
could tell me where I have to stop my car.

441
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:41,892
你根本就不开车
You don't even drive!

442
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,588
那是因为奥巴马那家伙把我驾照吊销了
That's 'cause that Barack Obama took my license away.

443
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:47,159
我可不觉得那事跟他有关
I don't think he was involved in the decision!

444
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,688
我今天出门是要给我老婆拉到50票的
I left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife.

445
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:50,839
我才不要一票都没有就回家
I'm not going home with zero.

446
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,318
你至少能帮帮忙  走进去
The least you can do is walk right in there

447
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,668
替我家媳妇投上一票
and punch a hole for the woman

448
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:57,538
她每周二都帮你把垃圾桶推上车道啊
who drags your garbage can up your driveway every Tuesday!

449
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,148
我不喜欢  那跟我的全部信仰都背道而驰
I don't like it! Goes against everything I believe in.

450
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,978
是吗  就一个停车标志
Really? A stop sign?!

451
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,358
不过我会去的  因为你是个好孩子
But I'll do it, 'cause you're a good kid.

452
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:06,821
我今天原本过得也还不错
And I had a nice day...

453
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:09,138
直到你冲我吼了起来
till you started yelling at me.

454
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,008
十分抱歉  谢谢你了
So sorry. Thank you.

455
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,428
走吧
Here you go.

456
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:16,498
告诉你  我老婆以前也是个酒鬼
You know, my wife was an alcoholic, too.

457
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,218
好吧  投个票而已
Okay. Let's just go vote.

458
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,558
那是老兵政治记者
That's veteran political reporter

459
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:22,128
沃特・夏皮洛
Walter Shapiro.

460
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:24,018
大家好啊
Hi, everyone!

461
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,178
-有什么新闻吗  -还没  还没
- Any news? - Not yet, not yet,

462
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,168
不过即使我输了  至少我知道
But even if I lose, at least now I know

463
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,108
我在播音界还是有点前途的
I have a future in radio.

464
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:34,048
我就不行  人得要看见我的脸才行
I couldn't. People need to see me.

465
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,968
在拿到结果之前  我想要感谢你们大家
Before we get the results, I just want to thank you all

466
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,168
感谢你们为我做的所有事
for everything you've done for me.

467
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:43,688
米奇和小卡  谢谢你们一整天
Mitch and Cam, for campaigning for me all day

468
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,438
开着你们的"克莱尔号"为我竞选
in your little Claire-mobile.

469
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,118
-那是我们至少可以做到的  -对
- It's the least we could do. - Yeah.

470
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:48,188
是真的"少"
Literally.

471
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:49,988
我们为休・杰克曼的电影做的宣传
We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's career

472
00:16:50,038 --> 00:16:51,886
可能都比为克莱尔做的多
than we did for Claire's.

473
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,338
还有曼尼和歌洛莉亚
And, Manny and Gloria,

474
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,931
谢谢你们打了那么多电话
thank you for making all those phone calls.

475
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,268
还有  爸爸
And, dad...

476
00:16:58,528 --> 00:16:59,868
谢谢你的支持
for all your support.

477
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,728
我觉得我没有说服一个人为克莱尔投票
I don't think I convinced anyone to vote for Claire.

478
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:04,734
我自己好像都没投上票
I don't think I even voted.

479
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,618
还有我老公
And my husband...

480
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,197
四处开车
who drove around

481
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:14,058
送了不知道多少位老人去投票
I don't know how many senior citizens today to the polls.

482
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,028
一位
One.

483
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,398
还有我可爱的孩子们
And my beautiful children,

484
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,298
是你们的信念让我有信心
whose faith has given me the confidence

485
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,438
相信我可以做到
to believe that I can do this.

486
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:24,338
我可以
I can--oh.

487
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:25,938
-谁来接  我输了  -妈妈  妈妈
- Somebody else answer it. I lost. - Mom. Mom.

488
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:26,568
-我可以感觉得到  -妈妈
- I can feel it. I-- - Mom.

489
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,849
你可以的  妈妈  接电话吧
You can do it. Mom. Answer the phone.

490
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,268
你好
Hello?

491
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:33,748
我就是
This is she.

492
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,888
谢谢你打电话通知我
Thanks so much for calling.

493
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,188
再见
Bye-bye.

494
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,108
有个坏消息
I have some bad news.

495
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:51,918
因为你当上议员要变忙了吗
Because someone's gonna be busy now that she's a councilwoman?

496
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,058
不  我没有在跟你们开玩笑
No, no, I wasn't doing that fake thing.

497
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:59,218
-我真输了  我输了  -不是吧
- I really lost. I lost. - Ay, no.

498
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,978
真遗憾  不过  你知道吗
I'm so sorry. But you know what?

499
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:07,358
我们都还是非常为你骄傲
We are still just so proud of you.

501
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,422
我不知道你们怎么想的
Yeah! I-- I don't know about you,

502
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:14,428
反正  我要喝一杯酒
But, um... I could use a glass of wine.

503
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,118
现在你们能听到她喝醉的嗓音了
Ohh. Now you're gonna hear her drunk voice.

504
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,758
妈妈
Mom?

505
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:27,608
你还好吧
You okay?

506
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,404
是的  好着呢
Yes. Fine. I'm good.

507
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:31,351
我很好  我不好  我是想赢的
I'm fine. I'm not fine. I wanted to win,

508
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,428
然后  我现在很尴尬
And... and I'm so embarrassed.

509
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:39,568
外边所有人都为我而努力
I mean, everybody out here worked so hard for me,

510
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,548
都信任我
and they believed in me,

511
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,320
而我让他们失望了
and I let 'em down.

512
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:47,508
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

513
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:49,698
乖女儿
Oh, sweetheart.

514
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:53,248
别哭啊  我会没事的
Well, don't cry. I'm gonna be fine, sweetie.

515
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,698
真的  我会没事的
Really, I am.

516
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:58,501
知道你这么在乎  我就已经好多了
Just knowing you care so much makes me feel better.

517
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,208
不是  我收到4封拒信
No, I got four rejection letters

518
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:03,298
一直没告诉你们
I never told you guys about.

519
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:06,448
什么
What?

520
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:11,348
加州圣巴巴拉分校  俄勒冈  威斯康辛
I got rejected from U.C.S.B., Oregon, Wisconsin...

521
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:12,718
-不是吧  -还有西北大学的
- Oh, no. - And Northwestern.

522
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:15,068
那一个我们是有点高攀了
Well, we were overshooting on that one.

523
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:16,738
那那个
What about, uh...

524
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,818
今天收到的  最后的机会了
It came today. My last chance.

525
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,750
我不敢打开
I'm too scared to open it.

526
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,578
无论它怎么说
Whatever it says in there,

527
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:27,588
你爹和我都超级为你自豪
your father and I are crazy proud of you.

528
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:28,758
好吗
Okay?

529
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,495
我今年真的有开始努力
I did start trying this year.

530
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,548
我知道的  你努力了
I know you did. You did.

531
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,725
没有什么好羞耻的
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

532
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:37,558
你也一样
Neither do you.

533
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,082
还是有点不一样的
It's a little bit different.

534
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:43,868
不  其实完全一样
No, it's exactly the same.

535
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,748
不同的是  你一直都很努力
Except you tried really hard the whole time,

536
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:48,245
而不是临时抱佛脚
not just at the end.

537
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,158
你说的对
