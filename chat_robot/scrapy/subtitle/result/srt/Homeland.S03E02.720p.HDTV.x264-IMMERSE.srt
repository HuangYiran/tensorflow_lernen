27
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,990

in which 219 americans lost their lives.

40
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,100
中情局连自己都保护不了
How can the CIA be expected to protect this country,

41
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,630
又怎么能保护这个国家呢
if it can't even protect itself?

42
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,320
对于我们来说  她之前不听指挥
Her history of insubordination and mental illness

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,620
又有精神病史  这可能比在特别委员会面前
might be more useful to us than a good performance

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,180
有良好表现更为有用
in front of the select committee.

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,550
我做不到
I won't do that.

46
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,950
我不能把卡莉扔出去当挡箭牌

You mean for someone who got in a bathtub and tried to slit her wrists?

50
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,330
什么时候才能再见到你
When can I see you again?

51
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,330
他叫马吉德・贾瓦迪

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,590
你有没有看今天的报纸
Have you seen the paper yet?

56
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,700
今天的头条是
Alright, now, the headline is:

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,100
"中情局本部引爆者与中情局人员有染"
"CIA officer linked to langley bomber."

58
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,490
我猜你已经看过这个了
I assume you've seen this.

59
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,260
谁不知道我们多讨厌有事情被捅到媒体上去
We all know how we hate things getting out into the press,

60
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,170
当然了  除非是我们自己把事情捅出去的
Unless of course we put them out there ourselves.

61
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,710
卡莉  你在犯一个很严重的错误
Carrie, you're making a bad mistake.

62
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,750
操你妈的  操你们全家
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,810
或许你应该评论一下昨天报纸上的
Perhaps you'd care to comment on the article

64
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,240
一篇文章
in yesterday's paper.

65
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,580
受质疑的谍报人员
The case officer in question,

66
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,920
她被诊断为躁郁症

67
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,520
这一情况  她对上级
A condition she concealed from her superiors

68
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,970
-一直隐瞒了十多年  -她是否向你隐瞒了
- for more than ten years. - Did she conceal from you

69
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,840
她和布洛迪议员发生性关系一事
the fact that she was sleeping with Congressman Brody?

70
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,650
我恐怕她确实隐瞒过  是的
I'm afraid she did, yes.

71
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,010
上帝

00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,090

75
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,740
他不在家
He's not here.

76
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,040
他已经走了  清早有个会
He left already. He had some early morning meeting.

77
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,790
-和谁  -不知道

- We could call him. - Well, if I could call him,

79
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,490
还大老远跑来这里干什么
why would I come all the way here?

80
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,860
你还好吧
Are you okay?

81
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,810
告诉索尔我来过
Well, tell Saul I came by.

82
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,310
他肯定预料到了
I'm sure he knows.

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,450
你们俩这是怎么了
What is going on with you two?

84
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,710
索尔给我说了那件事

85
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,900
-哪件事  -餐馆里的事
- What incident? - At the restaurant.

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,270

87
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,500
-他说你很生气  -是啊
- He said you were very upset. - Well, yeah.

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,960
我想是的
I-I guess I was.

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,020
但是如果要我说一件
But, you know, if-if I think about an incident

90
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,560
让我生气的事
that's upsetting to me,

91
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,500
不是这件  而是他在参议院特别委员会前
no, I think it would have to be when he sold me down the river

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,980
把我给彻底出卖了
in front of the fucking senate select committee.

93
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,320
这才
Now, that...

94
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,060
这才叫我生气
that was upsetting.

95
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,010
一定要告诉他我来过
Be sure to tell him I came by.

96
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,790
卡莉
Carrie...

97
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,610
我给过他机会了
Uh, he had his chance.

98
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,880
他们一无所获
So they found nothing.

99
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,340
别心急
So far.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,360
这么多资料都没用  包括这该死的笔记本
Out of all this, including a damn laptop.

101
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,590
我们找了位专家
We're bringing in a specialist.

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,500
她会有所发现的
She'll find something.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,970
我杀了个九岁的孩子  她最好能有所发现

109
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,750

110
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,690

No.

111

114
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,020

115
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,700
第一天起

116
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,020

一个带着头巾的孩子
A kid in a headscarf.

122
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,070
大多数的分局骨干都在爆炸中丧生了
And most of the banking division vanished in the explosion.

123
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,170
你要找一个有语言技能的专家
You asked for a specialist with language skills.

124
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,560
这个就是了

125
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,960
你那边什么情况
So, what do you got?

126
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,390
卡莉
Carrie.

127
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,880
她联系了一个记者
She called a reporter.

128
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,800
显然  她认为有必要让他们
Apparently, she thinks it's important they,

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,130
用她的话说是  "听听她的说法"
quote, "Hear her side of the story."

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,040
她透露什么事了吗
She give any indication what that is?

131
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,280
还没  但你也知道她会说什么
Not yet, but you know what she's gonna say.

132
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,250
我们从头至尾都知道布洛迪是恐怖分子
We knew Brody was a terrorist all along.

133
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,350
他穿了一件自杀式背心
He wore a suicide vest into a bunker

134
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,780
和副总统走进地堡

135
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,460
她试图警告我们  可没人听她的
She tried to warn us; nobody would listen.

136
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,110
那就打电话给编辑  让他把这事盖过去
So call the editor; get him to shut it down.

137
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,430
她不到黄河心不死  索尔
She's out for blood, Saul.

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,260
我们搞定了这些人
We keep her away from these guys,

139
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,940
她还会另求他路
she just goes somewhere else.

140
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,480
听着
Look,

141
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,450
我们料到会有这情况
we knew this might happen.

142
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,880
我们有应对措施
We planned for it.

143
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,880
我只想告诉你我会阻止她
I just wanted you to know I'm gonna stop her.

144
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,770
好了  你要知道
Okay, I'd like you to acknowledge

145
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,840
我在录音
that I am recording this

146
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,840
你说的一切都会记录在案
and that everything you say is on the record.

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,790
嗯  我正在被录音
Yeah, I'm being recorded.

148
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,390
我看到红灯亮了
I see the red light,

149
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,300
我想要全都录下来
and I want everything on the record.

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,700
我是妮可・黄  坐在我对面的是...
I'm Nicole Hung, here with...

151
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,850
卡莉・麦吉森
Carrie Mathison.

152
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,410
你在中情局工作了14年
You've been with the CIA 14 years.

153
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,310
是的
Yes.

154
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,130
你说你最近发生了意外
You told me you had a falling out recently.

155
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,320
不  我说的是
No, what I said was

156
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,910
我受到了攻击
I'm under attack.

157
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,520
一周前  你发表了一篇文章
A week ago, you published a story

158
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,330
说中情局本部引爆者
that an unnamed CIA officer was in a romantic relationship

159
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,660
与中情局人员有染
with the Langley bomber.

160
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,800
那人就是你吗
And is that officer you?

161
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,300
不  你没抓到重点
No, you're missing the point.

162
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,520
中情局没有人
No one at the CIA was

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,390
和中情局本部引爆者有染
in a relationship with the Langley bomber.

164
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,410
好吧  等等  根据我的消息来源
Okay, wait, according to my source...

165
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,680
就是中情局
The CIA.

166
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,740
我不能给你肯定的答案
I can't confirm that.

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,510
我不知道你打算
Well, I don't know what kind of conversation

168
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,740
怎么把谈话继续下去
you expect to have here

169
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,060
如果你都不肯承认再明显不过的事实
if you won't acknowledge the fucking obvious.

170
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,820
CIA是故意把报道透漏给你来陷害我的
The CIA gave you that story to set me up.

171
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,120
他们这么做有什么好处
For what?

172
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,400
弥天大谎
The big lie.

173
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,710
听着  不管他们说了什么
Now, despite what they said,

174
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,420
尼古拉斯・布洛迪
Nicholas brody is not responsible

175
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,130
与中情局的爆炸无关
For the explosion at langley.

176
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,080
你有证据
And you can prove this?

177
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,670
没错  我就是为这个来的
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

178
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,130
索尔・贝伦森在去委员会作证前
Did Saul Berenson know

179
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,530
知道这事吗
When he testified before the senate subcommittee?

180
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,400
他当然知道
Of course he did.

181
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,540
他说的一切都是谎话
Everything he said was bullshit.

182
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,010
我不是不明真相的那个人
Now, I'm not the one who got it wrong.

183
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,730
我才是唯一的明白人
I'm the only one who got it right,

184
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,030
而在此前非常长的时间内
And for the longest time,

185
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,200
CIA没有一个人肯信我
I couldn't get anyone at the CIA to believe me.

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,250
你告诉别人我要来了吗
Did you tell anyone that I was coming here?

187
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,270
只有我的编辑
Just my editor.

188
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,570
只有你的编辑
Just your editor?

189
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,700
操你妈的索尔
Fucking Saul.

190
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,000
卡莉・麦吉森
Carrie Mathison,

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,230
我们是警察
D.C. Metro.

192
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,910
你得跟我们走一趟
You need to come with us.

193
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,300
怎么  就来三个人
what, three of you?

194
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,640
你们觉得这点人就够了吗
You think that's enough?

195
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,710
只是例行公事  女士
Standard procedure, ma'am.

196
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,600
什么公事
Yeah, for-for what?

197
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,190
他们又给我编了个什么罪名
What sort of bullshit charges did they make up?

198
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,500
没有什么罪名  女士
There's no charges, ma'am.

199
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,550
我们有一份精神科拘留令
We've got a psychiatric detention order.

200
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,970
您明白是什么吗
You understand what that is?

201
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,320
明白  我明白
Yeah, I understand.

202
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,580
不用了
Hey, that's not necessary.

203
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,860
您会配合吧
Is it?

204
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,060
您有权在24小时内召开听证会
Now, you're entitled to a full commitment hearing within 24 hours.

205
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,770
这他妈就是个陷阱
This is complete bullshit!

206
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,520
你心知肚明  对吧
You know that, right?

207
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,940
女士  请
Ma'am, please.

208
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,620
你们回家有多久了  快一周了吧
So, you've been back home now, what, almost a week?

209
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,100
还好吗
How's that going?

210
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,370
会很困难吗
Is it a challenge?

211
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,500
为什么会困难
Why would it be a challenge?

212
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,340
我也不知道
I don't know.

213
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,800
再次回到现实世界中来
Reentry, being back out in the world?

214
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,800
我可不在现实世界中
I'm not back out in the world though.

215
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,170
我一直被困在家里
I'm stuck at home.

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,490
为什么会这样呢
And why is that?

217
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,940
丹娜觉得她是个...典型的反面
Dana thinks that she's... Famous in a bad way.

218
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,390
我说的是"反面教材"
The word is "Infamous."

219
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,400
是吗  你觉得自己是个反面教材吗
Is that what you think, that you're infamous?

220
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,690
好吧  不  我不觉得
Okay. No, I'm not.

221
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,770
那是什么
Well, which is it?

222
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,760
好吧  来回顾一下
Well, let's see.

223
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,150
我爸炸了CIA  杀了三百多人
My dad blew up the CIA, he killed 300 people,

224
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,810
人称第二次911
They call it the second 9/11, and it was

225
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,780
有很长一段时间  这是街头巷尾的唯一话题
All anybody talked about for a month and a half.

226
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,270
这是你爸做的事
What your dad did?

227
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,520
没错
Right.

228
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,030
那你自己做的事呢
What about what you did?

229
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,810
我  这个吗
What I did? This?

230
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,540
比较起来  这完全不值一提了吧
By comparison, it's, like, nothing.

231
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,670
我知道你的意思  但这并非不值一提
I know what you mean by that, but it's not nothing.

232
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,070
这也是我们三个今天共聚在此的原因
It's why we're here, the three of us.

233
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,390
那么你呢
So, what about you?

234
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,910
我
Me?

235
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,920
还是那个问题  你怎么样
Same question. How are you doing?

236
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
我很好
I'm fine.

237
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,500
好吧
Okay.

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,260
真的
Really.

239
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,180
我很高兴她回来了
I'm just glad that she's home.

240
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,270
很好
Good.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,110
的确  事情有些变化
I mean, there have been some adjustments,

242
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,690
但我们知道这是在所难免的
But we knew there would be.

243
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,630
什么样的变化
What kind of adjustments?

244
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,520
她重装了浴室
She remodeled the bathroom...

245
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,350
就是我自杀的地方
Where I did it.

246
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,650
我没有
I didn't.

247
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,410
你明明就有  你把它整个重装了
Yeah, you did. You remodeled the whole thing.

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,890
我没有
I didn't.

249
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,900
我没有重装
I didn't remodel it.

250
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,750
渗入水泥的血迹擦不干净
The blood wouldn't come out of the grout,

251
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,780
我只能把它们都换了  是我自己看书学做的
So I had to replace everything, which I did myself with a book.

252
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,920
没必要再说这事了
We don't have to talk about that.

253
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,140
同意
With you there.

254
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
你好  我想预约
Hi. I need to make an appointment

255
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,850
理查森医生  周二
For, um, Thursday for Dr. Richardson.

256
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,900
我想你
I miss you.

257
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,930
我也想你
I miss you, too.

258
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,610
丹娜  走吧
Dana, come on.

259
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,930
卡莉・麦吉森  我是哈伦医生
Carrie Mathison, I'm Dr. Harlan.

260
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,470
哈伦  我识字
Harlan. I can read.

261
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,930
我会陪你出席明天的拘禁听证会
I'll be with you tomorrow at your commitment hearing.

262
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,050
我想向你解释一下
I'd like to explain to you what that is.

263
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,250
我知道什么是拘禁听证会
I know what a commitment hearing is.

264
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,990
我只是不敢相信他们真要这么干
I just can't believe they're actually going through with it.

265
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,240
我不太明白你的意思
I'm not sure what you mean.

266
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
我的意思是  我懂
Well, I mean, I get it.

267
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,280
有人想说出真相
Someone tries to tell the truth,

268
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,800
你们就说他们是疯子
You counter by calling them crazy.

269
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,480
我很欣赏这招  真体面
I admire the move; it's elegant, but it's...

270
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,930
不过真的没必要
It's unnecessary.

271
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,960
告诉他们吧
Tell them that.

272
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,430
我退出
I'm standing down.

273
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,350
你退出
You're standing down?

274
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,250
我受到教训了  能让我走了吗
I've learned my lesson, so can I get out of here, please?

275
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
这里说你停止服药了
Says here you stopped taking your meds.

276
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,990
哪里说  什么  那是什么
Says where? What? What? What is that?

277
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,720
你的病历
It's your medical history.

278
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,100
谁给的病历
According to whom?

279
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,350
你的医生们
Your doctors.

280
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,670
是吗  可是...
Really? 'cause...

281
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,680
我真正去看的医生
No doctor of mine, one that I am actually seeing,

282
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,060
没人会那样写的
Would write that.

283
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,070
你有停止用药吗
Did you stop taking your meds?

284
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,400
我没有  我不是单纯的停药
I didn't... I didn't just stop taking my meds.

285
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,060
我用了另一套方法来代替药物
I have a routine to compensate.

286
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,210
这方法是我的医生建议的
A routine that I have worked out

287
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,220
我真正的医生  不是什么CIA的骗子
With my actual doctor, not some CIA shill

288
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,980
他们就是想让我闭嘴
Who's trying to shut me up.

289
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,700
我每天都跑步  跑六英里
I, um... I run every day, six miles.

290
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,020
有时候还更多
Sometimes more.

291
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,130
我还唱歌  想不到吧
Singing helps. Go figure.

292
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,060
还有  我还冥想
And, um, and I meditate.

293
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,790
以此保持冷静
To stay calm.

294
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,040
是吗  你冷静吗
Are you... Calm?

295
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,580
考虑到
Well, considering

296
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,540
我正被铐在医院的轮床上
I'm chained to a gurney in a hospital gown,

297
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
我想说我能保持这样已经不只是冷静了
I'd say I'm beyond calm.

298
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,510
我他妈都快入定了
I'm fucking zen!

299
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,040
我只是...  我不...
I just... I can't...

300
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,080
我不能再用药了
I can't do the meds anymore.

301
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,120
为什么
Why not?

302
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,200
因为那会让我的脑子变得迟钝
Because they dull my head.

303
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,180
我做事的时候会忽视重点
I miss things when I'm on them.

304
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,870
不是忽视
Miss, not... As in "Yearn for,"

305
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,720
是"抓不住"
But miss as in "Fail to see."

306
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,350
-抓不住  比如什么  -比如
- Fail to see what, for example? - Well, for example,

307
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,110
中情局的爆炸导致了219人丧生
The explosion at langley that killed 219 people.

308
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,350
我看到了
And I see it already,

309
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,550
你脸上的怀疑  可我真是名CIA
The doubt on your face, but I-I am cia.

310
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,010
你可以去查证
You can verify it.

311
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,890
当然
Unless, of course,

312
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,650
除非他们抹去了我的档案
They expunged my records, which...

313
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,500
仔细想想  可能性非常大
...Come to think of it, is a real possibility.

314
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,460
听着  我妹妹是名医生
Look, my sister is a doctor.

315
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,250
你可以给她打电话
You can call her.

316
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,160
她会告诉你我说的一切都是真的
She'll tell you everything I've said is true.

317
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,420
他们说你在找我
They said you were looking for me?

318
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,350
希望没有打扰到您
I didn't want to bother you.

319
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,550
不会  发现什么了
No bother. What do you got?

320
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,950
我设法追踪了笔记本上的账户
I managed to source all the accounts on the laptop.

321
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,350
并没有很多
There weren't that many.

322
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,440
文件也都在公文包里
And the documents in the briefcase, too.

323
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,160
结论是
And?

324
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,480
没有与伊朗有关的东西
Nothing originates in iran.

325
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,900
等你发现了再告诉我
Let me know when you find something that does.

326
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,170
长官
Sir?

327
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,080
我不太明白您到底希望我找什么
I'm not sure what you expect me to do.

328
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,460
我已经照您的要求浏览了所有账户
I've looked at all the accounts like you asked.

329
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,750
没有任何异常
There's nothing there.

330
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,680
知道为什么找你来吗
You know what you're here for?

331
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,150
检查银行账目
To examine the bank records.

332
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,840
你要跟踪钱的流向
You're following the money.

333
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,260
从香港贷款银行到这个男人
From Hong Hong lending bank to this guy.

334
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,350
这儿
Here.

335
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,260
马吉德・贾瓦迪
Majid Javadi.

336
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,370
这个伊朗人资助了12月12号的那场
The Iranian who funded the attack on this agency

337
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,300
对中情局的袭击活动
That occurred on 12/12.

338
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,400
我知道
I know.

339
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,940
很好
Good.

340
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,120
那就好好干吧
So do that.

341
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,750
还有
And you know what else?

342
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,790
我们说的是
While we're talking about an event

343
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,490
一场造成两百名美国公民死亡的袭击事件
That left 200 americans dead on the ground,

344
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,250
而目前你所做的一切  似乎都是无用功
And what you're doing about it, which is apparently nothing...

345
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,190
请原谅我态度不好
forgive me.

346
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,780
你头上戴的那玩意儿
You wearing that thing on your head

347
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,110
对于那些本该成为你的同事
is one big "Fuck you" to the people

348
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,050
却在爆炸中不幸牺牲的人来说
Who would've been your coworkers,

349
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,450
就相当于一个巨大的"操"字
Except they perished in a blast right out there.

350
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,850
如果你一定要戴它  如果真的非戴不可
So if you need to wear it, if you really need to,

351
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,290
这是你的权利
Which is your right,

352
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,510
但你最好是我们所见过的最好的分析师
You better be the best analyst we've ever seen,

353
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,310
所以别跟我说什么没有异常
And that means don't tell me there's nothing.

354
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,550
给我个计划
Give me a plan.

355
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,770
要么给我个计划  要么就他妈闭嘴
Give me a goddamn plan or don't say anything.

356
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,490
清楚了吗
Is that clear?

357
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,320
现在你明白我们想做什么了吗
You understand the mission now, what we're trying to do here?

358
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,900
是
Yes.

359
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,130
很好
Good.

360
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,510
我
I...

361
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,210
又怎么了
What?

362
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,400
我有个计划
I have a plan.

363
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,100
你说
Well, tell it to me.

364
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,060
我们把这家银行的人带进来
We bring in people from this bank.

365
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,660
审问他们在中东的这三家银行支行的
Ask them about wire transfers from these three branches.

366
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,500
电汇情况
In the middle east.

367
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,180
而我们需要审问的银行工作人员
The bankers we want to talk to,

368
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,000
他们现在在纽约
They're in New York.

369
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,380
好  我会把他们带来
Okay, I'll get them down here.

370
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,750
明天我们就跟他们谈谈
We'll talk to them tomorrow.

371
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
我们俩一起
The two of us.

372
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,020
丹娜
Dana?

373
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,950
怎么了
What?

374
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,210
外头越来越冷了  你要加件毛衣吗
It's getting cold out. Do you want a sweater?

375
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,250
不用
I'm fine.

376
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,950
妈妈
Mom.

377
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,150
需要吃的吗
Something to eat?

378
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,660
-我说...  -妈  让她一个人呆会
- I said... - Mom, just leave her alone.

379
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,430
我只是问问她要不要吃的
I just asked if she wants some food.

380
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,050
别  你快把她逼疯了
Well, don't. You're driving her crazy.

381
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,950
一整天什么都没吃  肯定有事
When someone doesn't eat all day, it means something.

382
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,420
可能她只是不觉得饿
Maybe she's not hungry.

383
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,270
宝贝
Sweetie?

384
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,490
妈  真的  别
Mom, really, don't.

385
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,660
见鬼  卡莉
Shit, Carrie.

386
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,180
请坐
Have a seat.

387
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,000
我都不知道这事
I didn't know about this.

388
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,140
一听到消息我就赶过来了
I came as soon as I heard.

389
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,510
你是来把我弄出去的吗
Did you come to get me out?

390
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,770
我不能
I-I can't.

391
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,700
那滚吧
Just-just leave.

392
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,130
你不能到处泄露情报局的机密
You can't go around spilling agency secrets.

393
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,370
你知道的
You know that.

394
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,130
索尔都惊慌失措了
Saul's panicked.

395
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,380
因为我
About me.

396
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,870
因为不能确定中情局的将来
About the CIA, if it even has a future.

397
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
所以他把那场爆炸怪罪到我头上
So he blames the explosion on me.

398
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,700
这就是他拯救情报局的计划
That's his plan to save the agency.

399
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,240
-我知道这事很操蛋  -知道就好
- It's fucked up, I know. - Good.

400
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,730
-但这并不能让你离开这里  -不
-But it's not gonna get you out of here. - No.

401
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,510
不  明天我家人会出席听证会
No, my family will be at the hearing tomorrow,

402
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,420
-他们会把我弄出去的  -卡莉  你必须...
- And they will get me out. - Carrie, you have to...

403
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,470
必须什么  做该做的事吗
What? What do I have to do?

404
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,470
看看他们把我关在什么地方
Look where they put me.

405
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,560
没有什么是我必须做的
I don't have to do anything.

406
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,930
你要小心点
You have to be careful.

407
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,870
在爆炸前  在你甚至还没意识到的时候
There are things that happened before the explosions

408
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,660
发生了一些事
You're not even aware of.

409
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,210
他们针对...
People targeted...

410
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,890
我很担心你会受到伤害
I'm worried you're gonna get yourself hurt.

411
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,730
他派你来的  对吗
He sent you here, didn't he?

412
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,260
-谁  -索尔
- Who? - Saul.

413
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,870
他派你来恐吓我
He sent you to threaten me.

414
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,470
不  不是  他没派我来
No, no, he did not send me.

415
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,690
你走吧
Just leave.

416
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,470
你听我说好吗
Okay, would you just listen?

417
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,390
别管我
Leave me alone!

418
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,400
怎么了
What's going on?

419
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,980
没事吧
Are you okay?

420
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,430
什么事都没有
Everything is fine.

421
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,000
他马上就走了
He was just leaving.

422
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,860
丹娜
Dana?

423
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,250
丹娜
Dana?

424
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,900
丹娜  你在哪
Dana, where are you?

425
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,230
妈  怎么了
Mom, what happened?

426
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
你姐姐跑出去了
Your sister's gone.

427
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,720
从门那边走
Go through the door.

428
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,620
等等
Wait.

429
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,840
你还好吧
You okay?

430
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,510
我不知道
I don't know.

431
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,100
等等
Wait.

432
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,290
小心
Watch out.

433
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,560
你没事吧
Are you okay?

434
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,280
我真的很需要见到你
I just really needed to see you.

435
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,940
麦琪
Maggie?

436
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,520
来了
Coming.

437
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,330
怎么了
What is it?

438
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,330
我需要找工资单
Pay stubs.

439
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,000
卡莉要在听证会上用到她的工资单
Carrie wants her paystubs for the hearing.

440
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,670
-为什么  -她说做证据用
- Why? - Well, she says it's evidence.

441
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,170
在那次该死的爆炸之后  她不止是复职
You know, they reinstated her after the damn explosion

442
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,740
还升官了
With a huge promotion.

443
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,950
如果这是她的错  你们真准备这么做吗
Is that what you do if it's her fault?

444
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,590
不过这又不是中情局受审判
It's not the CIA on trial though.

445
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,090
希望她能明白这点
Hope she gets that.

446
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,930
在这
Here.

447
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,930
真不敢相信你会来
I really can't believe you're here.

448
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,880
我能进去吗
Can I come in?

449
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,740
弗兰克  你好
Hello, Frank.

450
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,070
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

451
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,000
对啊  你来干什么
Yeah, why are you here?

452
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,520
我...
Look, I, uh...

453
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,030
我知道你们现在很生气
I understand you're angry.

454
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,230
收起你的鳄鱼眼泪吧
Hey, skip the phony sympathy.

455
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,380
你想怎么样
What do you want?

456
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,940
我知道你们俩现在都很恨我
I know both of you hate me right now,

457
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,250
但是我是站在她这边的
But I'm on her side.

458
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,840
-扯淡  -我真的是
-Oh, bullshit. - I am.

459
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,710
但是这改变不了她现在正在走上歪路
Doesn't change the fact that the way she's carrying on,

460
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,270
她最大的敌人就是她自己
She's her own worst enemy.

461
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,360
你们得把她拉回来  她不能
You need to reign her in; she can't be running

462
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,500
一不高兴了就跑去找记者
To a reporter every time she gets upset.

463
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,540
她这么做了吗
Is that what she did?

464
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,010
她没跟你提过吗
What, she didn't even mention it to you?

465
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,630
-没有  -你想让她做什么
- No. - Well, what do you expect her to do?

466
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,640
打不还手吗
Not even fight back?

467
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,510
她不是在还击
She's not fighting back.

468
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,270
她是在让自己变成众矢之的
She's making herself a target.

469
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,100
中情局靠机密吃饭
Agency runs on secrecy.

470
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,220
有人希望她被刑事起诉
There are people who want her indicted on criminal charges.

471
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,540
你这是威胁我们吗
So you're threatening us?

472
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,140
我只是在告诉你们事实
I'm telling you the truth.

473
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,740
现在你们能为卡莉做的最有益的事
Best thing you can do for Carrie right now

474
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,270
是说服她待在里面
Is convince her to stay inside.

475
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,040
你是说那个精神病房吗
You mean the psych ward?

476
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,400
我是说一个无法监视的但能让她恢复的地方
I mean out of sight, someplace she can level out.

477
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,310
你知道她停药了  对吧
You know she's off her meds, right?

478
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,970
你不会也觉得那是个好办法吧
Unless you think that's a good idea,

479
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,080
你真的得帮帮我
You really have to help me.

480
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,900
真好
Good.

481
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,010
什么
What?

482
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,080
你在笑
You're smiling.

483
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,540
你也是
So are you.

484
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,860
我也奇怪为什么会笑出来
Wonder why that is.

485
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
他们很快就会发现
You know they're gonna find out soon

486
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,730
我不见了
That I'm missing.

487
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,090
还有你妈妈...
And your mother is just...

488
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,350
别说了
Don't.

489
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,670
求你了
Please.

490
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,510
我只想要这二人世界
Just want it to be us.

491
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,960
还有洗衣机
And appliances.

492
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,610
我只想要二人世界和这洗衣机
I just want it to be us and appliances.

493
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,750
因为我们没有毛病
'cause we're not defective.

494
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,570
知道吗
You know?

495
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,060
我们没有
We're not.

496
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,610
外面的一切才有毛病
It's everything out there.

497
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,630
那我宁愿在这里做个疯子
Then I'd rather stay here with all the other crazies.

498
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
你才不疯
You're not crazy.

499
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,870
如果我真是疯子呢
So what if I am?

500
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,850
你真的好帅
You're so beautiful.

501
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,890
他说如果你有需要
He says he's here

502
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,170
他可以来帮你做人品证人
as a character witness, if you need him.

503
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,880
我跟他说过不用了
I already told him I don't.

504
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,140
要是你吵吵闹闹把他折腾走了
If you make a fuss and have him removed,

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,200
恐怕法官那边不会有什么好印象
I don't think it'll help you with the magistrate.

506
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,020
多个帮自己的又没坏处
It's not bad to have someone else on your side.

507
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,990
那好吧  让他留下
Okay, fine. Just leave him then.

508
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,400
我机会有多少
So what are my chances?

509
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,550
我们会申请放你回家
We're asking that you be released to your family.

510
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,410
就我来看
So as far as I'm concerned,

511
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,830
机会很大
they're excellent.

512
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,590
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

513
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,480
我只想赶紧了结
I just want this to be over.

514
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,140
他们可算来了
Oh, good, they're here.

515
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,740
麦琪  爸爸  嗨
Maggie, dad, hi.

516
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
这位是哈伦医生
This is Dr. Harlan.

517
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,450
嗨
Hey.

518
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,540
-都弄到了吧  -是的
- Did you find everything? - Yeah.

519
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,480
很好  我还在想你跑哪去了
Okay. I was wondering where you were.

520
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,950
这什么
What's this?

521
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,820
我们想谈谈你用药的事
We want to talk about your medication.

522
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,690
显然你们都商量好了
Obviously, you already have.

523
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,520
-卡莉  听我说  -不  几分钟后
- Carrie, listen... - No, I've got a hearing

524
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,650
我就有个听证会
in about three minutes.

525
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,030
关键就是我不想
The whole point being that I don't need

526
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,640
任人摆布
anyone telling me what to do.

527
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,870
你们还说要帮忙
You said you would help.

528
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,580
-我们是在帮你  -你们这叫帮倒忙
- We are helping.  -No, not when you pull this shit!

529
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,840
我们担心你啊
We're concerned, okay?

530
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,670
-怕你出问题  -省省吧
- About you getting yourself into trouble. - Don't be.

531
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,760
你那些话让人担心
I mean, from what you've been saying.

532
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,680
我什么都没说过
I've been saying nothing!

533
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,430
过去24小时
I've spent the last 24 hours

534
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,370
-我一直关在这里  -不  是之前
- checked in here. - No, before that.

535
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,520
你说记者那事啊
Oh, you mean the reporter.

536
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,970
对
Yes.

537
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,520
你又是怎么知道
You want to tell me

538
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,000
记者那事的
how you even know about that?

539
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,080
操  索尔那混蛋
God... fucking Saul.

540
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,390
他也是担心你
He's worried about you.

541
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,520
是吗
Really?

542
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,060
你那是泄露机密
You're divulging classified stuff.

543
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,320
他说句担心我
He told you that he was worried about me,

544
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,100
你们就真信了
and you believed it,

545
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,270
正是他把我弄进这里的
when he's the one who put me in here.

546
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,830
天呐  他这是要...
God, he's... he's try...

547
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,330
他这是要彻底整死我
he's trying to crush me when I am trying

548
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,540
而我还在苦苦
so hard to do what's...

549
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,450
找寻真相
what's right.

550
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,700
操
Fuck.

551
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,810
他简直人面兽心  根本不是朋友
No, he pretended to be my friend, and he's not.

552
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,570
说句难听的
You know what, really?

553
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,680
你们也一样
no different than you.

554
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,190
别这样
Hey...

555
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,690
大家起立
All rise.

556
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,110
巡回听证会第六场
The sixth circuit,

557
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,710
有请弗吉尼亚州
the Commonwealth of Virginia,

558
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,530
特别法官威廉・切斯尼
the honorable special justice William Chesney.

559
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,420
卡莉・麦吉森一案
Matter of Carrie Mathison.

560
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,900
是你吗
Is that you?

561
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,400
法官大人
Your honor...

562
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,530
对不起
I'm sorry.

563
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,550
闪开
Get off!

564
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,150
不
No!

565
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,950
这他妈是个骗局
This is a fucking sham!

566
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,200
快走
Come on.

567
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,960
恕我冒昧  长期以来
With all respect, you've had a long history

568
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,050
贵方与伊朗方面都有可疑交易
of questionable transactions with iran.

569
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,110
根据货币管理署出具的四号物证
Item four from the office of the controller of the currency,

570
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,470
三年前的十月间  他们曾下发一份
three years ago in October, they issued a cease and desist

571
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,130
要求你的当事人与德黑兰阿斯卡利银行
ordering your client to stop dealings

572
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,310
终止业务往来的禁止令
with the Al Askari Bank in Tehran.

573
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,090
我的当事人的确执行了禁令
My client complied with that order.

574
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,990
但你们仍旧与其贸易公司进行交易
You continued dealings with their trading company.

575
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,470
该禁令只限于银行业者
The order applied only to the bank.

576
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,630
是你们自己定义的吗
That's your position?

577
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,790
是禁令上的白纸黑字
That's the language in the paper.

578
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,780
于是在此期间  你们通过电子转账
So you proceeded to accept wire transfers

579
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,250
从某伊朗贸易公司
from an iranian trading company to the tune of $900 million

580
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,710
累计收款9亿美元
over that time period.

581
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,720
还有组织有计划
Systematically altered

582
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,020
篡改交易方抬头
the transaction headers

583
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,700
企图掩盖资金的真正来源
to conceal the true source of the funds.

584
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,210
我们并不知晓你们情报的来源
We're not sure where you're getting your information from.

585
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,960
我的当事人已尽了全力履行联邦法规
My client made every effort to comply with federal regulations.

586
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,260
我们有电邮显示结果迥然
We have an e-mail here saying the opposite.

587
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,830
有一条对哈兹拉文贸易公司的指令中写着
An instruction to Al Hazlawin Trading:

588
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,900
"删除所有伊朗方面客户的名称
"Delete all Iranian customer names to avoid any sign

589
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,530
以免为美方留下法律破绽"
of U.S. legal breach."

590
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,760
这些法律破绽
These legal breaches,

591
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,360
就是对你刚口口声声
those are violations of the laws

592
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,450
说你们在遵从的联邦律法的亵渎
you just told me you were complying with.

593
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,630
我不知您所指是什么
I wouldn't know what it refers to.

594
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,580
你怎么会不知道  邮件就是你发的
How can you not know? You sent the e-mail.

595
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,450
标题就是《勿提及伊朗》
Subject line is "Do not reference Iran."

596
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,910
我们掌握了虚假电子转账交易
We have the phony wire transfers--

597
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,200
成千上万笔
thousands of them.

598
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,390
我们想要真正交易者的名称
We want the real ones with the real names.

599
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,940
你们从哪儿搞来的
Where did you get this?

600
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,550
这就是你的问题吗
That's your question?

601
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,940
你的当事人在资助对本国的恐怖袭击
Your client is funding attacks by terrorists on this country,

602
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,410
而你却只想知道我们情报的来源
and all you want to know is how did we find out?

603
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,230
你刚才说的是谁来着
So who did you say this is again?

604
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,170
你们了解你们的银行吗
You know your bank?

605
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,150
它自鸦片战争起
It's been trafficking in human misery

606
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,810
便一直从事罪恶勾当
since the opium wars.

607
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,010
这不是过失
That's not an aberration.

608
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,380
也并非疏漏
It's not a mistake.

609
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,340
这就是你们的商业计划
That's your business plan.

610
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,950
你们为武器禁运国转移资金
You move money for embargoed governments

611
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,430
做虚假募捐
or phony charities.

612
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,940
至于资金用途  你们不闻不问
Where it goes, you don't want to know,

613
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,570
只要能赚到佣金就行了
as long as you get your fee.

614
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,230
但是这次我们要告诉你们钱去了哪里
But we're telling you where it went this time.

615
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,460
是用在了一辆载满C4炸药的汽车上
Into an suv full of c4 that blew up

616
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,730
就在三个月前  就在这幢楼的外面
right outside this building three months ago.

617
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,570
你们进来的时候还驶过了爆炸点
You passed the blast site on your way in.

618
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,130
我们知道资金经由你们的银行转移
We know the funds moved through your bank.

619
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,410
但我们还想知道资金的源头
We need to know where they originated.

620
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,760
是吗
You do?

621
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,600
是的
Yes.

622
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,060
抱歉  女士
All respect, ma'am...

623
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,950
在美国  这样可寻求不到帮助
in this country, that's not the way we ask for help.

624
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,780
你就完全没想过
Did you think for even a second

625
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,100
我有多担心吗
how worried I would be?

626
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,610
没必要担心
There was no need to worry.

627
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,100
怎么会没必要
How do you figure that?

628
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,800
他配不上你
He's not good for you.

629
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,820
凭什么这么说  你完全不了解他
And that is based on what, not knowing him at all?

630
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,630
显然他有问题
He's got problems, obviously.

631
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,730
不稳定
He's unstable.

632
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,190
这是你的专家诊断吗
Is that your professional diagnosis, mom?

633
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,850
他...丹娜  现在你需要的不是他
He's... Dana, he's not what you need right now.

634
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,070
也许我需要的正是他呢
Maybe he's exactly what I do need.

635
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,230
丹娜  康复中心每个医生  每册资料
Dana, every doctor at the center, every pamphlet,

636
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,960
还有我看过的每本书
every book that I've read on getting well,

637
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,990
都告诉我们相同的事
they all say the same thing:

638
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,470
就是现在最好先不要恋爱
you don't want to start a relationship.

639
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,710
什么  即便碰到真正懂你的人吗
What, with someone who actually understands you?

640
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,120
他们是这样说的吗
Is that what they say?

641
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,300
你知道这有多白痴吗
Do you realize how crazy that is?

642
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,870
你以为那帮人有什么真本事
You think they know something, the people in here.

643
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,880
其实屁也不是
Well, they don't.

644
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,570
就会神叨叨鬼话连篇
They just yack and yack and yack

645
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,980
直到埋单的人心里平衡些为止
until the people who are paying for it feel better.

646
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,800
好像真被他们治好了似的
Like everyone is getting well.

647
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,870
我真的无法理解
I really don't understand.

648
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,360
那就对了
Yeah, that's right.

649
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,130
你没事就好
Hey, glad you're all right.

650
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,320
哪里没事了
I'm not all right.

651
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,830
妈  没关系
Mom, it's okay.

652
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,520
是吗
Is it?

653
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,190
她跑到疯人院去还没关系
When someone runs away to the nuthouse?

654
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
她到底想让我怎么样
What does she want me to do?

655
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,660
你是想引起我注意吗
Do you want my attention?

656
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,910
是这样吗
Is that it?

657
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,880
我现在注意力都在你身上  真的
Because you got it, completely, believe me.

658
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,370
你想干嘛
What are you doing?

659
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,500
我不是想引起注意
I wasn't looking for attention.

660
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,050
丹娜  你想干嘛
Dana, what are you doing?

661
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,130
给你看些东西
Showing you something.

662
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,480
放开
No, no!

663
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,450
我并不想让你听到我哭喊呼救
It wasn't a cry for help what I did.

664
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,260
我并不想引起任何人注意
I didn't want anyone's attention.

665
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,210
我当时真的想自杀
I wanted to kill myself.

666
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,070
我想死了就一了百了
I wanted it all to be over, and I wanted to die

667
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,380
因为我已经受不了了
because I could not stand it anymore!

668
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,970
但我现在能承受了
But now I can.

669
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,460
我现在想活着
Now I want to be alive.

670
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,890
利奥就是原因
And the reason for that is Leo.

671
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,770
都不知道从什么时候起
I was happy last night for the first time

672
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,950
我很久没像昨晚那样开心过了
since I-I don't even know when.

673
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,080
我不想再这样下去
And I am not gonna do this anymore.

674
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,470
我不会再让别人对我指手画脚了
I am not gonna let everybody tell me what I should be fucking thinking

675
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,650
就好像我自己不能做决定一样
all the time, like I can't decide for myself,

676
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,210
好像我脑子真有毛病一样
like something is wrong with me.

677
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,030
利奥没疯
Because Leo is not crazy,

678
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,610
我也没疯
and I am not crazy.

679
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,940
你在怀疑自己疯了吗  你也没疯
And in case you're wondering, neither are you.

680
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,030
爸爸才疯了
Dad was crazy.

681
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,980
他有很多面
He was a lot of things.

682
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,650
他是个从一踏进家门起
He was a psycho who did nothing but lie

683
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,950
就满嘴谎言并破坏我们生活的
from the minute he set foot in this house,

684
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,380
不折不扣的疯子
and he ruined our lives.

685
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,390
这就是事实
It's the truth.

686
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,050
但我现在没事了
But I am okay now.

687
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,490
我真的好了  我敢这么说
I really am. I can... I can tell.

688
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,370
你知道为什么吗
Because you know what?

689
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,910
因为现在  此刻
Right now, at this moment,

690
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,720
我想活下去
I want to be alive.

691
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,990
银行那边有消息吗
Any word from the bankers?

692
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,100
没有
Nothing.

693
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,630
但我接到30个国会议员的电话
I did get calls from about 30 congressmen though.

694
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,390
让你停手
Telling you to back off.

695
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,640
提醒我该去抓恐怖分子
Remind me I'm supposed to be catching terrorists,

696
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,180
而不是搞垮国际银行系统
not bringing down the international banking system.

697
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,180
坐
Sit.

698
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,440
不用  我站着
No, I'll stand.

699
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,020
我今天去了卡莉的听证会
I went to Carrie's hearing today,

700
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,350
我看到她被拉下庭
and I saw her being hauled off,

701
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,720
乱踢乱叫
kicking and screaming.

702
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,900
我听说她失控了
I heard she lost it.

703
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,410
不是她失控了
She didn't lose it.

704
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,310
是我们让她失控了
We did that to her.

705
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,450
是我们
We did it.

706
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,400
我不会中途退出
I would never bail on you in the middle of something,

707
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,070
但我想让你知道  这里发生的事情
but I want you to know what's going on here

708
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,160
我无法接受
is not okay with me.

709
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,880
彼得
Peter...

710
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,230
这周确实难熬
It's been a rough week.

711
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,920
我懂
I'm aware.

712
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,310
但我们现在有了方向
But we're onto something.

713
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,370
如果跟我的预期一致
And if it leads to where I think,

714
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,010
这一切都值得
it will all have been worth it.

715
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,950
我不确定  索尔
I don't know, Saul.

716
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,360
有点信心吧
Just have a little faith.

717
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,980
问题就是
The thing is,

718
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,130
我没有
I don't.

719
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,960
这事一结束  我就走人
And when this is over, I'm out.

720
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,090
等事情结束再做决定吧
We'll see when we get there.

721
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,260
现在就说定了
I'm telling you now.

722
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,790
那是个意外  彼得
It was a mistake, Peter.

723
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,710
那孩子的死是个意外
What happened to that child.

724
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,240
没错  但那是我造成的
Yeah. It was my mistake.

725
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,020
我会处理
And I'll deal with it.

726
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,580
但我真不明白我们到底要干什么
But I don't know what the hell we're doing, I really don't.

727
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,860
我今天在中情局看到你了
I saw you at Langley today.

728
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,090
抱歉  我不认识你
Sorry, I don't remember.

729
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,900
可以理解
That's understandable.

730
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,140
你现在正忙着想方设法扯谎呢
You were pretty busy lying your ass off.

731
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,020
什么
What?

732
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,940
这周你失去了一个同事
You lost a colleague this week.

733
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,650
-没错  -他和他儿子都被枪杀了
- That's right. - He was gunned down, his son, too.

734
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,200
这是个可怕的意外
It was a horrible mistake.

735
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,760
希望不会重演
I hope it's not repeated.

736
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,570
告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you are.

737
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,740
你是谁
Who are you?

738
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,980
别人不回答你的问题
It's aggravating, isn't it,

739
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,190
很让人恼火  是吧
when someone won't answer your questions?

740
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,100
-跟我律师谈  -我就跟你谈
- Talk to my lawyer... - I'm talking to you.

741
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,940
我还要告诉你  你现在还有得选
And I'm telling you, you have a choice.

742
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,200
你可以给我们需要的信息
You can give us the information we're asking for,

743
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,210
不然你就跟自己打哑谜吧
or you can keep up your stupid charade.

744
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,370
但如果你选择后者
But if you make the latter,

745
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,250
我会竭尽全力
I want you to know I try very hard

746
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,290
让你们这些贪官好看
to be patient with venal shitheads like you...

747
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,750
现在我只能做这么多了
But I can only do it so long.

748
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,630
祝你平安飞到家
You have a good flight home.

749
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,170
都在这了吗
They're all here?

750
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,260
-银行记录  -应该都在
- The records? - Seem to be.

751
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,480
能从中找到什么线索
So what'd they give us?

752
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,700
所有线索
Everything.

753
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,810
银行基本都不管禁止令
HLBC basically ignored the cease and desist order,

754
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,860
和我们讨论的一样
just like we said.

755
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,220
他们虽然停止与阿斯卡里银行[巴基斯坦]合作
They stopped dealing with al-Askari bank,

756
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,490
但仍在与贸易公司合作
but they continued with the trading company.

757
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,120
实际上  交易额反而增加了
In fact, the number of transactions increased,

758
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,300
尤其是接近爆炸的日子
especially toward the date of the explosion.

759
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,880
查到涉及此事的所有人了吗
Know who all was involved?

760
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,110
还在查
We're getting there.

761
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,900
我们通过最终收款人已经确定了
On the receiving end, we've already identified

762
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,360
大约一半与阿布・纳齐尔有联系的人
half a dozen known associates of Abu Nazir.

763
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,110
资金来源呢
What about the source?

764
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,310
我们把名字输入交易记录中
We're still putting names to the transactions,

765
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,690
全部指向伊朗
but it's all pointing to Iran.

766
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,860
不仅仅是这个国家
Not just the country.

767
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,520
而是直接指向政府内部
Inside the government.

768
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,540
他们为什么会突然决定合作了
So why did they suddenly decide to cooperate?

769
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,100
不确定  我们该查清楚
I'm not sure. We want to know.

770
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,590
这是什么
What is this?

771
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,770
我横向比较各个账户时发现的
Something I noticed when I was reconciling the accounts horizontally.

772
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,630
所有来自伊朗的资金有20%流向了银行
All the Iranian funds had 20% stripped off by our banker friends--

773
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,840
这是处理违法交易的标准收费
a standard fee for prohibited transactions.

774
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,960
但  其中四分之一不见了
But... a quarter of that disappeared.

775
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,120
去哪儿了
To where?

776
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,600
还不清楚
I don't know yet.

777
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,000
就凭空消失了
Just seems to have vanished.

778
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,100
反正银行没有吞这笔钱
All I know is it was not retained by their bank.

779
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:19,990
查清楚
Find it.

780
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,660
-查清楚这钱到哪儿去了  -我尽力
- Find out where it went. - I'm trying.

781
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,540
这是你的首要任务
Make it your number one priority.

782
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,000
这些钱就是关键
That right there, that's the key.

783
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,580
近四千五百万美元
Almost $45 million.

784
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,710
法拉
Fara...

785
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,350
是  长官
Yes, sir?

786
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,290
这事先暂时保密
Keep it between us, for the time being.

787
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,980
我不知道你想证明什么
I don't know what you think you're proving.

788
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,250
但大家只是想让你服药
All anyone's asking is that you take your meds.

789
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,720
这是你逼我们的
I mean, you're not leaving us any choice.

790
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,260
这就是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

791
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,940
她在那边
Right over there.

792
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,810
卡莉
Carrie.

793
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,420
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

794
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,250
操...
Fuck...

795
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,560
你妈  索尔
You, Saul.
