70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,839
宝贝...
Babe...

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,001
或者 说说往事?
Share a memory, perhaps?

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,289
再或者 念首诗 或者一首歌词
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,886
有人要来吗?
Anyone?

74

先生?

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,802
马文他

与众不同

78
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,881
他是个

神枪手
a very good shot.

80
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,485
有人说他
Some would say that

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,847
是妄想症
he was paranoid.

82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,719
不过中情局给你服用了超过十年的迷幻药
But you have to expect a little of that when the CIA's dosing you with LSD

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,087
这情况很正常
for a little more than a decade.

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,129
他布置炸弹的速度
He could wire a bomb

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,802
比我见过的任何人都快
faster than anybody I ever met.

86
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,764
摩尔多瓦善良的人们永远
The good people of Moldova will always

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,011
都应该记得马文的恩德
be in Marvin's debt.

88
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,089
他真的是个好朋友
He was a really good friend.

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,450
- 我们得搬家  - 加拿大?

97
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,090
听着 宝贝...
Listen, babe...

98
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,841
据说在经历过大的悲伤之后...
You know they say it's really important not to make big...

99
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,204
最好不要做重大的决定
life-altering decisions right after a loss.

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,086
如果他们能追到马文 他们就能追到你也能追到我
If they can get to Marvin, they can get to you and they can get to me.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,731
他们是谁?
Who are they?

102

- I'm not leaving you.  - Listen...

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,161
不会有事的
It'll be all right.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,439
你们是?
What is it?

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,487
摩西先生...
Mr. Moses...

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,287
海军罪案调查处要讯问你
They want to debrief you at a Yankee White Facility.

110
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,720

I got a document right here that says that you have a special interest in the Cold War.

133

140
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,131
他们是来杀我们的
They're coming to kill us.

141
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,091
打开我的手铐
Get me outta these cuffs.

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,611
恕难从命 先生
I can't do that, sir.

143
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
你带着钥匙 对吧?
You have the key, right?

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
举起手来!
Hands up!

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,047
还有50尺
50 feet.

146
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,080
你不给我打开手铐的话 他们会把我们都杀掉的
They're gonna kill us both, if you don't get me outta these cuffs.

147
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,321
来吧
Come on.

148
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,363
弗兰克・摩西
Frank Moses.

149
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,563
其实要论军功 你是我心目中的英雄
You know, coming up through the ranks, you were my hero.

150
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
不过岁月不饶人 再厉害也不得不服老吧
Given enough time, I guess everyone cracks.

151
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,961
对吧 弗兰克?
Huh, Frank?

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,359
- 你是谁?  - 我?
- Who are you?  - Me?

153
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,361
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,087
我是政府雇佣来获取情报的人
I'm the guy the government hires to get information.

155
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,447
而且我可以进行我认为合理的任何形式的刑讯逼供
And I'm allowed to use any form of torture I deem fit.

156
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,010
而且如果你不开口我会对萨拉用刑
And I will torture Sarah until you speak.

157
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,441
说到萨拉 我喜欢看着她
Speaking of Sarah, I love watching her

158
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,530
躺在浴缸里刮腿毛
shave her legs in the tub.

159
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,801
让我想起了我在刚果遇到的那些比利时佣兵
Kinda reminds me of these Belgian mercs I met in the Congo.

160
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,324
为了逼供他们会活剥人皮
They would skin people alive to get them to talk.

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,410
你知道他们总哪里开始剥吗?
And do you know where they started?

162
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,201
猜猜
Guess.

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,449
从脚踝 跟你的萨拉一样
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,047
那么...
So...

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,811
要么你给我我要的情报...
You either give me the information that I need to know...

166
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,605
要么我毫不留情得把你的女人凌迟了
Or I'm gonna fillet your girl from head to toe with no mercy.

167
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,520
很好
Awesome.

168
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,121
喔
Wow.

169
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,767
对一个退休人员来说身手不错 可是你难道...
Pretty good for a retired guy. But are you...

170
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,039
一二三四五六...
1-2-3-4-5-6...

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,122
七对一 你还被铐着 手无寸铁也可以吗?
7-on-1 cuffed with no weapon good?

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,321
他妈的...
Son of a...

173
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,522
上 快 快 快!
Go. Go, go, go!

174
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,565
打伤就行了 留活口
Shoot him, but don't kill him.

175
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,203
好吧 打死也可以 包抄上去
All right, kill him. Spray it up.

176
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,204
弗兰克 这是你的最后机会
Frank, this is your last chance.

177
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,640
开火
Fire.

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,006
进去! 快!
Get in there! Go!

179
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,845
该死
Shit.

180
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,081
马文!
Marvin!

181
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,206
- 你快把我逼疯了!  - 我带钥匙来了
- You're driving me crazy!  - I brought the key.

182
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,205
你又装死
You faked your death.

183
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,283
- 该走了  - 我们走
- Gotta go.  - Let's go.

184
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,761
走吧
Gotta go.

185
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,642
你知道这给我惹了多大麻烦吗!
You have no idea what you put me through!

186
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,919
哦! 谢天谢地 你没事
Oh! Thank God, you're okay.

187
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,921
不!
No!

188
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,761
- 你来干什么?  - 马文带我来的 从安全房
- What are you doing here?  - Marvin brought me. From the house.

189
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,079
难道所有人都疯了吗?
Has everybody lost their mind?

190
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,687
- 马文 你不能把那样的女人扯进来  - 我总要知道你没事 对吧?
- Marv, you don't bring a girl like that here.  - I had to see if you were okay, didn't I?

191
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,359
宝贝!
Honey!

192
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,169
- 我觉得...  - 怎么了?
- I thought...  - What?

193
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,842
记得我们说过你不能参与这些吗?
Remember when we had that conversation about how you were gonna lay low?

194
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,883
你也没说哪些不能参与
You don't get to tell me when to lay.

195
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,050
我想说 我不是那个意思
I mean, I'm not saying that.

196
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,164
别说了 别说了 别... 不
Stop. Just don't. Just don't... No.

197
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,125
- 你现在生我气了?  - 你对我像瓷娃娃一样
- You're mad at me now?  - You treat me like a china doll.

198
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,679
弗兰克 我能给你一些关于女人的建议吗?
Frank, can I give you a little advice about women?

199
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,841
不能! 完全不能!
No! Absolutely not!

200
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,039
这样 你应该扪心自问
Listen, you gotta ask yourself,

201
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,079
一个那样的女人跟你这样一个货在一起图什么?
what is a girl like that doing with a guy like you?

202
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,844
肯定不是因为你长得帅
It ain't for your looks.

203
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,884
听着 我要开枪了 打烂你的肝
You know, I will shoot you. I will shoot you in the liver.

204
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,119
冒险 浪漫 危险 行动 这才是你能为伴侣分享的东西
Adventure, romance, danger, activities you can share as a couple.

205
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,043
是你骗我的事
It's about you lying to me.

206
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,447
弗兰克...
Frank...

207
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,364
你在我的葬礼上哭我很感动
I was very touched that you cried at my funeral.

208
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,766
没有的事
That's not true.

209
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,924
我在你葬礼没有哭
I didn't cry at your funeral.

210
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,050
我从来不哭
I'm no crier.

211
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,927
九十六个小时之前 有人在网络上发布了一份文件
Ninety-six hours ago, somebody posted a document on the Internet

212
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,489
称你我曾经在79年参与过一个叫"龙葵"的行动
that said you and I took part in an operation called Nightshade back in '79.

213
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,559
所以你才会装死?
That's why you fake died?

214
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,086
是 这引起了极大关注
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.

215
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,359
所以所有这些追你们的人认为你们知道一些
So everybody's after you for something they think you know

216
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,362
你们其实并不知道的事?
that you don't even know at all?

217
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,759
哦 天呐! 蜘蛛!
Oh, my God! Spiders!

218
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,366
宝贝 你应该离开去一个我不知道的地方
Honey, you need to go to ground and it's best I don't know where.

219
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,199
不 我哪也不去
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

220
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,524
- 只花现金 别打电话 别联系  - 谢谢 这样...
- Cash only. No calls. No contacts.  - Thanks. Look...

221
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,879
你在外边溜来溜去跟幽昧的国际危险女性一起拯救世界的时候
I'm not hanging out in some bunker while you slink around and save the planet

222
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,439
我才不要躲在某个地堡里
with dusky international femme fatales.

223
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,599
- 幽昧?  - 幽暗 烟熏的意思
- Dusky?  - Dark, smoldering.

224
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,250
我知道什么意思 马文
I know what it means, Marvin.

225
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,639
有你在场的情况下
It's hard to be the kinda person I have to be right now

226
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,281
我做不了我自己 也办不成该办的事
and do the kinda things that I'm going to have to do while you're here.

227
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,130
这会对我们有好处的
This is gonna be good for us.

228
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,879
我们要做什么?
What are we doing?

229
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,999
面对吧 可伦坡 一切都变了
Let's face it, Columbo, things were getting a little stale.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,119
喔 妈妈在饭桌上扇了爸爸一巴掌哇
Wow. Mommy just slapped Daddy at the dinner table.

231
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,839
后备箱里有个人?
Is there a human being in the trunk?

232
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,887
是
Yeah.

233
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,645
是谁 马文?
Who is it, Marvin?

234
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,802
他是军情六处的一位高级主管
He's a Senior Director of Military Intelligence.

235
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,208
我已经折磨他好多天了
I've been caramelizing his onions for a couple of days.

236
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,640
怎么折磨?
Caramelizing how?

237
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,323
三勺酸液和很多老鼠
With three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.

238
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,411
啊!
Dang!

239
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,411
{\an8}五角大楼

240
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,366
11个人死了 5个是联邦调查局的 国防部长想要一个简报?
Eleven people dead. Five FBI. And the SecDef wants a briefing?

241
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,649
你是干嘛吃的
You were brought in to contain this.

242
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,801
冷静点
Calm down.

243
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,162
我不信这么多年了 这件事还会找上我
I can't believe this is coming back on me after so many years.

244
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,639
将军 摩西和博格斯已经被彻底孤立了
General, Moses and Boggs have been completely isolated.

245
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,679
联邦调查局要以涉嫌凶杀逮捕他们
The FBI is seeking them for the murders.

246
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,889
国土安全局已经正式接到通知 说他们是恐怖分子
Homeland has been informed that they are officially domestic terrorists.

247
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,359
这样做靠谱吗?
Is that gonna work?

248
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,407
是的
Yes.

249
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,639
问题是只要网上有那个文件
The problem is with that document surfacing on the Internet,

250
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,086
所有人都会去追寻龙葵的下落
all the players will be coming after Nightshade.

251
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,404
纸包不住火
It'll open the book on this.

252
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,208
我要给国防部长打电话 我们得把这件事公布于众
I'm calling SecDef. We need to go public.

253
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
将军...
General...

254
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,850
没有人可以把这件事公布于众
Nobody's going public.

255
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,640
我们需要为摩西制定一个新计划
We need a new plan for Moses.

256
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,723
我需要你批准一个专家参与此事
I need you to approve a specialist.

257
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,159
什么专家? 中央情报局的?
What? CIA?

258
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,891
我已经试过了 他们对付不了那些家伙
It's been tried, sir. Didn't work so well for those guys.

259
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,719
去请韩秋白 他是最厉害的
Han Cho Bai. He's the best.

260
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,767
那就去吧
Do it.

261
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,246
香港

262
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,246
衣服也脱下来
Suit, too.

263
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,011
好了 他没问题
Okay, he's clean.

264
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,841
没搞错吧?
Seriously?

265
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,883
请坐 韩先生
Sit down, Mr. Han.

266
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,442
你的安保措施不错嘛
Your security is impressive.

267
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,803
他是一个商业伙伴
A business associate.

268
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,771
胡里奥・阿尔瓦兹・费尔南德斯
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.

269
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,531
很难接近
Very difficult to get close to.

270
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,171
当然 这必须处理得像一个意外事故
Of course, it must appear like an accident.

271
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,159
没问题 除了一件事
Not a problem. Except for one thing.

272
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,286
嗯?
Mmm?

273
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,567
费尔南德斯先生出价更高
Mr. Fernandes pays better.

274
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,927
喂?
Yeah?

275
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,361
目标是谁?
Who's the target?

276
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,086
噢 是你的一个老朋友 弗兰克・摩西
Oh, it's an old pal of yours. Frank Moses.

277
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,608
报应到了 弗兰克
Karma is a bitch, Frank.

278
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,208
伦敦 军情六处总部

279
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,360
这又是怎么了?
What is this?

280
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,519
维基解密文件上有一个标志
There's a watchword flag on a WikiLeaks document.

281
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,682
表示它是最高机密文件
It's coded Priority One Alpha Seven.

282
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,041
- 有个叫龙葵的东西  - 闭嘴!
- Something called Nightshade.  - Shut up!

283
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,921
快出去
Get out.

284
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,247
给我找维多利亚・温斯洛
Find me Victoria Winslow.

285
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,764
菲利普斯主任?
Director Philips?

286
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,525
嗯...
Um...

287
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,969
我这里有客人
I'm with someone right now.

288
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,250
看来你还是闲不住啊
Keeping busy, I see.

289
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,242
游手好闲 造恶之源
Idle hands do the Devil's work.

290
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,361
没错
Yes.

291
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,599
我知道你能接近弗兰克・摩西
I understand you can get close to Frank Moses.

292
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,601
没错
Yes.

293
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,042
军情六处有任务给你
MI6 has a job for you.

294
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,926
如果你想活命 就接受它
If you want to stay alive, you're going to accept it.

295
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,604
是时候选择立场了 维多利亚
It's time to choose sides, Victoria.

296
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,041
他们在哪儿教会你们这些东西的?
Where do they teach you guys this stuff?

297
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,599
看说明书 自学
Manuals, mostly.

298
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,011
嗯
Mmm.

299
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,121
一些东西是教不来的
Some of this stuff you just can't teach.

300
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,721
哇
Wow.

301
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,370
这不是很酷吗?
Isn't this cool?

302
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,969
我们一起完成任务
We're on a mission together.

303
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,119
你知道现在有多少人想要杀死我们吗?
Do you have any idea how many people are trying to kill us right now?

304
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,639
我们都明白 这里才是你应该在的地方
You and I both know that this is where you belong.

305
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,519
就在这儿
Right here. In the thick of it.

306
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,522
美人儿说得对 弗兰克
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.

307
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,206
走吧
Here we go.

308
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,486
小心脚下
Watch your step.

309
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,086
怎么了?
What?

310
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,527
噢
Oh.

311
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,451
拜托!
Come on!

312
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,127
- 这是从哪儿来的?  - 嗯... 马文给我的
- Where did you get this?  - Um... Marvin.

313
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,879
- 你给她枪?  - 这是美国 弗兰克
- You gave her a gun?  - It is America, Frank.

314
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,804
除了我大家都有枪
Everyone else has a gun.

315
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,849
她根本不会用
She has no idea what to do with this.

316
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,319
我会用
I know exactly what to do with it.

317
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,765
哦!
Ow!

318
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,006
别让小白碰火器
You don't give fire to a kitten.

319
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,167
你怎么不再给她点炸药呢 马文?
Why don't you just give her some dynamite, Marvin?

320
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,328
西格这枪没保险哈?
No external safety on the Sig?

321
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,610
把刚才告诉我的再跟他说一遍
Tell him what you told me.

322
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,239
冷战期间
At the height of the Cold War,

323
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,879
美国一个将军炮制了龙葵
Nightshade was cooked up by a rogue US general

324
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,519
想利用它对苏联进行先发打击
as a first strike capability against the Soviets.

325
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,249
- 说完了 我能走了吗?  - 说完了?
- That's it. Can I go?  - That's it?

326
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,679
- 想来点这个配胡椒吗?  - 不 好吧! 冷战期间
- You want a little pepper with that?  - No, okay! At the height of the Cold War,

327
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,839
通过外交邮件 一个兆吨当量的核装置
a megaton-yield device was smuggled into Moscow

328
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,039
被偷运到莫斯科 拆开来运进来的 然后这东西丢了 就这些
in diplomatic pouches, piece by piece, and then the weapon was lost. That's it.

329
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,804
你们在莫斯科弄丢了一件核武器?
You lost a nuke in Moscow?

330
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,651
制造它的科学家是爱德华・白利 就这些
The scientist was Edward Bailey. That's it.

331
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,121
怎么了?
What?

332
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,525
我犯了一个错误
I made a mistake.

333
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,159
爱德华・白利是一个天才物理学家
Edward Bailey was a genius physicist who built some of the greatest stuff

334
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,519
他在冷战时期制造过了很多杰作
during the Cold War.

335
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,606
中子弹 粒子束武器 神经毒气 非常厉害
Neutron bombs, particle beam weapons, nerve gas. Excellent nerve gas.

336
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,319
他是大规模杀伤武器方面的明星
He was a rock star of conceptual mass killing.

337
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,402
他们称他"死神达芬奇"
They called him "The Da Vinci of Death."

338
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,239
那时我们被安排去保护他在莫斯科的安全
We were the security detail assigned to getting him in and out of Moscow safely.

339
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,366
然后呢?
What happened?

340
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,641
我们以为他是安全的 苏联政府策划了一场汽车爆炸 抓到了他
We thought he was secure. The Soviets got him with a car bomb.

341
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,011
这都怪我
It was my fault.

342
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,601
他死了
He's dead.

343
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,805
我们是逃是战?
Run or fight?

344
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,279
我们只有这个维基解密网页
All we've got is this WikiLeaks page off the Internet.

345
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,001
从一个巴黎的IP地址发表的
Out of a Paris IP.

346
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,130
嗯 可能是巴黎的任何人
Hmm. Paris could be anybody.

347
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,610
等一下 等一下 后退一秒钟
Wait. Wait. Scroll back down for a second.

348
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,163
- 那是什么?  - 噢
- What is that?  - Oh.

349
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,727
嗯...
Uh...

350
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,840
咖啡的污渍?
Coffee stain?

351
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,606
嗯 是酒渍
Mmm. Wine.

352
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,921
青蛙
Frog.

353
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,039
什么?
What?

354
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,921
没事
We're okay.

355
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,721
是找你的
Your number.

356
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,439
喂
Yeah.

357
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,239
军情六处刚刚聘请我去杀你
MI6 has just given me a contract to kill you.

358
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,279
很显然 你涉嫌核恐怖分子 以及谋杀
Apparently, you're guilty of nuclear terrorism, murder,

359
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,965
并且是国际刑警的头号通缉犯
and you're number one on Interpol's Most Wanted.

360
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,479
那你说什么了?
What did you say?

361
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,679
哦 我说"可以啊"
Oh, I said "Yes. "

362
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,199
你知道 他们给的钱很多
You know, the money's good.

363
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
总之 就算我不做 其他人也会做
And anyway, if I don't do it, somebody else will.

364
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,279
哦 你应该知道美国也在派其他人去杀你
Oh, and you should know the Americans are sending someone also.

365
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,281
谁?
Who?

366
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,761
韩
Han.

367
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,719
糟透了 不是吗?
It's bad, isn't it?

368
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,959
- 你身边那个是马文吗?  - 对 还有萨拉
- Is that Marvin?  - Yes. And Sarah.

369
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,319
噢! 代我向他们问好
Aw! Send them my love, will you?

370
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,840
他们要把我逼疯了
They're driving me crazy.

371
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,839
马文给她一支枪
Marvin gave her a gun.

372
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,559
- 上膛了吗?  - 对!上膛了!
- Was it loaded?  - Yes! Yes!

373
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,119
你正被枪指着呢?
Are you being controlling?

374
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,531
没有!
No!

375
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,808
男女关系一定要把握好机会啊
You have to take chances in a relationship.

376
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,605
你得主动点
You have to be supportive.

377
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,559
我不想让她参加 我只要她安全
I don't need her to fit in. I just need her to be safe.

378
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,722
去租张碟 "脏舞"就行了 告诉她你爱她
Just rent. Dirty Dancing, tell her you love her.

379
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,126
在你还能享受生活的时候就赶紧去享受
You know, it's important to enjoy life while you still can.

380
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,605
维多利亚刚刚接受了中情六处委托 来杀我们
Victoria just accepted a contract from MI6 to kill all three of us.

381
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,639
你认为她不会那么做的 是吧? 弗兰克 她不会那么做的?
You don't think she'd do that, do you? Frank, you don't think she'd do that?

382
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,039
她是我们的朋友
She's a friend.

383
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,919
弗兰克 你傻吗? 你从没受雇去杀一个朋友吗?
Frank, what, are you stupid? You never took a contract out to kill a friend?

384
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,241
她打电话只是警告我们
She called to give us fair warning.

385
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,206
拜托 还有一件事呢
Come on. There's one more thing.

386
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,399
韩才是最大的麻烦
Han just went number one.

387
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,999
还不如直接把老二泡在蜂蜜里
Why don't they just dip our balls in honey

388
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,526
塞到蚂蚁窝里去算了?
and stake us to an ant farm?

389
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,807
快点
Come on.

390
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,931
喔! 疯狂的老混蛋
Whoa! Crazy old bastard.

391
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,279
弗兰克 你觉得自己老了吗?
Frank, do you feel old?

392
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,319
- 没有啊  - 我也是
- Not really.  - Me neither.

393
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,639
我有时候确实有点疯狂
I mean, crazy sometimes, I guess.

394
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,880
韩是谁?
Who's Han?

395
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,806
韩是谁?
Who's Han?

396
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,601
一个跟情报局作对的韩国人
Korean. Counter-intel.

397
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,599
弗兰克把他抓进监狱关了几年
Frank put him in jail for a few years.

398
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,399
那我们就应该怕他了 是吧?
We should be super-scared of him, huh?

399
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,609
没错 他是世界上最好的职业杀手
Yes. He is the best contract killer in the world.

400
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,007
我找到了一个销声匿迹近20年的身份
I've got a hit off an old alias, silent for almost 20 years.

401
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,799
他在逃脱追捕
He's dodging watch lists.

402
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,601
没错 他明早九点乘私人飞机从泰特波罗去巴黎
Bingo. Private flight to Paris scheduled for 09:00 out of Teterboro.

403
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,165
找到宾馆 查到分布图 和经理换岗的时间表
Find their hotel. Get blueprints and workups on the day and night managers.

404
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,087
让万斯在机场等我们
Have Vance meet us on the ground.

405
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,087
新泽西州 泰特波罗

406
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,527
他们在下一层 两个相邻的房间 监视运行正常
They're one floor down. Two adjoining rooms. Surveillance is almost up and running.

407
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,926
这比我想像的简单多了
This is going to be easier than I thought.

408
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,961
嗨 请讲
Hello. Speaking.

409
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,087
是的
Yes.

410
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,959
- 他们在哪儿?  - 刚才还在
- Where are they?  - They were here.

411
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,450
他们一点才定了客房服务
They ordered room service at 1:00.

412
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,720

Let's just say that Frank is in some very, very deep dog doo.

419
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,879
- 他杀不了我的  - 没错
- He's not gonna kill me.  - Yeah.

420
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,879
- 没有人能杀掉弗兰克・摩西  - 对!
- Nobody kills Frank Moses.  - Right!

421
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,679
对于不喜欢的人 他会折磨很久

422

Maybe five, six, maybe, bottles left in the world. It's pretty pricey.

430
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,009

453
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,039

You don't know the half of it. She and Frank were young.

454
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,681
他不知道她在为俄罗斯工作
And he didn't have the slightest idea she was working for the Russians.

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,563
不可能 龙葵是疯子的一个阴谋
Never! Nightshade was the plot of lunatics.

551
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,639
我过去跟你们一样 被洗脑被恐吓
I used to be like you. Driven by ideology and fear

552
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,688
从不思考这个世界多么美丽和可爱
with no love of what's beautiful in the world.

553
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,851
我才不信你们这些畜生!
I can't trust animals like you!

554
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,685
随你们便
Do what you will.

555
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,681
死很容易
Death is easy.

556
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,530
这无关目的地 而是旅程
It's not about the destination. It's about the journey.

557
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,603
死亡是俄罗斯的一种艺术形式
Death is an art form in Russia.

558
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,643
让人生不如死的方法太多了
There are so many ways to take a man to bits.

559
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,724
要不要试试车臣整容? 往下按住他!
Shall we start with a Chechen facelift? Hold him down!

560
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,359
停! 停！
Stop! Stop it!

561
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,919
我们就是这么来的
This is how we do it.

562
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,323
拜托 你那么勇敢
Please. You're so brave.

563
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,879
但你要明白
But you have to understand

564
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,602
我们做这些是有原因的 还有...
we're doing this for the right reasons. And this...

565
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,569
为此放弃你的生命不值得
This isn't worth your life.

566
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,248
你肯定还生有所求
You must have something to live for.

567
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,360
艺术
Art.

568
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
美酒
Wine.

569
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,839
女人?
Women?

570
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,921
哎
Hey.

571
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,126
帮帮我们
Help us.

572
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,764
我们需要这个情报
We need this information.

573
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,488
你在帮我们拯救世界 拜托
You'll be helping us save the world. Please.

574
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,763
嗯
Mmm.

575
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,966
因为你 我帮了
You, I'll help.

576
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,131
让一下
Excuse me.

577
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,681
谢谢
Thank you.

578
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,885
你没戏
And you can suck it.

579
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,679
宝贝? 甜心?
Baby? Honey?

580
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,127
认真的么? 你跟她搞一起了?
Seriously? You hooked up with that?

581
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,120
了不起的女人
What a woman.

582
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,969
这两件裙子一样的吗?
Is that the same dress?

583
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,810
在你看来它们是一样的?
They look the same to you?

584
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,843
没人叫过我是弗兰克・摩西的克星
No one ever called me Frank Moses' kryptonite.

585
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,199
弗兰克疯狂的爱着你
Frank's crazy about you.

586
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,885
我从没见过他那么怕失去你
I've never seen him afraid of anything except losing you.

587
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,643
可我是不是正在毁了他的生活?
What if I'm ruining his life?

588
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,489
弗兰克是那种头脑简单欲求单一的动物
Frank is a very simple creature with very simple needs.

589
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,690
好吗? 就只是杀人
Okay? It's killing,

590
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,011
吃饱
eating,

591
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,166
一夜情
sexting,

592
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,846
吃饱...
eating...

593
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,927
杀人 我猜
Killing, I guess.

594
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,687
你想说什么?
What's your point?

595
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,410
我不敢相信你亲了青蛙
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.

596
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,326
我亲过很多只青蛙
Well, I've kissed a lotta frogs.

597
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,679
- 我有东西给你  - 什么?
- I got something for ya.  - What is it?

598
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,524
青蛙存款保险柜的钥匙
The key to The Frog's security deposit box.

599
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,367
- 从哪弄的?  - 法国里昂信贷银行
- From?  - Credit Lyonnais.

600
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,767
宝宝 我有个要求
Baby, I have a request.

601
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,765
嗯
Uh-huh.

602
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,525
今晚和我出去吃个饭如何?
How would you feel about going out to dinner with me tonight?

603
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,329
- 嗯  - 怎么说这里是巴黎
- Hmm.  - It is Paris, after all.

604
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,079
好啊 太好了!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

605
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,608
待在这 我就回来
Stay here. I'll be right back.

606
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,571
弗兰克 我需要你
I need you, Frank.

607
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,090
现在不行
It's not a good time.

608
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,530
我们有个线人提供了一些真实情报
One of our old assets has some real information.

609
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,764
他现在要跟我们见面
He needs to meet with us right now.

610
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,801
不
Nah.

611
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,924
弗兰克 你在干嘛? 她是你的克星 你在干嘛?
Frank, what are you doing? She's kryptonite. What are you doing?

612
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,282
- 我能应付  - 你确定?
- I'll handle it.  - Are you sure?

613
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,607
嗯
Yeah.

614
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,279
不好意思 有点工作要做
It's not okay. It's just some work.

615
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,126
- 别这样 多没意思  - 去吧 和你的俄国情人工作去吧
- No, it's not fun.  - Go. You and Svetlana, you work it out.

616
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,769
我保证我准时回来陪你吃饭
I promise you that I will be back in time for dinner.

617
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,121
我会回来的
I'll be back.

618
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,761
保护好她
Keep her safe.

619
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,609
弗兰克 我们之间怎么了?
What happened to us, Frank?

620
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,371
- 这个...  - 嗯
- Well...  - Hmm.

621
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,130
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

622
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,244
你离开了我 差点杀了我
You set me up. Tried to kill me.

623
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,765
我差点杀了你
I tried to kill you.

624
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,201
美好的旧时光啊 不是么?
They were good times, weren't they?

625
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,799
你知道么 如果你让我背叛我的国家
You know, if you'd asked me to betray my country,

626
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,801
我就不得不下狠心的
you know I would have.

627
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,200
好的 女士
Yes, Madam.

628
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,281
天啊
My God.

629
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,849
你知道么 我曾去找过你
You know, I looked you up once.

630
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,480
那时你住在洛杉矶的一间小屋里
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.

631
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,362
门前种着一大片玫瑰花
There were roses out in front.

632
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,524
但我那时没勇气
But I lost my nerve.

633
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,843
你想怎么样?
So what do you want?

634
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,687
弗兰克 记忆里都是和你共事 都是纪律束缚
It was all about work with you, Frank. Rules.

635
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,531
不关纪律
Not rules.

636
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,526
对错
Right and wrong.

637
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,406
你知道么 尽管我当时有自己的个人感情
You know, it's harder for me not to follow orders.

638
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,767
但我不能不遵从命令
Despite my personal feelings.

639
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,924
感觉超越一切甚至对错
But feelings don't matter any more than right or wrong.

640
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,047
但是命令却有对错
Orders matter.

641
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,891
命令?
Orders?

642
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,882
俄罗斯要从这拿一些东西
Russia will handle things from here.

643
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,569
弗兰克 我要拿走那把钥匙
I'm taking the key, Frank.

644
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,204
我不会让你拿走的
I can't let that happen.

645
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,846
不会?
No?

646
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,045
我胳膊没知觉了
I can't feel my arms.

647
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,605
在堪萨斯好好享受
Enjoy Kansas.

648
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,086
嗯
Hmm.

649
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,966
他晕了
He's out.

650
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,050
他好像醒了
He might be awake.

651
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,770
正好 那他能感觉到了
Oh, good. So he can feel it.

652
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,770
你整个职业生涯有被人下过药吗?
Did you ever, ever in your entire career let yourself get drugged?

653
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,764
你还喜欢她!
You still like her!

654
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,559
现在她拿走了钥匙!
And now she has the key!

655
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,609
她没拿走这把钥匙 她只是拿了一把钥匙
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.

656
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,121
什么?
What?

657
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,126
我知道这女人肯定会像弹班卓琴一样玩弄他
I knew she would play him like a banjo at an Ozark Hoedown.

658
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,283
所以我收好了
So I have the key.

659
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,966
水
Water.

660
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,165
我是待了多久?
How long was I out for?

661
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,165
有一些是他的
Some of it's his.

662
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,045
马文 你也有份?
Et tu Marvin?

663
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,487
弗兰克 潮流是生活中唯一不变的
Style is the only constant in life, Frank.

664
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,483
之前的假期我们没来过巴黎
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.

665
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,050
哦 在巴黎我想你能做的就是
Oh. Shopping's what I thought you did in Paris

666
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,964
花男朋友的票子去购物来作为补偿
with your boyfriend's money

667
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,850
当他被衣衫不整的 放荡的
while you're waiting for him

668
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,959
俄国贱前女友迷晕放倒
to wake up from being taken down

669
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,679
你还得辛苦的等着他醒过来
by his skanky, slutty, Russian biatch ex-girlfriend.

670
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,159
感谢 感谢你赞美我这件皮草
So thanks. Thanks. Thanks for the compliment for the fur.

671
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,999
因为你说我穿这件裙子很美 我感觉相当好
For telling me that I look nice in my dress. It makes me feel really good.

672
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,685
这样也让我感觉好有爱
And it makes me feel very loving towards you also.

673
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,639
她为什么要这么对我?
Why is she doing this to me?

674
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,244
我们打的过去吧
We can get a taxi over here.

675
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,079
弗兰克 听着 我跟你说些事
Frank, listen, I gotta tell you something.

676
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,722
你要学会分享你的感受 来挽回这段感情
You have to start to learn to share your feelings to evolve your relationship.

677
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,519
尽管做到这点一开始会很不适应
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.

678
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,359
就说你身处枪林弹雨中
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.

679
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,967
如果你原地不动 你就会没命 行吗?
If you stay where you are, you're gonna die. Okay?

680
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,039
现在你告诉我 你要怎么做?
So, you tell me, what do you do?

681
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,359
行动起来
Make the run.

682
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:29,163
对 你必须行动直到感觉安全了
Yes. You have got to make the run to emotional safety.

683
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,841
啊
Huh.

684
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,559
摩西 你死了没?
You dead yet, Moses?

685
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,641
还没
Not yet.

686
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,639
我的飞机呢?
Where's my plane?

687
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,846
在我菊花里!
In my ass!

688
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,126
- 在巴黎外郊飞机场那  - 你到底...闭嘴!
- It's in an airport outside of Paris.  - What are you... Shut up!

689
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,291
快离开这
Let's get outta here.

690
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,525
- 马文?  - 嗯?
- Marvin?  - Yeah?

691
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,688
你口袋里是不是还有一颗炸弹?
Is that a stick of dynamite in your pocket?

692
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,242
是啊 我留着它是为了以防万一
Yeah, but I'm saving it for an emergency.

693
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,442
那 现在不就是万一的紧急时刻了吗?
Well, this is kind of an emergency, isn't it?

694
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,839
我给她的那把钥匙与一个极其猖獗的恐怖组织有关
The key I gave her is connected to a particularly nasty terrorist cell

695
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,842
就是他们保险柜的钥匙
and their safe deposit box.

696
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,164
法国人解决这类事很完美啊
The French take this kinda thing pretty seriously.

697
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,806
够了
That's enough.

698
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,879
放开我! 立即放开我!
Put me down! Put me down now!

699
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,801
好吧
All right.

700
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,526
我们得快走了 莫斯科会在一小时内放了她
We gotta move quickly, Moscow will have her out within the hour.

701
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,047
再见了美国情人
For the love of Mike.

702
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,646
是的
All right.

703
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,050
我没和你说话
I'm still not talking to you.

704
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,802
这是一份关于龙葵的军情六处报告
All right. This is an MI6 report on Project Nightshade.

705
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,210
是关于安置核装置的那个特工
It's about the operative that placed the device.

706
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,722
他们拘留并把他处以ICE
They took him into custody and put him on ICE.

707
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,399
什么是ICE?
What's ICE?

708
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,009
监禁但不能处死 他们会把谁留在ICE长达三十二年呢?
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute. Who would they keep on ICE for 32 years?

709
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,362
- 快 得走了  - 去哪? 哦!
- Come on. Gotta go.  - Come on where? Oh!

710
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,521
她怎么会发现我们?
How could she have possibly found us?

711
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,603
因为我打电话告诉她我们要来
Cause I called her and told her we were coming.

712
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,764
与其被偷偷干掉 不如面对面比较好
I couldn't take the pressure of not knowing.

713
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,607
为什么她还不开枪?
Why isn't she shooting at us?

714
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,648
这样能使我们省下二十四小时
That should buy us 24 hours.

715
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,809
你好 亲爱的
Hello, sweetie.

716
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,801
下次你俩再制定这样一个计划时
You know, the next time you two make a plan like this,

717
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,360
最起码要让我参与进来
you could at least let me in on it.

718
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,679
弗兰克 你在怀疑我的判断力
Frank, you're compromising me.

719
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,366
鬼知道你会不会昏了头告诉那女人?
Who knows what some girl is gonna squeeze out of you?

720
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,729
你从哪找的这些尸体?
Where'd you get the bodies?

721
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,651
我的冰箱里
My freezer.

722
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,370
快起来
Come on. Wake up.

723
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,839
喂?
Yeah?

724
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,999
事办的怎样了?
What the hell's going on?

725
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,319
- 长官?  - 从青蛙那得到什么了吗?
- Sir?  - Get anything from The Frog?

726
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,847
还没 在我们谈之前他服了种毒
No, he took some sorta poison before we really talked.

727
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,045
我觉得他现在什么都说不出来
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.

728
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,839
你必须找到摩西和博格斯
You've got to find Moses and Boggs.

729
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,490
嗯 嗯
Mmm. Mmm.

730
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,367
别担心 我在追踪
Don't worry. I'm on the trail.

731
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,200
在你的右边 能欣赏到著名的伦敦塔
On your right, you see the famous Tower of London.

732
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,725
很快 我们将在伦敦桥下穿过
And shortly, we'll be passing under the Tower Bridge.

733
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,930
这是个城堡
It's a fortress.

734
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,879
这是所专收精神病罪犯的精神病院 他在ICE间
It's an asylum for the criminally insane. He's in the ICE unit.

735
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,408
那是被军情六处深埋在地下的最高安全设施
That's an MI6 Alpha Level secure facility buried deep within that building.

736
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,963
就像是一所监狱中的监狱
It's like a prison within a prison.

737
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,404
那我们怎么到那?
How are we gonna get in there?

738
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,759
她想要我的头! 她想要我的头! 这是个天主教徒的阴谋
She wants my head! She wants my head! It's a Papist plot.

739
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,559
是她 就是玛丽那个贱人 苏格兰女王 她想要我的头
It's her. It's that bitch Mary, Queen of Scots. She wants my head.

740
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,519
你们在干什么? 放开我! 放开我!
What are you doing? No! No!

741
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,046
把塞西尔带来 把塞西尔带来 我才是英国女王
Get me Cecil. Get me Cecil. I'm the Queen of England!

742
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,199
不要把我带到塔里! 你个贱人 我要砍你的头!
Don't take me to the Tower! I'll have your head for this, you bitch!

743
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,487
不! 不!
No! No!

744
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,522
"为王者无安宁"
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

745
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,605
他们都在谋害我
They're plotting against me. All of them.

746
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,999
这才是好女王
There's a good queen.

747
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,086
够了 老疯子
Stuff it, you old bat.

748
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,881
谢谢你
Thank you.

749
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,841
如果你不介意的话 还不是很"老"
Not so much the "old," if you don't mind.

750
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,799
我觉得我演的超好
I think it was really, really good.

751
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,167
我都有点与贝蒂・戴维斯通灵了
I thought I was kind of channeling Bette Davis.

752
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,284
早上好 琼斯医生要去见十七号囚犯
Good morning. Dr. Jones to see prisoner number 17, please.

753
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,799
琼斯医生? 你是军情六处的吗?
Dr. Jones? Are you with MI6?

754
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,290
很遗憾 不再是了
Sadly, not anymore.

755
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,160
因为我没在名单上找到你
Because I don't seem to have you on my list.

756
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,329
该死的这没用啊 为什么?
Bloody thing's not working. Why's that?

757
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,121
你应该用...
You're supposed to use...

758
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,726
趴在地上
Lay down on the ground.

759
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,323
好样的 趴在地上
Attaboy. On the floor.

760
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,130
一百二十一号 在这
Number 121. Oh, there it is.

761
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,606
弗兰克!
Frank!

762
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,439
你们是谁? 是客人吗? 你们在找谁?
Who are you? You're visitors? Who are you looking for?

763
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,120
我们喜欢有客人来 不是吗? 老兄们
We love having visitors, don't we, fellas?

764
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,611
白利博士?
Dr. Bailey?

765
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,606
白利博士?
Dr. Bailey?

766
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,441
你想找谁? 嗯?
Yes. Who did you expect to find here? Hmm?

767
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,003
- 先生...  - 什么?
- Sir...  - What?

768
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,526
我看见你死了
I saw you die.

769
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,730
看见我死了? 他是谁?
Saw me die? Who is he?

770
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,121
弗兰克?
Frank?

771
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,119
弗兰克・摩西 我亲爱的老兄!
Frank Moses, my dear fellow!

772
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,039
你好吗 老兄? 真高兴能见到你 真高兴你能来
How are you, old sport? So glad to see you. So glad you came by.

773
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,879
我们一直在等你 不是吗 伙计们?
We've been expecting you. Haven't we, fellas?

774
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,879
天呐 弗兰克 你怎么这么老了 天呐!
My God, Frank, why are you so old? Good lord!

775
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,644
- 先生...  - 怎么了?
- Sir...  - What?

776
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,805
你已经被关在这三十二年了
You've been locked up here for 32 years.

777
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,959
得了吧 弗兰克 你是在逗我吧
Come on, Frankie, you've gotta be kidding me.

778
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,719
快 练练手
Come on, put 'em up.

779
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,087
三十二年 多离奇啊 你是谁?
Thirty-two years. How extraordinary. Who are you?

780
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,407
维多利亚
Victoria.

781
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,409
维多利亚! 你应该读读这个
Victoria! You should read this.

782
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,684
列宁的国家与革命 美好的时光 都怪斯大林乱搞
Lenin. State and Revolution. Jolly good time. Stalin got it wrong, of course.

783
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,959
弗兰克 我们要去哪? 你今晚要带我们去剧院吗?
So where are we going, Frank? Are you taking us

784
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,879
弗兰克 那是我们今晚要去的地方吗?
to the opera again tonight? Is that where we're going, Frank?

785
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,359
剧院? 我们喜欢歌剧 不是吗? 伙计们
The opera? We love the opera, don't we, fellas?

786
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,919
是的 有歌剧 香槟和草莓
Yes, the opera and the champagne and the strawberries all round.

787
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,399
抱歉 亲爱的 你叫什么来着?
Sorry, my dear, what is your name again?

788
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,519
维多利亚
Victoria.

789
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,359
不好意思 这是他们一直给我
I'm sorry, it's the drugs

790
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,759
吃的药害的 我只有短期记忆
they've been feeding me, it's my short-term memory.

791
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,919
他们给我吃的药...
The drugs they've been feeding...

792
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,839
应该是想让我们安静下来
Something that's meant to keep us peaceful, I suppose,

793
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,080
或让我们不添麻烦!
or harmless!

794
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,321
总之 我知道就在这附近
Anyway, I know it's around here somewhere,

795
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,807
但我不知道具体在哪
but I don't know where it is.

796
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,599
白利博士 我们需要你的帮助
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.

797
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,251
- 什么?  - 你记得龙葵吗?
- Mmm?  - Do you remember Nightshade?

798
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,002
抱歉 我在找我的烟斗还有圣克里斯托弗像章
I'm sorry, I'm looking for my pipe and my St. Christopher medallion.

799
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,929
孩子们总是乱拿东西送人
Boys gave it to someone.

800
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,371
他们是小男孩
They were little boys, you see.

801
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,200
现在它去哪了... 不知怎么地不见了
Now where it's gone... It's gone somehow.

802
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,885
啊...
Um...

803
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,039
妈的!
Oh, shit!

804
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,560
嘿 弗兰克 我在这
Hey, Frankie, I'm over here.

805
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,279
我找到像章了 它一直在我兜里
I found it. it was in my pocket the whole time.

806
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,799
我还是找不到我那该死的烟斗 但像章在这
I couldn't find my damn pipe, though. But here it is.

807
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,280
抱歉 亲爱的 你刚问我什么问题来着?
Sorry, my dear, what was the question you asked me?

808
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,644
你记得龙葵吗?
Do you remember Nightshade?

809
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,959
模糊记得 是一种炸弹吧
Vaguely. It was some kind of a bomb, I believe.

810
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,479
白利博士 人们在寻找那个武器
Dr. Bailey, people are looking for that weapon.

811
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,119
人们想要使用它
People who want to use it.

812
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,044
哦 天呐 是的 我当然知道 相信我
Oh, dear. Yes, I do understand, of course. Believe you me.

813
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,319
知道吗 我为美国人做了很多
But you know, I made many things for the Americans and

814
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,319
但最后龙葵可以说是一场噩梦
Nightshade turned out to be a bit of a nightmare.

815
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,479
太不一样了 最终证明是太危险了
It was quite different. Turned out to be too dangerous.

816
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,319
所以自然地 他们就把我关在这个地方了
So naturally, they had to lock me up in this place.

817
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,279
之后我觉得他们对我做的这些相当正常
And after what they did to me, I think it's perfectly natural

818
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,441
我让他们所有的人都滚!
I tell them all to go F off!

819
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,839
军情六处企图伪造白利的死? 为什么啊? 他们在隐藏什么?
MI6 tried to fake Bailey's death? Why? What are they hiding?

820
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,161
你得走了 你得查查了
You're gonna have to go. You're gonna have to go find out.

821
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,720
你知道他们将会审讯然后杀了我的
You know they're gonna try and kill me.

822
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,920
- 我在俄罗斯给你打电话  - 再见
- I'll call you from Russia.  - Do svidanya.

823
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,163
注意七号通道
Maintenance to Bridge 7.

824
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,450
最高安全区域被入侵
We got a breach in Maximum Security.

825
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,521
抓住她!
Secure!

826
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,519
什么事这么重要?
All right, what's so important?

827
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,286
我刚从军情六处得到消息说爱德华・白利还活着而且逃跑了
I just heard from my source at MI6 that Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.

828
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,839
- 这不可能啊  - 这比一个桀骜不驯的将军
- That's not possible.  - This is bigger than a rogue general

829
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,968
和他的未爆炸武器的事更大 还有什么我不知道的?
and his unexploded ordnance. What don't I know?

830
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,850
游戏已经变味了
The game has changed.

831
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,327
白利知道的对我们来说太危险了
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

832
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,890
我们不能让白利或龙葵落入恐怖分子手中 否则数百万的人将会死
We can't let Bailey or Nightshade fall into terrorist hands, or millions will die.

833
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,286
见鬼 这是真的
Holy shit, it's real.

834
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,644
如果不采取措施 核武器将在莫斯科市中心爆炸
Unless we secure it, that weapon's going off in the middle of Moscow.

835
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,407
现在来看 那算是最好的情况了
Right now, that's our best case scenario.

836
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,601
伙计们?
Guys?

837
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,439
啊!
Ah!

838
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,920
欢迎你们 我的朋友
Welcome, my friends.

839
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,288
你真的还活着
So, it is true. You're alive.

840
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,810
告诉我那东西在哪?
Tell me, then, where is this device?

841
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,646
谁?
Who?

842
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,489
还在进行中
Work in progress.

843
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,201
我从没想过能把
I never thought I'd be smuggling

844
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,041
弗兰克・摩西偷带进俄罗斯
Frank Moses into the heart of Mother Russia.

845
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,561
我也是
Me, neither.

846
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,242
在我没忘之前 弗兰克 有点小事
Oh, before I forget. Frank. Frank, a little something.

847
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,565
如果你被抓了或韩追上你了
If you are caught or Han catches you,

848
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,807
还是服毒自尽比较好
suicide pill is a much better option than what you face.

849
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,169
面带俄罗斯式微笑死去
You die with Russian smile on.

850
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,166
祝你好运 再见
Good luck. Do svidanya.

851
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,323
- 白利先生  - 怎么了 弗兰克
- Mr. Bailey.  - Yes, Frank?

852
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,163
你能告诉我们核武器藏在哪里吗?
Is there any way you could tell us where you hid the nuclear weapon?

853
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,366
弗兰克 看这些奶牛 它们多美啊
Look at all those cows, Frank. They're beautiful.

854
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,527
是啊
Yeah.

855
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,007
奶牛?
Cows?

856
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,847
嗨! 喂!
Hi! Yoo hoo!

857
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,010
情况不妙
That's not good.

858
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,804
弗兰克 我们被盯上了
We have eyes on, Frank.

859
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,246
我的飞机呢?
Where's my plane?

860
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,164
他们雇我杀你
They paid me to kill you.

861
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,211
他们没说让我一次就解决掉
They didn't say I had to do it all at once.

862
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,720
摩西 这事没完
This is not over, Moses.

863
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,921
我们没完! 没完!
We're not over! It's not!

864
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,044
他怎么了?
What's wrong with him?

865
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,161
哇
Wow.

866
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,609
这是哪?
What is this place?

867
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,604
我第一个藏身之处
My first safe house.

868
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,484
自从一九八四年就未动过 哇!
Untouched, since 1984. Aw!

869
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,966
这是河豚毒?
Fugu poison?

870
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,761
河豚毒是致命的东西 死的很惨
Fugu poison is deadly stuff. Terrible death.

871
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,846
这是你要的那玩意儿吗? XKG毒气 我发明的
This your little gizmo? XKG gas. I invented it.

872
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,604
我们企图除掉老菲德尔・卡斯特罗
We tried to take out old Fidel Castro in 61 in Cuba.

873
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,046
但还是没能成功
That didn't work though.

874
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,721
弗兰克 来点茶吗?
Any tea, Frank?

875
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,087
为什么韩这么恨你?
Why does Han hate you so much?

876
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,444
他小时候缺乏关爱
Not enough hugs as a child.

877
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,888
弗兰克陷害他窃取国家机密
Frank framed him for stealing state secrets.

878
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,887
所以他从一位高端反情报官员
So he went from being a highly decorated counter-intel officer

879
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,010
变成了个贱民
to... to being a pariah.

880
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,399
更讽刺的是 弗兰克给自己的生命
What's ironic though, is that Frank actually created the circumstances

881
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,890
创造了一个巨大的威胁
for his own death.

882
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,207
太富有诗意了
It's poetic.

883
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,240
我还不是没死吗
I ain't dead yet.

884
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,209
那能吃吗?
Should you eat that?

885
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,369
吃下去安全吗?
Is that safe?

886
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,563
按这上面的保质期来看 还没过期呢
It's before they had that, you know, "sell by" date stuff.

887
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,761
哦
Oh.

888
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,170
你见过卡斯特罗?
So did you get to meet Castro?

889
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,201
谁?
Who?

890
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,885
你见过卡斯特罗吗?
Did you get to meet Castro?

891
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,919
见过 在肯尼迪被暗杀的两周后
Yes, I did, actually. About two weeks after Kennedy was assassinated.

892
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,285
说起这个 弗兰克
Talking of which, Frank,

893
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,679
我慢慢想起自己是谁了
I'm starting to remember more and more who I am

894
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,284
做过些什么 以及我制造的武器
and who I was and the weapons I made.

895
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,682
天呐 真是奇迹
My God, it really is amazing.

896
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,963
军情六处的家伙们真是有效率 上帝保佑他们...
How efficiently those boys from MI6, may God bless 'em...

897
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,439
就是这样 弗兰克
But you know something, Frank?

898
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,519
一旦发现留着我们没用了
They really do throw us away. Don't they, old sport?

899
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,239
就立即把我们处理了 不是吗? 老兄
When we're no longer convenient, I suppose.

900
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,600
完全不在乎我们把最好的年华献给了他们
As though we'd never given them the best years of our lives.

901
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,211
开个玩笑
Bit of a joke, really.

902
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,089
是的 异常奇怪
Yes, very strange.

903
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,768
你记得龙葵在哪吗?
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

904
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,281
能再说一遍吗?
I'm sorry, my dear?

905
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,643
你记得龙葵在哪吗?
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

906
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,801
记得
Oh, yes.

907
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,051
现在这儿应该对了
Now, this feels right.

908
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,403
就在这附近 这次我确信
It's around here somewhere. I'm sure this time.

909
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,723
一切都和以前完全不一样了
Everything looks different completely.

910
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,811
也许就在那
Maybe it's over here.

911
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,327
- 都找了好几个小时了  - 对 就是这儿
- It's been hours. Hours.  - Yeah, this is it.

912
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,081
到了
Here we are.

913
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,802
穿着吉米・丘跑路舒服吗?(著名奢侈品牌女鞋)
How are those Jimmy Choos working out for you?

914
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,400
入口在这儿
The entrance is up there.

915
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,331
谁是棒约翰?
Who's Papa John?

916
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,639
这是新开的
It's new.

917
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,801
到哪里的入口?
Entrance to what?

918
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,762
通向老王宫的秘密通道
Secret tunnels through the old catacombs.

919
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,689
勃列日涅夫当年用来与情妇幽会
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.

920
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,400
- 在哪?  - 就在这
- In where?  - In there.

921
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,446
克里姆林宫?
The Kremlin?

922
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,010
武器在克里姆林宫?
The weapon is in the Kremlin?

923
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,970
这是他们绝对想不到的地方
It's the one place they wouldn't look.

924
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,202
天呐 记着要保温啊?
Jesus. Do you mind keeping it warm?

925
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,850
知道你造成了多大的损失吗
You have no idea the damage you've done.

926
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,559
你把我们自己人关了三十二年
You kept one of our own locked up for 32 years.

927
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,919
我维护了世界安全
I have kept the world safe.

928
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,526
- 如果那个武器落入坏人之手...  - 武器?
- If that weapon falls into the wrong hands...  - The weapon?

929
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,729
你根本什么都不知道
You haven't the slightest idea.

930
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,479
你得让我打给摩西
You must let me call Moses.

931
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,403
他不知道自己将面对什么
He doesn't know what he's walking into.

932
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,883
你曾经有过机会 现在没了
You've had your chance. It's over.

933
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,369
抱歉 维多利亚
I'm sorry, Victoria.

934
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,923
抱歉个屁
Sorry, my ass.

935
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,449
他们说你是这里的传奇人物
They say you're a legend around here.

936
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,047
我...
I've...

937
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,765
我从来都没听说过你
I've never heard of you.

938
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,764
肯定是在我来之前
Must have been a bit before my time.

939
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,604
好了 你现在见识过了
Well, you've heard of me now.

940
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,890
他们怎么可能从没发现炸弹产生的辐射?
How is it possible they never picked up the radiation signature from that bomb?

941
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,447
这问题问得好
That's the million dollar question.

942
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,962
伙计 这是新的
Hey, gang. This is new.

943
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,929
你觉得这堵墙后有什么?
What do you think is behind that wall?

944
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,241
呃...
Um...

945
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,046
我认为是俄国人
I think Russians.

946
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,006
如果那个洞被人发现 我们就死定了
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.

947
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,924
我需要你帮忙拆除炸弹
I'm gonna need you to help me to disarm the weapon.

948
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,319
弗兰克 总得有人看着门
Frank, somebody's gotta guard the door.

949
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,970
- 不行  - 但是...
- No.  - But...

950
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,446
你需要这个
You'll need this.

951
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,446
将军同志

952
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:00,300
这是二十分钟前在红场拍到的

953
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,446
搜索建筑 派部队支援

954
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,126
再说一遍
One more time.

955
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,199
很好 很好 意思是什么?
Great. Great. What does that mean?

956
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,639
"煤气泄漏 等待维修"
"Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."

957
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,240
- 好的 然后他们就会走开  - 如果他们没走呢?
- Good. And then they'll move on.  - And what if they don't?

958
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,679
- 要枪吗?  - 要
- Want a gun?  - Yes.

959
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,966
不行 不要枪
No. No gun.

960
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,002
不能动 你是保安
Just don't move. You're a security guard.

961
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,679
不许笑 你不能笑
Don't smile. You can't smile.

962
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,201
你别离开你的岗位 好吗?
You just never leave your post. Okay?

963
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,646
很好
Nice.

964
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,970
两枪 打这儿和这儿
Two shots, here and here.

965
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,521
把尸体拖进去 有必要的话就多杀几个
Drag the body in there and repeat as necessary.

966
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,087
- 枪没保险  - 没有
- No safety.  - No safety.

967
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,243
弗兰克 我不喜欢克林姆林宫
Frank, I don't like the Kremlin so much.

968
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,368
我更不喜欢在它的下面
And I like being underneath it even less.

969
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,760
我们到了
Here we are.

970
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,924
太棒了 恍如昨日
That's great. It's just like yesterday.

971
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,366
这是我的扳手也可以说是撬杆 看这个
There's my wrench or crow bar. Look at this.

972
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,601
那里
There.

973
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,885
嘿 看 伙计们
Hey, look, chaps.

974
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,519
这是我的旧烟斗 我就知道我把它落在哪里了
That's my old pipe. I knew I'd left it somewhere.

975
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,602
我爱妻买的第五个 那是一九六九年
My dear wife bought this the fifth, 1969.

976
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,451
这是我们的结婚纪念品 噢 对了! 这个 呃...
It was our wedding anniversary. Oh, yes! This is, um...

977
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,451
顺便说下 这就是龙葵
This is Nightshade, by the way.

978
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,406
看那
There.

979
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,803
- 那是...  - 红汞核弹
- Is that...  - That's Red Mercury.

980
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,485
红汞?
Red Mercury?

981
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,768
人们都说它只存在于冷战神话中
We were always told it was a Cold War myth.

982
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,879
是 他们都说这不可能 但是我做到了 看到没?
Yes, they said it couldn't be done, but I did it. See?

983
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,963
弗兰克 如果它是红汞核弹 那你可以把它装进包里
Frank, if that's Red Mercury, you can zip it up in a backpack

984
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,407
在白宫巡游 没人会发现
and take it on the White House tour. It's undetectable.

985
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,159
没有信号 没有辐射
No signature. No fallout.

986
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,479
这个武器将会在一夜之间完全改变
This is a weapon that will entirely change

987
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,962
国际力量的平衡 像那样
the balance of international power overnight. Just like that.

988
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,410
我们都会死
We're all gonna die.

989
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,161
跪下
On your knees.

990
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,647
卡塔亚
Katja.

991
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,842
任何政府都不能占有这个武器
No government should have this weapon.

992
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,846
你的国家不行 我的也不行
Not yours. And not mine.

993
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,165
我有命令在身
I have orders.

994
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,085
这与命令无关 这关乎是非
This isn't about orders. This is about right and wrong.

995
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,086
不要逼我
Don't.

996
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,441
你真的有来美国看我?
Did you really come to see me in the States?

997
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,166
是
Yes.

998
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,806
那时 我房子外的花是什么颜色的?
What color were the flowers outside my house?

999
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,045
黄色
Yellow.

1000
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,045
我发现你一直站在这里啊

1001
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:33,680
煤气泄漏 等待维修

1002
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,045
我叫帕沙 回头一起喝一杯吧

1003
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,045
好?

1004
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,045
我想你也注意到我了?

1005
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,331
搞什么... 嘿!
What in the name of... Hey!

1006
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,559
你亲这个人干嘛啊?
What are you doing kissing this guy?

1007
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,879
我不想杀他
I didn't wanna kill him.

1008
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,399
这是什么狗屁逻辑?
What kinda stupid logic is that?

1009
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,970
她来这干什么啊?
What in the Sam Hill is she doing here?

1010
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,159
她又和我们合作了
She's working with us again.

1011
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,439
那才见鬼呢
Like heck she is.

1012
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,599
你干嘛亲他?
Why were you kissing that guy?

1013
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,491
伙计们 在克林姆林宫发生的就让它过去吧
Kids, what happens in the Kremlin stays in the Kremlin.

1014
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,844
你要和我好好解释这事
You are gonna have to explain this to me.

1015
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,041
同志们!
Hey, Comrades!

1016
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,686
为了更多的成功
Here's to more success.

1017
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,159
成功
Success.

1018
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,321
还有拯救世界!
And saving the world!

1019
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,801
拯救世界!
Saving the world!

1020
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,639
干杯!
Na zdorovie!

1021
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,641
干杯!
Na zdorovie!

1022
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,040
我接个电话 马上回来
I got this. Right back.

1023
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,481
嘿
Hey.

1024
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,919
你在哪?
Where are you?

1025
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,921
莫斯科
Moscow.

1026
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,249
他是个疯子 弗兰克
He's a nutter, Francis.

1027
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,919
军情六处把他关起来不是因为他制造了那武器
MI6 didn't lock him up because he created the weapon

1028
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,729
而是因为他想引爆武器
but because he wants to see it go off.

1029
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,606
嗨 弗兰克
Hello, Frank.

1030
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,642
那是维多利亚 是吧?
That was Victoria, wasn't it?

1031
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,839
她和你说我是个怪物
Telling you that I was some sort of a monster

1032
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,401
曾经想毁灭苏联帝国
who once wanted to destroy the Soviet empire.

1033
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,089
好 慢慢转过身
Yeah. Very slowly.

1034
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,924
没错 好孩子
That's it. Good boy.

1035
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,842
很好 进去
Good. In you go.

1036
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,247
马文...
Marvin...

1037
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,531
放下枪
Guns down.

1038
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,161
放下武器 慢慢来
Weapons down. Very slowly.

1039
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,847
你故意把它透露给维基解密
You planted the thing on WikiLeaks.

1040
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,203
是的 我从守卫那拿了个手机
Oh, yes, it was a cell phone taken from a guard.

1041
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,963
我只是渴望能够报复军情六处
I was just itching to get my revenge on MI6, you see.

1042
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,124
弗兰克 你找到青蛙太不可思议了
Frank, you were absolutely marvelous the way you found The Frog.

1043
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,811
其他人绝对找不到他
No one else could have found him.

1044
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,121
杰克?
Jack?

1045
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,163
对不起 弗兰克 我已经拿红汞和霍顿先生做了交易
Sorry, Frank, I made a deal already with Mr. Horton for Red Mercury.

1046
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,330
- 干得好 白利  - 谢谢
- Well done, Bailey.  - Thanks.

1047
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,482
很高兴又见到你 弗兰克 把枪都捡起来
Nice to see you again, Frank. Pick up the guns.

1048
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,366
祖国不会忘记你 弗兰克
Your country appreciates your sacrifice, Frank.

1049
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,565
但你们的时代过去了
But your time's up.

1050
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,047
我们走
Let's go.

1051
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,046
是时候了 白利
It's time, Bailey.

1052
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,481
是的 没错
Yes, it is time.

1053
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,159
多有趣啊
Very Interesting.

1054
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,122
叛逃的美国特工变身为核恐怖分子 杀害了俄罗斯高官
Rogue American agents turned nuclear terrorists kill top Russian officer.

1055
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,887
不妙啊
Not good.

1056
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,529
永别了 弗兰克 永别了 马文
So long, Frank. So long, Marvin.

1057
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,571
来吧 伙计们 走吧
Come on, boys, let's go.

1058
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,442
放松 放松
Easy. Easy.

1059
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,480
让我帮你拿吧
Oh, please, let me take that from you.

1060
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,201
我以为我们要去伦敦做任务汇报
I thought we were doing the debriefing in London.

1061
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,479
本来是要去的 但既然你是这么个病态而又心理扭曲的混蛋
Oh, we were. But since you're such a sick, twisted bastard,

1062
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,481
你要去科罗拉多
you're going to Colorado.

1063
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,119
那里有一个秘密的设施 在地下一英里处
There's a secret facility there, it's about a mile underground,

1064
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,039
你要在那里度过余生 你大脑的所有认知
where you will spend your remaining years having every bit of knowledge

1065
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,119
都会被清除
plucked from that giant head of yours.

1066
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,121
真的吗?
Really? Hmm.

1067
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,119
既然我们都摊开说了
And since we're speaking frankly,

1068
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,282
我就告诉你吧 那里会你会觉得之前被关的32年
I should say that it will make your last 32 years

1069
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,528
像是在加勒比海度假
seem like a vacation in the Caribbean.

1070
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,761
给他铐上
Cuff him.

1071
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,441
嗯
Mmm.

1072
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,641
我说吧
Oh, I say.

1073
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,967
好吧
Well, well.

1074
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,240
你没想到吧 老头?
Bet you didn't see that coming. Did you, old man?

1075
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,011
我必须说 我真没想到 太好了
I must say, I didn't. Jolly good.

1076
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,201
你先请
After you.

1077
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,528
谢谢 早上好 先生们
Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.

1078
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,326
他说什么?
What did he say?

1079
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,601
预备
Ready.

1080
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,771
做点什么啊
Do something. Do something.

1081
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:10,961
我爱你
I love you.

1082
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,123
至少不是韩先抓到我们
At least Han didn't get us first.

1083
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,368
不是吧? 这种时候你还提他干嘛?
Really? You're gonna bring that up right now?

1084
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,530
啊 世界上再也没有什么比一个美丽的女人拿帅气的枪
Ah, there is nothing more sexy in the whole world

1085
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,769
更性感的了
than a beautiful woman with an incredible gun.

1086
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,450
你真是个浪漫派
You're such a romantic.

1087
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,606
小心
Watch your eyes.

1088
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,080
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1089
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:01,083
我喜欢开枪前你的脚趾这样弯起
I love the way your toes curl right before you fire.

1090
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,119
无药可救
Hopeless.

1091
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,639
嗯
Mmm.

1092
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,641
哇!
Ah!

1093
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,324
- 不许动  - 嘘!
- Freeze.  - Shh!

1094
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,683
你知道吗? 我觉得你没必要拿枪指着我
You know something? I don't think you ought to point that idiotic thing at me.

1095
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,441
你该好好想想自己签的安保协议是否包括丧葬费?
You should really start thinking about your security protocol, don't you think?

1096
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,401
那是什么东西?
What the hell is that?

1097
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,170
那个 孩子 是解毒剂
That, my dear boy, is an antidote

1098
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,843
世上最强神经毒气的解毒剂 看

1099
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,566

1100
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,685
戴维斯先生 你好啊
Hello, Mr. Davis.

1101
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,679
你没料到吧
And you didn't see that coming.

1102
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,125
有想到吗 老伙计?
Did you, old sport?

1103
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,200
我确定你不想错过接下来的精彩内容
I'm sure you wouldn't want to miss what's coming next.

It's a little antidote. Jolly good.

1105
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,206
好了
That's right.

1106
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,839

1108
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,807
太好了
Jolly good.

1109
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,599
老实说 两天 弗兰克 才两天
Honestly, two days, Frank, two days,

1110
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,199
你就落到行刑队手里了?
and you're in front of a firing squad?

1111
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,279
是 但是你看...
Yeah. But look...

1112
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,806
不用 不要解释 你明明可以做得更好 太可悲了
No. No excuses. You're better than this. It's pathetic.

1113
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,925
弗兰克 一架美国军用飞机在伦敦紧急降落

飞机上所有人都死了

1115
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,489
白利已经到伊朗使馆避难
Bailey has taken refuge in the Iranian embassy.

1116
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,684
伊朗使馆?
The Iranian embassy?

1117
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,086
我们要去那里
We've gotta go there.

1118
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,048
好的 让他们准备好
All right. Get 'em ready.

1119
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,847
我去确保下我们能起飞
I'm gonna make sure we're cleared for takeoff.

1120
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,648
如果世界就在一周内灭亡
If the world is here in a week,

1121
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,919
咱们在特克斯和凯科斯群岛见
I will meet you in the Turks and Caicos.

1122
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,079

Mmm-hmm.

1123
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,839
我们整个晚上
And we will spend all night

1124
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,763
- 都在星空下度过  - 都在星空下度过
- beneath the stars.  - Beneath the stars.

1125
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,281
嗯...
Mmm...

1126
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,405
我不说韩语!
I don't speak Korean!

1127
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,920
你玩得开心吗?
You having fun yet?

1128
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,248
我开始觉得开心时会告诉你
I'll let you know when I start having fun.

1129
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,280
你背叛了我
You betrayed me.

1130
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,761
我别无选择
I had no choice.

1131
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,290
如果换作是你 你也会这么做的
You'd have done the same thing, if you were me.

1132
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,364
美国付你多少钱?
How much is the US paying you?

1133
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,679
两千万
20 million.

1134
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,841
你和我开玩笑呢?
Are you kiddin' me?

1135
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,527
我要得更多
I asked for more.

1136
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,006
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

1137
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,771
你以前是个好探员
You used to be a good agent.

1138
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,766
停! 等等 听着 我需要你的帮助
Stop! Wait a minute. Listen, I need your help.

1139
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,724
我知道你内心还是想做正确的事情
I know there's a part of you that wants to do the right thing.

1140
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,721
有一个武器将会被引爆...
There is a weapon that's gonna be detonated...

1141
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,080
胡扯
Bullshit.

1142
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,525
不是胡扯
It's not bullshit.

1143
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,442
有个炸弹正在前往伦敦
There's a bomb headed for London right now.

1144
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,642
如果你不帮我的话 一百一十万的人将会失去生命
Eleven million people are gonna lose their lives if you don't help me.

1145
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,561
好吧
All right.

1146
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,171
我们走
Let's go.

1147
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,769
我可没说以后不杀你
This doesn't mean I'm not going to kill you later.

1148
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,527
我知道
I know.

1149
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,080
我觉得要让恋爱顺利
I think the way to make a relationship work

1150
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,000
你们两个都不能放弃自我 你同意吗 马文?
is that neither of you give up who you are. Don't you agree, Marvin?

1151
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,086
精彩 马文说得太好了
Exactly. Exactly what Marvin says.

1152
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:06,286
相爱就像跳崖 你只需要信任并放手
Falling in love is like jumping off a cliff. You just have to believe and let go.

1153
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,250
天啊!
My God!

1154
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,285
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1155
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,447
没事 他没问题
No, he's all right.

1156
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,847
他是和我们一起的
He's with us.

1157
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,125
我们谈开了
We talked it out.

1158
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,919
杀了白利 拿到武器
Kill Bailey. Secure the weapon.

1159
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,921
这会有多难呢?
How hard can it be?

1160
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,439
当然 外围的安保非常森严
Of course, the external security is very, very heavy

1161
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,479
里面是革命护卫队的核心部分
but inside there are hardcore Revolutionary Guards.

1162
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,369
他们都是极端的狂热者
They are serious fanatics.

1163
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,210
成败都取决于她
The whole thing depends on her.

1164
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,361
你确实知道 如果他们抓到你 他们会杀了你吧
You do realize, if they catch you, they will kill you.

1165
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,680
{\an8}伦敦

1166
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,680
我知道这个对你来说不容易 但是别担心
I know this won't be easy for you, but don't worry.

1167
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,801
好吗?
Okay?

1168
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,883
你要知道 我一直都在想
You know, I've been thinking about

1169
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,049
你和我
you and me.

1170
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,962
还有我只是...
And I just...

1171
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,491
送你一样东西
I got you something.

1172
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,366

Wow.

1173
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,726

You like it?

1174
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,002
- 太喜欢了  - 七连发哦

1175
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,119

- Okay.  - Not yet. I'm not ready.

1176
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,439
停 不 现在还不行 等一下吧
Stop, no. Not right now. Wait.

1177
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,879
如果现在不做 你就把这事搞砸了 知道吗?
If you don't do it, you're gonna blow it, all right?

1178
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,959
看着我
Look at me.

1179
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,279
- 我数到三  - 嗯 听着...
- I'm gonna count to three.  - Mmm. Listen...

1180
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,439
我数到三 好吗?
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

1181
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,001
- 我们还能回去...  - 我用英语数
- We can go back to the...  - In English.

1182
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,527
- 一...  - 别现在 不 等下
- One...  - Not now. No. Wait.

1183
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,210
二...
Two...

1184
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,730
该死
God damn it.

1185
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,047
嗨
Hi.

1186
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,530
她会被杀死的
She's gonna get killed.

1187
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,886
这帮人离开老巢之后会很小心的
It's tough when they leave the nest.

1188
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,322
弗兰克 想想吧 不管你信不信
Frank, come on. A little trust.

1189
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,727
她有你我都不具备的天赋
She has talents you and I will never have.

1190
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,640
什么天赋?
What talents?

1191
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,525
人见人爱
People like her.

1192
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,844
如果她能活下来 这对你们的关系很有帮助
If she lives, this'll be good for your relationship.

1193
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,321
说得对
You're right.

1194
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,327
我自认唯一了解的事物 就是女人和秘密行动
And if there's one thing I know, it's women and covert ops.

1195
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,485
这是两件事啊
That's two things.

1196
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,048
不 蠢蛋
No, grasshopper.

1197
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,651
这是一回事
It is not.

1198
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,001
我想告诉你一个秘密 部长先生
I wanna tell you a secret, Mr. Minister.

1199
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,525
她还想跟这家伙亲热?
Is she gonna make out with this guy, too?

1200
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,961
哦!
Ohh!

1201
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,721
你搞什么鬼?
What the hell was that?

1202
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,326
河豚毒
Blowfish poison.

1203
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,242
你的身体马上会感觉到麻痹感和枪伤的疼痛
Paralysis and shooting pains will grip your entire body.

1204
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,002
你会慢慢的窒息而死
And you will slowly asphyxiate until you choke to death

1205
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,567
整个过程意识清醒 除非你照我说得做
while remaining fully-conscious, unless you do exactly what I say.

1206
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,371
来不及叛国我就会死的
I will die before I compromise my country.

1207
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,399
好的 我们带你去你的办公室 你要用官方信纸写一封文书来
Okay. We will drive you to your office where you will write a letter on official stationery

1208
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,919
谴责伊朗妇女所受的虐待
denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.

1209
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,410
然后你就能拿到解药
Then you will get your antidote.

1210
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,566
就这些?
That's it?

1211
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,566
伦敦 伊朗大使馆

1212
01:31:17,533 --> 01:31:18,609
有什么可以效劳的?
{\an1}How may I help you?

1213
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:20,983
我想投靠伊朗

1214
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,641
啊 白利博士 不好意思推迟了时间
Ah. Dr. Bailey, my apologies for the delay.

1215
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,279
邓布洛维斯基教授已经表明了这个武器是真的
Professor Dombrovski has declared the weapon authentic.

1216
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,884
而且我们已经准备好发射了
And we're prepared to proceed.

1217
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,244
只要我能拿到钱就行 大使先生
As soon as my money's transferred, Mr. Ambassador.

1218
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,927
闪开! 她和我一起的
Move! She's with me.

1219
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,921
阿曼?
Arman?

1220
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,399
你得让他走
He needs to go.

1221
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,719
好的 好的
Okay, okay.

1222
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,604
你们说什么呢? 她是谁?
What are you talking about? Who is she?

1223
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,723
先生 实在抱歉 你得离开这
Sir, I'm sorry, you need to leave.

1224
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,604
你给我闭嘴!
You need to shut up!

1225
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,239
不
No.

1226
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,119
你们到底在这干什么呢?
What? What is happening here?

1227
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,167
抱歉 你在干吗?
Sorry. What are you doing?

1228
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,399
告诉我 你们在这干什么! 她是谁?
Tell me what is happening here! Who is she?

1229
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,199
滚出去! 我说"滚出去"的时候 你就给我滚出去!
Get out! When I say "get out," get out of here!

1230
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,486
你得离开这!
You need to go!

1231
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,091
你他妈给我闭嘴!
You shut the fuck up!

1232
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,011
保险柜在哪?
Where's the safe?

1233
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,287
什么?
What?

1234
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:01,810
保险柜在哪?
Where's the safe?

1235
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,926
便便来咯
Poo poo's coming.

1236
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,925
24小时服务
24 Hour Plumbing.

1237

Let's see our friend here.

1243
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,924
能借我下你的刀子吗?
Would you lend me your knife, please?

1244
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,801
多谢
Thank you.

1245
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,564
不好意思弄脏了地毯
Sorry about the mess on the carpet.

1246
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,207
哦对了
Oh, well.

1247
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,559
这会儿 杰克... 希望你不介意我这么叫你
At this point, Jack... You don't mind me calling you "Jack," I hope.

1248
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,609
你一定开始意识到
You must be beginning to comprehend

1249
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,485
你是彻彻底底的失败了
the stunning totality of your failure.

1250
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,966
你不能把它给他们
You can't give it to them.

1251
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,679
哦 比起我把红汞给他们
Oh, I've no more interest in giving Red Mercury

1252
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,524
我更想给你
to these boys than I have in giving it to you.

1253
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,241
天哪
Jesus.

1254
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,639
是啊 我们还是在悲哀的旧世界
Yes, it's a sad old world, you know.

1255
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,290
不管怎么样 我是这么想的
Anyway, that's only my opinion.

1256
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,165
但是关键的是 杰克
But the central point is this, Jack,

1257
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,639
你看 像你啊 或者军情六处 或者中情局的这些混蛋
you see, when men like you and those dickheads from MI6

1258
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:59,007
不管你们从哪个部门来的
or CIA or whatever sewers you came from.

1259
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,851
当你们不仅要杀我
When you take away not only my life

1260
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,999
还要杀我深爱但无辜的妻子娜塔莎
but the innocent lives of my dear beloved wife Natasha

1261
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,919
还要杀我六岁的小儿子的时候 看看吧 是啊
and my little boy, who was only six, you see. Yes.

1262
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,206
我还能说什么?
I mean, what can I say?

1263
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,280
你们既然惹了我 老弟
When you mess with me, buddy,

1264
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,881
这就是你的下场
this is what you get.

1265
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,606
见鬼去吧 老不死的
Go to hell, old man.

1266
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,923
再见吧 爱国英雄
Fare thee well, patriot.

1267

砰
Boom.

1268
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,880
下一步该什么了?
Now what's next?

1269
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,727
啊 华盛顿
Ah, Washington.

1270

1275
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,646
- 就那个玩意儿?  - 正在倒计时 弗兰克
- Is that it?  - It's counting down, Frank.

1276
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,841
关掉它 好吗?
Shut it Off. Right?

1277
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,559
关... 好啊 怎么关? 声控啊?
Shut... Yeah. With what? Acupressure?

1278
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,882
- 我不知道  - 那为啥让我干呢?
- I don't know.  - Well, why is it my responsibility?

1279
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,041
快做点什么吧
Just do something.

1280
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,880
就凭我的破化学?
With my Mr. Chemistry set?

1281
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,209
我不知道该怎么做 你想让我去按按钮?
I don't know what I'm doing. You want me to push a button?

1282
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,530
白利跑了 炸弹开始计时了
Bailey's loose and the bomb's ticking.

1283

等一下 劳驾女士
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.

1284

把炸弹拿走

干得真漂亮
Jolly good show.

1291
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,081
妈的
Bollocks.

1292
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,801
你真要开这破玩意儿?
You really drive this ridiculous thing?

1293
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,526
你能射击吗?
Can you shoot?

1294
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,490
你得引导我们一下 弗兰克

来吧 弗兰克 我们还有四十分钟
Come on, Frank. Forty minutes.

1296

我现在不能和你说话
I can't talk to you right now.

1298
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,806

1299
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,121
没什么事
It's fine.

1300
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:49,727

Show me something.

1302
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,361
维多利亚
Victoria,

01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,359
我正在观察 白利要上M4号高速公路

1306
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,519
这条线可能会止爆 这一条可能会引爆
This one should stop it and this one should detonate it.

1307

各百分之五十的几率 弗兰克
It's fifty-fifty, Frank.

1308
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,959
等下!
Wait!

1309
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,086
不对头啊
That's weird.

1310
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,441
你知道你在干什么吗?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1311
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,079
等下 等等! 等等!

1313
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,443
我早知道我们要死了!
I knew we were gonna die!

1314
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,929
- 准备好干掉这个狗娘养的了吗?  - 必 须 的
- Ready to kill this son of a bitch?  - Abso-bloody-lutely.

1315

Trouble.

1317
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,921
马文!

1318
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:13,044
弗兰克 踩两个踏板 控制两个操纵杆
Frank, it's two pedals and two sticks.

1319
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,321
好的
Okay.

1320
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,959
妈的! 我们跟丢了 他正在去机场的路上
Damn it! We missed him. He's going into the airport.

1321
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,007
去抓他!
Go get him!

1322
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,129
- 好的 你们在哪?  - 遇到点麻烦
- Well, where are you?  - In trouble.

1323
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,959
请掉头! 你们正处在禁飞区
Turn back! You are in restricted airspace.

1324
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,599
弗兰克 他们打算击落我们
Frank, they're gonna blow us outta the sky.

1325
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,721
无所谓啊
I wouldn't worry about that.

1326
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,320
本来引擎就要熄火了
The engine's shutting down.

1327
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,490
求救! 求救!
Mayday! mayday!

1328
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,761
弗兰克!
Frank!

1329
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,644
我早知道我们要死了!
I knew we were gonna die!

1330
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,839
最后一次警告!
This is your last warning!

1331
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,889
拜托 告诉我你们坠毁的时候没有带着大规模杀伤性武器吧
Oh, please, tell me you're not crashing with a weapon of mass destruction.

1332
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,009
不 弗兰克 不
No, Frank, no.

1333
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,841
天啊
Oh, God.

1334
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,125
你在后面还好吧 马文?
You okay back there, Marvin?

1335
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,679
这可不是个完美的三点降落 弗兰克
It wasn't exactly a three-point landing, Frank.

1336
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,727
炸弹怎么样了?
How's the bomb doing?

1337
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,730
我无法阻止它
I can't stop it.

1338
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,925
我们得把它带出这
We gotta get it outta here.

1339
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,364
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

1340
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,607
给我出来
Get outta the car.

1341
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,727

你一直是个好大兵 不是吗?

1344
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,526
这是个僵局
Stalemate.

1345
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,090
怎么才能不伤害她而又干掉他呢?
How will you take him out and not shoot her first?

1346
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,882
弗兰克 没关系的
Frank, it's okay.

1347
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,081
你能开枪 没关系的

扔地下!
Drop the gun!

1351
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,087
把枪放下 弗兰克
Put the gun down, Frankie.

1352
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,561
多谢
Thank you.

1353
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,245

真是个好女孩
That's a good girl.

1357
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,441
啊!

1358
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:24,287
过来
Come here.

1359
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,245
啊! 真幸福
Ah! It's so sweet.

1360
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,691
现在下飞机 带着龙葵
Now leave the plane. Take Nightshade with you.

1361
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,807
再见了 弗兰克
Bye, Frank.

1362
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,605
好梦哦
Sweet dreams.

1363
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,483
你为什么不开枪?
Why didn't you just shoot me?

1364
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,806
- 出什么事了?  - 我无法解除炸弹
- What happened?  - I couldn't disarm it.

1365
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,530
妈的
Oh, crap.

1366
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,521
马文
Marvin,

1367
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,370
快爆炸了?
it's going to detonate?

1368
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:34,846
是的
Yeah.

1369
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,206
抱着我
Put your arms around me.

1370
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,641
哦...
Oh...

1371
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:03,969
出我所料
I didn't see that one coming.

1372
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,447
这可不是每天都能看到的
There's something you don't see every day.

1373
