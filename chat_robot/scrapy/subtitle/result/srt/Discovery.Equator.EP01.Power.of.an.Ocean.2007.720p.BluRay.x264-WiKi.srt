1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,971
太阳
The sun

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,071
施予光线和生命
giver of light and the life

3
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,684
赤道的太阳最猛烈
shines most powerfully at the Equator.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,448
太阳在这里驱动生物丰富的区域
Here, it powers an 
extraordinarily rich zone of life.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,284
三大洲三大洋的瞩目奇异的动物
Brilliant and bizarre species from
three continents... three oceans.

6
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:42,667
赤道不只是地图上的一条线
而是自然的强大力量
More than a line on a map...
Equator is a powerful force of nature.

7
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:49,632
赤道

8
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,681
太平洋

9
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,351
海洋的力量

10
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,159
加拉帕哥斯群岛位于赤道
The Galapagos Islands lie on the Equator

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,659
却不是热带天堂
but they're no tropical paradise.

12
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:20,658
太平洋为这些沙漠岛
带来富庶和饥荒
The Pacific Ocean brings both fortune 
and famine to this desert islands.

13
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:30,357
海洋在加拉帕哥斯群岛
营造了奇怪和似非而是的国度
At the Palapagos islands the ocean has 
created a strange improbable realm.

14
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:34,855
这是龙的栖身之所
This is a place for dragons.

15
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,655
海生鬣蜥栖息于此
因为它们能够驾驭海洋的力量
Marine iguanas livs here because they
can harness the power of the ocean.

16
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:51,053
海洋的力量来自赤道太阳
The ocean's power comes from the Equatorial sun.

17
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:55,852
让带来食物和矿物的水流翻腾
it sets in motion great currents 
that bring food and minerals here

18
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,752
这些是喂饱很多动物的宝物
riches to feed many.

19
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:05,651
但海流不止食物丰富，而且寒冷
But they're not just rich 
the ocean currents are cold 

20
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,150
企鹅正适合这种寒冷
cold enough for penguins.

21
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:27,847
企鹅在赤道除了在
加拉帕哥斯群岛还能在哪里游泳
Where else but at the Galapagos Islands 
could a penguin swim at the Equitor?

22
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:36,446
蜥蜴只有在这里才能在水下草地
像羊一样吃草
And only here can a lizard graze 
like an underwater meadow.

23
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,744
但有时海洋收回水流和宝物
But sometimes the ocean withdraws 
the currents and their riches

24
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:51,043
动物在这些岛屿上就会朝不保夕
then there's hardship on 
these islands of uncertainty.

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,842
即使饥荒出现也有希望
Even in the face of famine, there's hope

26
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:02,641
但繁殖无异于冒险
but breeding is a gamble 

27
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:05,341
冒险总是没有好结果
and gamblers often lose.

28
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,038
海洋带给加拉帕哥斯群岛
的宝物和荒芜来自太阳
The riches and desolation that the ocean brings
to the Galapagos Islands are driven by the the sun.

29
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,291
在赤道太平洋，
Out across the Equatorial Pacific,

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:34,336
威力无穷的太阳
将水面温度提升至近摄氏30度
the immensely sun heats surface 
water to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.

31
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:38,636
温暖潮湿空气大量上升
warm moist air rises in such 
huge amounts, 

32
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:43,735
从太空往下看
赤道是一条沸腾云层的线
that from space
the Equator is visible as a line of boiling cloud.

33
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:51,034
下面吸进来的凉气因地球转动
流到西面
Cool air drawn in from below is 
swept west by the spin of the earth.

34
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,233
这些是贸易风
These are the trade winds

35
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,932
贸易风在赤道相撞
and they collide at the Equator,

36
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,732
产生雷雨和暴雨
creating thunderstorms and heavy rain.

37
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:11,630
帕米拉环礁是辽阔太平洋中部
少数遭受洪水侵扰的地方
Palmyra Atoll is one of the few specks of land in 
the vast central Pacific to receive this deluge.

38
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,529
这些小岛也位于赤道
These small islands also lie on the equator.

39
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,828
和加拉帕哥斯群岛完全不同
They are completely different 
from the Galapagos Islands

40
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:29,728
但两种岛屿的动物都由海流塑造
yet life on both is shaped by the power of ocean currents.

41
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:36,026
尽管这繁茂的热带天堂
几乎每天下雨
Although it rains nearly every day
in this lush tropical paradise,

42
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:40,126
却总是炎热，总是夏季
it's always hot always summer.

43
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:48,025
在水量充足的温暖下
皮孙木长至30米高
In the well-watered warmth,
Pisonia trees tower to thirty metres

44
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:52,924
很少热带环礁有长着巨树的雨林
there are very few tropical atolls 
with a rainforest of giant trees.

45
00:04:56,324 --> 00:05:01,423
在下面的潮湿阴影里
是巨型椰子蟹
and in the damp shade below,
giant coconut crabs.

46
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:10,121
一只雄性大椰子蟹可重13公斤
A big male can weigh 13 kilogram,

47
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:12,820
脚可长逾半米
with legs that span more than half a metre.

48
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,818
椰子蟹的主食是新鲜椰子
全年都能吃到
The crabs' main food is fresh coconuts,
that are available all year round.

49
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:41,516
椰子蟹是全球最大的陆地
无脊椎动物
Coconut crabs are the largest 
terrestrial invertebrates in the world.

50
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:47,415
它们有巨型前螯，
可将骨肉剪碎
They have massive front claws,
strong enough to strip flesh from bone

51
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:53,514
即使如此，几只蟹要几天才能
剥开这椰子
even so, it'll take a team of 
crabs days to husk this coconut.

52
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,278
除了椰子，
Apart from coconut,

53
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,822
这里食物不多
there's often not much to eat here

54
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,411
但椰子蟹几乎什么都吃
but the crabs eat practically anything.

55
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:13,511
它们在这些无人岛屿上繁衍
没有天敌
They thrive on these uninhabited 
islands and have no predators.

56
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,409
它们唯一的威胁来自其他椰子蟹
their only threats come from each other.

57
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:46,605
椰子蟹是林地霸王
Coconut crabs are the undisputed 
rulers of the forest floor

58
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:51,005
但天空和树顶属于海鸟
but the skies and tree tops 
belong to the seabirds.

59
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,304
近30种鸟类来这里筑巢
Nearly thirty species come here to nest.

60
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:03,802
帕米拉环礁是赤道太平洋
海鸟饲养幼儿少数的岛屿之一
Palmyra Atoll is one of only a few islands in the 
equatorial Pacific where seabirds can raise their young.

61
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:12,501
一只红脚鲣鸟幼鸟在树的高处
嗷嗷待哺
High in a tree, 
a red-footed booby chick waits to be fed.

62
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,800
鲣鸟依靠高树筑巢
The boobies depend on the tall trees for nesting

63
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,999
但树也依靠这些红脚夺目的鸟
but the trees also depend on these 
birds with spectacular red feet.

64
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,498
一只红脚鲣鸟为饥饿的幼鸟觅食
To find food for its hungry chick,

65
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,998
大部份时间都在海上寻找飞鱼
a red-footed booby spends most of its time 
far out at sea, searching for flying fish

66
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,597
这是困难漫长的工作
it's a long difficult job

67
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:43,296
温暖海洋就像毫无生命的沙漠
the warm ocean is like a lifeless desert.

68
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:50,495
每天成年红脚鲣鸟将太平洋
微量食物带回岛上
Each day, the adults bring the Pacific's 
meagre offerings back to the island.

69
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:57,594
食物仅够一对红脚鲣鸟
喂养一只幼鸟
There's only ever enough food for a pair
of red-footed boobies to raise one chick.

70
00:07:59,094 --> 00:07:59,896
如果幼鸟死亡
if a chick dies,

71
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,293
父母要等到下一年才会交配
its parents won't breed again 
until next year.

72
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,191
椰子蟹什么都吃
Coconut crabs eat anything 

73
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:18,590
包括死幼鸟
including dead chicks.

74
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:25,489
但这些馋嘴鬼不是鲣鸟留下的
东西唯一受惠者
But these eager undertakers aren't the only ones 
that benefit from what theboobies' leave behind.

75
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,089
鲣鸟送给森林一份珍贵礼物
The boobies give a precious gift to the forest

76
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,288
它们的排泄物是皮孙木需要的
丰富鸟粪肥料
Their waste is a rich guano fertiliser 
that Pisonia trees depend on.

77
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,487
森林需要海鸟
The forest needs the seabirds

78
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:46,385
还有每年落在帕米拉环礁的
近4.5米雨水
and also the nearly four and a half metres of
rain that falls on Palmyra Atoll each year.

79
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:06,383
尽管动物几乎每天都要忍受暴雨
Though its animals must endure 
a rainstorm nearly every day,

80
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:09,582
这岛屿是渗水珊瑚沙形成的
the island is made of porous coral sand

81
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,082
雨水很快流走
rainwater quickly drains away,

82
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:17,581
椰子蟹要喝水的话
就要收集身上滴下的水
To get a drink, a crab collects 
water dripping off its own body

83
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:22,080
用一根平时用来清理鳃的细腿
using a tiny leg that it normally 
uses to clean its gills.

84
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,277
海鸟在风暴大作时也继续寻找
飞鱼喂饱幼鸟
Even during a storm, seabirds continue their 
endless search for flying fish to feed their chicks.

85
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:55,775
雨和海鸟粪制造的远不止满布
椰子蟹和皮孙木的丰沃森林花园
Rain and seabird guano have created much more than this 
lush forest garden of coconut crabs and Pisonia trees.

86
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:01,074
暴雨溶解了叶子上的干海鸟粪
Heavy rain dissolves dried guano off leaves

87
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:04,773
冲进渗水珊瑚沙
and washes it down through 
the porous coral sand.

88
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:14,972
这液体现在是独特花园的肥料
This liquid is now fertilizer 
for a very different garden.

89
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:21,471
地上的营养丰富了帕米拉的环礁
nutrients from the land enrich 
Palmyra's fringing reef.

90
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,470
没有海鸟粪，这些水域会和
周边海洋一样荒芜
Without seabird guano,these waters would 
be as barren as the surrounding ocean

91
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,369
但一群刺尾鱼吃着营养
丰富的藻类
but a school of convict 
surgeonfish graze rich algae,

92
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,468
在上面得到养份
fertilised from above.

93
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,366
珊瑚礁看来像是大花园
The coral reef looks like a vast garden,

94
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:53,865
却是几百万个小动物组成的
but it' one made up of millions of tiny animals.

95
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:01,064
每个珊瑚都是水螅虫群落
Each coral is a colony of polyps,

96
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:04,264
全都会过滤流经海流的食物
all filtering food from the passing current.

97
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:14,362
但珊瑚水螅虫成功的真正秘密
But the real secret to a coral polups' success

98
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:18,861
是藏在组织之内的微型花园
are the minute gardens,
buried inside, buried in the tissue.

99
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:27,760
几百万个微型共生藻 为自己
Millions of zooxanthellae, microscopic 
algae, make food for themselves 

100
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,959
和寄生珊瑚制造食物
以光合作用
and their host coral, 
by photosynthesis

101
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,059
利用赤道太阳的力量
by harnessing the power of the equatorial sun.

102
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:49,557
这植物、动物和太阳间
难以置信的关系
This incredible relationship, 
betwen plants and animals and sun,

103
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,756
建立了巨型珊瑚堡垒
has built a great coral fortress.

104
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:57,055
珊瑚快速成礁
Yet as fast as the corals build the reef,

105
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,755
有些栖息者却要捣毁珊瑚礁
some inhabitants break it down.

106
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:10,353
一只隆头鹦哥咬破珊瑚硬骨架找
里面的水螅虫
A bumphead parrotfish chews the coral's 
hard skeleton to get at the polyps inside.

107
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:15,252
但它既破坏又建设
But it's as much a builder as destroyer.

108
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,952
它排泄出来的珊瑚是沙
It excretes the coral as sand

109
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:23,251
沙可以堆成岛屿和沙滩
sand that helps buid the 
island and its beaches.

110
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:31,750
帕米拉的珊瑚礁栖息着几百种鱼
Palmyra's reef is home to 
hundreds of fish species.

111
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,349
18种蝴蝶鱼栖身于此
Eighteen species of 
butterfly fish live here,

112
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,948
有些只吃珊瑚水螅虫
some so specialised they eat 
nothing but coral polyps.

113
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:47,947
它们的嘴巴像钳子
进食时准确而小心
With mouths shaped like forceps,
they're precise and careful eaters.

114
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,346
清洁隆头鱼靠其他鱼维生
A cleaner wrasse makes its living off other fish 

115
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:59,545
清除寄生虫是不俗的生意
parasite removal is a thriving business.

116
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:17,342
在赤道太阳每天照射12小时
At the Equator, the sun shines 
for twelve hours every day

117
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:22,241
但12小时黑暗里生命没有停止
but life doesn't stop during 
the twelve hours of darkness.

118
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,941
鲣鸟仍在海洋上觅食
boobies still feed out in the open ocean.

119
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,940
但礁上已经面目全非
But on the reef, much changes.

120
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,939
隆头鹦哥身上的颜色
晚上变成黄褐色
A bumphead parrotfish is dressed 
in drab night colours, 

121
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,738
睡觉的时候隐藏自己
to hide as it sleeps.

122
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,538
一群浮游生物浮上海面觅食
Swarms of zooplankton rise 
to the surface to feed

123
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,937
它们被鬼魅般的动物吃掉
and are fed upon by ghosty figures.

124
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,634
魟的双翼长近三米
Manta rays with wings spanning 
nearly three metres swoop and dance

125
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:11,734
每晚在这里吸食宝贵食物
as they suck up the riches 
available here every night.

126
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,930
珊瑚在荒芜的赤道太平洋中心
制造了丰饶绿洲
The corals have created a rich oasis in 
the middle of the barren Equatorial Pacific.

127
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:45,228
但这么多种鱼和珊瑚怎么会在
贫乏海洋中间的小环礁共存？
But how did so many different fish and corals come to populate 
this tiny, islated atoll in the middle of an empty ocean?

128
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:51,127
太阳和地球转动形成强烈贸易风
The sun and spin of the earth 
create trade winds so powerful

129
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:55,326
贸易风吹动两大团水
向西太平洋移动
they move two great masses of water 
towards the western Pacific.

130
00:14:55,827 --> 00:15:00,826
结果是海面上升，然后向下流动
The result is a raisd sea level, 
which then flows back downhill,

131
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:03,025
沿赤道东流
eastward along the Equator,

132
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:06,925
形成宽几百公里的逆流
as a counter-current, a few 
hundred kilometres wide.

133
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,524
帕米拉环礁就在它的途中
Palmyra Atoll lies directly in its path.

134
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:19,123
逆流将很多鱼卵和珊瑚幼虫
The counter cuttent brings eggs 
and larvae of many fish and corals

135
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,922
由亚洲边缘的珊瑚礁
from reefs on the edge of Asia

136
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:24,522
这一群年轻海洋生物
让帕米拉环礁
this bounty of young marine life makes Palmyra Atoll 

137
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:29,521
比在海流以外的夏威夷等
岛群要丰饶得多
much richer than island groups such as Hawaii, 
that lie outside the current's fiow.

138
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,918
很多帕米拉生物在
流经海流诞下后代
In their turn, many Palmyra species launch 
their offspring into the passing current.

139
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:51,018
在一月最高潮时交配的刺尾鱼
排出大量精子和卵子
On the highest tide of the month mating 
surgeonfish release clouds of sperm and eggs.

140
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:01,116
很多受精卵被外流潮水
冲离珊瑚礁
Many fertilized eggs are swept away 
from the reef on the outgoing tide,

141
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:06,615
在流动缓慢的逆流里向东
踏上未知旅程
to face an uncertain journey east, 
in the slow-moving counter current.

142
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:14,514
卵子几天内就会孵成幼体
Within days the eggs hatch into larvae.

143
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:18,213
几星期后变成小鱼
After a few weeks they develop into tiny fish.

144
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:23,512
孵化后两个月内随波逐流的小鱼
需要停留在珊瑚礁上
Within two months of hatching the hopeful 
travellers need to settle on a reef.

145
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:27,012
但最接近陆地的是
加拉帕哥斯群岛
But the nearest land is 
the Galapagos Islands,

146
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,511
要向东前进五个月
five months travel to the east.

147
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:34,010
它们的水流太慢了
Their current is too slow

148
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:36,210
即使猎兽不吃它们
even if predators don't get them,

149
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,910
小鱼也会时日无多
the young fish will run out of time.

150
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,008
在逆流底下
Far below the counter current,

151
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,608
较快的克伦威尔海流
也沿赤道东流
the faster Cromwell Current 
is also flowing east along the Equator.

152
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:54,307
它带着最远来自南极的深海海水
It carries deep ocean water 
from as far away as Antarctica.

153
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,106
它终于浮到水面
It finally rises to the surface 

154
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:01,306
在加拉帕哥斯群岛西面
up the flanks of the western Galapagos Islands

155
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,940
水域非常寒冷，却意味生机勃勃
its waters are very cold,

156
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,193
却意味生机勃勃
yet they hold the promise of life.

157
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,702
水流含有大量溶解矿物
The current is rich in dissolved minerals

158
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:30,802
这些营养遇上赤道太阳
就会产生奇迹
and when these nutrients meet the 
equatorial sun, a miracle occurs.

159
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:38,300
矿物喂饱了微型植物
例如矽藻
The minerals feed microscopic plants, 
such as diatoms

160
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,399
它们在阳光照射的水面繁殖
and in the sunlit surface 
waters they reproduce,

161
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,699
再次分开
生命迅速繁衍
dividing again and again, 
in an explosion of life.

162
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:07,395
这些繁殖迅速的浮游生物将
海洋变成黑压压一片
These dense plankton blooms turn 
the sea into a murky soup that 

163
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:08,495
能喂养很多动物
feeds many species,

164
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,995
包括一种不平凡的猎兽
including an unusual predator -

165
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,994
不能飞行的巨型鸬鹚
the giant, flightless cormorant.

166
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:29,392
这小鸬鹚群是繁忙之地
This small cormorant colony is a busy place

167
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,691
有些要喂养大幼鸟
Some pairs have large chicks to feed;

168
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,391
有些刚刚开始繁殖
others are just beginning to bred.

169
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:42,390
这些孤立岛屿上没有陆上猎兽
There are no land predators 
on these islated islands,

170
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,389
所以鸬鹚不需飞行逃走
so there's nothing here that 
the cormorants need fly away from

171
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,588
时间一久它们失去飞行能力
over time, they've lost the power of flight -

172
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,388
它们走路或者游泳
instead they walk or swim.

173
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:11,285
鸬鹚只有几百对
There are just a few hundred 
pairs of cormorants.

174
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:15,684
它们只栖息在一年克伦威尔
海流流经的地方
They live only where the Cromwell 
Current wells up, year round,

175
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:18,384
在加拉帕哥斯群岛西面
on the western Galapagos Islands.

176
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:26,483
所有准备好面对这些寒冷水域的
动物都大快朵颐
All the animals that are prepared 
to brave these icy waters dine well.

177
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:36,181
海生鬣蜥在加拉帕哥斯群岛
比比皆是
Marine iguanas are found throughout 
the Galapagos Island group

178
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:41,980
但西面的鬣蜥是最大最肥的
but these ones in the west are 
by far the biggest and fattest.

179
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,679
日出时鬣蜥一如平时等待着
It's dawn, and the iguanas are 
playing their usual waiting game.

180
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,878
这些爬行动物和它们忍受的
长夜一样寒冷
These reptiles are now as cold as 
the long night they've just endured

181
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,377
它们要晒一会儿太阳后才觅食
they need to heat up in the 
sun before they can feed.

182
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:07,176
寒冷令最大的雄蜥焦躁
Cold makes the largest males grumoy.

183
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,970
冰冷鬣蜥不只要等晒数小时太阳
才能让身体暖和得足以觅食
Cool iguanas not only have to wait for hours 
until the sun warms them enough to feed

184
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:48,670
它们也要忍受附近忙碌的鸬鹚
they must also tolerate their 
busy cormorant neighbours.

185
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,869
鸬鹚高近一米
让晒太阳的鬣蜥相形见拙
Nearly a metre hall, 
the cormorants dwarf the basking iguanas.

186
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:59,968
温血鸟类无需等待就可以进冷水
The warm-blooded birds don't need 
to wait to get in the cold water

187
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,667
这对热恋鸬鹚自日出就在跳舞
this courting pair have 
been dancing since dawn.

188
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,264
在这里做不懂飞行的鸟类很好
This is a great place to 
be a flightless bird

189
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:24,464
雄鸬鹚永远不需离开巢外几百米
a male cormorant never needs to travel 
more than a few hundred metres from his nest.

190
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:29,963
寒冷的克伦威尔海流提供一切
The cold Cromwell Current 
provides everything

191
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:34,962
包括它一定要带给同巢鸬鹚的
大量新鲜藻类
including the gifts offresh algae 
he must bring to his nest mate.

192
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:07,957
雌鸬鹚将藻类砌成鸟巢
The female adds the gift to the 
collection she's fashioning into a nest

193
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:13,356
完成后巢就会高得足以
防止卵撞上硬石
when complete, it'll be just high enough 
to keep her eggs off the hard rock.

194
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:23,454
将近中午时邻近的鸬鹚
已经忙了几小时
By mid-morning, when the nearby cormorants 
have already been busy for hours,

195
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:28,453
饥饿的鬣蜥只是刚刚开始活动
the hungry iguanas are only just 
beginning to show signs of action.

196
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:36,252
第一批雄性大鬣蜥慢慢爬到水边
The first big males slowly make 
their way down to the water's edge.

197
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:46,550
食草鬣蜥有很不寻常的生活方式
The vegetarian iguanas have 
a most unlikely lifestyle,

198
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:49,650
只有在赤道才可能
one that's only possible here, 
at the Equator

199
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,649
热带太阳的热力让它们能够
忍受寒冷海水
where the heat of there tropical sun 
allows them to endure the chilly waters.

200
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:05,747
离岸几百米处是冷海流栽培的
繁茂藻类花园
Just a few hudred metres offshore, nurtured by 
the cold current, there are lush algae gardens.

201
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,646
但只有雄性大鬣蜥有足够的
块头抵受泠水
But only the largest males have enough 
body mass to survive the chill waters

202
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,245
小鬣蜥则会失温过快而死
a small iguana would lose 
heat too quickly and die.

203
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:35,543
只有雄性大鬣蜥潜入水里
寻找藻类最丰富的地方
Only big males dive down to feed 
where the algae is most lush.

204
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:43,441
但为什么这雄性大鬣蜥能够
忍受摄氏16度水温
But how can even this large male survive 
water that's just 16 degrees Celsius,

205
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:46,641
这温度低得足以杀死
冷血爬行动物
low enough to kill a 
cold-blooded reptile?

206
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:53,940
一只潜水的雄鬣蜥将血
抽离身体表面
A diving male moves blood 
away from his body surface,

207
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,939
转而保存主要器官的热力
to help conserve heat in his core organs.

208
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,638
它也大幅减少心跳率
He also drastically lowers his heart rate

209
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,238
这样它就能抵受体温下降15度
By doing this, he can survive a 
fifteen degree drop in body temperature.

210
00:24:11,837 --> 00:24:13,118
上午将尽
As the morning wears on,

211
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,836
其他大鬣蜥身体
够暖和了，纷纷潜水
other big iguanas become warm 
enough to take the plunge.

212
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:44,531
一只雄鬣蜥的长爪钩着
凹陷的火山熔岩
A male hooks his long claws 
into the pitted volcanic lava,

213
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:47,631
准备面对海浪上升
as he braces himself against 
the wave surge.

214
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:06,428
鬣蜥食量惊人
Iguanas are voracious eaters.

215
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:07,927
它们会将藻类吃个干净
They clip the algae until it

216
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,327
看来像是新草地
looks like a newly mown lawn.

217
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,126
但藻类在这丰饶水域生长迅速
But algae grows fast in these rich waters

218
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:17,426
几天后又能喂给鬣蜥
and can be grazed again in just a few days,

219
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,725
潜水的鬣蜥一定要尽快吃藻类
A diving iguanas must feed quickly,

220
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,224
它是陆地动物
经常要浮上水面呼吸
Being a land animal, 
he surfaces often to breath.

221
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:33,424
它最多只能在冷水里两小时
And he can only survive the cold 
water for two hours at the most,

222
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:36,123
之后就一定要回到岸上
before he must head back to shore.

223
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:44,122
雄性大鬣蜥潜了好一阵子的水后
非常寒冷
After a long dive,big males 
are so chilled,

224
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,321
几乎无法游动
they 're barely able to swim.

225
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:50,721
如果它们冲出海洋就会必死无疑
If they're swept out to sea,
they'll face certain death.

226
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:54,620
每只都要奋力游回温暖岸边
Each must fight his way back 
to the warm shore.

227
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:10,318
潮水最终低得露出最浅的藻床
At last the tide is low enough to 
expose the shallowest algae beds.

228
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:19,216
较小的雌鬣蜥和年轻鬣蜥
终于可以进食
finally, the smaller females 
and young iguanas can feed.

229
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,615
但它们也要尽快
But they, too, must hurry

230
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,815
它们要和转变的潮水斗快
they're in a race against the turning tide.

231
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:52,611
海生鬣蜥和另一种热带爬行动物
分享藻类花园
Marine iguanas share the rich algae gardens 
with another tropical reptile. 

232
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,510
和鬣蜥一样
加拉帕哥斯群岛绿龟
Like the iguanas,
the Galapagos green turtle 

233
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,309
在冷水里行动缓慢
is slow and sluggish in the cold.

234
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:09,208
绿龟没有鬣蜥的爪抵挡浪涛
It lacks an iguana's claws 
to hold on in the swell,

235
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:11,307
但它们锲而不舍
but it's persistent 

236
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:15,107
生长迅速的藻类值得它们这样做
and the fast-growing algae 
is well worth the effort.

237
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,806
对西岛的动物来说
For the inhabitants of 
the western islands,

238
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:26,905
克伦威尔海流是可靠提供者
the Cromwell Current is 
a reliable provider.

239
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:32,304
但在较难预测的东岛又怎样？
But what's happening in the less
predictable world of the eastern islands?

240
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:38,403
现在是五月初
太阳让水面升温至25度
Right now, in early May, the sun has heated 
the surface water to 25 degrees 

241
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:41,503
海水清澈，提供的食物不多
it's clear, and offers little food.

242
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:51,401
加拉帕哥斯群岛企鹅同时住在
寒冷西岛和温暖东岛
Galapagos penguins live in both the 
cold western and warm eastern islands.

243
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:54,700
在东方，时间很难熬
In the east, times are hard

244
00:27:55,001 --> 00:28:00,600
但这里的企鹅期望着
食物丰富的冷水很快到达
but penguins here are gambling on a rich, 
cold water bonanza arriving soon.

245
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,098
蝴蝶鱼找到喜爱的温暖海水
Butterfly fish fine the warm 
waters very much to their liking.

246
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:13,598
但和帕米拉环礁不同
这里没有太多珊瑚
However, unlike Palmyra there's 
not much coral here to feed on,

247
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:16,597
所以它们改变了生活方式
so they've changed lifestyles.

248
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,796
一些蝴蝶鱼现在吃寄生虫
Some butterfly fish now eat parasites

249
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,396
它们成了清洁鱼
they have become cleaner fish.

250
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,195
要在这里生存
To survive here

251
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,595
你要适应
不然就要死
you adapt or die.

252
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:40,393
对海岸鸟类而言
For some coastal birds,

253
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:45,793
岛屿附近的温暖海水和海洋一样
是毫无生命的沙漠
the warm water around the islands is as 
much a lifeless desert as the open ocean.

254
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,891
但这些蓝脚鲣鸟和企鹅一样
However, like the penguins, 
these blue footed boobies 

255
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:54,191
期望着冷水到来
are gambling on the arrival of cold water,

256
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,190
幼鸟能够有充足食物
rich in food for hungry chicks.

257
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,789
这一对蓝脚鲣鸟刚刚交往
This pair is in the early stages of courtship.

258
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,688
接下来几天它们的关系
会更进一步做一些例行动作
Over the next few days they'll deepen 
their relationship with ritual displays

259
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:15,888
和开始选择筑巢地
and begin the task of choosing a nest site.

260
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:38,883
这一对蓝脚鲣鸟刚刚开始
This pair is just starting

261
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,683
但其他蓝脚鲣鸟已经生下幼鸟
but others already have chicks.

262
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:46,582
成双成对的蓝脚鲣鸟群落处于
不同繁殖阶段
Throughout the colony pairs are 
at different stages of breeding

263
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:52,182
但未来无法肯定
让后代冒上生命危险
but all are gambling the lives of 
their offspring on an uncertain future.

264
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:54,981
这一对蓝脚鲣鸟很早筑巢
This pair nested early

265
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,180
如果冷水很快到达
它们就会是赢家
They'll be winners if the 
cold water arrives soon.

266
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:01,880
它们有两只蛋，其他的鸟有三只
They have two eggs, others have three.

267
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,479
它们也许能养大所有幼鸟
或者一只也养不大
They might raise all their 
chiks or none it all 

268
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,679
全要看食物何时到达
depends on when the food arrives.

269
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,398
一只雄性蓝脚鲣鸟在离巢不远处
潜进水里觅食
A male blue footed booby dives 
for food, not far from the nest.

270
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,596
但水仍然是暖的
But the water is still warm

271
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:36,295
它只是徒劳无功
there's little reward for all his hard work.

272
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,894
它和伴侣是最早繁殖的
He and his mate were among 
the earliest to breed.

273
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,694
最初有三只蛋
They started with three eggs

274
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:47,893
但它们只找到
足够一只幼鸟吃的食物
but they're only finding enough 
food for a single chick

275
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:52,893
目前它们没有转运的迹象
and at the moment there's no sign
of a change in their fortunes.

276
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,815
这幼鸟生存与否要看地球的轨道
This chick's survival depends 
on the Earth's Orbit

277
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,650
和太阳的位置
and the position of the sun.

278
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:05,491
太阳向北半球移动
As it moves towards the northern hemisphere,

279
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,090
带着贸易风和海洋水流
it's bringing trade winds 
and ocean currents with it

280
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:12,590
对鲣鸟来说，这意味着富足
and for the boobies, 
the promise of plenty.

281
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,789
鲣鸟不只冒季节转变
何时开始的险
The boobies are notjust gambling on 
when the change in season will happen.

282
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,988
也面对着即时的问题
They have a more immediate problem.

283
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:33,387
这年轻军舰鸟已经学会
偷勤劳的鲣鸟的食物
This young frigate bird is already learning
to steal food from the hard-working boobies.

284
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:39,685
军舰鸟的成功相当依靠
鲣鸟的运气
Frigate bird success relies heavily 
on the fortunes of the boobies,

285
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:43,385
所以它们将繁殖选在这个时候
so they've timed their breeding 
to coincide with them.

286
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:59,882
军舰鸟现在繁殖
冷水来临时也会受惠
By breeding now frigate birds will also 
benefit when the cold water arrives.

287
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:04,781
如果鲣鸟没事
这些小偷也会繁衍
If boobies do well,
then there pirates will thrive

288
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:08,981
如果水继续暖和
它们就会受苦
if the water stays warm, 
they'll both suffer.

289
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:12,880
雌军舰鸟在空中飞过
As female fly overhead,

290
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,679
一群雄军舰鸟争相以红色气囊
取悦它们
a group of males compete to impress 
them with the redness of their air sacs,

291
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,079
它们使劲叫嚷抖动
and the vigorousness of their 
calling and shaking.

292
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:43,075
这地方难以居住
This is a rough beighbourhood.

293
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,374
一只收集树枝筑巢的红脚鲣鸟
A red footed booby collecting 
sticks to build a nest

294
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,974
一定要面对空中盗贼
must run a gauntlet of aerial pirates

295
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:52,274
它们既偷树枝又偷食物
as intent on thieving sticks 
as they are food.

296
00:32:56,573 --> 00:33:00,772
军舰鸟翅膀张开超过两米
身体轻巧
With a wingspan of more than two metres, 
and an amazingly light body,

297
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:03,872
是飞行技术高超的恶棍
a frigate bird is an aerobatic thug

298
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:07,871
能够在空中偷掉鲣鸟嘴里的树枝
able to steal sticks out 
a booby's beak in mid air.

299
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:29,967
鲣鸟掉下树枝
The booby drops its stick

300
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:32,867
但敏捷的军舰鸟轻松地捡起来
but the agile trigate bird just swoops it up.

301
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,865
偷窃是非常危险的做法
Thievery is a very risky strategy

302
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:49,364
这对军舰鸟只会养一只幼鸟
so much so that this pair will raise just a single chick.

303
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:51,664
这是艰巨的工作
It's an epicjob

304
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:58,263
它们的后代要一年半
才能学会空中偷窃
it will be a year and a half before their 
offspring masters the dark art of aerial piracy.

305
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:13,061
尚在学习的小偷连成年军舰鸟
也会下手
Even an adult frigate bird is a fair target, 
for an apprentice pirate.

306
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:33,057
资源竞争非常激烈
Competition for resources is so intense,

307
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:37,257
军舰鸟要一直保持警觉
在巢里也不例外
that frigate birds always have 
to be on guard even at the nest.

308
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:50,455
军舰鸟和鲣鸟认为
冷水会带来食物
Frigate birds and boobies are gambling 
that cold water will bring them food

309
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,054
信天翁相信会带来凉爽天气
the albatrosses trust it 
will bring cool weather

310
00:34:54,554 --> 00:34:56,453
希望很快来临
hopefully soon.

311
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:03,352
尽管信天翁是寒冷气候的鸟类
Although albatrosses are cold climate birds,

312
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:06,852
加拉帕哥斯群岛是
弄潮信天翁的栖息地
the Galapagos Islands are home 
to wave albatrosses,

313
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,751
唯一的热带信天翁
the only truly tropical species.

314
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:16,050
它们只在这里繁殖
This is the only place they breed,

315
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,250
它们来这里，因为这里是
没有猎兽的安全地方
and they're here because it's a safe, 
predator-free haven.

316
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,649
但对回来的雌信天翁并不安全
But it's not so safe for a returning female.

317
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:27,848
它一定要穿过一群雄信天翁
She must run a gauntlet of males,

318
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,348
它们都想和它交配
hell-bent on mating with her.

319
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:39,047
这些信天翁都不是
雌信天翁的伴侣
Neither of these males is this female's mate

320
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:43,746
1/4幼鸟不是养育它们的
雄信天翁的后代
Around a quater of all chicks are not 
fathered by the male who raises them.

321
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:56,613
对信天翁而言
Among albatrosses,

322
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,450
强奸和住在赤道同样意料不到
rape is as unexpected as living at the Equator

323
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,942
但这些是加拉帕哥斯群岛
but these are the Galapagos Islands,

324
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:07,042
奇怪和不可能的事会发生
where strange and improbable things happen.

325
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:14,941
信天翁和军舰鸟一样
只养一只幼鸟
Like frigate birds, albatrosses 
raise just one chick

326
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:18,440
这工作需要一对信天翁
近八个月时间
The task will take a pair 
nearly eight months.

327
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:22,540
它们交配前几星期前互相展示
For weeks before they begin, 
they display to each other.

328
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,539
这是保证尽管和其他信天翁交配
it's a way of ensuring that,
despite all the extra matings,

329
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,338
两只鸟仍会一起做这漫长的工作
both birds will be committed 
to the lengthy task ahead.

330
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:10,532
这一对信天翁长时间的仪式
加强它们的联系
The pair's prolonged ritual 
strengthens their bond,

331
00:37:10,632 --> 00:37:13,231
为了它们分离过活的长时期
for the long periods they spend apart.

332
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,831
它们在1500公里外觅食
They feed fifteen hundred kilometres away,

333
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:19,830
在秘鲁海岸外上升的冷水
in cold water upwellings off the 
coast of Peru.

334
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,729
每只鸟或许要离开两星期
Each bird may be away for two weeks at a time,

335
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,229
但这次长旅程是值得的
but the long journey is well worth it.

336
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:33,528
信天翁的觅食地非常富饶
The albatrosses' feeding grounds 
are incredibly rich

337
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:38,028
这些觅食地是加拉帕哥斯群岛的
动物等待的关键
and they're the key to what the animale 
of the Galapagos are waiting for.

338
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:44,126
太阳不仅制造太平洋的海洋水流
The sun not only generates Pacific's ocean currents,

339
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:46,826
也能移动水流
it has the power to move them around.

340
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:51,325
五月时，太阳向北移动
During May, when the sun is moving north,

341
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:54,825
东南贸易风正在加强
the south-east trade winds are gatheribg strength.

342
00:37:55,525 --> 00:38:01,823
到时候就会将秘鲁海岸的
洪堡洋流拖向北面
When they're strong enough, they'll drag the cold 
Humboldt Current northwards from the coast of Peru.

343
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:06,523
一层云会预示冷水到来
The arrival of the cold water 
is marked by a layer of cloud

344
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:11,222
这是丰饶的清凉季节
称为浓湿雾
this is the cool season of plenty 
known as the 'garua'.

345
00:38:14,522 --> 00:38:15,001
但这时
But at the moment,

346
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,422
东岛仍被温暖贫瘠的水包围
the eastern islands remain surrouded 
by warm barren water.

347
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,920
只得西岛有食物
Only the western islands have food.

348
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:25,820
多得可靠的洪堡洋流
thanks to the reliable Crownwell Current,

349
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,219
雄性大鬣蜥在藻类花园
进食了两小时
The big male iguana's been feeding 
in the algae gardens for two hours.

350
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:38,691
它现在很冷
He's now so cold,

351
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,612
连吃进去的藻类也消化不了
He not even capable of digesting the algae he's just eaten.

352
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:47,516
应该提高体温了
It's time to warm up again.

353
00:38:56,115 --> 00:39:01,714
寒冷的鬣蜥把自己靠在热石上
Cold iguanas press themselves against 
the hot rock for maximum warming.

354
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:10,713
雄性大鬣蜥吸引热力时
身体慢慢恢复活动
As the big male absorbs heat, 
activity slowly returns to his body.

355
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:25,610
只有等它的体温恢复至35度
才能消化胃里的藻
Only when his temperature reaches 35 degrees 
can he digest the algae in his stomach.

356
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:42,907
一只年轻鸬鹚打扰晒太阳的鬣蜥
A young cormorant bothers the sunbathing iguanas,

357
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:44,707
只因为它有恃无恐
just because it can.

358
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:00,804
尽管有恼人的邻居
Despite the annoying neighbours,

359
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:06,604
加拉帕哥斯群岛有一切支持
鬣蜥异常生活方式的情况
the Galapagos Islands have all the conditions 
to support the iguanas unusual lifestyle,

360
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,003
像焗炉一样散发热力的黑熔岩
The black lava, which radiates heat like an oven

361
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:12,502
和中午的烈日
and the intense midday sun a blessing

362
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:17,302
让两个截然不同的世界同时并存
that makes life between two 
very different worlds possible.

363
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:25,301
雄鸬鹚整天在冷水进出收集藻类
The male cormorant is in and out of the 
cold water all day collecting algae gifts.

364
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:28,900
它没有注意到岸上变得多热
He doesn't notice how hot it's become ashore.

365
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,899
但对一些动物来说
无情的中午热力是诅咒
But for some animals, 
the merciless midday heat is a curse.

366
00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:41,698
所有筑巢鸟类都面对太阳的考验
All nesting birds are facing trial by sun.

367
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:50,696
鸬鹚群的地面温度接近40度
Ground temperatures in the cormorant 
colony have climbed into the thirties

368
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,796
但成年鸬鹚无法躲避
but the adults can't escape.

369
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:55,895
它们要看守蛋和幼鸟
They're trapped by their eggs and chicks.

370
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:08,893
赤道太阳划过天空
As the equatorial sun moves across the sky,

371
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:12,793
一只鲣鸟转身躲避酷热
a booby turns to face away from its burning heat

372
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:16,792
在巢边制造鸟粪日晷
creating a guano sundial around its nest.

373
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,891
它扬起背部羽毛
想要挡着凉风
It raises the feathers on its back, 
trying to catch a cool breeze.

374
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,490
一只幼鸟在父母的身影下
A chick shelters in shade cast by its parent.

375
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:29,290
但成年鸬鹚无处遮阴
but there's no shade for the adults.

376
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:43,288
孵化的信天翁喘气驱热
An incubating albatross pants to lose heat.

377
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:46,787
它的父母直觉会受到最大考验
its parental instincts tested to the limit 

378
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:49,587
直至凉快的浓湿雾到来
until the cool garua arrives.

379
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:57,785
海狮较轻松
Sealions have it easier

380
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:01,285
一天最热的时候可以滑水
during the hottest part of the day they go surfing.

381
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,779
加拉帕哥斯群岛的气候反复无常
On the Galapagos Islands climate is unpredictable

382
00:42:39,379 --> 00:42:43,078
情况每天每年改变
conditions change from day to day, year to year.

383
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,178
生物尽量应对不稳定情况
Creatures deal with the uncertainty as best they can.

384
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:52,177
鲣鸟幼鸟，孵化了
A booby chick hatches

385
00:42:52,977 --> 00:42:55,276
但它的未来会怎样？
but what will its future hold?

386
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:57,976
今天它有食物
There's food for it today

387
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,775
但明天能吃饱吗？
but will it get fed tomorrow?

388
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:04,475
冷水何时来到？
When will the cold water arrive?

389
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:07,474
如果不来的话会怎样？
And what happens if it doesn't arrive at all?

390
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:16,273
每隔几年岛就会
被温暖贫瘠的水包围
Every few years the islands remain 
surrounded by warm empty water

391
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:19,072
这叫做厄尔尼诺
This is called El Nino

392
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:23,472
所有依靠冷水来临的动物
都要受苦
All the animals that depend on the 
coming of the cold water, suffer.

393
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:25,771
厄尔尼诺严重的话
In a severe El Nino,

394
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:28,671
连可靠的克伦威尔海流都来不到
even the reliable Cromwell Current may fall

395
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:31,770
后果不堪设想
the effect is devastating.

396
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:43,668
海狮和小海豹饿死
Sea lions and seal pups starve to death.

397
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:46,268
只有腐肉食动物过着好日子
Only scavengers do well.

398
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:52,267
很多鲣鸟离巢而去
Many booby desert their nests,

399
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:55,966
留下熔岩海鸥吃遗下的蛋
leaving lava gulls to feast on abandoned eggs.

400
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:01,965
死亡逼近鲣鸟群
Death stalks the booby colony.

401
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:04,965
只有最强壮的幼鸟能够生存
Only the strongest chicks survive.

402
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:17,263
最近一次厄尔尼诺引致
很多鬣蜥死亡
In a recent El Nino, many iguanas died

403
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,662
但其他鬣蜥靠缩小生存下来
but others cheated death by shrinking.

404
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:27,762
它们的身体，包括骨头
缩小了近1/4
Their whole body, including skeleton, 
shrank by nearly aquarter.

405
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:35,860
缩小的幸存者可以靠较少
和较差的食物生存
shrunken survivors could exist on less, 
poor quality food.

406
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,759
鬣蜥一定要灵活变通
Iguanas must always be resourceful

407
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,059
它们这样才能在这些
沙漠岛上生存
it's how they survive on these 
desert islands.

408
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:49,858
它们每天都要抵受酷热
Each day they walk a thermal tightrope

409
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,757
近傍晚的时候，连鬣蜥都太热了
by mid afternoon, even the iguqnas are too hot.

410
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,857
它们不碰发烫的地面让自己凉快
They push their bodies off the hot ground to cool themselves

411
00:44:58,457 --> 00:45:02,256
彷彿它们想要看看
来临的浓湿雾
it's as if they're trying to catch a glimpse of the coming garua.

412
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:07,255
远处的云预示浓湿雾快将来临
Clouds on the horizon hint it might be near

413
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,854
但也许这近在眼前，却无影无迹
but it's come this close before, and still failed.

414
00:45:13,354 --> 00:45:18,153
日落时分
生物暂且获得片刻抒缓
Sunset grants the animales of the 
Galapagos a temporary reprieve.

415
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:22,552
鬣蜥现在冒着体温过低的风险
The iguanas now risk becoming too cool.

416
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,452
但对海鸟来说
but for the seabirds

417
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:27,252
长夜让它们松一口气
the long night will be a blessed relief.

418
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:43,549
对海狮来说，黑暗带来新可能
For the sea lions, darkness brings new possibilities.

419
00:45:49,649 --> 00:45:53,748
它们现在可以在水下悬崖
猎食睡着的鱼
They can now hunt for sleeping fish on underwater cliffs.

420
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,404
热天已经很长时间了
As long hot days turn into weeks,

421
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:26,242
云慢慢在岛上积聚
clouds slowly gather over the islands,

422
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:29,242
冷水快到这里了
The cold water is almost here.

423
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:34,141
这是今年小鬣蜥的好时机
It's good timing for this year's iguana hatchlings.

424
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:37,540
这小鬣蜥花了几天
This baby iguana has spent days,

425
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:41,240
挖开孵化的地方
在沙滩碎石深处
digging its way up from where it hatched, 
deep in the beach gravel.

426
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,639
它首次出现在地面上
Above ground for the first time,

427
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,139
尝试免让其他动物发现
一边盘算最好的逃跑地方
it tries to avoid detection while 
it works out the best place to run.

428
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,237
这小鬣蜥一定要走过
空旷沙滩的无人之地
The hatchling must cross a 
no-man's land of empty beach.

429
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,737
到达可以安全藏身的石头
to reach rocks where it can safely hide.

430
00:47:11,535 --> 00:47:12,734
它做到了
It makes it.

431
00:47:16,635 --> 00:47:22,134
小鬣蜥直觉知道
会在海里找到好运
Instinctively the young iguana knows that 
it'll find its fortune from the sea

432
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:26,533
尽管它要过几年身体长大后
才能潜进水里
although it'll be many years before 
it's big enough to dive down

433
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,232
在克伦威尔海流富饶的
藻类花园觅食
to feed in the rich algae 
gardens of the Cromwell Current.

434
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:38,730
季节终于改变
Finally, the seasons change

435
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,930
冷水到达了
the cold water arrives,

436
00:47:41,031 --> 00:47:44,130
每次总是伴随着厚云
accompanied by its trademark heavy cloud.

437
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,929
这是浓湿雾季节
This is the season of the garua.

438
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:57,427
浓雾形成，赤道太阳和洪堡洋流
冷水互动
The dense mist forms as the hot equatorial sun 
interacts with the cold water of the Humboldt Current.

439
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,427
浓湿雾带来较凉快的温度
The garua brings cooler temperatures

440
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,226
弄潮信天翁现在舒服一点
waved albatrosses are more comfortable now.

441
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,724
一只虚弱的鲣鸟运气好
A weak booby chick is in luck

442
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:21,923
今年它会有食物
there will be food for it 
this year, after all.

443
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,023
在这巢里两只幼鸟都会生存
In this nest, both chicks will survive.

444
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:31,222
不只鲣鸟可以繁衍
It's not just the boobies who prosper 

445
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:33,421
军舰鸟也会
so will the frigate birds.

446
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,820
对所有海洋生物来说
For all the creatures of the sea,

447
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:46,520
浓湿雾到来是难以置信的
丰饶时候的开始
the coming of the garua is the beginning 
of an incredible time of plenty.

448
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:03,917
西部的克伦威尔海流
是可靠的全年提供者
In the west, the Cromwell Current 
is a reliable year-round provider.

449
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,916
在东部，每年有几个月
In the east, for a few months each year,

450
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:12,216
强大的洪堡洋流
带来难以想像的财富
the powerful Humboldt Current 
brings unimaginable wealth

451
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,615
丰富的冷水，由南极一直到赤道
rich cold water, all the way 
from Antarctica to the Equator,

452
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,714
来到加拉帕哥斯群岛
here at the Galapagos Islands.

453
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:29,913
赤道太阳的威力
和冷水水流的矿物
The power of the equatorial sun
and the minerals in the cold current

454
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:34,112
是激发生命暴增的火花
are the sparks that ignite an explosion of life

455
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:40,611
浮游生物生长非常迅速
遮蔽了阳光
plankton grows so quickly and thickly, 
it dims the light.

456
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,509
浮游生物分布非常广阔
The plankton blooms are so vast,

457
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,809
在太空也看得到
they can be seen from space 

458
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:56,508
给贸易风吹到西面
blown to the west by the trade winds.

459
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:12,605
大量的萨利马鱼群是东岛企鹅
等待已久的宝物
Enormous schools of salimas are the bonanza the 
penguins of the eastern islands have been waiting for.

460
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:32,103
这一年所有依靠海洋的动物
都有好日子过
This is a good year for all animales 
that depend on the sea.

461
00:50:33,403 --> 00:50:37,002
海洋水流，因为赤道太阳而动
Ocean currents, set in motion by the equatorial sun,

462
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:39,501
带来肯定和财富
have brought certainty and wealth.

463
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:44,901
生命在这些疑幻疑真的
沙漠岛繁衍
Life prospers on these improbable 
desert islands 

464
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:46,900
在冷水的绿州上
in an oasis of cold water,

465
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,699
由太阳…
created by the power of the sun.

466
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:52,969
和海洋的能量催生
and the power of the ocean.
