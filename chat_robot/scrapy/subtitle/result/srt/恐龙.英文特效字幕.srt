{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shh, shh. I'm here.

109
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. We can't stay here.

110

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, now, Suri. There's nothing to be afraid of.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Look! - Whoa!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Did you see that? - What? - I did.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Me too! - Where did it go? - I don't know. Let's go see.

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Leave it alone. Hey! - Shh, Dad.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You heard Kron. Move it!

122
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Watch it.

123
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Zini, get your head down.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster.

125

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Keep those little legs movin', Url, or you'll get left behind.

126

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at all the Aladars.

127

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you're even thinking of joining them...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron,

130
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There is a more protected spot further down the...

131
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We'll rest here for the night. Go ahead, Bruton.

132
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now.

133
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All this pushing and shoving about,

134
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}just for a place to sleep.

135
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm not used to this kind of behavior.

136
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Baylene, you got big feet. Just give 'em a kick. Git!

137
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ooh, I couldn't possibly.

138
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shoo, shoo.

139
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will you come on, Baylene? You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive?

140
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Show some backbone. - Hey, there.

141

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, sorry about that.

142
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, it's just, we overheard you talking, and, um...

143
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, my word. Look at Url.

144
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast.

145
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What an unfortunate blemish. - Good mud bath'd clear those up.

146
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

147
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Um, he's my grandfather... Couple of times removed.

148
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Try a couple of species removed.

149
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:56,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, my name's Aladar. This is my family. We're all that's left.

150
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my dear. I'm so sorry.

151
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Baylene's the last of her kind. Finding stragglers like her all along the way.

152
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I heard you say something about nesting grounds?

153
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is the most beautiful place there is, child.

154
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's where the herd goes to have their babies.

155
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will we find anybody that looks like us there?

156
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, the last few days, I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

157
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who knows what we'll find.

158
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The hard job now is just getting there.

159
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- And we're being driven unmercifully. - By who?

160
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron, the herd's head honcho.

161
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We can hardly keep up. An older woman like myself...

162
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's... Well, it's positively indecent.

163
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then tell him. What's the worst he can do?

164
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's his problem?

165
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- That's him, honey. Kron. - Huh.

166
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, excuse me! Kron, you got a second?

167
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Get lost, kid. - Hmm. Relax, Bruton.

168
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Who are you? - Uh, Aladar.

169
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why aren't you uphill with the...

170
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}uh, young bloods?

171
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I was back here talking to these guys.

172
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I guess they... They're having a hard time keeping up.

173
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit?

174
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hmm. Let the weak set the pace. Now, there's an idea.

175
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar.

176
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hey, they need help back here. - Hmm.

177
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Watch yourself, boy.

178
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers,

179
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}no matter how charming they are.

180
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You sure know how to catch a girl's eye, there, stud.

181
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye if I was you, especially Neera's.

182
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you.

183
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Since when do we take orders from the likes of him?

184
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops.

185
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I could hold that monster's brain in the palm of my...

186
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, Yar, she's right. Better to keep our heads down with this bunch...

187
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}than get 'em bitten off by those things.

188
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you consider yourself lucky that's all that's following us.

189
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, wake up.

190
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Enough with the beauty sleep. You're ravishing already.

191
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! Hello! Anybody in there?

192
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Zini, what are you doing?

193
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I believe you left a wake-up call for the dawn of time.

194
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Come on! Move it! - What's the hurry?

195
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Something's up. The herd's gathering without us. Let's check it out.

196
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rise and shine! Kron says everybody goes.

197
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. Get up. On your feet.

198
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Huh. The charm never stops around here.

199
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You say something?

200
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, no... no, sir.

201
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Unless you got a death wish,

202
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you and that little parasite better get moving!

203
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?

204
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey, there's your girlfriend.

205
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:55,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you talkin' about? - You know what I'm talkin' about: Neera.

206
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.

207
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I made a real impression on her.

208
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What you need is a little help from the love monkey.

209
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- "The love monkey"? - Ow, baby!

210
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That, children,

211
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}is what's known as a "jerkasaurus."

212
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And with that, the ice is broken.

213
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We've got a lot of first-timers here. Make sure they get it.

214
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We stop for nothing and no one.

215
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If this is your first crossing, listen up.

216
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There is no water till we reach the other side.

217
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And you'd better keep up, 'cause if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out!

218
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness.

219
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It looks like a very long walk. - And hot.

220
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you smell somethin' sizzlin', it could be me.

221
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're moving too slow.

222
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll pick up the pace.

223
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, old girl, you're wandering off a bit.

224
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's all I need: A monkey on my back.

225
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}On your feet, Eema.

226
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We can't let those things eat you.

227
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're out there waiting.

228
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- The lake! - We made it?

229
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's just over that... that hill, baby.

230
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, thank goodness.

231
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, Eema. Water. Remember water?

232
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, it's time to refresh my memory.

233
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just gonna walk right into that lake...

234
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Until the water's up to my eyeballs...

235
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and soak it all in.

236
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe the rains collected somewhere else.

237
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you want us to do?

238
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Take a scout and check the entire perimeter.

239
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Enough! You have to be strong now.

240
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The nesting grounds are only a few days away. Keep moving!

241
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron, we've never gone this long without water.

242
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If we keep going like this, we'll lose half the herd.

243
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then we save the half that deserves to live.

244
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? They're moving already? Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.

245
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There was water here, always water here before.

246
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We always had water, always. - And... And plenty of mud. - Oh, Eema, please.

247
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The herd won't wait. We must carry on.

248
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You gotta get up.

249
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- There was water everywhere. - There is no water, dear.

250
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Baylene, don't move. - What is it?

251
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

252
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Do you hear that? - I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.

253
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now press down.

254
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I always did like big girls!

255
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Water! - Oh, my goodness!

256
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Water! Come on! - He found water.

257
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's it, Eema. Come drink.

258
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron, look. All we had to do is dig, and...

259
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good. Now, get out of the way.

260
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait! Wait! There's enough for everyone!

261
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh. - Eema!

262
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's it. Keep pushing and shoving. That's very helpful.

263
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bruton, we've been walking in circles. There's no water here.

264
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I think we should get back. - Shh. Keep it down.

265
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's get out of here.

266
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, you come out on three.

267
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One, two, three!

268
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on out. No one's gonna hurt you.

269
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. What's going on?

270
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The little Aladars haven't had anything to drink.

271
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think they're scared of me.

272
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who wouldn't be? You are pretty scary.

273
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on over, guys.

274
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Take it easy. Don't worry. She's just a hair ball. - And proud of it.

275
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. He's gonna find you some water.

276
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here. Now, you just take a foot and press.

277
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa.

278
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Come on. Knock it off.

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's work together here, huh? A little teamwork. Ready?

280
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One, two, three. Press!

281
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good job, Suri.

282
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Where are your parents, anyway? - A lot of us are on our own now.

283
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You like kids, I see.

284
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.

285
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm Aladar... the "jerkasaurus."

286
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ohh. Sorry about that.

287
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're probably right.

288
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Dad, wake up. - Huh?

289
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why did you help that old one?

290
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What else could we do? Leave her behind?

291
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. You mean, you actually...

292
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that happens all the time.

293
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You don't survive if you're not... - Strong enough.

294
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well... yeah.

295
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is that you talking, or your brother?

296
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everything's so different.

297
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I-I don't know what to think anymore.

298
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, Neera... we watch out for each other,

299
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds.

300
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You sound so sure. - I'm not,

301
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but it's all I know.

302
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, um... Oh, water.

303
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll, uh, get you some water.

304
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Can I try it? - Sure. Just press.

305
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Sorry. - No. You... You first.

306
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}One down... and,

307
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}well, one down.

308
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron!

309
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Carnotaurs! - What? They never come this far north.

310
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The fireball must've driven them out.

311
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You led them right to us! Maybe you can feed them with your hide! Move the herd out, double-time!

312
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What's happening? - My brother's moving the herd.

313
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kron, what's going on?

314
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving, they'll catch up to us.

315
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But the others in the back... They'll never make it.

316
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They'll slow down the predators.

317
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can't sacrifice them like this!

318
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold it! That could be you back there! Or you!

319
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you ever interfere again,

320
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll kill you.

321
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stay away from him!

322
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aladar, no. You just... just go. I'll be okay.

323
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go! Let's go! Carnotaurs!

324
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Carno-what? - Carnotaur.

325
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude. Let's go.

326
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:55,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on! We're gonna get left behind.

327
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go! Hurry up! We're losing them!

328
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aladar, slow down.

329
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, joy. Blisters.

330
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got blisters on my blisters.

331
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't wanna know where I got blisters.

332
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What was that? - It came from up ahead.

333
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be? - A carnotaur.

334
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:12,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What's the second-worst thing it could be? - Two carnotaurs! Oh!

335
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- That's it. I'm gone. - Oh, my goodness!

336
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Everybody, we don't know for sure. It could be the herd.

337
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Let's check it out. - Oh, my goodness. Goodness gracious.

338
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, it's Bruton.

339
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It appears we weren't the only ones left behind.

340
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:54,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What happened? - Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.

341
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We can't just leave him here. - We can if we move fast enough.

342
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, you don't look so good. Let me help you.

343
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Save your pity. I just need some rest. Now, get away from me.

344
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Suit yourself.

345
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you change your mind, we'll be in those caves.

346
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's dark, but at least it's dry.

347
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I like dry. It's the dark part I'm having trouble with.

348
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ouch! Ooh. Sorry, Url.

349
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sturdy little thing, ain't he?

350
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.

351
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You coming in or what?

352
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is it with you?

353
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At least I know enough to get in out of the rain.

354
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, come on. On your feet.

355
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:06,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Uh, you can lie down with us. It's warmer.

356
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}May I remind you that he's one of them?

357
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:20,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, looks like he's one of us now.

358
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ahh. Who booked this trip, anyway?

359
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough.

360
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, when I get there, I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

361
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You tell him, Eema.

362
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If I could sleep that deep, I'd be in paradise.

363
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

364
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This plant grew on our island.

365
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It will make you feel better.

366
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:22,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why is he doing this? Pushing them on with false hope?

367
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's hope that's gotten us this far.

368
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But why doesn't he let them accept their fate?

369
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've accepted mine.

370
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- And what is your fate? - To die here.

371
