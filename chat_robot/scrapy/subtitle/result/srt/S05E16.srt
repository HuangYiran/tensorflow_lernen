1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,130
你确定不想像
You sure you didn't want to going back to earth

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,560
麦凯他们回地球度假
Like mckay and the others?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,060
星门控制中心没有零点模块
Nah, sgc doesn't have a zpm,

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,630
所以  地球这两周
So two weeks on earth

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,560
就像困在泰达路斯(迷宫建筑师)的迷宫三周
Means three weeks cooped up in the daedalus.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,060
相当于缺席五周
That's five weeks of missing work.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,900
我们工作一年半才有休假
We only get one of those every year-and-a-half,

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,000
我宁愿留着  等到特殊情况再放假
So I'd like to save mine for something more special.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,560
我们要去宿营吗
So we're going camping instead?

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,430
到一个从没被人发现的沙滩冲浪
On a beach that's never been surfed or even touched.

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,730
不是更能令人振奋吗
You gotta get more excited about this.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,030
喂  快看
Hey, check that out.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,300
怎么
What?

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,500
你猜他会有所行动吗
Think he'll ever make a move?

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,860
管他的
Who cares?

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,700
话说...
Say...

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,800
我们一年才能待在地球14天
I know we only get 14 days on earth a year,

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,500
你肯定很想念你父亲
And you miss your dad and all...

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,830
你想说...
But...

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,230
我有个老...
See, one of my old--

21
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,000
一个和我一起
A guy who was doing his doctorate

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,300
读博士的人
At the same time as me,

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,200
他将要做一次关于他最近研究
He's giving a big secret presentation

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,630
的秘密演讲
About some new thing that he's working on,

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,600
所有物理界的巨头
And everyone and anyone in the physics community

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,430
都会出席
Is going to be there.

27
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,500
而后...
And... well...

28
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,600
其实...
See, the thing is

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
我不由得有个想法
There's this perception out there

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,730
觉得自己
That I'm,

31
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,100
很失败  可有可无
Like, a washout, recluse...

32
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,030
怎么说
Why?

33
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,230
这是我赖以谋生的方法
Well, 'cause I do this for a living.

34
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,430
研究秘密顶尖技术
I mean, super double tip-top secret stuff.

35
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,630
近十年
I mean, I haven't published a paper

36
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,000
我还没发表过什么论文
In nearly a decade--

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
没有发表过任何公众读物
Not one that can be read by the general public--

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,860
连这外星系的生活什么的
And I'm kind of hard to get ahold of,

39
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,200
我也应接不暇
What with living in another galaxy and all.

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,700
我知道你的感受
Yeah, I know what that's like.

41
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,830
就是  他们觉得我不合群
Exactly. they think I'm a shut-in.

42
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,500
所以说...我在想...
So... I was thinking...

43
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,530
如果我能带个女士...一起去
That if I was to, say, show up... with a woman...

44
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,760
还是一个...美女
A-- a beautiful woman...

45
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,800
他们也许不会觉得
That they wouldn't maybe--

46
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,730
我是个彻底的失败者
Not think that I was... like, a complete loser.

47
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,930
其实才一天
Like, it would be one day,

48
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,360
在那里过一个晚上
The first night we were there,

49
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,530
第二天就可以启程去齐佩瓦瀑布
And then you could be off to chippewa falls.

50
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,800
说不定很有趣
I mean, it could be fun.

51
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,630
让我想想
Hmm. well, let's see--

52
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,060
满屋的物理学家
A room full of physicists,

53
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,630
一个啰啰嗦嗦的演讲
A long-winded presentation

54
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,200
或许我还听不懂
I probably won't understand...

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,700
听上去不怎么有趣
Yeah, doesn't really sound like fun.

56
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
或许那里会有酒水供应
Well, there'll be drinks, probably,

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,560
还有三明治
And maybe those little sandwiches...

58
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,100
还有...我
And... me.

59
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,730
我也会去
I'll be there.

60
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,500
你不必刻意编造理由
You don't have to fabricate all these reasons

61
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,230
约我出去
On why you need me to be with you.

62
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,130
直接约我就是了
You could just ask me out on a date.

63
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,630
我并不是想...
Hey, I didn't want to--

64
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,900
我是说 我知道你...
I mean, I know you--

65
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,460
或许我就答应了呢
I'll probably say yes.

66
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,160
那么...你愿意赏脸跟我去吗
Well, you... want to go to this thing with me?

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,860
好
Sure.

68
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,160
荣幸之至
I'd love to.

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,430
我也很...我是说...那...
Well, I'd love-- I mean, that's--

70
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,730
很好  不错  太好了  那是...
Good. good. great. that's--

71
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,960
就这么定了
It's a date.

72
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,460
就这么定了
It's a date.

73
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,030
那是关于什么的演讲
So what's the presentation?

74
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,360
我不知道
I don't know.

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,000
我们去到之前他都想保持神秘
He doesn't want to tell anyone until we all get there,

76
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,330
如果我认识他
But if I know this guy,

77
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,860
我就会说那是二流科学的
It'll be, uh, you know, first-class presentation...

78
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,960
一流演绎
With, like, second-rate science.

79
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,530
可能还有些"旁征博引"的成分
Probably some minor adjustment to someone else's work,

80
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,300
那里的食物肯定不错
But the food'll be good.

81
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,460
同伴也是
And the company.

82
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,160
迈尔克姆  你看过这个吗
Malcolm, have you read this?

83
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
看了
Yes.

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,860
你的下属认为
Your staff thinks it's reckless

85
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
明天启动仪器不太明智
To turn this thing on tomorrow.

86
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,730
少数人而已
Some of my staff...

87
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,030
迈尔克姆
Malcolm...

88
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,330
一些胆小鼠辈罢了
They're just getting cold feet, that's all.

89
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,600
还记得他们在瑟恩启动液氢容器时
Do you remember all that stuff that came out

90
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,530
他们都纷纷离开了吗
Before cern turned on the lhc?

91
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,400
你也知道  黑洞缩影
You know, miniature black holes,

92
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,760
外来粒子
Exotic particles,

93
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,900
太空金属
Strangelets,

94
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,130
星球瞬间毁灭
The instantaneous destruction of the planet?

95
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,200
全都是无稽的闹剧
All unfounded histrionics.

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,700
我们会没事的
We are going to be just fine.

97
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,230
你的意思是
So you're saying

98
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,900
这些潜在灾难都不会发生吗
None of these potential catastrophes will happen?

99
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,400
总有那么微小的一点机会
Well, there is always the slight possibility

100
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
某个部分会出错
That something might go wrong.

101
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,700
后果将会不堪设想
The cause has a lot riding on this.

102
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,730
别担心
Don't worry about it.

103
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,900
你所谓的后果
Your precious "cause"

104
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,030
明天就会消失得一干二净
Will come out of this squeaky clean tomorrow.

105
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,200
那些最坏打算的后果
Some of these worst-case scenarios

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,130
令人毛骨悚然
Are terrifying--

107
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,100
那当然
Of course they're terrifying--

108
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,200
因为那是最坏打算
They're worst-case scenarios!

109
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,460
是有可能发生
They are the worst possible thing

110
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,430
最坏的事
That could ever happen, ever.

111
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,230
明天会一切顺利的
Tomorrow will come off without a hitch.

112
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,630
我们做了很多试验
We've done hundreds of tests.

113
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,760
不可能失败
There is zero possibility for failure.

114
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
相信我
Trust me.

115
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,210
真让人兴奋
This is exciting.

116
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,780
飞机罢了
Well, it's just a plane.

117
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,310
但我从未做过头等舱
Yeah, but I've never even flown first class.

118
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,480
太奇妙了
This is amazing.

119
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,380
尝过这些草莓吗
Have you tried these strawberries?

120
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,550
10岁的时候
When I was 10,

121
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,610
我吃了整整一碗
I ate a bowl full of strawberries

122
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,950
还吐了
And threw up.

123
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,180
到现在还不能消化草莓
I haven't been able to stomach them since.

124
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,650
他怎么可以付得起这些行头
How does this guy afford all this?

125
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,350
我还以为他是个物理学家而已
I thought he was just a physicist.

126
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,350
他总能说服
Well, he was always able

127
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,110
大腕投资
To dupe guys with deep pockets in

128
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,910
他的研究计划
To backing his research.

129
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,350
光靠甜美的笑容和幻灯片
It's amazing what a nice smile and a power point presentation

130
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,210
是不足以打动你
Will get you.

131
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,350
我现在很满意
Well, I am impressed.

132
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,180
是的
Yes,

133
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,480
我看得出
I can see that.

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,980
拜托
Oh, come on.

135
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,010
朋友飞黄腾达  你应当高兴
You should be happy for your friend's success.

136
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,380
我与他只是
Well, it's more of an acquaintance

137
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,910
泛泛之交
Than a friend.

138
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,980
萍水相逢才不会用私人飞机接你
Acquaintances don't pick you up in private planes.

139
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,710
他这样做不是为了示好
He didn't send the jet to be nice.

140
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,550
而是给我个下马威
He sent the jet to rub it in my face.

141
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,810
在学校  我悟性总是
I was always one step ahead of this guy

142
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,810
胜他一筹
During school,

143
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,880
现在来到现实世界
And now that we're in the "real world,"

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,210
他想向我证明
He wants to show me that,

145
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,580
就这个星球而言
As far as most of the planet is concerned,

146
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,350
他的成就比我高得多
He's a lot more successful than I am.

147
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,710
还有  看这身晚装
And what is with the evening attire?

148
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,510
看在老天的份上  我们是去参加学术讲座
I mean, we're going to a science talk, for god's sake.

149
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,980
他以为自己是老几
Who the hell does he think he is?

150
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,750
你准备接下来的一整天
Is this what the whole day will be like?

151
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,010
你都要这样喋喋不休吗
Are you going to be in a bad mood?

152
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,550
不
No.

153
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,580
我们回到地球  乘坐着私人飞机
'cause we're back on earth on a private jet,

154
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,110
品尝着奢华的香槟
Drinking expensive champagne,

155
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,710
你的女伴穿着华丽的晚礼服
And your date's wearing a fancy dress.

156
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,710
罗德尼  换了是别人  他们一定很尽兴
Most people would be having a good time, rodney.

157
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,780
你说的对  你说得是
You're right. you're right...

158
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,050
麦凯
Mckay.

159
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,350
罗德尼·麦凯博士
Dr. rodney mckay.

160
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,550
珍妮弗·凯勒医生
Dr. jennifer keller.

161
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,810
欢迎
Yes. welcome.

162
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,280
现在  你们需要
I'll just need you both

163
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,810
签署这份保密协议
To sign this non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.

164
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,780
不是吧
You're not serious.

165
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,110
有问题吗  先生
Is there a problem, sir?

166
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,610
还要什么保密协议
This whole thing is a confidentiality agreement?

167
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,080
是
Yes, sir.

168
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,380
他在做什么研究
What could they possibly be doing back there

169
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,750
连协议都有上200页
That needs to be kept 200 pages secret?

170
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,380
如果你想进去  就要先签协议
If you want to go inside, sir, you need to sign the agreement.

171
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,650
恐龙吗
Dinosaurs?

172
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,880
什么
Excuse me?

173
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,250
里面有活生生的恐龙吗
Do they have living dinosaurs back there?

174
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,550
如果他令恐龙回生
Because I'll sign this

175
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,780
我肯定会签
If he's brought dinosaurs back to life.

176
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,650
若不是如此  他肯定在发傻
But short of that, he is out of his mind

177
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,750
以为我不管他的研究是什么
If he thinks that I am going to pretend

178
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,710
都值得我去为他保密
That whatever discovery he's made

179
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,150
还要签署
Is so important and so secret

180
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,110
这份像莎翁名著那么厚的
That I have to sign the unabridged works

181
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,450
保密协议吗
Of william shakespeare here.

182
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,010
快签
Just sign it.

183
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,750
来吧
Here you go.

184
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,380
真幸运  有美女替你说话  是吧
Oh. you're just lucky the lady's here, aren't you?

185
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,150
我认为我们这是在哪里
Where do you think we are?

186
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,080
不知道  亚利桑那州  内华达
I don't know. arizona? nevada?

187
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,450
我不觉得
I didn't think

188
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,250
这里有什么秘密装置
People even built secret facilities anymore.

189
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,410
这里那么复古
It seems so 1950s.

190
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,350
罗德尼·麦凯
Rodney mckay?

191
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,880
根据可靠情报  你已经挂了
I had it on good authority that you were dead.

192
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,250
这位是你的...妹妹吗
And this would be your... sister?

193
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,410
不  尼尔  这不是我妹妹
No, no, neil. she's not my sister.

194
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,210
她是珍妮弗·凯勒
This is jennifer keller.

195
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,280
这是比尔·耐  这是尼尔·迪格斯·泰森
That's bill nye and neil degrasse tyson.

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,650
电视明星
You know, from television.

197
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,910
对啊  当然
Yeah, uh-- of course.

198
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,880
很高兴见到你
Very nice to meet you.

199
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,750
不  这该我说
No, pleasure's mine.

200
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,980
她名花有主了  尼尔
And she's taken, neil.

201
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,880
不  我没那意思
No, no, I didn't mean it that way--

202
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,010
尼尔最喜欢抢我的东西
Neil likes to steal things from me,

203
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,210
比方说女人和理论物理学思想
Things like women and theoretical physics ideas.

204
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,150
是的  谁不想借用
Yeah, but who hasn't stolen an idea

205
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,410
伟大的罗德尼·麦凯的思想呢
From the great rodney mckay?

206
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,850
你总算认了
Oh, so we admit it now.

207
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,380
想当年
See, back in the day,

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,080
每当有人有什么新见解
Whenever any one of these people came up with a new idea

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,850
或者发表了什么文章
Or published a new paper,

210
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,510
他就会信誓旦旦的说
Dr. mckay here would swear

211
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,480
跟他的研究如出一辙
That he was already working on something very similar,

212
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,210
只是还没来得及发表
Just hadn't gotten around to publishing it yet.

213
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,410
他就会说
He'd say things like,

214
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,280
"我正想说这个"
"i was about to say that very same thing,"

215
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,550
或者是"我刚刚想的和这个一样"
Or, "i was just about to have That same idea."

216
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,380
至少我不会将冥王星从行星中删除
At least I didn't declassify pluto from planet status.

217
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,850
尼尔  把孩子弄哭
Way to make all the little kids cry, neil.

218
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,750
就让你觉得很伟大吗
That make you feel like a big man?

219
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,210
多亏泰森博士
See, thanks to dr. tyson,

220
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,250
冥王星被赋予新的状态
Pluto is now the first of the plutoids,

221
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,880
新一级的天体
A new class of celestial object.

222
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,710
太好了
It's cool.

223
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,080
别这样  罗德尼
Come on, rodney.

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,580
这是21世纪
It's the 21st century.

225
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,640
事实上  仔细想想
Actually, come to think of it,

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,540
你上次发表论文在什么时候
When was the last time you even published a paper?

227
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,510
80年代?
The '80s?

228
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,410
没有那么久吧
It hasn't been that long.

229
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,740
当时读它时
I think I was listening

230
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,210
我就像在看
To that band a flock of seagulls

231
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,710
一群海鸥乐队唱大戏
While I was reading it.

232
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,110
事实上  你的论文吹的真是天花乱坠
Actually, it might have been pre-reagan.

233
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,670
是吗  真有幸你们读了我的论文
Well, it has been great running into you guys.

234
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,110
我们要去找座位了
We should maybe get our seats.

235
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,110
再见
Bye.

236
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,770
他们俩不可能在约会!
They can't possibly be dating.

237
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,670
是啊
I know.

238
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,270
那么  既然你已经结婚了  那
Well, you're married, so...

239
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,140
Dibs.

240
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,740
她是你的了
She's all yours.

241
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,240
我想不应该来这儿
I think maybe this was a bad idea.

242
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
为什么
Why?

243
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,610
我突然觉得
Well, I just remembered

244
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,440
自己并不太喜欢这些人
I don't really like these people.

245
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,410
是你不喜欢他们呢
Is it that you don't like them,

246
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,640
还是他们不喜欢你
Or maybe they don't like you?

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,110
可能吧
Possibly.

248
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,240
我是说  我过去有点要强
I mean, I used to be a little... abrasive?

249
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,070
以前啊
Oh, used to be. yeah.

250
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,340
不好解释
It's hard to explain.

251
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,010
我的领域竞争很激烈
My field is very competitive.

252
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,010
是吗  我读了六年医
Yeah, I went to med school  For six years.

253
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,570
不太了解这方面事
I wouldn't know anything about that.

254
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,010
是啊
Oh... right.

255
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,910
不是每件事
Not everything

256
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,170
都得这么争的  罗德尼
Has to be a competition, rodney.

257
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,370
他们知道你很聪明
They know how smart you are.

258
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,710
那可不一定
I'm not sure they do.

259
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,940
他们当然知道
Of course they do.

260
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,510
你没必要一直提醒他们
You don't have to keep reminding them.

261
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,510
应该谦逊点
It's called being humble.

262
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,540
谦逊  你知道这个词吗
Have you heard that word before?

263
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,340
听着  这是我们第一次约会
Look, we're on our first date

264
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,640
是来看这个物理讲座的
And I've come to a physics talk, okay?

265
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,140
你也应该放下架子
You have to bend a little bit too.

266
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,410
谦逊  是吗
Humble, eh?

267
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,210
也许我可以试试
I'll guess I can try anything once.

268
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
地球
Earth...

269
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,340
我们的星球  我们的家
Our home, our planet,

270
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,070
生命在此孕育
The very vessel of life.

271
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,640
我们的家园  独一无二不可取代
Our world-- unique, irreplaceable.

272
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,210
可是  有时
And yet, at times,

273
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,510
我们冷酷无情的索求
It seems like we are unrelenting in our quest

274
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,740
使生态系统遭到毁灭性的破坏
To drive our ecosystem into catastrophic failure.

275
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,910
毫无节制
Gone unchecked,

276
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,440
全球变暖将使当如今繁华的世界
Global warming will transform this lush world we know today

277
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,740
寸草不生  毫无生机
Into a lifeless and arid rock.

278
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,710
朋友们  危险在步步紧逼
Friends, the stakes couldn't be higher,

279
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,270
情况已迫在眉睫
The situation no more dire.

280
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,670
是时候采取行动了
It's time... to act.

281
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,310
大家好  我是马尔科姆·托尼
Hello. I'm malcolm tunney.

282
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,410
如果他真的担心全球变暖
If he's so worried about global warming,

283
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,040
为什么要用私人飞机接我们
Why did he fly us here on a private jet

284
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,970
比瑞典排放的二氧化碳都多
That spews out more co2 than sweden?

285
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,010
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

286
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,410
非常好
Very kind.

287
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,710
众所周知
As many of you know,

288
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,840
我并不是个环境学家
I am not an environmental scientist,

289
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,740
我也不会假装是
Nor do I pretend to be one.

290
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,370
譬如说  我经常洗澡
For instance, I shower regularly.

291
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,470
别介意  拉里
No offense, larry.

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,040
我只是一个心系地球的公民
I'm just a concerned citizen,

293
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,310
长久以来它爱护着我们人类
One who realizes that the earth has carried us for so long,

294
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,410
也许是时候回报她了
Maybe it's time that we carried her.

295
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,470
他还真是
That ratio would be accurate

296
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,410
够自大的
If his body was the size of his ego.

297
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,040
是啊  有点
Yeah, it's a little much.

298
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,210
解决类似全球变暖问题
Solving a problem like global warming

299
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,840
复杂到难以想象
May seem impossibly complex.

300
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,510
如此多的国家  如此多的企业
So many nations, so many corporations,

301
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,840
所以我们每个人
And john q. public

302
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,710
必须要面对许多问题
Will have to agree on a dizzying number of issues.

303
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,040
那么  个人能做些什么
So, then, what can one person really do

304
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,870
改变现状呢
To make a difference?

305
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,670
而我
What can i,

306
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,610
和我那无与伦比的技术
With my particular and unique skill set,

307
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,670
又该怎么办呢
Do to help?

308
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,170
他们认为你自命不凡
They think you're the arrogant one?

309
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,510
在过去的十年里
I've been working on a number of projects

310
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,940
我做了一些研究
Over the last decade,

311
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,910
然后我发现  总结成果
And I realized that, if I were to combine them,

312
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,340
便有意想不到的收获
I just may be able to achieve something unexpected...

313
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,110
所以  女士们先生们
So, ladies and gentlemen,

314
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,340
在科瑞玛创新公司
With major funding

315
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,270
朋友的资金支持下
From my friends at kramer innovations,

316
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,370
我设计了一个方法
I have been able to devise a means

317
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,440
能够安全可控的冷却我们的地球
To cool our planet in a safe and controlled way.

318
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,240
这家伙不知道什么叫冷却
This guy wouldn't know cool--

319
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,770
这背后的科学理论非常复杂
Now, the science behind this is immensely complex,

320
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,010
在你们离开讲厅前
But there will be detailed briefs

321
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,810
会详细的介绍给你们
Handed out to you as you leave the lecture hall,

322
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,070
但现在
But for right now,

323
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,640
让我来简单的解释一下
Let me just give you the  cliffs notes.

324
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,170
首先是这个巨大的吸热设备
It begins with a massive heat-sink,

325
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,210
我的设计之一
One of my own design,

326
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,440
能够从周围环境中
Which steadily draws heat

327
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,910
稳定的吸收热量
From the surrounding environment.

328
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,240
吸收的热量怎么办
But where does the heat go?

329
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,540
也许你会问
Where does that heat go,

330
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,770
吸收的热量怎么办
You may ask.

331
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,570
是的  朋友们  这才是最棘手的部分
Well, my friends, that is the hard part.

332
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,440
用托尼时空物质通道
I give you the tunney space-time matter bridge.

333
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,640
等等  什么
Wait. what?

334
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,940
现在  这不仅仅是理论证明
Now, this isn't just some theoretical math proof.

335
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,510
这已经在技术上投入使用了
This is a functioning piece of technology,

336
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,940
简单的说就是把此空间中的热量
One that literally moves heat from our space time

337
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,910
传到彼空间
And vents it out into another space time.

338
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,470
那是我的通道
That's my bridge...

339
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,670
我和我妹妹想出来的
My sister and I came up with that.

340
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,470
抱歉
Shh. sorry.

341
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,110
这个方法行得通
And it works.

342
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,670
为这个系统  我们做了几个月的实验
We've been testing the system for a few months now,

343
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,010
结果证明系统非常稳定
And it has proved to be remarkably stable.

344
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,870
那是我的想法
That's my idea!

345
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,640
罗德尼  现在不是时候说这个
Rodney, now is not the time.

346
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,610
为了做个示范
For the purposes of the demonstration today,

347
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,910
我在设备周围加了
I've surrounded this facility

348
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,510
电子隔离网
With an electrified plasma grid

349
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,210
其中的吸热器
That will contain the reach of the heat-sink.

350
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,870
只会吸收该建筑内的热量
It will draw heat only from this facility.

351
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,440
等等  他要当场开机器
Wait, he's going to turn it on With us here.

352
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,770
这  这可不行
That's-- this is a bad idea.

353
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,970
罗德尼  拜托
Rodney, please.

354
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,270
为了证明它行之有效
And to prove the effectiveness of this system,

355
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,670
我会把该建筑的温度降低十度
I will lower the temperature within this facility By 10 degrees.

356
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,810
不过别担心
Oh, and don't worry,

357
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,140
我已经关了空调
I've turned off the air conditioning,

358
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,870
保证不会骗你们
So there'll be no cheating, I promise.

359
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,870
抱歉  我不能让他这么做
I'm sorry, I can't let him do this--

360
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,710
不  罗德尼
No, rodney--

361
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,540
打断一下
Excuse me!

362
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,370
马尔科姆
Malcolm...

363
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,310
麦凯博士
Dr. mckay.

364
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,210
谢谢您能来
Thank you for coming.

365
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,910
你不能这么做
This is a bad idea.

366
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,540
我们还没开始互动问答部分
Well, we're not quite ready for the q&a session yet,

367
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,010
可以等一下再发表观点吗
So if you could just wait till then--

368
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,440
还是先让我们看看你的研究数据
Let's just take a look at the data you've come up with

369
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,010
讨论一下
And talk about this,

370
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,410
因为在这么多人的场合下开机器
Because turning the device on with all these people here

371
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,710
太危险了
Could be very dangerous.

372
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,310
尊重的说  我不同意
Respectfully, I disagree.

373
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,510
你不能未经允许就这么做
Wh-- you can't do something like this Without our consent.

374
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,410
坐下
Sit down!

375
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,310
在进场时你签了协议  不是吗
You did sign the document when you entered, didn't you?

376
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,170
是的  我以为那只是
Well, yeah, I thought that was just--

377
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,540
那么你已经同意了
Then I have your consent.

378
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,340
好吧  可是
Yeah, but--

379
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,610
我也在研究一个项目
Look, I've been doing work

380
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,040
和这个非常相似
That is very, very similar to this--

381
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,010
是吗
Really?

382
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,410
我认为这不能
I don't think that's possible.

383
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,470
那个连接其他空间的通道
Look, these bridges to other space times

384
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,440
很难预测
Can be very unpredictable.

385
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,370
你有什么研究成果
Do you have any research

386
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,770
现在就要发布吗
You'd like to put forward right now?

387
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,840
论文之类的
A paper, perhaps?

388
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,540
任何成果足以支持你的观点
Anything to back up your claim?

389
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,770
罗德尼  拜托
Rodney, please.

390
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,170
你不是在嫉妒我吧
Tell me this isn't just petty jealously.

391
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,470
好了
Okay.

392
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,370
不  我只是
Well, no, no, i-- I just--

393
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,540
我不这么认为
No, I didn't think so.

394
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,710
别担心  各位
Don't worry, everyone.

395
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,870
这个示范完全安全
This is completely safe.

396
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,210
那么
And...

397
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,910
我们开始了
We're up and running.

398
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,370
等你们读了简介
Now, I'll be happy to answer all of your questions

399
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,310
我将很乐意回答你们的问题
Once you've had a chance to read the brief,

400
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,610
但现在
But for now,

401
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,710
我们何不回到休息室
Why don't we all go back out to the lobby

402
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,970
来杯热可可呢
Where hot cocoa is waiting,

403
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,640
这儿马上会变得非常冷
'cause it's about to get very cold in here.

404
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,240
谢谢
Thank you.

405
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,870
我
I--

406
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,540
来吧
Come on.

407
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,010
我们去喝杯热巧克力  好吗
Let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?

408
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,040
这
This is...

409
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,940
他是怎么知道我的项目的
How did he even get ahold of my work?

410
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,070
你肯定这是你的项目成果
You're sure this is your work?

411
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,370
绝对肯定
Absolutely.

412
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,910
你相信我  是吗
Look, you believe me, don't you?

413
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,070
我当然相信你
Of course I do.

414
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,670
他不可能是自己想到的
There is no way that he came up with this On his own.

415
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,370
我们要   要
We've got to-- we've got to--

416
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,140
过来
We... come on.

417
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,010
我们不应该进来
We shouldn't be in here.

418
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,240
你站在那望风
Okay, just stand guard there.

419
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,840
等我花几秒钟
It'll take me a couple of seconds

420
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
黑入他的电脑
To hack into his computer.

421
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,240
你在做什么
What are you doing?!

422
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
谢谢
Thank you.

423
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,210
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,940
十分感谢
Thank you, but I don't think

425
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,510
我想如此伟大的成就
An achievement of this magnitude

426
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,540
还是要归功于大家
Can truly be credited to one man.

427
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,040
托尼博士
Dr. tunney, sir.

428
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,010
抱歉
Oh, excuse me.

429
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,610
怎么了
Yes? what is it?

430
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,040
你吩咐我们一旦降到64度
Well, you told us to shut the device down

431
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,540
就关掉设备
Once we reached 64.

432
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,610
是的  对啊  现在可以关设备了
Yes, that's right. we can shut it down now.

433
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,340
问题是  我们试过了
Well, that's the problem, sir. we've tried.

434
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,010
事实上我们尽了最大的努力
We've tried everything, in fact.

435
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,010
可设备关不上
The device won't shut off

436
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
马尔科姆
Malcolm...

437
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,100
对不起  给我几分钟
I'm sorry, could you just give me a moment here?

438
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,900
让我来
Let me in here.

439
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,300
好的  都有谁来过这
All right, now, who's been in here?

440
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,740
只有我们  先生
Just us, sir.

441
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,200
什么问题
What is it?

442
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,470
通道无法关上
Well, the bridge won't deactivate.

443
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,870
我也不知道为什么
I don't understand why it shouldn't.

444
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,770
关掉建筑的电源
Shut down the power to the facility.

445
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,340
呃  那没用
Uh, that won't do anything.

446
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,970
一旦运行  这个系统便
The system self-generates its own power

447
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,840
自行供电
Once it's up and running.

448
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,000
那就关掉封闭区部分
Then shut down the containment field.

449
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,080
我们得让客人离开
We need to get these guests out of here.

450
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,210
那也没用
That won't work either.

451
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,680
为什么
Why not?

452
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,610
为什么
Why not?

453
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,580
这十分复杂
Well, it's impossibly complicated,

454
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,880
封闭区跟设备的最基本部分紧密相连
But the containment field is tied into the basic operations of the device.

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,580
也就是说  它完全关不了
It literally can't shut down

456
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,140
除非我们把物质通道毁了
Until we collapse the matter bridge.

457
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,840
这是个保险协议
It's a safety protocol,

458
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,010
除非我们能中断设备
One that I can't reprogram

459
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,410
否则我无法重新编程
Until we can power down the device.

460
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,610
那我们被困在这里了
So we're trapped in here

461
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,410
除非你能把这些搞定
Until you can get this thing fixed?

462
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,910
没错
Yes.

463
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,140
到时候怎么办
What happens until then?

464
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,980
这通道会一直通过吸热设备
The bridge will continue to draw heat

465
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,210
吸收热量
From the heat-sink.

466
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,210
十分钟内已经降了十度
We just dropped 10 degrees in 10 minutes.

467
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,710
一个小时内  会低于零度
In an hour, we'll be below zero.

468
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,240
我们会冷死的
We're going to freeze to death.

469
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,980
我已经启动了建筑的供热系统
Well, I've activated the facility's heating system.

470
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,510
会为我们争取点时间
That should buy us a little bit of time.

471
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,980
你说"一切顺利"  你做了很多测试
You said "without a hitch," you'd run hundreds of tests.

472
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,780
有人干扰了系统
Someone has messed with the system.

473
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
太出格了
That was out of line, man.

474
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,710
他偷了我的成果
He stole the work.

475
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,410
他当时还在做演讲啊
Hey, come on.It was in the middle of his presentation.

476
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,440
他就要启动了
He was about to start the thing up!

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
不能再等了
It couldn't wait.

478
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,810
他请你来是出于好意
He brought you here as an olive branch.

479
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,040
想跟你重归于好
He wanted to bury the hatchet.

480
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,540
没错  背着我
Yeah, in my back.

481
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,740
麦凯博士  凯勒医生
Dr. mckay? dr. keller?

482
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,580
什么事
Yes?

483
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,840
托尼先生想跟你们说句话
Mr. tunney would like a word.

484
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,840
我猜  那个字就是"抱歉"
Well, I'm guessing that that word is "i apologize."

485
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,610
已经两字了  天才
That's, uh, two words, genius.

486
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,010
真是个怪胎
That's one odd duck, that guy.

487
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,880
男子汉勇于承认错误
Well, it takes a big man to admit that he's wrong,

488
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,340
我很欣赏
And much as I appreciate it,

489
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,740
但我还是希望道歉过程
I really would prefer that this whole apology thing

490
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,540
能更公开
Took place a little more publicly.

491
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,540
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

492
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,710
你才应该
You are the one

493
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,640
向我道歉
Who should be apologizing to me.

494
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,080
道什么鬼歉啊
What the hell for?

495
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
我邀请你来是出于礼貌
I invited you here as a courtesy.

496
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,510
出于好意
Out of kindness.

497
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,710
大家都认为
You know, most people think

498
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,710
你疯了
You've lost your mind,

499
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,080
才会去霍华德·休斯医学研究所
That you've gone, uh,howard hughes

500
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,280
我不再联系
Just because I don't call anymore

501
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,180
并不代表我脑子有问题
Doesn't mean I'm keeping my urine in jars.

502
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,140
听着  我不需要你...
Look, I don't need you to--

503
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,080
闭嘴  我没空听这些
Shut up. I don't have time for this.

504
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,410
你们两个干了什么
What have you two done?

505
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,580
我们干了什么
What have we done?

506
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,840
我们关不了设备
We can't shut the device down.

507
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,680
我告诉过你别打开它
I told you not to turn it on.

508
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
我几乎是求你的
I practically begged you.

509
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
但你们有听吗  没有
But would you listen? no!

510
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,710
告诉我们你们做了什么
Tell us what you did

511
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,140
还有怎么解决
And how to undo it

512
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,010
我就考虑不告你们
And I'll consider not pressing charges.

513
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,740
我们什么都没做
We didn't do anything.

514
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
真的吗
Oh, really?

515
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,010
那解释一下这个
Explain this, then.

516
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,410
我们真不该在这
We shouldn't be in here.

517
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,110
-站在那里把风  -为什么
-Stand guard there.  -Why

518
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,410
我需要点时间黑进他的电脑
It'll take me a couple seconds to hack into his computer.

519
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,040
你在干嘛啊?!
What are you doing?!

520
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,910
如果那个混蛋以为在同行面前
If that son of a bitch thinks that he can humiliate me

521
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,140
羞辱了我还能逍遥自得
In front of my peers and get away with it,

522
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,880
那他就等着吧
He's got another thing coming.

523
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,310
我会毁了他
I will destroy him.

524
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,980
不是现在  罗德尼
Now is not the time, rodney.

525
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,280
这里肯定有什么
Got to be something in here I can use

526
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,710
能让他身败名裂
To discredit the pretentious tool.

527
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,580
快点  快点  有人来了
Hurry up, hurry up, somebody's coming.

528
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,840
过来  过来
Come on, come on, come on.

529
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,010
听着  我想你们断章取义
Now, look, I can see how, out of context,

530
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,140
会牵连到...
That could seem incriminating...

531
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,580
断章取义
Out of context?

532
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,740
你在那干什么
What were you doing in there?

533
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,310
我找我在两年前
I was looking for a paper I published

534
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,880
发表的一篇文章
A little over two years ago,

535
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,610
关于物质通道的
One that dealt with a matter bridge.

536
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,910
罗德尼
Rodney,

537
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,640
你已经很久没发表文章了
You have not published a paper in a very long time.

538
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,240
大概你不知道那是我的成果
You probably didn't even know it was my work.

539
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,410
现在你用笔名发表文章吗
Oh, you're publishing under a  nom de plume  now?

540
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,980
好吧  我想该这么说了
Okay, here's how I think it went down--

541
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,580
你在为政府工作
You were working with the government.

542
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,310
有人很相信你
Someone there trusted you a lot

543
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
然后让你看了一些不该看的东西
And let you see something you weren't supposed to see.

544
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,910
或者你可能意外地收到了一些东西  谁知道呢
Or maybe you were sent something by accident, who knows.

545
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,780
你看到一篇关于物质通道的文章
You saw a paper about a matter bridge,

546
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,140
一个被叫停的计划
A project that was shut down

547
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,210
因为外来粒子的副作用
Due to the adverse effects of exotic particles.

548
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,410
你看到了
You read it,

549
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,710
你发现如果通道只用来
You realized that if the bridge was used

550
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,340
传送能量
Merely as a transfer of energy, say heat,

551
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,410
就不会产生外来粒子
There would be no exotic particle creation

552
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,440
也不会有副作用
And thus no adverse effects.

553
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,140
所以...
So...

554
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,640
你将其占为己有
You co-opted the science as your own,

555
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,580
稍作改变就飘飘然了
Made a few changes to make yourself feel better,

556
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,910
就那样做了
And got to work,

557
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,780
不顾原作者关于
Dismissing the original authors' warnings

558
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,340
时空通道固有不稳定的警告
About the inherent instability of time-space bridges.

559
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,310
怎么样
How am I doing so far?

560
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
那太荒谬了
That's preposterous.

561
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,840
托尼博士研究这个很多年了
Dr. tunney's been working on this for years.

562
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,280
那是我的成果  马尔科姆
That was my work, malcolm.

563
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,710
那文章是我写的
I wrote that paper.

564
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,480
特伦斯
Terrence

565
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,180
他们也许能帮我们
These people may be able to help us.

566
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,280
这太糟了
This is bad.

567
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,380
毁坏吗
The sabotage?

568
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,280
毁坏  求你了
Sabotage. please.

569
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,540
但是你说那...
But you said there was--

570
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,510
我太早下结论了
I may have rushed to judgment.

571
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,610
你能关了它吗
Can you shut it down?

572
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,010
听着  这些物质通道
Look, these matter bridges

573
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,210
难以预测
Are the very definition of unpredictable.

574
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,440
我想得你以前说过的
You know, I think I remember you saying

575
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,210
关于这个
Something about that before.

576
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,680
有还是没有  博士?
Yes or no, doctor?

577
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,210
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

578
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,080
你们开始供热了吗
Have you turned up the heat?

579
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,980
是的
Yes.

580
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,910
你有没有注意到这个
Have you noticed this?

581
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,810
有
Yes.

582
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,280
那是什么
What is it?

583
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,240
通道通过吸热器吸收的能量
The bridge isn't drawing a consistent load

584
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,810
并不稳定
From the heat-sink.

585
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,580
相反  是有波动的
Instead, it's wavering.

586
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,980
那有什么糟的
Why is that bad?

587
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,240
不至于说糟吧
I wouldn't necessarily call it bad.

588
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,510
但的确不好
It's definitely not good,

589
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,910
也不知道多不好算糟
But I don't know that I'd call it bad.

590
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,410
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding me, right?

591
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,740
正常的通道
A regular bridge

592
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,940
无论何时都会吸收
Should draw the same amount of energy

593
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,040
等量的热能
At all times.

594
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,010
但这个波动得很厉害
This one is fluctuating greatly.

595
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,410
或许能为我所用
Maybe we can use that...

596
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,140
等它到了极限
Wait for it to peak,

597
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,580
就会超负荷  然后崩溃
Then overload it and crash.

598
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,140
好主意
That's a good idea.

599
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,410
对  我就知道你会喜欢
Yeah, I thought you'd like it...

600
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,540
跟我的主意有关的东西
What with it being my idea and all.

601
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,810
这儿真冷
It's freezing in here.

602
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,540
知道了
We get it. it works.

603
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,740
关掉它
Shut it down.

604
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,110
我冷的快粘到椅子上了
I'm starting to freeze to my chair.

605
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,380
搞什么鬼
What the hell was that?

606
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
一束突然的急速冷冻光
A sudden and dramatic cooling beam.

607
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
从通道射出的不规则能量
The irregular power pull from the bridge...

608
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,380
当通道向吸热器突然吸收能量时
Oh, so when the bridge makes a sudden demand on the heat-sink...

609
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,740
吸热器
The heat-sink reacts

610
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,310
向封闭区内某一固定点
By drawing power from a single, localized place

611
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,810
吸收能量
Inside the containment field.

612
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,480
那光把挡路的所有东西冷冻
And that beam would freeze anything in its path.

613
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,940
天哪  不会吧
Oh, did not see this coming.

614
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,380
简直是冰闪
It's freeze lightning.

615
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,810
冰闪...太赞了
Freeze lightning... ooh, I like that.

616
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,780
甭想了  那是我的
Oh, you can't have it. it's mine.

617
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,940
你是盗版
It's copywritten.

618
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,610
他怎么样了
How's he doing?

619
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,040
他整个变形了
He's in very bad shape.

620
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,180
他左半边身子都冻的发亮了
It's like his whole left side has been flash-frozen.

621
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,380
我闻所未闻
I have never seen anything like this before.

622
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,680
天啊
Oh, man.

623
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,480
听着  这不全是你的错
Look, this isn't entirely your fault.

624
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,940
我真希望他签了弃权书
I... I really hope he signed his waiver.

625
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,440
你认为这种情况是
Do you think this is the first time

626
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,810
第一次发生吗
This has happened?

627
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,010
也许这只是第一次
Yeah, or maybe just the first time

628
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,480
有人看到
Anyone's been around to notice it.

629
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,740
这东西会毁掉整栋建筑的
So this thing could be wreaking havoc all over the facility.

630
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,410
会一直发生吗
So this is going to keep happening?

631
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,110
没错  也许会更频繁
Yes, and probably with greater frequency.

632
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,140
好了  这一点副作用
Okay, this little side effect

633
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,080
会妨碍我们关掉它
Is going to really hamper our attempts to shut this thing down.

634
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,240
你用"妨碍"二字
And by "hamper",

635
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,980
是说"我们都会死"吗
You mean "get us all killed."

636
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,940
没错  貌似这样
Yeah,something like that.

637
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
我们得通知军队
We need to call in the military.

638
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,860
我想还是先不要
I'd prefer not to do that just yet.

639
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,100
你们真幸运  外面那个人还没死
You're lucky that guy out there isn't dead.

640
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,780
我肯定你们两个
I'm sure these two

641
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,170
能把那设备调回正常的运作模式
Can get the device back into its proper operating mode.

642
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,840
这有点太迟了
It's a little late for that.

643
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,470
特伦斯  事态已经失控
Terrence, things have gotten out of hand.

644
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,040
我们得通知他们了
We need to make that call.

645
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,970
打了电话  政府会监禁我们的
We make that call, the government shuts us down.

646
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,870
对  真不错
Yeah, that's the idea.

647
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,940
我不明白
I don't understand.

648
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,270
设备开始出故障时
When the device started to malfunction,

649
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,500
你想做的第一件事
The first thing you wanted to do

650
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,530
就是把所有人安全送走
Was get everyone out of here safely.

651
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,800
为了避免计划被禁止
To avoid the project being branded

652
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,230
因为继续进行太危险了
As too dangerous to move forward.

653
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,430
现在木已成舟啦
Well, the cat's out of the bag now.

654
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,800
你是不是担心
Are you worried about all the money

655
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
你投进去的钱  打水漂啦
You sunk into this? 'cause that's gone.

656
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,430
不是  我不是担心钱
No, I'm not worried about the money.

657
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,800
我们就快解决
We're close to coming up with a solution

658
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,230
全球变暖了
For global warming.

659
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,430
我们能拯救这个星球
We could save the planet.

660
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,600
这比我重要  也比你重要
It's bigger than me, and it's bigger than you.

661
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,940
要是我们能控制那设备
If we can get the device under control

662
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,430
而不必惊动军队
Without calling the military,

663
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,470
他们就会让我们继续研究
They're going to let us continue our research.

664
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,600
那我告诉你
I've got news for you.

665
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,770
你搞不定了
You can't control it,

666
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,670
而且你不应该再继续研究了
And you shouldn't continue with your research.

667
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,170
我们会解决的
We'll figure it out.

668
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,970
我给了你们极大的信任
I have the utmost faith in both of you.

669
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,140
真荒谬
This is ridiculous.

670
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,970
把你的电话给我
Give me your cell.

671
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,300
没用的
It won't work,

672
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,140
在封闭区不起作用
Not with the containment field up.

673
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,500
干扰太强
There's too much interference.

674
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,070
你办公室里有电话
You have a land line in your office.

675
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
没声音
It's dead.

676
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,970
给我试试
Give me that.

677
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,100
没声音
It's dead.

678
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,870
肯定是克雷默掐断了电话线
Kramer must have killed the phones.

679
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,770
估计你也进不了
I don't suppose you have access

680
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,600
通信室
To the communications room?

681
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,530
是克雷默的地盘
It's a kramer facility.

682
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,700
我只是在那工作
I just work here.

683
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,000
棒极了
Great.

684
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,470
貌似就指望咱俩了
Looks like it's up to you and me.

685
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,570
我们最好快回控制室
We'd better get back to the control room,

686
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,770
自己把它修好
Figure this out ourselves.

687
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,770
等等  等等
Wait. wait, wait.

688
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,940
那儿不是有
Isn't there, like,

689
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,770
一屋子天才吗
A room full of geniuses out there?

690
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,140
就他们?
That's debatable.

691
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,800
再来个那种冰闪
If that freeze lightning thing happens again,

692
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,840
人就死光了
People could die.

693
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,500
他们会拖我后腿的
They'll slow me down.

694
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,870
我们今天说好的
Hey! what happened to that "humble" thing

695
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,300
"谦逊"哪儿去了
We were going to try today?

696
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,800
结果是
...the result

697
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,430
我们所称的  冰闪
Is what I am calling "freeze lightning."

698
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,570
难以置信
Unbelievable.

699
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,700
是在固定点发生的
It is the sudden and immediate transfer of heat

700
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
瞬间能量转换
From a localized area,

701
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,770
其潜在能量足以致命
And it is potentially very lethal.

702
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,370
我们得想办法毁掉物质通道
We need to figure out how to collapse the matter bridge,

703
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,670
阻止其从吸热器吸收能量
Stop it from drawing energy from the heat-sink,

704
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,500
否则这儿迟早会冻死人
Otherwise it's going to get "unlivably" cold in here.

705
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
为什么我们不把这封闭区关上
Why don't we just turn this containment field off

706
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
然后离开呢
And get out of here?

707
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,100
好吧  首先
Well, for one thing,

708
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,200
这与物质通道的基本操作
It's tied into the basic function

709
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,370
紧密相关
Of the matter bridge,

710
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,270
所以不能只是关上
So we can't just shut it off.

711
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,070
就算关得上
Even if we could,

712
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,700
它储存了这么多冷空气
It houses so much cool air now

713
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,230
一旦被毁就会导致
That it would create a sudden, massive cold front

714
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,400
突如其来的寒流
As soon as it drops.

715
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,530
于是暴风  龙卷风
We're talking high-speed winds, tornadoes...

716
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,330
席卷而来
An instant mega-storm.

717
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,170
更不用提
Not to mention the fact

718
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,500
吸热器就会吸收
That the heat-sink would start to draw heat

719
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,900
不仅仅是该建筑的
Not just from this facility,

720
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,330
乃至整个星球的热量
But from the entire planet.

721
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,370
我们必须阻止它发生
We cannot allow that to happen.

722
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,370
为什么不能毁了它  把它砸了
Why don't we just destroy it, just bash it apart?

723
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,900
可能会引起时空裂缝
Because that could create a tear in our space time.

724
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
还是算了吧
Never mind, then.

725
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
对
Yeah.

726
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,270
听着  你们是精英中的精英
Look, you guys are the best of the best.

727
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,000
我想你们研究研究一定会有办法
I'm sure if you work together, you'll come up with something.

728
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,370
这样肯定不行  听着
That will never work. look.

729
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,840
给我两秒钟足够了
Just give me two seconds...

730
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,000
不
No!

731
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,140
你错的一塌糊涂
You're going about this all wrong.

732
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,270
注意点你在挑谁的错
Watch who you're correcting,

733
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,140
"赛先生"
"science guy."

734
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,370
我的博士学位可不是混来的
My ph.d. is not honorary.

735
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,630
听着  我是工程师  我会做数学
Hey, look, I'm an engineer. I can do math!

736
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,230
听我说就行了
Just listen to my idea--

737
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,170
我听着呢  听到让我觉得
I have been listening, and that is what led me to believe

738
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,470
你是个智障
That you are a moron!

739
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,630
令人欣慰的是  你们俩都错了
If it's any consolation, you're both wrong.

740
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,670
什么  难道你对吗
What, and you're right?

741
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,900
我们还要听你的
We're supposed to listen to you?

742
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,740
就是你这个混蛋把我们搅得一团糟
You're the jerk that got us into this mess.

743
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,500
我的理论能行
I have a workable theory.

744
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,740
是啊  "理论"
Yeah, a "theory".

745
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,670
考虑到我有这方面充足经验
Take into account that I have experience with this,

746
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,170
我几年前做这个时
That I've been doing work that is years ahead

747
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,900
你们还在痴人说梦话呢
Of anything you guys have even been dreaming about?

748
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
我正有此意
I think that's kind of what I'm getting at!

749
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,970
真丢人
This is embarrassing.

750
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,700
瞧瞧你们
Look at you--

751
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,100
这个世界上最伟大的思想者
The greatest minds this world has to offer,

752
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,770
要是我不知道你们的身份
And if I didn't know any better,

753
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,500
还以为这是一群六年级的小学生
I'd think there was a bunch of sixth graders in here.

754
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,670
你们还不赶快闭嘴合作
You guys need to suck it up and get along.

755
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,330
就像我常说的
It's like I've always said,

756
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,100
人与人之间更为相似...
People are more alike than they are different--

757
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,470
拜托  耐
Not now, nye.

758
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,400
好吧
Okay.

759
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,430
我们的生命危在旦夕
Our lives are at stake here.

760
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,140
我们需要一个解决方案
We need a solution,

761
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,700
而且越快越好
And we need this fast.

762
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,940
努点力
Please...

763
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,040
加油啊  所以人都在指望你们
Come on, the rest of us are counting on you.

764
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,670
好  罗德尼
Yes, rodney.

765
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,330
我貌似有想法了
I think I'm onto something.

766
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,300
我得平静一下
It just needs some ironing out.

767
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,370
很好  看到没
Okay. Great.

768
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,400
伙计们
Guys...

769
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,400
是啊  好吧
Yeah, well,

770
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,700
我们现在好好看看
Let's have a look at it and just...

771
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
理清思路
Fresh eyes.

772
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,970
先从比尔的理论开始
We'll start with bill's theory...

773
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,740
他们能想出办法的
They'll figure something out.

774
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,200
我也相信他们能
I'm sure they will.

775
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,530
但愿赶在有人死掉之前吧
Let's just hope it's before someone dies.

776
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,230
我叔叔乔治
You know, my uncle george,

777
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,970
非常厌恶人说
He always hated the phrase

778
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,530
拯救地球
"save the planet".

779
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,040
为什么
What?

780
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,840
他只是认为这种想法太过时了
Well, he just thought it was a little backwards,

781
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,600
地球就在这
You know, 'cause the planet's going to be here

782
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,330
不论发生什么
No matter what happens.

783
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,140
也许会变得难以生存
It might be a giant unlivable rock,

784
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,530
但我们会挺过来的
But it's going to survive.

785
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,970
你是想把话题转为
So you're turning this

786
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,800
语言学的讨论吗
Into a discussion on semantics?

787
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,330
我的意思是  克拉默先生
What I mean is, mr. kramer,

788
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,400
你所做的不是拯救地球
The work you're doing isn't about saving the planet.

789
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,330
而是拯救生命
It's about saving lives.

790
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,270
这是一项神圣的职责
And that's a noble pursuit,

791
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,230
去救亿万民众
Trying to save billions of people...

792
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,000
即使是救几百人也是神圣的
But it's no less noble to save a hundred.

793
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,400
这些人  不论多聪明
These guys, no matter how smart they are,

794
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,400
他们一样需要帮助
They could use some help.

795
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,270
只要一个电话就能让他们活着出去
One phone call could get that help here.

796
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,670
现在  求你了
Now, please...

797
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,270
让我打个电话吧
Please let me make that call.

798
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,040
天啊  别吓我
Oh, don't tell me.

799
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,630
我的老天
Oh, god.

800
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,800
十分抱歉
Oh, I'm so sorry.

801
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,900
你能修吗
Can you fix it?

802
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,400
不  我们现在完全与世隔绝了
No. we're completely cut off.

803
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,100
真是坏消息
Well, that's terrible news.

804
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,400
都是我的错  我应该
It's my fault. I should have--

805
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,630
是啊  你应该
Yeah, you should have.

806
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,570
你该看看这个
You need to see this.

807
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
冷空气
Oh, the cold temperatures

808
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
正在影响封闭区发射器
Are affecting the containment field emitters.

809
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,900
如果系统变弱了  就濒临损毁了
When they're weak, they're on the verge of failing.

810
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
那很好啊
That's great.

811
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,870
我们能把大多数人
We can get most of the people

812
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,900
转移出去  对吧
Out of here, no?

813
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,370
给军方打个电话
Make a call to the military?

814
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,030
我们周围空气温度很高
We're surrounded by desert air.

815
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,170
而封闭区内的气温
The temperatures inside the containment field

816
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,400
越来越冷了
Has gotten very, very cold.

817
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,070
冰冷空气的突然喷发
Introducing a sudden and immediate blast of icy air

818
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,770
会引起可怕的漩涡风暴
Will create one hell of a vortex storm.

819
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,600
传输器不可能通过
No way a cell transmission could make it through,

820
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,670
更别说让人安全出去
Let alone actually get people out of here safely.

821
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,100
我们经受得住风暴
We can ride out the storm.

822
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,600
不行  除非我们关闭设备
No, if we can't shut down the device,

823
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,230
否则气温系统会源源不断的
The heat-sink's going to keep feeding cold air

824
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,230
放出冷空气
Into that weather system.

825
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,830
永无止境
It'll never stop.

826
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,900
这可不好
That's not good.

827
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,230
我还是希望它别发生
No, I'd rather that didn't happen.

828
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,430
不不不
No, no, no, no.

829
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,330
这说不定是好事
This might be a good thing.

830
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,330
什么意思
What is it?

831
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,570
这个封闭区
Well, the containment field

832
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,800
在持续缓慢的消亡
Is dying a slow but consistent death.

833
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,000
现在它已经很弱了
It might be weak enough

834
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,170
足够我们往外拨一个手机信号
To actually punch a cell phone signal through now.

835
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,200
好吧
Oh, you know,

836
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,230
也许你说得对
You might be right.

837
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,970
好  这可能是我们的一线生机
Okay, this is probably our best bet.

838
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,130
这两个辐射源是最弱的
These two emitters are the weakest.

839
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,270
这得争分夺秒
It's a bit of a run from here,

840
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,130
我最好现在就去
So I'd better get going right now.

841
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,030
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

842
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,970
给我你电话
Give me your cell.

843
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,870
我们需要您在这里帮助解除通道
We need you here to help dismantle the bridge.

844
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,870
我来打电话
I'll make the call.

845
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,700
我
I--

846
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,730
来吧
Come on.

847
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,570
好  好
All right, all right.

848
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,770
好
Fine.

849
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,770
谢谢
Thanks.

850
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,800
我一旦接通就通知你们
I'm going to radio once I get through.

851
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,470
祝你好运
Good luck.

852
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,130
你也是
You too.

853
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,700
她看起来是个女强人
She seems like a very capable woman.

854
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,100
当然
She sure is.

855
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,030
他是你妹妹吧
She's your sister, right?

856
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,100
单身?
Is she single?

857
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,100
好了  刚说到哪儿了
All right, where were we?

858
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,670
你的想法
Your idea

859
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,300
在通道毁掉的一瞬击垮它
Of overwhelming the bridge to the point of collapse,

860
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,130
是个好主意
It's a good one.

861
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,430
非常正确
It's right on track.

862
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,670
不过
But...

863
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,700
我们都认为这意味着
Everybody here thinks it means

864
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,500
要接通吸热器
We've got to dial up the heat-sink.

865
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,770
气温就会更低
It's going to get even colder.

866
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,200
可能会引起
And that could result

867
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,230
大量难以预料冰闪
In an unpredictable amount of freeze lightning...

868
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,630
把我们全冻死
Which could kill us all.

869
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,570
正确
Right.

870
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,270
该建筑的锅炉垮了
The facility's furnace just went down.

871
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,770
为什么会这样
Well, how did that happen?

872
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,630
我们上个小时开了120%的马力
We've been running at 120% for the last hour

873
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,430
补偿失去的热能
To compensate for falling temperatures.

874
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,100
我们在沙漠中心
We're in the middle of the desert.

875
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,770
建筑不用如此供热
The facility's not meant to be heated like this.

876
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,830
我们马上就会冻成冰棍
We'll get below freezing pretty darn quick now.

877
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,330
好吧  我们不能关了电源
All right, well, we can't power it down

878
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,530
因为它自己供电
'cause it generates its own power.

879
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,870
我们也不能等
And we can't wait

880
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,070
因为封闭区就要崩溃了
For the containment field to collapse

881
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,370
暴风会杀死我们
Because the storm will probably kill us.

882
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,600
伙计们  我们别无选择
Guys, we don't have a choice, okay.

883
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,100
一旦通道达到顶峰
We've got to wait for the bridge to peak,

884
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,900
就接通吸热器  看能不能克服它
Dial up the heat-sink, see if we can overwhelm it.

885
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,470
我知道很危险  但我们得破釜沉舟了
I know it's dangerous, but that's all we've got.

886
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,930
好吧  听着
Okay, look.

887
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,870
这儿人太多了
There's too many people in here.

888
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,630
我还有重要工作
I have important work to do.

889
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,070
你们不要妨碍我
I do not need you in the way,

890
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,530
所有人  出去
So, everybody, out!

891
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,500
快点
Oh, come on.

892
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,200
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

893
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,630
兰德指挥办公室
General landry's office.

894
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,570
你好  我是珍妮弗·凯勒医生
Yes, this is dr. jennifer keller.

895
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,030
我必须立即跟总指挥说话
I need to speak to the general immediately.

896
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,300
情况紧急
It's an emergency.

897
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,300
喂
Hello?

898
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
喂
Hello?

899
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,400
喂  这里是
Hello? this is dr.--

900
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,130
喂
Hello?

901
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,300
娘的
Son of a bitch!

902
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,870
要警告大家我们要开始了吗
Should we warn everyone we're about to do this?

903
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,930
不用  会引起恐慌的
No, no, that would just cause a panic.

904
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,130
他们最好不知道
It's probably better they don't know.

905
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,270
我们无法将人群转移到安全地带
We have no way of moving people to a safe area,

906
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,330
而且我们也不知道
Plus we have no idea

907
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,870
下一个冰闪
Where the next freeze lightning strike

908
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,870
会击中谁
Could hit.

909
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,270
冰闪
"freeze lightning--"

910
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,700
名字够烂的
You know, that's a bad name.

911
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,630
别看我  是他想出来的
Don't look at me. it's his idea.

912
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,870
好了  开始吧
Okay, here we go.

913
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,400
好了  快关了
All right, shut it off.

914
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,230
不行  通道还没垮掉呢
I can't. it hasn't collapsed the bridge yet.

915
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,400
刚刚有信号的
I had a signal before.

916
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,430
快点
Come on!

917
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,970
没用
It's not working!

918
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,530
还需要一点时间  一点点
We just need a little more time, a little more time.

919
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,470
冰闪
The lightning strikes

920
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,870
把整个建筑都冻起来了
Are freezing off whole sections of the facility.

921
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,870
大家都被隔离了
Everyone is getting isolated.

922
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,200
没关系了
It doesn't matter.

923
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,030
只要我们能关了它  迟早会化的
They'll melt eventually if we can shut this thing down.

924
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,770
你会把我们都害死的
You are going to kill us all!

925
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,600
听着  我得一直
Look, I just need to keep doing--

926
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,600
你做了什么
What did you do?

927
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,370
关了它
I turned it down.

928
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,870
什么  为什么
What? why?

929
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,100
太危险了
It was too dangerous.

930
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,330
但就快成功了啊
But we were almost there.

931
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,430
就要达到峰值了  就要成功了
It was peaking out! it was going to work.

932
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,830
是啊  那我们就都挂了
Yeah, and we'd all be dead.

933
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,130
得想点别的法子
We have to come up with something else.

934
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,530
是啊  还有更快的么
Yeah, something fast!

935
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,000
封闭区就快垮了
'cause the containment field is about to fail.

936
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,430
好极了
Great.

937
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,770
不太好
Oh, not good.

938
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,730
罗德尼  听到吗
Rodney, can you hear me?

939
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,000
拜托告诉我你接通了星门控制中心
Please tell me you got through to the sgc?

940
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,430
没有
No.

941
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,870
那你得再试试
You've got to keep trying.

942
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,900
我想啊  但手机有点进水了
I'd love to, but my phone got a little soaked.

943
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,630
它都不开机了
It's not even... turning on.

944
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,700
什么
What?

945
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,070
走廊被冰闪击中了
My hallway got hit by that freeze lightning thing.

946
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,870
你没事吧
Are you okay?

947
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,430
目前没事  过一会儿就不好说了
I am now, but I won't be for long.

948
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,470
发生了什么
What happened?

949
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,900
我被封在里面了
I'm frozen in.

950
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,670
水管也被炸开
And the pipes busted open.

951
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,130
我的体温在急剧下降
My body temperature is dropping really fast.

952
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,830
好吧  我去通知安全人员
Okay, I'll radio security.

953
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,400
马上派人找她
I'll get someone out to her right away.

954
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,730
听着  保安就来了
Look, security's on the way.

955
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,500
你好好等着
I need you just to sit tight

956
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,970
尽量保持温暖  懂么
And try to stay warm, okay?

957
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,200
好的
Okay.

958
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,830
很抱歉没能接通电话
Sorry I didn't get the call through.

959
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,470
你尽力了
You did your best.

960
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,870
你把那玩意儿关了吗
Did you shut down that thing down?

961
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,730
还没  我们还在努力
Not yet. we're working on it.

962
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,430
加油
Hurry.

963
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,430
是啊
Yeah.

964
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,500
麦凯
Mckay!

965
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
听着  我得走了
Okay, look, I've got to go.

966
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,630
人马上就到  好吧
Someone's on the way, all right.

967
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,670
怎么啦
What is it?

968
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,100
封闭区崩溃  倒数计时
Containment field failure

969
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,370
3  2  1
In 3... 2... 1...

970
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,200
高空风
Winds aloft.

971
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,870
逐渐达到危险程度
Reaching dangerous levels.

972
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,170
如果持续下去
If it continues like this,

973
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,070
我们就等着看龙卷风吧
We'll have a mess of tornadoes on our hands.

974
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,070
好极了  或许之前我们就挂了
Great. Even less time before we died.

975
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,790
听着  这个设备不是能自己供电吗
Look, this device is capable of generating its own power, right?

976
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,590
是的  我们转换其中一小部分能量
Yeah, a small percentage of the energy we're transferring

977
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,090
用来支撑设备
Is siphoned off to power the device.

978
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,230
只要它在运作  就是自给自足的
So once it's running, it's self-sustaining.

979
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,090
所以我们不能拔了插头了事
Which is why we can't just pull the plug.

980
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,490
的确
Exactly.

981
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,930
但它只是在一定程度上自我供电
But it's only capable of powering itself to a certain extent?

982
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,890
它总有个发电能量的极限吧
It has a finite amount of power generation capability?

983
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,390
是啊  当然
Well, yes, of course.

984
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,430
也许我们一直在南辕北辙
Maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way.

985
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,060
我们一直在给通道
We've been trying to force so much power

986
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,890
提供能量
Through the bridge

987
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,290
才造成了超负荷
That it overloads it.

988
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,790
或许应该将其消耗殆尽
Maybe we should starve it--

989
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,230
从发电机吸收能量
Suck so much power from its generator

990
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,130
直至其瘫痪
That it stalls it out.

991
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,890
从技术上说是可行的
Technically, we could do that,

992
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,260
但得从电源中吸收大量能量
But you'd have to draw an insane amount of power.

993
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,460
吸热器都做不到
The heat-sink could never do it.

994
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,490
是不行
No...

995
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,630
但再来一个时空通道或许可以
But another space-time bridge could.

996
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,160
你想再打开一个时空通道
You want to open another space-time bridge?

997
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,530
既然设备不能开一个时空通道
The device was rigged to power a single bridge.

998
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,790
那我们就再开一个
We open another one...

999
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,660
只要它压制住系统  它就会停了
And it overwhelms the system and it fails.

1000
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,960
肯定行的
It'll work.

1001
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,690
是啊  但你想过没
Y-yeah, but do you have any idea

1002
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,590
配置系统使其
How difficult it will be

1003
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,760
能同时开两个时空通道
To configure the system

1004
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,860
有多难吗
To open two concurrent space-time bridges?

1005
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,030
我没说过这很简单啊
I never said it was going to be easy.

1006
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,460
简直不可能
Well, it'll be impossible.

1007
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,090
拜托  我可是罗德尼·麦凯博士  好吧
Hey, I'm dr. rodney mckay, all right?

1008
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,390
"困难"用秒解决  "不可能"用分钟搞定
"difficult" takes a few seconds, "impossible," a few minutes.

1009
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,790
罗德尼  能听到吗
Rodney, can you hear me?

1010
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,190
他们把你救出来了吗
Have they got you out of there yet?

1011
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,130
没有
No.

1012
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,530
托尼  刚刚怎么说来着
Tunney, what's the deal?

1013
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,760
你不是派了保安了吗
I thought you sent security.

1014
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,890
他们无法到她那儿
They can't get to her.

1015
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,690
什么  怎么会
What? why not?

1016
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,690
刚刚一轮冰闪
Oh, that last round of freeze lightning,

1017
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,190
封了许多走廊
It sealed off a lot of the corridors.

1018
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,290
看  他们正朝她那儿去呢
See, they're making their way to her,

1019
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,660
但得花点时间
But it'll take some time.

1020
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,990
越来越难
It's getting harder...

1021
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,330
很难保持清醒了
Harder to stay awake.

1022
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,530
我快要体温过低了
I'm going into... hypothermic shock.

1023
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,090
珍妮弗  坚持住  好吗
Jennifer, just hang in there, all right?

1024
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,330
行  我们在这儿
All right, we're here, right?

1025
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,790
我们可以去找她  那么近
So we can get to her. it's a straight shot.

1026
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,460
他们应该走这条路  穿过实验室
They should have come this way, through the lab.

1027
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,430
他们与我们也隔离了
They're cut off from us too.

1028
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,390
我要去找她
I've got to go get her.

1029
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,590
别  等等  我们现在很忙啊
No, wait. we're a bit busy right now.

1030
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,930
她会死的!
She'll die.

1031
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,060
如果风暴持续下去
If the storm keeps up like this,

1032
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,330
最终会毁掉建筑  我们都会死的
It'll rip the building apart, we'll all die!

1033
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,430
上次你声称自己是天才
Last time I checked,

1034
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,390
我审核过了
You were claiming to be a genius.

1035
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,690
计划我都给你了
I already gave you the plan.

1036
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,530
可是漏洞百出
A plan full of holes.

1037
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,590
那就填上!
So fill them!

1038
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,990
要是出错怎么办
W-what if I run into a problem?

1039
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,030
搞定它!
Work around it!

1040
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,490
你比我聪明
You're smarter than me.

1041
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,290
我知道
I know.

1042
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,090
麦凯
Mckay!

1043
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,060
真受不了
Oh, this is outrageous!

1044
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,890
最需要他的时候  他反倒推给我了
When we need him the most, he puts it on me,

1045
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,790
而我应该
And I'm supposed to be the one to--

1046
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,790
别像个娘儿们
Man up.

1047
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
珍妮弗
Jennifer!

1048
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,490
好了  就是它了
Okay, I think that's it.

1049
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,830
启动之前  检查一下
Before I run it, just check my math.

1050
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,190
检查过了
I have been!

1051
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,560
不然你以为我在这儿干什么
Why do you think I'm standing here?

1052
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,490
珍妮弗
Jennifer!

1053
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,430
好了  快点快点
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

1054
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,830
开始
Do it!

1055
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,960
没呼吸了
You're not breathing.

1056
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
天哪  没呼吸了
Oh, my god, you're not breathing.

1057
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,990
拜托别死啊
Oh, please don't be dead.

1058
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,290
千万别死啊
Please don't be dead.

1059
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,490
回到我身边  拜托
Come back to me, please.

1060
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,260
快醒醒啊
Please come back to me.

1061
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,330
成功了
It worked!

1062
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,530
第二个时空通道超过了能量供应
The second space-time bridge blew the power supply.

1063
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,190
两个通道都垮了
Both bridges collapsed.

1064
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,460
成功了
I did it!

1065
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,190
拜托
Please...

1066
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,690
谢谢老天
Oh, thank god.

1067
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,690
你没事吧
You're okay.

1068
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,430
你没事吧
You're okay...

1069
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,360
我很冷
I'm really cold.

1070
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,860
我也是
Me too...

1071
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,060
你救了我
You saved me.

1072
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,660
那我们扯平了
I guess that makes us even.

1073
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,990
我用了把斧子
I used an ax.

1074
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,160
大斧子
A big ax.

1075
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,430
真希望你当时能看到
I really wish you were conscious,

1076
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,830
这是我迄今为止做过的最酷的事
'cause I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done--

1077
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,160
真不知道失去了你
I don't know what I would have done

1078
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,490
我怎么办
If I lost you...

1079
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,630
我爱你
I love you.

1080
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,490
已经有段日子了
I have for some time now.

1081
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,930
希望你知道
I just wanted you to know.

1082
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
我
I--

1083
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,790
至少你朋友
Well, at least your friends

1084
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,890
不再认为你可有可无了
Don't think you're a washout anymore.

1085
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,330
白痴比尔·耐
Stupid bill nye

1086
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,790
还在到处跟人说
Is telling everyone who will listen

1087
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,530
是托尼那家伙关了设备的
That tunney's the guy who turned the device off.

1088
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,190
的确是他关上的啊
Because he was the one that shut off the device.

1089
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,260
是我的想法  我的点子
With my coding. it was my idea.

1090
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,190
罗德尼  真这么要紧吗
Rodney, does it really matter?

1091
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,630
是的  当然
Yes. yes, it does.

1092
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,930
对不起
I'm sorry,

1093
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,790
我知道应该谦逊
I know I'm supposed to be humble,

1094
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,660
不应该那么要强
Not supposed to care,

1095
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,160
但我就是在意  很在意
But I do, I really do.

1096
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,060
但这  这就是你要了解的我
And that's... that's something you should know about me.

1097
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
那就辞职
Well, quit, then.

1098
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,790
去私营部门
Join the private sector.

1099
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,790
做些让全世界见证的伟业
Start doing work the whole world can see.

1100
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,690
我有想过
I've been thinking about it.

1101
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,060
什么  肯定没有
What? no, you haven't.

1102
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,690
我和星门控制中心的合约年底到期
My contract with sgc is up this year.

1103
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,330
也许是時候继续了  做点别的
Maybe it's time to move on, time to do other things.

1104
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,630
拜托
Please...

1105
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,090
没什么人比你更爱工作了
I don't know anyone who loves their job more than you.

1106
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,730
你说军方会让他们
So you think the military

1107
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,990
继续实验吗
Is going to let them keep experimenting?

1108
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,430
不太可能了
I think it's highly unlikely.

1109
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,130
何况  地球工程前景不好
Besides, geo-engineering is a dumb pursuit anyway.

1110
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,030
靠个人不能解决全球变暖问题
No one person's going to solve global warming.

1111
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,390
人人有责
We all have to do our part.

1112
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,160
例如不搭私人飞机
Like not take private jets.

1113
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,160
总有一天他们会理解的
Well, they were going our way anyway.

1114
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,390
知道么  只有你和我真好
You know, it's kind of nice, just me and you back here.

1115
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,090
是啊
Right.

1116
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,260
是啊!
Right!

1117
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,160
几小时前你差点挂了
You were legally dead a few hours ago.

1118
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
你简直冻僵了
You were practically frozen.

1119
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,190
你真的想
You really want to...

1120
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,190
要么那样
Well, it's either that

1121
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,190
要么听你喋喋不休
Or you keep telling me

1122
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,360
如何如何拯救了大家
How you, and only you, saved the day.

1123
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,030
我努力尝试"谦逊"
I'm trying out this whole "humble" thing out.

1124
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,190
看来女士还真吃这一套
Seems to be quite a hit with the ladies...
