00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,300
Excuse me, sir.

Elevator descending. Elevator descending.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Detective Kennex?

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
May I help you?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,300
John? What are you doing down here?

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,700
I was, uh... I was just looking, uh, for you.

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,100
I'm-I'm, uh... I'm, uh... I'm great.

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,600
- Cool.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
They're replacing my chest plate.

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,900
We have to go by Rudy's later and pick one up.

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,100
Okay. We'll... we'll do that.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
Oh, I can't get it out of my head.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
- What are you talking about?
- The life-sized Ken doll.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,700
That's what's bothering you? I'm the one that lives with them.

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
I have no privacy, and they glare at me with their

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
lifeless eyes. I'm miserable.

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,400
- You need to talk to Captain Maldonado.
- Talk to Maldonado... about what?

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
- I need my own place.
- You gotta be kidding me.

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,500
- You saw how awful it was down there.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,300
- It's burned into my brain forever.
- Welcome to my world.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,100
You're, uh... you know, you're not...

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,300
like that down there, are you?

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
Not that it's any of your business...

44
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,000
but my designer was much more thoughtful. I'm made to look human.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,900
Oh, okay, good. I can show you.

46
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,800
No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no. Oh, my G...

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Is that all for one person? Dude, put it away.

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
Wait. You're a robot.

49
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,700
What... what do you do with it?

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Probably the same thing you do with yours...

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,900
- nothing.
- I do plenty with mine.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,300
- Oh, yeah?
- Plenty.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,200
Yeah? What's up with Detective Stahl?

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,800
- What about her?
- The way she smiles at you... the way she says your name...

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
- John...
- Oh, please, don't.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
- She likes you.
- Come on. We work together, so...

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,600
John. Your fake leg is really sexy.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,900
Captain Maldonado, you said you oversaw the investigation of this case.

59
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,400
Can you elaborate on what you found at the crime scene?

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,900
I saw Dr. Fuller, the victim, lying dead on the ground in a parking garage,

61
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,500
(DOCTOR LIAM FULLER IS AFFILIATED WITH THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY CORE AT CARRIGE UNVIERSITY)
adjacent to a clinic where he worked as a fertility specialist.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,900
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Yes.

63
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
There were three shots... two bullets to the chest, one to the head...

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,700
at point-blank range.

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,800
I know that because the residue from the gunpowder

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,200
- had blackened the wounds around Dr. Fuller's skin.
- Sounds brutal.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
It was.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,900
Whoever did this must be a horrible person,

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,700
with a record of doing horrible things.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,300
I call your attention to Exhibit C.

71
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,300
This is the weapon that was found
next to the body of

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
- Dr. Liam Fuller, is it not?
- Yes.

73
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
It's a high-capacity assault pistol, banned for street use.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,400
Were my client Ethan Avery's fingerprints on the gun?

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
No, they were not. Nor were they at the scene.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,800
- And did you find his DNA at the scene?
- No, we did not.

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
You're telling me that my client, an upstanding citizen

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
with no criminal record who donates a good portion of his inheritance to charity...

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
- Objection, Your Honor, irrelevant.
- Sustained.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,900
- Move it along.
- You're telling me that my client, Ethan Avery,

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,300
brutally murdered Dr. Liam Fuller...

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,900
Yes, that's correct.

83
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,300
...and you have no physical evidence to connect my client to the crime.

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,000
- No.
- Thank you.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
- But what we do have...
- Captain.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,300
- That'll be all.
- No.

87
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,600
That's not all. What we have is two eyewitnesses who saw your client murder Dr. Fuller in cold blood.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,900
- I said no further questions.
- Two witnesses who are not related to each other,

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,200
- who were both at the scene of the crime...
- I... Your Honor.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
- ... who were able to pick out of a lineup...
- Objection.

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
- Sustained.
- ... separately, that man, Ethan Avery.

92
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
That shuts the door on reasonable doubt.

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,400
- Your Honor...
- That's enough, Captain.

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,000
- You may step down.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,000
It's so stressful, isn't it?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
All this waiting.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,100
It's my first time being a witness.

98
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,200
Have you ever been a witness in a murder trial?

99
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
No, I've never been a witness.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
I like your scarf.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
It's your grandmother's, isn't it?

102
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,500
- How did you know that?
- She told me.

103
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm sorry, but my grandmother's been dead for a year.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
I know that. I'm a psychic.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
And a medium. A little bit of both, I guess.

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,200
A medium psychic? On good days, I'm a petite psychic.

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,700
The lawyer asked me not to mention it on the stand.

108
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,900
But we're not on the stand, so...

109
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,500
No, I can't tell her that, she's about to testify.

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,600
Tell me what?

111
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,800
She thinks you're ruining her scarf with your oily skin.

112
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,400
Her words, not mine. I think your skin is lovely.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,100
- I told you, nobody wants to hear that.
- Haley Myers?

114
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,700
- They're ready for you.
- Don't worry.

115
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,000
You're gonna be great.

116
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Please raise your right hand.

117
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,900
That wasn't nice. I told you. I shouldn't have said anything.

118
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,500
I always do that.

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
- Is the State ready to call its next witness?
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,200
Um, as you know, the two eyewitnesses are in protective custody,

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,200
so to ensure their safety, we're going to be broadcasting their testimony remotely.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,900
That's fine. Proceed.

123
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,100
The State calls Haley Myers to the stand.

124
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
- Have you been sworn in?
- I have.

125
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,100
You may be seated.

126
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,900
- State your full name for the record, please.
- Haley Jolene Myers.

127
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,800
- And what is your profession?
- I'm a registered nurse.

128
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Thank you, Mrs. Myers.

129
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,200
- You were at the parking garage the day in question, were you not?
- Yes.

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I was.

131
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
You were going to your car, correct?

132
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,000
It was around 8:00 a. m. I had just finished my shift.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,700
And can you tell us what you saw?

134
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,200
I, um...

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,500
- Yeah.
- It's all right, Mrs. Myers.

136
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,400
Just... take your time.

137
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,400
I saw a man striding toward a parked car.

138
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,800
He was moving quickly, like he had a purpose.

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Then I saw he was holding a gun.

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
- Mrs. Myers?
- Something's happening.

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,400
The safe house has been compromised. Deploy now.

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
No!

143
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,900
Someone help her!

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Where's the other one?

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,300
IDENTIFY SUBJECT

146
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,400
VAUGHN, MAYA

147
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
Maya Vaughn.

148
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,300
I'm a police officer. You're gonna be okay.

149
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,500
You're gonna be okay.

150
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
What do we got?

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,500
A single shooter, entered by force, discharged a large-caliber weapon,

152
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
took out the bailiff first.

153
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Then shot and killed Haley Myers, one of the witnesses in the case against Avery.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,300
- Any DNA? Prints?
- So far, nothing to give us an I.D.

155
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
- Armor-piercing.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,300
- Probably purchased on the black market.
- Any idea how the shooter found the safe house?

157
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
We found this tracker on the bailiff.

158
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,500
Someone must've figured out he was on the protection detail.

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,800
Followed him here. Any word on the other witness?

160
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,700
Yeah, she's alive and in custody.

161
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,900
Good thing. Because right now, she's the only thing standing between Ethan Avery and his freedom.

162
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,400
I've got an eye for you.

163
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,700
(EVIDENCE)
An eye for me, that's funny.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,000
- Morbid, making your MX hold the bin, isn't it?
- Oh, he can handle it, right?

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Affirmative.

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,400
I can hold more than a metric ton, which converts to 2,204.6 pounds.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm collecting pieces for Rudy. If he can reassemble the MX,

168
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
he might be able to pull some footage from its CPU.

169
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,000
- Mm.
- I.D. the shooter.

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
- The Knights just scored. The score is now two to one.
- Hey, whoa... whoa, buddy, stop.

171
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
- I'm recording it.
- Oh, sorry.

172
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,600
- He's been updating me.
- I didn't know you were a fan.

173
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,100
Glad I can surprise you.

174
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,300
- I better, uh...
- They just scored again.

175
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,700
Hey, you're ruining it.

176
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,400
- Sorry...
- Unbelievable.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,700
I bet you're having a pretty bad day.

178
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,200
A witness under police protection murdered in front of an entire courtroom.

179
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,900
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- Get away with what?

180
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,600
I was in court. With you.

181
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,300
You think you're so smart. 

182
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't get how a guy with a 180 IQ could be so sloppy.

183
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,800
Your assassin didn't complete the job.

184
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm sure the warden told you I've had no visitation,

185
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,100
phone calls or correspondence since I got here, so...

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,700
how could I pull off hiring a hit man from solitary confinement,

187
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
- Lieutenant?
- Captain.

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,800
Right. Captain.

189
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
You were on the news... about that ordeal at the wall.

190
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,500
I came out of that all right.

191
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm surprised you're not more highly ranked for a woman your age.

192
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I- I bet you have one of those plaques hanging on your wall

193
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,900
just to show everyone how far you've come in such a short amount of time.

194
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,800
No ring.

195
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
Been single a long time, haven't you?

196
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
You don't know anything about me.

197
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,500
I know that you don't like me because...

198
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
people respect me.

199
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Because what I do amounts to more than just buttoning up a business suit and barking orders from a desk,

200
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,900
hoping that people will take me seriously.

201
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
You think this far-fetched scheme of yours to put me in jail will make you feel important?

202
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,600
Well, let me be the first to tell you that you're not important.

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,700
You'd be content if just one person could see you and want you.

204
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,200
But they don't, do they?

205
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
All those men you work with, they just walk right past you.

206
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,600
Like you're invisible.

207
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,800
No matter what you do, no matter how bad you want it,

208
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
at the end of the day, it'll always be just you.

209
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Alone.

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
You're a son of a bitch.

211
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,200
I know you killed Dr. Fuller.

212
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,500
I know you're behind the murder of Haley Myers.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,900
And I am gonna personally see to it that you never get on the other side of the razor wire.

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
I hope you get your man.

215
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Can you tell us what happened when you were at the safe house?

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
I was listening to the testimony.

217
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,800
I got up and went to the bathroom.

218
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,000
And then I heard a shot. And then another one.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,700
- Did you ever get a look back at who was shooting?
- No, the door was closed.

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,200
I knew if I didn't do anything, I'd be next, so I went to the window and opened it.

221
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
- And that's when you climbed down.
- Yes.

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,100
And I just started running.

223
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
- Did you ever look back?
- No.

224
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
- So you didn't see the shooter.
- No.

225
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,000
But Haley did.

226
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
- Haley?
- The other witness.

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Haley told me she saw the killer.

228
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,700
You said you ran away after the shots were fired, so...

229
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,700
- when did she tell you?
- About ten minutes ago.

230
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,300
- Um, sorry, I'm not quite following you.
- I'm a medium psychic.

231
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,900
But on good days, I'm a petite psychic.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,900
I can communicate with her spirit.

233
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,100
Miss Vaughn, we don't usually

234
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,500
get our leads from spirits.

235
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,900
- We like to deal in facts.
- Well, this is legit.

236
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,800
I had the Cerebellux procedure. It worked on me.

237
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,100
- Cerebellux procedure?
- It's relatively new and unproven.

238
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,100
It's meant to increase percentage of brain usage in human beings.

239
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,900
Enhancements have been known to add sensory abilities

240
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
or a notable increase in intelligence.

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,300
- Maybe you should try it, John.
- I was one of the positive results.

242
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,700
When I touch items, like, anything, really,

243
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
the voices start in my head.

244
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,700
And if I'm holding an item of a deceased person, well, then they

245
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,600
- just start talking to me from the beyond.
- That's fascinating.

246
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
- That's insane.
- I'm sorry, sorry.

247
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,600
You know what happens when I get nervous. I just can't stop talking.

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,700
Haley's upset.

249
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,600
She wants me to get to the point and tell you who killed her.

250
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
- Who?
- Ethan Avery.

251
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Ethan Avery?

252
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Uh, Miss Vaughn...

253
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,000
Ethan Avery was sitting in a courtroom across town...

254
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Could you please lower your voice?

255
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,400
Sorry, she really needs you to listen.

256
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,100
Ethan Avery murdered her. She knows it for sure.

257
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,900
She saw his face.

258
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,300
Okay, uh... Thanks, Maya.

259
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Haley.

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,100
We'll be right back.

261
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
- Medium.
- Psychic-medium, actually.

262
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,200
She's a kook. She says that Ethan Avery is the one that killed Haley Myers in the safe house.

263
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,500
Ethan Avery was with me in court. It's impossible.

264
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,600
That's what I said. Look, I think the real problem here is the D.A.'s last living witness

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,500
belongs in a puzzle factory, not giving testimony on a witness stand.

266
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Hello, my fellow law enforcers. Sorry to interrupt.

267
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,400
But I thought you might like to hear this.

268
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,900
We all know that facial replication technology exists,

269
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,000
DNA can be fabricated, fingerprints can be planted.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
The human vocal chords can't be faked.

271
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Recorded, yes. Duplicated, yes. And to the human ear, they can seem identical.

272
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,700
However, if an auditory specialist, <i>like moi,

273
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,400
tirelessly analyzes</i> the audio print, 

274
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
it is possible to discern whether or not a voice

275
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,700
is a recording or...

276
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,000
as in this case, organic.

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,900
- Anybody get that?
- I do.

278
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,400
Thank you, my friend.

279
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
I pulled some audio from the hologram testimony,

280
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,700
and picked out a voice from the safe house. The killer's voice.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,100
- This voice.
- Where's the other one?

282
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
That voice is 100% not a recording.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,200
Those are coming directly from vocal chords.

284
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Which means that whoever was saying this was actually in the room...

285
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,200
with the witnesses and fired that gun.

286
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,900
And the voice belongs to... wait for it...

287
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,300
...Ethan Avery

288
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,400
himself.

289
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,700
What about an identical twin?

290
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,700
That would explain why someone with his voice killed the witness and the bailiff.

291
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
We checked that out. Avery's an only child.

292
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,700
- Narcissistic, sociopathic...
- But what's the ultimate in narcissism?

293
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
What if Avery cloned himself?

294
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,900
No, we checked with the Anti-Replication guys. They said there's no case file on Avery.

295
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,200
Oh, come on, those ARD guys are so backlogged.

296
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,700
I wouldn't trust their records.

297
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,300
Hello, people... cloning is complex.

298
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,500
Unless Avery had a secret Ph. D in biogenetics, he wouldn't have the skills.

299
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,000
We did a thorough background check on Avery.

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If he was harboring a clone, we would've found evidence.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Wait a minute, Dr. Fuller's a fertility specialist.

302
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,300
I mean, we don't know why Avery killed him, but cloning's a reproductive technology.

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,400
What if there's a connection we missed?

304
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,900
Right, we've never been able to establish motive.

305
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,200
Or any connection between Avery and Fuller.

306
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Let's check it out.

307
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,300
- Uh, you sure you don't mind?
- Oh, no, it's fine.

308
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,600
Here... this was hers.

309
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm sorry. I'm not getting anything.

310
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,400
How long ago did your wife pass away?

311
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,500
My ex-wife. I was just hoping she was dead.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,700
- I don't think this is gonna work.
- Yeah, that's what she said.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Wait, uh, what was that?

314
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,200
That's Haley. She wants me to deliver a message.

315
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,300
- What is it? What'd she say?
- The message isn't for you.

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,500
I wanted to ask you a few questions about Liam Fuller.

317
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,800
- You knew him, didn't you?
- Yes.

318
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,500
I read about his murder.

319
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,700
It chilled me. Although I hadn't seen him in many years.

320
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,200
Actually, I found an article by Dr. Fuller that was published 22 years ago on stem cell cloning.

321
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,300
(PRODUCING STEM CELLS FOR HUMAN CLONE TRANSFER)
It mentions Adelaide Jones as his research assistant.

322
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
- That's you, right?
- That was Dr. Fuller being generous.

323
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,700
- Did you stay in touch with Dr. Fuller after the study was over?
- No.

324
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,500
When they passed legislation banning cloning, research funding dried up overnight.

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,300
Dr. Fuller had to give up that work and refocus his career.

326
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,500
By any chance do you recall an Ethan Avery taking part in that study?

327
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
I wouldn't know. The subjects were anonymous.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,000
I've looked for more of his work on cloning, but I haven't been able to find anything.

329
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,800
We worked a lot out of his mother's house.

330
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,200
If his old research still exists, you might try looking there.

331
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
- Uh, have you seen Maya?
- Maya?

332
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
- The witness?
- Yeah, yeah.

333
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,400
The one I asked you to watch?

334
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
Yeah, look, she asked me to go get her a cup of coffee.

335
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,000
- I come back, I can't find her.
- Paul, I couldn't have given you an easier job.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,800
You think it's easy to take care of bananapants all day? What are you doing?

337
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm checking the surveillance cameras around the precinct.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If she left, we should be able to trace her... I've got her.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
She's walking down Eighth Street.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,300
No, no, wait... why don't you <i>just go re-read the How to Be a Cop manual?</i>

341
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,500
Hey, Maya.

342
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
Nice day for a walk.

343
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm going to see Haley's parents. She wants to talk to them.

344
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,100
Did Haley ask you to do that?

345
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
I have to give them a message. Tell them that she's okay.

346
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,100
Haley is definitely not okay. Look, why don't you hop in the back?

347
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,200
You can either hop in the car or I'll arrest you for jay-walking.

348
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,300
Either way you're coming with us.

349
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
<i>Why did you leave the police station?</i>

350
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,200
- <i>What were you possibly thinking?</i>
- I wasn't thinking, I was listening.

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,500
- Something you could probably learn to do.
- Tell me about it.

352
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,100
We're doing our very best to try and protect you.

353
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,100
And you're wandering around like a walking bull's-eye.

354
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,800
You're in protective custody for a reason. People are trying to kill you.

355
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,300
John, has anyone ever told you about your energy?

356
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,200
- I have.
- It's very troubling.

357
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,000
You're surrounded by a very strong aura of red.

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,300
"Strong aura of red. " Great.

359
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,400
It's the color of anger and frustration.

360
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,900
- And apples and Christmas.
- It pushes people away from you.

361
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,500
I can tell that's not what you want.

362
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,700
- You know, I kind of like being by myself.
- Really?

363
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,300
'Cause when we met, John, I got a very intense vision.

364
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,200
- I'm getting an intense vision right now.
- It was all dark.

365
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
There was a bright light. And there was, um...

366
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,500
- running.
- So, you're telling me to run towards the light?

367
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,200
No, you're not running. Someone's coming towards you.

368
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,600
Someone very special. It's also a very strong smell.

369
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,300
Is it New Spice Special Reserve? 'Cause sometimes he wears too much aftershave.

370
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
- No, I don't.
- No, not that.

371
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Something else. Bourbon.

372
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Now you're talking.

373
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,000
You on the other hand... when I read you,

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,800
everything is quiet. Peaceful.

375
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,400
See, now I know you're way off base. 'Cause this guy is anything but.

376
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Get down! Watch out! Watch out!

377
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
- I'm going out.
- But you can't! You don't have a chestplate!

378
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,900
Maya, no! John, she's hit!

379
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,300
- Eli!
- Leave him! We got to get the hell out of here!

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,800
I need an ambulance... now!

381
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,000
Ethan Avery...?!

382
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,800
We got a lead on who killed Haley Myers in the safe house.

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,500
- Who?
- Ethan Avery's clone.

384
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,000
- He looks exactly like him, ten years younger.
- What about the others?

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,300
I don't know. I didn't get a look at their faces, but...

386
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,800
if I had to guess, I'd say they were clones, too.

387
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,100
They're well-trained, well-armed, and proficient.

388
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,100
Stahl's gone to Fuller's mother to track down his research.

389
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,500
Have you heard from the hospital?

390
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
Yeah. Maya's got a chipped collarbone and possible internal bleeding.

391
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,400
That's not good news. How the hell did they find her?

392
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,500
I have no idea. We weren't at a predetermined location.

393
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Stahl checked the precinct surveillance. She wasn't followed when she left.

394
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,100
We're sweeping the cruiser for tracking devices.

395
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,800
She has to pull through. If we don't have her, we have nothing on Avery.

396
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
We can't connect her to Fuller.

397
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,400
I know.

398
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,900
He's winning. Avery's winning.

399
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,200
I'll call you if I get anything else.

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,500
Try not to move too much.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Is Detective Kennex okay?

402
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,500
He's fine. He's looking for the shooters right now. We're all just glad you're okay.

403
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,700
The bullet's impact was 37 millimeters from puncturing your lung.

404
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
You were very lucky, Maya.

405
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,900
I don't think anyone's ever called me that before.

406
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,700
I never thought of myself as lucky.

407
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,400
The week before my 19th birthday, my parents died in a car accident.

408
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,700
The police said it was instant.

409
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm-I'm sorry.

410
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,300
That's okay.

411
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,700
We all know that we're gonna lose our parents.

412
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,300
I just assumed it would be years later.

413
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
Definitely not both of them at the same time.

414
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,700
Everyone said, "With time, it'll get better. "

415
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,100
And I tried, but I was living in the house that I grew up in.

416
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,500
I didn't want to move. It was my home.

417
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,200
That's why you got the procedure.

418
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,400
I heard it helped people connect to the other side.

419
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,900
Everyone told me not to do it, that it was a fraud,

420
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,500
that hearing voices was a sign of mental illness,

421
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,100
but I didn't care.

422
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,800
I signed up right away, followed all the rules, did everything they suggested.

423
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,000
And then when I woke up...

424
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,200
I knew something was different.

425
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,100
When I heard the first voice, I was terrified.

426
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,000
It was so clear...

427
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,700
and no one else could hear it.

428
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,200
When the shock wore off, I knew I had the ability.

429
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
That must've been amazing.

430
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
Realizing you could reconnect with your parents.

431
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,000
That's what I thought.

432
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
While I was recovering from the procedure,

433
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
there was a fire.

434
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
Our house burnt to the ground.

435
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,400
And when I went back, it was just ash.

436
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,600
And I needed something of theirs to touch,

437
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,900
to connect to them.

438
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,100
But everything...

439
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
everything was gone.

440
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,000
The irony is, I talk to dead people all the time.

441
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,400
But I can't talk to the people who matter the most to me.

442
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,900
- What'd you find?
- There are no trackers, Detective.

443
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,300
Your vehicle is clean.

444
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,000
I want you to turn this phone into a secure comm, okay?

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
Completely off police channels.

446
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Certainly. One moment.

447
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,600
Ooh, a secure line. What's the occasion?

448
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Rudy, did Valerie deliver the MX destroyed at the safe house?

449
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,100
Ah, yes, Detective Stahl, she graced the lab with her presence.

450
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Check the MX's comm tech. See if it's missing.

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,700
Okay.

452
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
It's not there.

453
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,600
- In fact, the whole ear is missing.
- That's how they did it.

454
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
That's how they followed Maya. They stole it,

455
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,200
and they're monitoring police comm signals.

456
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Hello?

457
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
- We should take a look inside.
- Do we have probable cause, Detective Stahl?

458
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,100
Yes. I'm worried about Mrs. Fuller's health.

459
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,400
She's an old lady.

460
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,200
No problem. I'll notify the precinct of our location.

461
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,700
Anybody home?

462
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,800
Mrs. Fuller?

463
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Clear the upstairs.

464
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,700
(????????????)

465
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,900
The second floor is clear.

466
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Send this and all the files on this computer to Maldonado immediately.

467
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,400
Copy.

468
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Stop right there.

469
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,900
All police frequencies have been compromised. We have to assume

470
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,400
that Avery's clones have heard everything we've broadcast.

471
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,700
Dr. Lom is setting up an encrypted frequency.

472
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,200
Should be up and running in 15 minutes.

473
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,300
Captain, this was sent by Detective Stahl via her MX. She marked it urgent.

474
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,700
She found the connection. Dr. Fuller was the one who cloned Avery.

475
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,400
- How do you know?
- This is a letter Dr. Fuller sent to him, 

476
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,200
threatening to publish his research and expose the clones. That's why Avery killed him.

477
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,500
Wait a minute. Valerie sent that on the compromised frequency.

478
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,400
- What's her status?
- Detective Stahl logged in in a farmhouse on Old Sawmill Road.

479
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,300
The locator in her cruiser indicates it was parked out front.

480
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
It's Stahl.

481
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,900
Valerie, listen to me. You got to get out of there.

482
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,700
- You must be someone very special.
- Who is this?

483
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
I think you know.

484
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Of all the people she could have contacted when her life depended on it, she chose you,

485
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,400
- Detective Kennex.
- Let me speak to Detective Stahl.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,300
That's not the way this works.

487
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
You have someone I want, and clearly we have someone

488
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,700
you want, so let's see how we can accommodate each other.

489
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,800
You listen to me, you hurt her in any way...

490
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,600
<i>I suggest you listen, Detective.</i>

491
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm going to send you a set of coordinates.

492
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,000
I want Ethan Avery brought to that location in two hours.

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,300
You will come in one car. If you bring reinforcements, we will know.

494
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,400
If there are drones in the area, we will know.

495
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,700
If we detect anything amiss, she's dead.

496
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,400
And don't even try to come to this house.

497
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
I know you know where we are.

498
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,600
Wow, you must be the smart one.

499
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
<i>We all are.</i>

500
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,600
You have two hours.

501
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,600
They won't negotiate with you...

502
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,900
not even for me.

503
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,500
- You're not gonna get what you want.
- I beg to differ.

504
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,500
You should've heard him on the phone.

505
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,900
You're important to him.

506
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,200
I say we kill her anyway! They shot Eli!

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,900
And they'll pay for it, but not right now. We have to get Ethan back.

508
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,100
We have to put the family back together.

509
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,300
You're not a family.

510
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,200
Why do this for a murderer who's held you hostage your entire life?

511
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,600
Because he is us.

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,100
How far would you go to save yourself?

513
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,100
They want to meet in the woods north of the city. There's a road at each end.

514
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,700
What about aerial surveillance? Maybe helos?

515
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
These guys have tech capable of spotting our assets.

516
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,700
You can't seriously be thinking about taking Avery out there.

517
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,200
Paul, if we don't comply, they won't hesitate.

518
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,100
They'll kill her.

519
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,100
Check out a transport vehicle from the motor pool.

520
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,200
- I'll prep Avery for travel.
- Captain, you can't just give in.

521
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,200
This is my case. We're gonna do it my way.

522
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
Call Rudy. We're gonna need his help.

523
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,100
<i>Scanning me for weapons,</i> Captain Maldonado? What's the occasion?

524
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,700
It's standard procedure. You're being released.

525
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,400
Released?

526
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,300
Please tell me you finally got your man.

527
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,300
Enjoy your freedom. It'll be short-lived, I promise.

528
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,400
- He's clean.
- Thank you.

529
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Have transport standing by. Mr. Avery's ready for release.

530
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,000
You must have a guardian angel.

531
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,700
Get her in the van.

532
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,000
All right.

533
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,300
Everyone's in position. Let's get started.

534
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Calibrating scanners.

535
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Linking scanners with our GPS coordinates.

536
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,600
No drones. We're good.

537
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Get set up.

538
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,200
And scanners are locked on.

539
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,800
All right, let's get 'em.

540
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Bring her out!

541
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,800
Get your hands off me.

542
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
You set?

543
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Initializing hologram projection.

544
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
It's him.

545
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,900
I've got to admit, it shows some real spine on your part,

546
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,900
coming down here in person just to let me go.

547
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
Your clones put us in a tight spot.

548
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,800
They are remarkable, aren't they?

549
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah, that's one word for it.

550
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,800
Slight problem. We're getting short on the hallway.

551
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
This needs to happen fast.

552
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Do you really think, after this is over, you can all just disappear?

553
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,400
I kept them hidden for over two decades, I'm sure we can disappear for a few more.

554
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
Okay, Rudy, how we looking?

555
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Not so good. About 20 feet at most.

556
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,700
It's not him!

557
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,500
Stahl!

558
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,600
What's up?

559
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,900
Did Dorian just flip that van?

560
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Why hasn't he done that before?

561
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,500
You okay?

562
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,700
Yeah, I'm okay.

563
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
- We got Stahl.
- Copy that.

564
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,300
What the hell's going on? Why am I not being released?

565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
You're not going anywhere, you son of a bitch.

566
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,900
When I stepped into the garage, I saw a man.

567
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,300
He was walking towards a parked car, carrying a gun.

568
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,500
And then what?

569
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,900
I saw the man shoot Dr. Fuller three times.

570
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,800
And without any doubt, can you see the man who pulled the trigger

571
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,300
- in the courtroom today?
- Yes, I do.

572
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,800
Can you point to him, please?

573
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,000
That man right there.

574
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,900
Let the record show that the witness identified the defendant, Ethan Avery.

575
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,100
Thank you, Miss Vaughn.

576
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,000
Your Honor, the State rests.

577
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Court will adjourn. We will resume again in one hour.

578
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,200
I got to say, you held yourself together really well up there today.

579
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,700
Really? I was so nervous, I was shaking like a leaf.

580
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,200
Well, you didn't look nervous. You did great.

581
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Listen, I know you're a skeptic,

582
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,700
but remember the energy I was telling you about the other day in the car?

583
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,100
Yeah, the, uh, the red one that repels anything and everyone around me,

584
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,800
- except for bourbon and someone coming towards me, right?
- Mm, that one.

585
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Just so you know, the universe has a way of working things out for us.

586
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
All the wonderful things you've done, it's already being erased.

587
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,600
I think we both know where this is going, so I wanted to be the first to tell you

588
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,500
that you're going to jail forever.

589
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,000
In the next few days, people will be talking about you,

590
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,800
about the killer, the cloner, the novelty that is Ethan Avery.

591
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,500
In a few years, people will bring up in passing

592
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,800
the egomaniacal philanthropist

593
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,000
who made duplicates of himself because he thought

594
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,100
the world needed more of him.

595
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,900
And decades and decades from now, while you're in jail rotting away alone,

596
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,400
Ethan Avery will be forgotten.

597
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,400
It will be like you never existed.

598
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,900
- Hey, Sandra.
- Yeah?

599
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh, nothing. I just wanted to say, uh, just wanted to say you look nice today.

600
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,500
Thanks.

601
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,700
Hey, Dorian.

602
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,000
Hey. I wanted to catch you before you left the courthouse.

603
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
- I wanted to give this to you.
- What is it?

604
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,600
I've been thinking about your parents, what happened.

605
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,000
I thought I'd look into it. There was an arson investigation.

606
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah, they never figured out who did it.

607
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,100
I know, but this box was in the evidence locker, and I had it released.

608
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,100
Maybe there's something in here that might work for you.

609
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,900
I hope it helps.

610
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
Want some company?

611
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
Yeah, sure.

612
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,300
- Where'd you get the booze from?
- My desk, top drawer.

613
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,900
Never know when you're gonna need it.

614
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,600
Boy, you really are full of surprises.

615
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,700
What are you doing in here this late?

616
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,700
- Had to log some evidence downstairs.
- What's your excuse?

617
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,900
Ah, I was just finishing off a report.

618
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,400
Thought I'd catch the second half of the game.

619
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,900
