1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,044
创世之初 冥冥之中
In the beginning, there was darkness...

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,171
随着轰的一声
and then, bang...

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:09,383
诞生了无限膨胀的
giving birth to an endless expanding existence...

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,969
时间 空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,263
现在 所见超乎我们的想象
Now, see further than we've ever imagined...

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,557
超越了我们生存的限制
beyond the limits of our existence...

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,268
这个空间我们称之为“宇宙”
in a place we call " The Universe. "

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,648
它们漫步在行星的地表
They roam the planetary surface...

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,277
穿梭于水下
fly under water...

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,363
翱翔在空中
and soar through the heavens.

11
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,204
然而这不是地球上的野生动物游猎
But this is no wildlife safari on planet Earth.

12
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,791
这是天文级的探险
This is an expedition of astronomical proportions.

13
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,668
这里看出去一切良好
Everything looks good from here.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,587
OK 收到
Okay, we copy that.

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,258
一旦人类发现自己并不孤单
When the human race discovers it is not alone...

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,511
那么我们的宇宙兄弟姐妹们都会是什么模样呢？
what will our cosmic brothers and sisters look like?

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,016
为了回答这个问题 主要的天文学家和太空生物学家
To answer this question, leading astronomers and astrobiologists...

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,685
将进化原理和物理学运用于
have applied the principles of evolution and physics...

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:07,066
有可能在宇宙中发现的五种类型的外星世界
to five types of alien worlds likely to be found in the cosmos.

20
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,110
这些是有可能存在的生物
These are the creatures that could be out there.

21
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,619
准备好 来一次星际游猎
Prepare to take an intergalactic safari...

22
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,831
睁大眼睛 来看看“陌生的面孔”
and peer directly into the eyes of " Alien Faces. "

23
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,831

历史频道【中国美满】

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,263
宇宙
The universe...

26
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,615
星际庇护所
an intergalactic sanctuary...

27
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,826
居住着数十亿个星系
of billions of galaxies...

28
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,622
数万亿颗恒星
and trillions of stars.

29
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:13,265
难道它只是死气腾腾的荒芜之地
Could it only be a lifeless, barren wasteland...

30
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,100
到处是伽马射线暴
of gamma-ray bursts...

31
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,894
燃烧的恒星
burning stars...

32
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,357
黑洞？
and black holes?

33
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:32,033
抑或有生命存在于地球以外的宇宙天堂里呢？
Or does life exist beyond Earth in this cosmic paradise?

34
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:39,666
会不会外星人也盯着我们 琢磨着一个古老的问题  -
Do alien faces gaze towards us, pondering the age-old question...

35
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,626
我们孤独吗？
are we alone?

36
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,297
科学家仍然在搜索着我们地球以外生命
Scientists are still searching...

37
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,008
发来的首个信号
for the first signs of life beyond our planet...

38
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,221
但是很多人相信它就在那里 等待着我们去发现
but many are convinced it's out there, waiting for us to find it.

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,726
然而立足地球 要是存在的话 那会是啥模样呢？
But what on Earth, if anything, would it look like?

40
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:05,192
利用地球科学 逻辑学 进化理论的有力结合
With a potent mix of earth science, logic, and the theory of evolution...

41
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,235
计算机图形艺术家已经能够
computer graphic artists are able...

42
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:10,280
拿出某些外星生命的模样
to bring some of these alien faces to life.

43
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:21,875
为了亲眼目睹这些外星人世界
And to come face to face with these extraterrestrial creations...

44
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,337
我们将展开一场梦幻游猎
we will embark on a fantasy safari...

45
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,131
进入宇宙尚未探索的地方
through the unexplored reaches of the universe...

46
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,676
就像是巡游在星际动物园里
like a tourist in an intergalactic zoo.

47
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:39,434
我们的第一站 假设行星 Eronel
Our first stop, the theoretical planet Eronel.

48
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,027
行星 Eronel是一颗年长的行星
The planet Eronel is an odd planet.

49
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,824
首先 它并不是围绕着我们太阳一般的恒星
First of all, it doesn't circle around a star like our Sun.

50
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,661
它围绕着一颗小红矮星
It circles around a little red dwarf.

51
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,162
那些都是些小恒星
These are tiny stars.

52
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:04,000
它们有时会是我们太阳大小的五分之一 六分之一
They're sometimes a fifth, a sixth the size of our Sun.

53
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:08,380
因此 宜居区会非常靠近那颗恒星
So the habitable zone is going to be much closer to that star.

54
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,678
这个宜居区是谜团的关键部分
This habitable zone is a crucial piece of the puzzle...

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,640
了解任何一颗行星上的生命进化的关键
when understanding the evolution of life on any alien planet.

56
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:26,189
一个太阳系里的宜居区就是与恒星的距离
A habitable zone in a solar system is the distance from the star...

57
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,943
在那里 水可以以液态存在于地表
where water can exist as a liquid on the surface.

58
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,445
能从恒星获得足够的热量
It gets enough heat energy from the star...

59
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:35,156
来获得和保留液态水
to have liquid water and stay liquid water.

60
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:40,036
液态水是生命起源的基本元素之一
Liquid water is one of the basic elements for life to begin.

61
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,834
但是在Eronel上 宜居区
But on Eronel, the habitable zone...

62
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:49,045
太靠近这颗熊熊燃烧的气球
is so close to this glowing ball of burning gas...

63
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,966
恒星的引力将Eronel潮汐锁定
the star's gravity causes Eronel to be tidally locked...

64
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,467
极像地球的月球
much like Earth's Moon...

65
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,847
我们始终只能看到月球的一个面
as we only see one side of the lunar surface at all times.

66
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:04,769
这就意味着Eronel的一半始终是白天
This would mean that half of Eronel is constantly in daylight...

67
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,939
而另一半始终是黑夜
and the other half is constantly in darkness.

68
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:13,236
在中间 会有一个200英里宽的区域
In the middle, there would be a 200-mile-wide area...

69
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,656
横跨南北两极
that stretches from the north pole to the south pole...

70
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,659
那里就是永恒的曙光
which is in a constant state of twilight.

71
00:05:19,702 --> 00:05:21,703
因此就会让你琢磨
So it makes you wonder...

72
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:23,997
在这颗行星上 哪里可以发现生命呢？
where would we find life on this planet?

73
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,751
实话实说 你会发现它到处都是
Well, truthfully, you're going to find it everywhere.

74
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,170
但是如果它是在黑暗面
But if it's on the dark side...

75
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:33,381
生命就已经适应居住在黑暗里了
it's life that's been adapted for living in the dark.

76
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,133
如果是在明亮面
And if it's on the bright side...

77
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:39,262
生命就已经适应就居住在明亮里了
it's life that's been adapted for living only in the bright side.

78
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,473
而在这个曙光区
And in this twilight zone area...

79
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:45,101
你会发现两者都适应的生物了
you're going to find creatures that are adapted for both.

80
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,980
它们可以在这个世界的两边自由来去
They can wander and stray into both sides on this world.

81
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,691
它们真的把握了自己的命运
They really control their own destinies...

82
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,444
去想去的地方 去想捕食的地方
in where they want to go and where they want to hunt.

83
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:59,282
在Eronel上 你会看到有光合有机物
On Eronel, you're going to have a photosynthetic organism...

84
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,201
或许 有可能在海洋环境中
probably, likely in the marine environment...

85
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,744
红藻或细菌
a red alga or a bacteria...

86
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,622
可能适应了摄取红外线
that will be adapted to taking in infrared light...

87
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,250
摄取可以摄取的能量来充当食物
and taking what energy it can out of that and making food.

88
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,545
在陆地上 它或许会成为地衣之类的东西 因为天冷  -
On land, it would probably be a lichen-like thing because it's cold--

89
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,464
苔藓将会适应的
mosses that would be adapted that way.

90
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,925
你将看到以这些为食的生物
You're going to have organisms that are going to feed off those.

91
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:24,307
Eronel上的这种藻类代表了一个很长食物链的底部
This algae on Eronel represents the bottom of a very long food chain.

92
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,102
所有东西为了生存都扮演着重要的角色
Everything plays a vital role for survival...

93
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:30,939
从植物到更大 更复杂的生物
from the plant life to the larger, more complex creatures.

94
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:35,777
在Eronel上利用这种藻类作为食物来源的一个例子
One example on Eronel that uses this algae as a food source...

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,488
就是叫做achom的昆虫
is the insect known as an achom.

96
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:43,618
achom是一种奇怪的小生物
The achoms are a bizarre little creature.

97
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:49,207
在地球上 我们知道有所谓的形态变化
On Earth, we know of what we call metamorphosis.

98
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,712
就是生物从一种形态变成另一种形态的奇怪的能力
It's the odd ability of a creature to change from one shape to another.

99
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,831
我们看到变成蝴蝶
We see it in butterflies.

100
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,750
毛毛虫 在你花园里蚕食
A caterpillar, eating in your garden...

101
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,836
爬上围墙 作茧自缚
will climb up on the fence, spin a cocoon...

102
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,547
几个月后 破茧变成蝴蝶
months later, hatch out into a butterfly.

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,385
这些虫子也是这样 但是方法非常奇特
These do that, too, but they do it in a very odd way.

104
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,594
它们看上去活像鳗鱼
They look almost eel-like...

105
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,181
两排鳍分列两侧
with two sets of fins that stick out on either side.

106
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,266
在某些特殊的时候
At some peculiar moment...

107
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,062
它们爬上植物 固定在上面
they move over to some of the plant life lock themselves in...

108
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,107
依附在上面 外面形成一个壳
and attach themselves and form a shell around them.

109
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,610
当外壳破裂时
When that shell splits...

110
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,905
出现的东西是我们前所未见的
out comes something that we've never seen before.

111
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,824
攫取水中的氢气
Taking the hydrogen from the water...

112
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,243
分解氢气和氧气
splitting the hydrogen from the oxygen...

113
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,036
充气成一个小气泡
it inflates a little bubble...

114
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,872
它们就升出水面
and they lift right out of the water...

115
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,419
微风吹拂它们 将它们带入高空
the breezes picking them up, carrying them to high altitudes...

116
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,421
把它们散播到星球各地
spreading them out over the planet...

117
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,382
随风飘到曙光区
towards the twilight zones as the breezes move.

118
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,093
它们几乎就像是伞兵从天而降
And they're almost like parachutists coming back down.

119
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,764
一旦achom抵达地面
Once the achoms reach the ground...

120
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,435
它们就立即建造洞穴 作为它们的住所
they immediately create a burrow, where they primarily live.

121
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,479
不过在achom觅食泥土里的垃圾时
But as the achoms scavenge through the dirt for food...

122
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,401
它们又会被食物链的上一层动物从上方捕食
they are hunted from above by one of the next links in the food chain...

123
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,698
那就是peena-pod
the peena-pod.

124
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,869
我们在这个星球上看到的最有趣的动物之一 就是peena-pod
Now, one of the creatures that we'd find most interesting on this world is the peena-pod.

126
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,079
它是一种奇怪的小动物
It's an odd little creature...

127
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,832
因为它的眼睛一直绕道后面
because its eyes wrap all the way around...

128
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,168
所以它可以看到背后的所有动静
so it can see any movement behind it.

129
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,337
在Eronel的曙光区
In the twilight zone of Eronel...

130
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,965
那里会是非常阴冷
it is going to be very dark and cold...

131
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,468
原因就是其母星的光线暗淡
due to the low light of its star...

132
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,970
猎手 甚至被猎者
and the hunters, or even the hunted...

133
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,389
都会发展出猫头鹰一般的大眼睛
will have developed large eyes like owls...

134
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,808
或像地球上的其它夜行性动物
or other nocturnal creatures here on Earth.

135
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,313
不过Eronel上的大多数动物已经发展成
But there is an interesting adaptation...

136
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,940
一个有趣的适应现象
that developed in most creatures on Eronel.

137
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,153
Eronel围绕着M星运转
Eronel orbits an M star.

138
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:53,506
M星发出的光大多数是红外线
M stars emit most of their light in infrared.

139
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:57,302
红外线就是那种光  -
Infrared is the light that--

140
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:01,306
就是你打开烤箱会感到热的光
It's actually heat that you feel when you open up the oven.

141
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,516
那就是这些动物能看见的光
That's what these creatures would see.

142
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:08,188
它们可以看到四周物体所发出的热
They would see the heat expended by their bodies in the world around them.

143
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,399
它看上去完全不同于看你我
It would look very different than it does to you or me.

144
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,736
为了看到星球的黑暗面的热信号
To see heat signatures on the dark side of the planet...

145
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,739
赋予了Eronel上食物链最大的一环  -
gives one of the biggest links on the food chain of Eronel...

146
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:22,160
courga 一个狡诈的优势
the courga, a cunning advantage.

147
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:28,792
在它们的意识 动作 集体行动的方式里
In their sense, in their moves, in the way they act together...

148
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,003
活像是非洲平原上的豺狼
they resemble jackals in the plains of Africa.

149
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,129
它们结队而行
They move in herds.

150
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,506
它们是猎手 它们是掠食者
They're hunters. They're predators.

151
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,511
丑陋而讨厌的动物
Ugly little, nasty creatures...

152
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:42,389
它们会包围一只或一群peena-pod
that will surround a peena-pod or a colony of them...

153
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,808
把它们给揪出来 作为自己的大餐
ferret them out, and that's their meal.

154
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,187
它们具有与众不同的能力 不管怎样
They have the odd ability, however...

155
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,272
不仅能在曙光区里看到东西
to see not only in the twilight regions...

156
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,650
用我们普通人一样的眼睛
with eyes like we might normally have...

157
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,903
而且它们在上方还有第二双小眼睛
but they have a second set of smaller eyes right above...

158
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,572
一旦它们进入黑暗区
that, once they move into the darker regions...

159
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:01,074
就是黑暗面
the nighttime side...

160
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:05,036
它们就可以逮住那个区域里的动物的热信号
they can now pick up the heat signatures of creatures in that area.

161
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:11,418
这些只是可能生活在Eronel之类的星球上的少数动物
These are only a few of the creatures that could live on a planet like Eronel...

162
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,669
然而 至少在眼下
but, at least for now...

163
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,172
它们只是我们想象的产物
they are simply a product of our imagination.

164
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,219
在科学上 我们可以坐在这里
In science, we can sit there...

165
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,805
想象其他地方的生命
and we can imagine life elsewhere.

166
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:30,520
但是要我们举例子 拿出数据点 事实上
But if we have examples, we have one data point, in fact...

167
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,896
也就是地球上的
and that's planet Earth.

168
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,109
因此 要是我们可以观察地球上的生命
And so, if we can look at life on Earth...

169
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,821
地球给了我们大量惊人的信息
it provides us with an amazing wealth of information...

170
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:43,450
那么我们就可以循迹找到别处的生命
that we can then take forward to look for life elsewhere.

171
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,664
我们有各种生态系统供我们研究
We have a variety of ecosystems that we can study...

172
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,041
我们可以审视其中的挑战
and we can look at the challenges.

173
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:57,464
生态系统里有些什么？ 生命会面临那些挑战？
What are in ecosystems? What challenges do living things face?

175
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:02,260
我们可以将这些原理用到外星生命上
And we can apply these principles to alien life.

176
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,971
为了了解如何去运用这些原理
To understand how these principles can be applied...

177
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:09,267
我们必须继续我们的星际野生动物游猎
we must continue our intergalactic fantasy safari.

178
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,980
我们离开了Eronel
We leave the surface of Eronel...

179
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:18,443
急速穿越宇宙322光年
and zip across the cosmos 322 light-years away...

180
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:21,321
来到一个新太阳系
to a new solar system...

181
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:25,325
一个假想的行星AG-143
and the theoretical planet AG-143.

182
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:34,167
AG-143比地球大 比地球大很多
AG-143 is bigger than the Earth, much bigger than the Earth.

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,838
它有一个美丽的环系统围绕着它
It has a beautiful ring system that circles around it.

184
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:43,218
然而更重要的是它是一个巨大的干旱荒漠之地
But more importantly, it is a big, gigantic dry desert...

185
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,724
其引力场是我们地球的三倍
with three times the gravitational field that we feel here on the Earth.

186
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,729
一个人 在地球上重175磅的话
A human, weighing in at 175 pounds on Earth...

187
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:57,732
站在AG-143的地表
would step off onto the surface of AG-143...

188
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,985
就会重达525磅
to weigh about 525 pounds.

189
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,113
毫无疑问 生命也必须适应
Certainly, life would need to adapt.

190
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,407
但如何适应呢？
But how?

191
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,915
哈佛大学天体物理中心的大卫 阿吉拉
David Aguilar of Harvard University's Center for Astrophysics...

192
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,337
认为想象复杂的外星生命形式适应的最佳方法
believes the best way to envision the adaptations of complex alienðÞlife forms...

193
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,714
就是通过观察各种生物
is by looking at the variety of creatures...

194
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:26,094
它们已经进化到了栖息在我们地球上各种生态系统中了
that have evolved to inhabit the diverse ecosystems of our own world.

195
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,806
我们来到了北卡罗来纳动物园
We're here at the North Carolina Zoo...

196
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,184
因为目前在国内所有的动物园里
because, of all the zoos in the country right now...

197
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,019
这个是非常特殊的
this is very special.

198
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,231
它规模大
It is large.

199
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,275
占地大
It's big.

200
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:46,948
这里的环境重现了我们地球的各种环境
And the environments here duplicate the different environments we find on our planet.

201
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:52,579
今天这里是我们星球上生命多样性的绝妙例子
This here today is a marvelous example of the variety of life on our planet.

202
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:58,167
在地球生命多样性里面 吉拉尔认为
And within this variety of life on Earth, Aguilar believes...

203
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,129
支撑极其沉重结构的这些动物
that creatures supporting an extremely heavy structure...

204
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:07,468
成为了了解AG-143进化的理想模型
become the perfect model for understanding evolution on AG-143.

205
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,222
我们所说的适应了一个沉重世界环境的动物
When we talk about an animal adapted for a heavy-world environment...

206
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:13,808
就是这个世界重力较大 就是它
a world with more gravity, this is it.

207
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,059
来看看我们在这里看到的
Look at what we have out here...

208
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:18,771
这原型的腿可以支撑庞大的身躯
the prototype legs that can suspend a huge body.

209
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,565
当然我们可以将它放低
Of course, we would have to move him down...

210
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,483
使其更接近地面
move him closer to the ground.

211
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,319
但是这就是我们所见到的理想状态：
But this is perfect what we would see:

212
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:27,447
矮壮敦实 不过这样的重量
Shorter, squattier, but heavy like this...

213
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:30,950
适应了一个重力较大的星球
adapted to a planet with much stronger gravity.

214
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:40,585
尽管AG-143的生命形式肯定具有地球生物类似的特征
Although life forms on AG-143 have certain comparable characteristics to creatures on Earth...

215
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,964
但是它们的陌生模样是我们星球上根本看不到的
their alien faces are beyond anything found on our planet.

216
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,977
看出去一切良好
Everything looks good from here.

217
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,228
OK 收到
Okay. We copy that.

218
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,772
声音良好
Sounds good.

219
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:02,815
恭候大驾
We wish we were with you.

220
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:09,072
要是有朝一日 深太空探测发现了太阳系外的生命
What if, one day, a deep space probe...

221
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,367
又当如何呢？
detects life outside our solar system?

222
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,791
外星人会是啥模样呢？
What would an alien look like?

223
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,045
为了更好地了解这些异界生物
To better understand these otherworldly creatures...

224
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,089
以及它们是如何进化的
and how they might have evolved...

225
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,258
科学家认为你必须首先了解
scientists believe you must first understand...

226
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:34,097
有关生命诞生的物理环境的一些简单概念
a few simple concepts about the physical environments where life might begin.

227
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,394
在你关注遥远恒星周围的行星时
When looking at planets around distant stars...

228
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:44,232
有两个因素是我们科学家所瞄准的
there are two factors that we scientists zero in on.

229
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,694
首先是与母星的距离
First is distance to the mother star.

230
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,238
这决定了你获取能量的多少
That determines how much energy you have...

231
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,074
是否有液态水
and whether or not you have liquid water.

232
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,494
其次 质量
Second, the mass...

233
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,998
行星的大小
the size of the planet.

234
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,709
这决定着重力
That determines gravity...

235
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,420
以及你可能会看到何种生物
and what kind of organisms you may have.

236
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:09,048
在人们思考进化生物学时
When people think about evolutionary biology...

237
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,260
我们往往认为整个自然界充满了腥风血雨
we tend to think of the whole nature red in tooth and claw,

238
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:17,223
生物间 物种间等等充满了达尔文主义的竞争
the whole Darwinian competition among organisms and among species and so on...

239
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:20,977
我们忽视了就是物理环境塑造了生命
that we forget that it's the physical environment that really shapes life.

240
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:26,524
你所看得的何种重力 何种温度 何种压力
What gravity you have what temperature, what pressure...

241
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:31,112
何种大气成分取决于是否存在着大气层 等等
what composition the atmosphere is if there is any atmosphere, and so on.

242
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:37,744
物理定律并未因你穿行宇宙而改变
The laws of physics don't change as you travel through the universe...

243
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:41,622
因此了解我们地球环境中的生物进化
so understanding how creatures evolved in our Earthly environment...

244
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:43,416
已经让科学家去想象
has allowed scientists to imagine...

245
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,794
假设行星AG-143之类的其它星球上
what life forms might arise on other types of worlds...

246
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,174
有可能出现的生命形式
like the theoretical planet AG-143.

247
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,598
AG-143围绕着明亮的F级恒星运转
AG-143 orbits a bright F-class star.

248
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:03,227
这个世界只有10%的地表覆盖着地表水
Only ten percent of this world is covered with surface water.

249
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,646
集中在沙漠之下的水囊里
And pockets of this liquid H2O...

250
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:08,357
里面收集了稀少的降雨
collect under the sands from the sparse rainfall.

251
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:13,946
AG-143的环境炎热干旱
The environment on AG-143 is hot, arid...

252
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,449
阳光极其耀眼
and the sunshine extremely bright.

253
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:21,913
因为那颗恒星是F级恒星 所以
Now, because the star is an F-class star, okay...

254
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,122
比太阳更亮
which is brighter than the Sun...

255
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:26,000
你会接受到紫外线
you're going to have a UV output, ultraviolet light output.

256
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,711
因此那里的生物
So, the organisms there...

257
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,963
将不得不以某种方式来保护
are going to have to somehow be shielded...

258
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:34,383
不是大气层就是它们自己的遮蔽物
either in the atmosphere or in their own coverings.

259
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,638
这些遮蔽物可能是厚厚的壳
These coverings may be in the form of thick shells...

260
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,226
或其它外衣 来吸收强烈的紫外线辐射
or other exteriors that would absorb the harsh UV radiation.

261
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,311
但是AG-143上的生物
But the creatures on AG-143...

262
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,147
也会进化出其它身体特性
would also develop other physical characteristics...

263
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,191
是那个世界特有的
that are unique to this world.

264
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,819
这真是有趣的想象
It's really interesting to imagine...

265
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:55,947
生命可能会喜欢上高重力的行星
what life might be like on a planet with higher gravity.

266
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,494
从微生物的角度出发
Well, from a microbe's point of view...

267
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,122
可能不会有很大的差异
there might not be a whole lot of difference.

268
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:06,290
所产生的差异
Where the differences would start to come...

269
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,460
就是你一旦登陆上去 举个例子
is when you go out and land, for example...

270
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:13,548
你就不得不为站立而烦恼
and there you have to worry about standing up.

271
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,717
噢 该死的重力 我只是  -
Oh, darn gravity, you know, I just--

272
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,686
我只是无法站立起来
I just can't pull myself up.

273
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,932
然而强大重力的另一个副作用
But another byproduct of strong gravity...

274
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:28,896
有可能让AG-143上的山丘具有难以置信的地貌特征
may also give rise to an unlikely cast of characters on the surface of AG-143...

275
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:33,234
更确切说  是略高于地表
or rather, slightly above the surface.

276
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:40,032
地球上 我们的大气是79%的氮气
On Earth, our atmosphere is 79 percent nitrogen...

277
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,870
20%的氧气 1%的其他气体
twenty percent oxygen, and one percent other gases...

278
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:47,748
如此安排是因为地球的重力
that is held in place due to the gravitational pull of the Earth.

279
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,420
但是在AG-143之类的行星上
But on a planet like AG-143...

280
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:55,965
较强的重力会吸引住更为稠密的大气
the stronger gravity would hold a much thicker atmosphere...

281
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,009
完全适合飞行
perfect for achieving flight.

282
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:01,847
它也有可能吸引住很高比例的氧气
It may also hold a much higher level of oxygen.

282
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,225
我们在2亿年前经历过一个时期
We went through a period a couple of hundred million years ago...

283
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:11,230
那时 我们认为地球有过一个氧气含量较高的时期
where we think the Earth had a higher concentration of oxygen for a while.

284
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:13,524
我们从化石记录中看到过
And what we see in the fossil record...

285
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:19,071
大型昆虫 大型翅膀 大型飞行生物
is giant insects, huge wings, giant flying organisms.

286
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:20,281
因为只要你想一想
Because if you think about it...

287
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:22,575
你要有更多的氧来代谢
you have more oxygen for metabolism...

288
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,744
因此你做事要用上更多的能量
so you can do things with more energy.

289
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:29,040
那就像是用氧气瓶之类的东西吸高压氧
It's like taking in higher oxygen with an oxygen tank or something.

290
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,541
你感觉整个上气不接下气
You feel all pumped up...

291
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,377
那就是这些生物必定的感觉
and that's how these organisms must have felt.

292
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,175
由于稠密的大气和高浓度的氧
With a thicker atmosphere and higher concentration of oxygen...

293
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,888
AG-143的空中遍布大型飞行动物
the skies of AG-143 would be full of large flying creatures...

294
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:47,308
随心所欲长时间呆在空中
that could stay airborne for as long as they need.

295
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,562
一个例子可能是sargan
One example could be the sargan.

296
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:54,690
这种动物可能大半辈子都翱翔在空中
This creature would live most of its life...

297
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,695
寻找着这颗行星上零散分布的水源
soaring through the atmosphere, looking for pockets of water that scarcely pepper the planet.

298
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,532
一旦sargan找到了出水孔
Once the sargan finds a watering hole...

299
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,494
它们会扑向水坑 不仅是饮水
they swoop down in hopes to not only drink...

300
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:10,706
还要捕猎那些找到通向绿洲之路的动物
but hunt any creatures that may have found their way to the oasis...

301
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,126
如moblant之类的动物
a creature like the moblant.

302
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,423
乍一看 你几乎会把moblant当作海星
At first sight, you might almost mistake a moblant for a starfish.

303
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,843
它有短而粗的手臂用来穿越沙漠
It has stubby little arms that it moves across the desert.

304
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,637
然而关于这些手臂的怪事是
But the odd thing about these arms...

305
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,473
它们具有很长的触须来探测沙子里
is they have long tentacles that probe the sand...

306
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:30,351
可能隐藏的宝贵的水囊
for pockets of precious water that may be hidden.

307
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:32,270
这种生物的怪异之处
And the odd thing about this creature...

308
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,648
是一旦它找到一个好大好大的水囊
is if it finds a large, large pocket of water...

309
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,862
就会把水抽上来 就像抽水井那样
it begins pulling the water up like it's pulling it up a well...

310
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:44,740
它会一点一点增大
and it grows in size, and it grows in size...

311
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,785
把水储存起来 宛如骆驼那样
and stores the water up like a camel does.

312
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:54,375
适应了找到和储存水是生存的关键
Adaptations to locate and store water are crucial for survival.

313
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,837
要坚持在沙漠里
To be stuck out in the middle of a desert...

314
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:01,465
距离貌似有水源的数百英里范围
hundreds of miles from anything resembling a liquid...

315
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,885
将会是几乎所有地球生物的葬身之地
would be a death sentence for almost any Earth creature.

316
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:12,852
对于我们假设行星AG-143上的生命 情况也是大同小异
The same would be true for life on our theoretical planet AG-143.

317
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:18,774
这就是为何pholis的活动主要是在地下水附近
This is why the pholis lives primarily near the water deposits...

318
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:23,029
这样它就尽可能靠近在这宝贵的东西
so that it will remain close to this precious commodity.

319
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,411
AG-143上最怪异的生物之一就是pholis
One of the most bizarre creatures on AG-143 is the pholis.

320
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,121
它们短小精悍
They're short, squatty.

321
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,416
它是三条腿支撑一只嘴巴
It's a mouth supported by three legs...

322
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:39,420
下面的基座靠鳞片在地面攀爬
on a pedestal platform that has scales underneath.

323
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:43,591
它在沙子上滑行 宛如响尾蛇
It glides across tðÞe sand almost like a sidewinder as it moves.

324
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,469
它具有感觉化学物质的超凡能力
It has the uncanny ability to sense chemically...

325
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,512
不管其猎物在不在附近
whether or not its prey is nearby.

326
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:54,810
它在溪流或小湖泊周围捕食
It hunts around the edges of streams and small, little lakes.

327
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:59,315
它一旦发现猎物 会突然停下不动
And if it finds its prey, it suddenly stops, freezes...

328
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:04,028
伪装自己 这样它几乎就变得分辨不出了 耐心等待
and camouflages itself so that it almost becomes invisible, waiting...

329
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,491
直到不行的生物过来
until a hapless creature moves...

330
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,701
然后突然之间 将其抓获
and then, suddenly, out it snaps.

331
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,914
它得到了自己的晚餐
It's found its dinner.

332
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,211
pholis的移动方式
And the pholis' method of movement...

333
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,589
在地面上滑动好像草地上的蛇
gliding across the surface like a snake on grass...

334
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,841
是另一种进化特征
is another evolutionary characteristic...

335
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,552
肇因就是这颗行星较强的重力
caused by the stronger gravity of the planet.

336
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,140
用鳞片爬行 而不是用腿
To slide with scales, rather than lifting a leg...

337
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,851
会比其它动物来的便当得多
would be a lot easier for any creature.

338
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:41,816
这提供的优势是其猎物远比不上的
That, and it offers a quiet advantage over its prey.

339
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,276
它们可能永远都觉察不到pholis的逼近
They may never hear the pholis coming.

340
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:51,826
但是作为AG-143食物链的一员 没有什么是高枕无忧的
But as the food chain goes on AG-143,nothing is safe.

341
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,792
潜伏在这些水池里是一种无声而致命的动物
For lurking in these pools of water lies a silent but deadly creature...

342
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,877
叫做heathor
known as the heathor.

343
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:07,133
在我们行将结束对AG-143的食物链考察时
As we end our examination of the food chain on AG-143...

344
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,927
我们看到了极端的挑战
we've seen the extreme challenges...

345
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,763
那里的生物对很少的地表水
that creatures on a world with little surface water...

346
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
和较强的重力必定要去克服
and higher gravity must overcome.

347
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,771
但要是行星的条件倒过来呢？
But what if the planetary conditions were reversed?

348
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:23,941
要是星球上对于生命来说有适量的水
What if a planet had a suitable amount of water for life...

349
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:28,571
但同时重力又很弱呢？
but also a much weaker gravitational force?

350
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,282
答案或许就在我们头顶上
The answer might lie right above our heads...

351
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,451
在地球的上空
in the skies above the Earth.

352
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,498
在我们的星际游猎中
On our intergalactic safari...

353
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,792
我们看到了主要的太空生物学家
we've seen how leading astrobiologists...

354
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,628
利用当今的地球科学来假设
used present-day earth science to hypothesize...

355
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:48,174
假想世界里的生物的大小 形状和行为
about the size, shape, and behavior of creatures...

356
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:52,219
那里的重力要比地球强得多
on an imaginary world with much stronger gravity than Earth.

357
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:01,187
但是如果重力弱很多 情况又当如何呢？
But what would happen if the gravity was much weaker?

358
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:06,192
为了找到答案 我们离开强重力的AG-143
To find out, we lift off from the strong gravity of AG-143...

359
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:12,406
前往89光年外的另一颗行星GP-C 925
to another planet 89 light-years away, GP-C 925.

360
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:19,205
GP-C 925比地球小
GP-C 925 is smaller than the Earth.

361
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,373
它是地球大小的一半
It's about half the size of the Earth.

362
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,585
它是地球类行星的分水岭
It's borderline for an Earth-like planet.

363
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:27,296
因为它较小 所以重力也弱
And because it's smaller, it has less gravity.

364
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:34,136
它所围绕的恒星温度要比太阳低
The star that it circles around is cooler than our Sun.

365
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,016
正因为如此 在冰冻区域  -
And because of that, it's a cross between frozen ice patches...

366
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,894
绿色光合植物探头的地方
green photosynthetic plants peeking through...

367
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,021
和水体之间有个交叉
and some bodies of water.

368
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,941
这里看上去极像我们地球的北部
It would look very much like the northern part of our planet...

369
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:50,194
靠近加拿大和格林兰的北部
you get up towards the northern parts of Canada and Greenland.

370
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:52,238
我们管那里叫针叶林地区
WðÞ call it the taiga areas.

371
00:23:55,116 --> 00:24:00,287
GP-C 925有一个非常特殊的环境
GP-C 925 would be a very specific type of environment.

372
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,248
你在这个星球上看不到沙漠
You wouldn't find deserts on this world.

373
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,125
实际上 你在这个星球上很少能看到山脉
You'd find very few mountains, actually, on this world.

374
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:08,087
这是个非常寒冷的世界
It would be a world that was cooler...

375
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:11,507
保存要易于我们自己的星球
more preserved than what we see on our own planet...

376
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,760
但是美景却无二致
but beautiful just the same.

377
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,722
这个星球 由于重力要小得多
This world, with much lower gravity...

378
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:22,643
就会产生更大 更优美的生命形式
could generate much larger, more elegant life forms.

379
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:23,769
我身高6英尺6英寸
Now, I'm 6' 6 ".

380
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,365
想象一下 我在只有一半或三分之一重力的世界里
Imagine how tall I could be if I had evolved in a world with a half or a third the gravity.

381
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,409
身高会有多少
Imagine what a redwood would look like...

382
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:31,452
想象一下 红杉在低重力世界里会是什么样子
in a world with lower gravity.

383
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,743
作用于地表生命的此类重力效应
These types of gravitational effects on the surface life...

384
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:43,163
将会塑造出不同的特色
would shape and model different characteristics.

385
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:47,084
这也会反映在GP-C 925之类的星球上
It would also appear that on a world like GP-C 925...

386
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:54,174
很大程度上 地表生命根本就不会在地表发现
much of that surface life would not be found on the surface at all.

387
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,225
我们现在是在鸟笼里
Here we are in the aviary.

388
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:07,605
高踞这些树上的是恐龙的残余
Up in these trees are the remnants of the dinosaurs.

389
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,733
那就是恐龙消亡后留下的
This was what was left behind when the dinosaurs passed on.

390
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,485
这些鸟注定是高飞的
These birds are meant to fly.

391
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:17,489
它们的骨骼是空的 它们的羽毛紧贴在一起
Their bones are hollow, their feathers locked together.

392
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:20,117
这些鸟注定要统治天空
These birds were meant to rule the skies.

393
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,496
但是在低重力星球上
But on a low-gravity planet...

394
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,125
这就是你会见到的统治天空的东西
this is what you would see that would rule the planet.

395
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:33,172
因为重力将变得较轻 飞翔将变得非常容易
Because gravity is going to be light, flight is going to be very easy.

396
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:40,554
飞翔将会像地球上一些生物各显神通的家常便饭
And flight is something that's been done on Earth by a number of organisms in different ways.

397
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:43,390
蝙蝠张开它们脚趾之间的膜
Bats stretch membranes between their fingers...

398
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,018
变成翅膀来飞翔
and create wings to fly.

399
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,687
飞鼠展开它们的皮襟翼
Flying squirrels put flaps out of their fur...

400
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,356
一路滑行
and glide that way.

401
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,985
然而并非GP-C 925上的一切
But not everything on GP-C 925...

402
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:57,029
都类似于地球上的生物
is comparable to creatures on Earth.

403
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:04,244
能够想象出来的最奇怪的飞行生物
The strangest of the airborne creatures one could imagine...

404
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,163
是lollygar
are the lollygars.

405
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:11,418
想象中的漂浮的囊袋几乎就像是充足气的肺囊
Imagine floating sacs that almost look like inflated lungs...

406
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:17,216
有很长很长的触须下垂
with long, long, long tentacles hanging down...

407
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:22,638
在背景中缓慢漂浮时 一直垂落到地面
that drape along the countryside as they slowly move and float over the scenery.

408
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:28,352
靠内部加热 温暖的气体将其囊袋膨胀
Heated by internal heat inside, the warm air inflates their sacs.

409
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:31,397
它们看上去几乎就像是水母 漂浮在空中
They almost look like jellyfish, floating through the air.

410
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:39,029
和水母一般 它们蛰刺捕食面前来不及躲避的一切东西
And like jellyfish, they sting and grab anything that scurries over the ground in front of them.

411
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,824
来看一下它们随风飘荡
To see them moving, bobbing up and down in the wind...

412
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,828
就像一群迷幻水母那样
like a herd of psychedelic jellyfish...

413
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,372
是我们难以想象的
is something beyond what we can imagine.

414
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,583
而在这里 那是再平常不过的事情了
And yet hðÞre, it's quite common.

415
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,671
即使身临其境
Even life on the ground...

416
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:59,216
也会超越我们已知科学的极限
would push the limits of science as we know it.

417
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,512
我们观察这个世界时 不妨来考量一下这些swaystack
When we take a look at this world, think of the swaystacks.

418
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,931
它们看上去好像有长长的主茎
They look like they're long stalks...

419
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:09,643
伸向15、20、30英尺高的空中
that extend 15,20,30 feet into the air...

420
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:12,771
好多个在其顶端有一个灯泡
numerous ones coming up with a bulb on the end.

421
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:14,773
它们在风中摇摆
They sway in the wind.

422
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,735
然而惊奇的是它们并非植物
But what's amazing is these aren't plants.

423
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:22,072
它们是有根的动物 让其生根 缓缓走过星球表面
These are animals with roots that pick up and slowly move...

424
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:27,661
并将自己拴住 在风中飘荡
across the planet surface and anchor themselves back down swaying in the wind...

425
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:30,789
等候着靠近的动物
where they wait for any creature that happens by.

426
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:35,586
对于靠近的动物 其顶端像小飞盘那样
As a creature moves by, the top of them, like little Frisbees...

427
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:38,213
快速刺入它的身子
shoot off and wedge into the side of the creature...

428
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,842
刺入它们的腿 甲壳 毛发
into their leg, into their carapace, into their hair...

429
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:43,761
瞬间致命
stuck for the moment.

430
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:47,806
一旦移动到新的地方 它们会降落
As they move on, they reach a new area, they drop off...

431
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,309
开始新一轮生长
and they begin growing all over again.

432
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,227
它们只是利用这些飞在空中的这些小飞碟
They're simply spreading their seeds...

433
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,147
来散布种子
with these tiny little disks flying through the air...

434
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,357
前提是它们觉察到有东西经过
once they sense something moving by.

435
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:02,446
在这个星球上 我们看到类似的情况
On this planet, we see similar things...

436
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,491
植物和杂草生长在一起
with the plants and the weeds that grow here...

437
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,493
但是并不妨碍它的个头和范围
but nothing to this size and extent...

438
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:10,788
我们的概念会把握不定
and the idea that we begin crossing plants...

439
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,083
究竟是类似动物的植物呢还是类似植物的动物  -
that look like animals and animals that look like plants--

440
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,212
这的确是个怪异的世界
this is a bizarre world indeed.

441
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:21,507
swaystack和lollygar之类的生物
Creatures like the swaystacks and the lollygars...

442
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,886
在GP-C 925 将会享用到充分的水量
would enjoy an adequate amount of water on GP-C 925.

443
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,181
但是在一个有着更多水的 好多水的世界
But what would happen on a world...

444
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:36,313
情况又当如何呢？
where there was even more water a lot more?

445
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:40,526
尤其是 在没有任何陆地的星球
Specifically, a planet with no land whatsoever...

446
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:42,444
一个水世界上呢？
a water world?

447
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,796
打我们开始星际游猎开始
Since we embarked on our intergalactic safari...

448
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,717
我们已经看到了Eronel星上achom 惊人的生命周期
we have seen the amazing lifecycle of the achom on Eronel...

449
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,513
AG-143星上模样怪异的pholis
the bizarre-looking pholis on AG-143...

450
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:13,308
以及GP-C 925星上漂浮的lollygar
and the floating lollygars of GP-C 925.

451
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,356
所有这些假象世界里的这些假设生命形式
All of these theoretical life forms on these imaginary worlds...

452
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:24,736
都是科学家所创造的 根据是地球生命进化的知识
have been created by scientists, based on knowledge about the development of life on Earth.

453
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:30,284
然而这些生物又是如何诞生于
But how would these creatures have gotten their start...

454
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,120
这些奇怪 遥远的行星的呢？
on these strange, far-flung planets?

455
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,584
我们知道产生生命的必要条件
The requirements that we know have to be there for life...

456
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,211
就是根据我们所知的生命
is based on the life that we know...

457
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:46,091
我们所了解的导致生命的起源及演化的化学
and the chemistry that we think leads to the origin and evolution of life...

458
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:50,053
就是含水或水溶液里的碳化学
is carbon chemistry in aqueous or water solution.

459
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:55,183
我们需要有氮
and we need nitrogen.

460
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:59,021
你需要某种能量
And you need some sort of energy...

461
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:04,151
因为生命 即使是微生物 都需要食物
'cause life, even microbes, needs food.

462
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,069
它们必须要有某种代谢
They've got to have some sort of metabolism...

463
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,113
因此你需要有某种能源
so you need some source of energy.

464
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,448
阳光作用相当有效
Sunlight works pretty well...

465
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,867
但是它并非唯一的能源 即使是在地球上
but it isn't the only source of energy, even on Earth.

466
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:25,464
数百年来 科学家认为阳光是生命能量的唯一来源
For hundreds of years, scientists believed that sunlight was the only energy source for life.

467
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,221
但是在过去几十年里
But within the past few decades...

468
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,350
新的发现表明他们错了
new findings showed they were wrong.

469
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:46,818
在海底热水口附近所见的热水温度
Boiling water temperatures found around hydrothermal vents on the seafloor...

470
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,489
曾被认为是与生命格格不入的
were once believed to be incompatible with life.

471
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,703
但是最近科学家已经发现
But, recently, scientists have discovered...

472
00:30:56,746 --> 00:31:03,126
这些黑烟囱周围的区域完全适合水下种群的繁荣
the areas around these black smokers are perfectly suitable for a flourishing underwater community.

473
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,511
取代了太阳 这些生物的能量
Instead of the Sun, these creatures take their energy...

474
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:16,473
取自这些出水口的高温 气体和矿物质
from the heat, gases, and minerals spewing from the vents.

475
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,521
这些高度顽强的生命形式就是所谓的嗜极生物
These highly tenacious life forms are known as extremophiles.

476
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:25,440
这些极端的嗜极生物拓展了我们的认识
The existence of extremophiles broadens our aspects...

477
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:30,028
即认为生物能做什么和了解生物能做什么
of what we think organisms can do and what we know organisms can do.

478
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,532
换句话说 如果你观察所有不同种类的环境
In other words, if you look at all of the different kinds of environments...

479
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:35,033
我们就会发现在地球上
that we find here on Earth...

480
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,869
其范围会从极冷到极热
it ranges from extremely cold to extremely hot...

481
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:42,541
到酸 到碱 几乎到你所能想到所有状况
to acid, to alkaline just about anything you can think of.

482
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,127
几乎在任何地方 你都能发现生命
And just about everywhere, you find life.

483
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:49,131
整个地球都能发现生命的事实
The fact that life is found at all on Earth...

484
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:53,301
很大程度上要归功于我们在太阳系里的位置
is due in large part to our position in the solar system.

485
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,220
我们科学家曾经认为
We scientists used to believe...

486
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,889
为了让生命出现在一个行星上
that in order to get life off the ground on a planet...

487
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,226
它必须是距离太阳的宜居区
it has to be in the Goldilocks zone of the Sun...

488
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,771
不能太近 因为水会沸腾
not too close because water will boil...

489
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,399
不能太远 因为水会冰冻
not too far because water will freeze...

490
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,694
而是要恰到好处 有液态海洋
but just right to have a liquid ocean...

491
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,321
在其中DNA可以形成
out of which DNA can form.

492
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,408
啊 那种情景我们现在知道是错误的
Well, that picture we now know is wrong.

493
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:21,246
我们现在认为 即使是在木星这样的行星的冰冻卫星上
We now believe that even on icy moons of planets like Jupiter...

494
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:24,291
都可能有生命出现
it is possible to get life off the ground.

495
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,837
木卫二是木星的卫星
Europa is a moon of Jupiter.

496
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,213
它被冰包得严严实实
It's covered in ice.

497
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:36,178
但是在冰层下面 似乎有一个巨大的海洋
But beneath the ice, there is apparently a gigantic ocean...

498
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,807
或许在数十亿年里 一直就存在着液态水
perhaps stable for billions of years, containing liquid water.

499
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,024
因此这就让物理学家等不知所措
And so that sent the physicists and so on scrambling.

500
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,843
你怎么会在如此远离太阳的地方 获得液态水的呢？
How could you end up with liquid water so far away from the Sun?

503
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:56,573
现在 事实证明 这个概念是
Now, what it turns out, the idea is...

504
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:58,950
存在着所谓的潮汐可挠性
is that there's something called tidal flexing.

505
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,372
对于木卫二来说 潮汐可挠性的肇因是其巨大的个头
For Europa, tidal flexing is caused by the immense size...

506
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,792
以及木星的引力
and gravitational pull of Jupiter...

507
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:11,880
引起了卫星上的冰拉伸 产生了热量
which causes the ice on the moon to pull and stretch, generating heat.

508
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:18,136
一旦下面的冰层得到足够的热量
Once the insulated lower layers get warm enough...

509
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,139
冰就会融化 变成海洋
the ice will melt, creating oceans.

510
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,896
现在加入被认为可以在木卫二上生存的生物种群
Now add the types of organic compounds that are believed to exist on Europa...

511
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,484
你只需稍加改进 但又是对生命非常现实的手段
and you've got a slightly altered, but very realistic recipe for life.

512
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:38,740
这就把我们带去了星际游猎的下一站
This brings us to our next stop in our intergalactic safari.

513
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:47,666
我们离开GP-C 925背后热闹的星空后
As we leave the busy skies of GP-C 925 behind...

514
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,793
我们走过72光年
we can travel 72 light-years...

515
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,713
来到一颗假想的气体巨星 叫做Yeneer g  -
to a theoretical gas giant known as Yeneer g...

516
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:58,051
有着8颗卫星的行星
a planet circled by eight moons.

517
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,805
通常 我们不会理会Yeneer g
Normally, we wouldn't bother with Yeneer g.

518
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,098
它是颗气体巨星
lt's a gas giant...

519
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,101
我们不认为生命会存在于这些星球上
and we don't think life could exist on these worlds.

520
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,856
我们感兴趣的星球是其卫星Aner'bas
The world we're interested in is the moon Aner'bas.

521
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,192
其大小是水星的两倍
It's about twice the size of Mercury.

522
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:18,738
它是个非常类似于围绕木星的木卫二的星球
It's a world very similar to the moon Europa that circles around Jupiter.

523
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:24,035
想象一下 一个行星覆盖了海洋
Imagine a planet covered with oceans...

524
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:26,788
在其表面 有冰 大量的冰
and on the surface, ice, a lot of ice...

525
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,207
把一切都锁定在里面
that locks everything inside.

526
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,002
这个星球上没有踏足之地
There's no ground to walk on this planet.

527
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:35,380
然而就在这些海洋里 有可能充满了生命
But inside these oceans, they could be teeming with life.

528
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,472
由于Yeneer g持续不断的牵引
And with the constant pull by Yeneer g...

529
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:48,935
Aner'bas既有可能具有大量的地热活动
Aner'bas would most likely have a large amount of geothermal activity...

530
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,480
那可能是生命诞生的主要能源
that could be a prime source of energy for life to begin.

531
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,907
Aner'bas的表面极少量的光
Near the surface on Aner'bas, small amounts of light...

532
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,952
有可能透过薄冰层渗入下面的水中
may bleed through the thinner areas of ice to the water below.

533
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,457
这里某些生物有可能已经进化成了眼状物
Here some creatures may have evolved eyes.

534
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,542
这可能提供给了它们有利条件
This may provide them with advantages...

535
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:16,213
但是也会让它们对某些防御技术更加敏感
but would also make them vulnerable to certain defense techniques.

536
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,427
amabo堪称狡猾的水下逃脱大师楷模
One example of a cunning underwater escape artist is the amabos.

537
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:27,349
对我们来说 光就是光
To us, light is just light.

538
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,476
然而来看看amabo
But think of the amabos.

539
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:32,771
小巧玲珑 几乎是胶状模样的动物
A small, little, almost gelatinous-looking creature...

540
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:36,233
在水下游动 无忧无虑
that swims through the water, innocent.

541
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,735
假如有什么靠近它 威胁它
If anything comes close to it that threatens it...

542
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:44,532
它就会发出耀眼的闪光笼罩自己
it throws out a brilliant flash of sparkling lights all around it...

543
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,577
让靠近自己的动物眼花缭乱 不能自拔
blinding whatever creature came up to it.

544
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,788
就在那一刻 它逃之夭夭
And in that moment, it's gone...

545
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,457
犹如墨鱼喷出大大的墨水团一般
much like a squid might shoot out a big ink cloud...

546
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:56,253
它突然之间被耀眼的闪光笼罩
It is suddenly masked by brilliant lights...

547
00:35:56,295 --> 00:35:58,380
几乎就像是国庆日的烟花
that almost look like the Fourth of July.

548
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,008
它逃之夭夭
And it's gone.

549
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:06,680
光 在那种场合 就是一种防卫机制
Light, in that sense, is a protective mechanism.

550
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,519
但是生活在深海里的生物
But creatures that live much deeper in the oceans...

551
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,562
会有其他的生存方式
would adapt other methods for survival.

552
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:19,317
一个例子是zowalina
One example is the zowalina.

553
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:27,075
zowalina就像是可怕的蜘蛛和奇怪的螃蟹的杂交种
The zowalina look like a cross between a weird, weird spider and a very strange crab.

554
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,373
但是它们具有奇异的能力
But they have an odd, odd ability.

555
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,375
它们不是通过眼睛来感受世界
They don't sense their world through eyes.

556
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:38,211
它们不是通过耳朵来感受世界
They don't sense their world through ears.

557
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:42,424
它们感受世界是通过电场
They sense their world through an electric field...

558
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,467
它们身体周围所产生的电场
that they generate around their bodies.

559
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,512
这个电场可以延展出去
This field can be stretched out...

560
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,724
因此它就会感受到周围的动静
so that it senses everything that's moving around it.

561
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:56,521
貌似它的世界受到这个电场的影响
It sees its world by what impinges on this electronic field.

562
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,773
有趣的是
And the interesting thing about it is...

563
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:03,194
它们一旦锁定认为是猎物的东西
once they've locked onto something that they think is prey...

564
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,990
它们就会静候其慢慢靠近
they wait till it draws nearer and nearer...

565
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,200
以迅雷不及掩耳之势发起攻击
and all of a sudden--zap.

566
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:20,045
一个巨大的电击 击昏猎物
A huge bolt of electricityjets out, stuns their prey...

567
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,423
伸出触角将其抓住 拉入囊中
and a tentacle whips out and grabs it and pulls it right in.

568
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:26,176
它捕猎是利用电流
It hunts by using electricity.

569
00:37:28,387 --> 00:37:34,059
在我们观察此类生物必须战胜水世界的巨大挑战时
As we see the immense challenges that creatures like this would have to overcome in a water world...

570
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,770
尚有最后一个因素有待探索
there is one last factor yet to explore.

571
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,487
一旦到了地球人探索宇宙间的生命时
When the time comes that the people of Earth discover life in the cosmos...

572
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,741
或生命最终决定自己暴露给人类时
or that life finally decides to reveal itself to the human race...

573
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,786
有可能它根本就不是生物体
it may not be a biological entity at all.

574
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,414
不是血肉之躯 碳啊什么的
Rather than flesh, blood, and carbon...

575
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:59,626
我们有可能会碰到钢和硅啊
we might be met with steel and silicon...

576
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:01,836
机器
a machine.

577
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:17,060
我们走近假设行星Gaia' Leo 我们的最后一站
As we approach the theoretical planet Gaia' Leo, our final stop...

578
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:20,814
我们注意到其表面有三个巨大的陨石坑
we notice three extremely large craters on the surface.

579
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,362
小行星撞击有生命的行星将是灾难性的
An asteroid collision with a life-supporting planet would be catastrophic.

580
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,867
但是在Gaia' Leo上 情况会有所不同
But on Gaia' Leo, something's different.

581
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,541
我们近地观察
We approach the surface...

582
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,044
看到机械小生物到处在漫游
and see tiny mechanical creatures roaming around.

583
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,297
尽管我们经历了千里迢迢
Although our journey thus far...

584
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,134
发现在假想的宇宙边缘
has explored an imaginary edge of the universe...

585
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:52,846
充满了形形色色的生物体
filled with biological creatures of all shapes and sizes...

586
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,307
但是某些科学家认为外星世界
some scientists believe an alien world...

587
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,394
反而有可能是合成机器的世界
could instead be a land of synthetic machines...

588
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,312
就像Gaia' Leo那样
much like Gaia' Leo.

589
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:14,951
搜索地外智慧（SETI）中心的塞思 肖斯塔克博士
Dr. Seth Shostak of the Search for Extraterrestrial IntðÞlligence or SETI Institute...

590
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:18,538
认为一旦地球外生命被发现
believes that when life beyond Earth is discovered...

591
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,583
我们的宇宙较有可能是铁和硅构成的
our cosmic relative may be made of steel and silicon...

592
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,418
而不是血和肉
rather than flesh and blood.

593
00:39:27,423 --> 00:39:29,382
任何已经足够聪明的外星人
Any aliens that have gotten clever enough...

594
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:32,343
都会建造无线电发射机进行联系
to build a radio transmitter and get on the air...

595
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,928
因此我们会听到他们
so that we could hear them...

596
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,556
有可能已经到了下一个阶段
have probably gone the next step...

597
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,186
这下一个阶段有可能是开发有思想的机器
and the next step might be the development of thinking machines.

598
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:48,651
要更好地了解遍布此类机器的外行星的起源
To better understand the origin of an alien planet teeming with these types of machines...

599
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:54,782
科学家称我们只要看看地球上我们自己的智慧的进化
scientists say we only have to look as far as our own evolution of intelligence here on Earth...

600
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,702
尤其是人工智能
specifically artificial intelligence.

601
00:39:58,704 --> 00:40:00,914
人工智能 你可能会说
Artificial intelligence, you might say...

602
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:03,166
就是凭空制造孩子的科学
is the science of making babies from scratch...

603
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,876
而不是用传统的手段
instead of the old-fashioned way.

604
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,798
它尝试通过了解大脑的运作
It's the science and engineering that tries to put together a mind...

605
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,842
将科学工程组合进大脑
by understanding how the mind works.

606
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,222
现在 我们尚未达到这一步
Now, we haven't done that.

607
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:19,516
我们尚未打造出思想机器
We haven't built thinking machines...

608
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,059
但是圈内人士似乎认为
but people who work in that area...

609
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:25,980
那有可能在20、50、100年里问世
seem to think that that's likely to happen within 20 years, 50 years, 100 years.

610
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:32,570
可以想象未来数百乃至数千年后
It's conceivable that hundreds perhaps thousands of years into the future...

611
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:35,990
我们可能会和我们的机器合二为一
we may want to merge with our machines.

612
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,743
要认识到在未来数个世纪里
Realize that in the coming centuries...

613
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:41,120
机器实际上会变得比我们聪明
machines could actually become smarter than us...

614
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:44,832
这样始终存在着危险
and there's always the danger...

615
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,044
我们的作品会将我们投入动物园 关进笼子
that our creations will put us in zoos, behind bars...

616
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:51,756
扔花生给我们 让我们跳舞
and throw peanuts at us, and make us dance...

617
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,592
就像我们把熊关进笼子跳舞一样
just like we make bears dance at zoos.

618
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,389
但是要是与机器合二为一
But instead of merging with the machines...

619
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:05,353
那么有朝一日 事实上 人类就有可能变成机器了
one day humans may, in fact, become the machines.

620
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,901
一旦芯片胜过了人脑
And once the CPU surpasses the human brain...

621
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:14,612
成熟的软件将会让这些人
sophisticated software could give these beings...

622
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:17,073
具有我们无法比拟的优势
an unparalleled advantage over us.

623
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:20,201
要是你具有了人工智能
If you've got artificial intelligences...

624
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,954
大脑的运行速度超过人脑100万倍
running on brains a million times faster than human...

625
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,248
思维快过人脑100万倍
and thinking a million times fast as human...

626
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:30,044
那么理论上它们干1万年 就只要思索上3.5天
they can theoretically do 10,000 years worth of thinking in 3 1/2 days.

627
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:36,175
巨大的能量将是他们实现这一壮举的生命线
Vast amounts of energy would be their lifeline to achieving such a feat.

628
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,598
一旦他们为了所有可利用的资源而获得了Gaia' Leo
Once they harvested Gaia' Leo for all usable resources...

629
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,019
这些小机器人生物 即所谓的seval
these small robotic creatures, known as sevals...

630
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:48,396
就会建造一条通向太空的星际高速公路
could build a planetary highway to space...

631
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,318
然后下一级的机器 捕捞器
then the next level of machines, the fishers...

632
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,989
将可以为自己的生存获得几乎无极限的能量
would have access to virtually an unlimðÞted amount of energy for their survival.

633
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,661
要认识到地球只是利用了
Just realize that the Earth only uses...

634
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:07,373
太阳能量的很少一部分
a tiny fraction of the energy from the Sun.

635
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:10,918
如果太阳这么大
If the Sun were this big...

636
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:17,175
地球相对太阳的个头 就只有针头那么大
the Earth would be nothing but a head of a pin compared to the size of the Sun...

637
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:21,220
因此我们只吸收了太阳发出的能量极小一丁点
so we absorb only the tiniest fraction of energy from the Sun.

638
00:42:25,893 --> 00:42:28,186
为了获得太阳发出的能量
To harvest the energy from the Sun...

639
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:31,606
一个叫做戴森球的理论结构
a theoretical structure known as a Dyson sphere...

640
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,400
围绕它或其它所有的恒星周围构建起来
could be built around it or any other star.

641
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:37,403
戴森球是一个巨形球体
A Dyson sphere is a gigantic sphere...

642
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:39,864
围绕着恒星构建
that is built to surround a star...

643
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:43,034
以吸收那颗恒星所有的能量
to absorb all the energy from that star.

644
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:49,165
这样 你就可以吸收恒星在这个过程中
In this way, you can absorb the entire output of a star...

645
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,209
没有燃烧的全部输出
without getting burned in the process.

646
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:57,715
一旦恒星分解 能量耗尽
Once a star is dissected for parts and its energy is depleted...

647
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,967
捕捞器就会拆卸戴森球
the fishers could dismantle the sphere...

648
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,013
自己推进到下一个星系组
and propel themselves towards the next galactic battery.

649
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,819
如果科学家说的没错
If scientists are correct...

650
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,990
这种机器的架设有可能就在基地附近的行星上
this rise of the machines may even happen on a planet closer to home.

651
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,590
随着时间的推移
As each year passes...

652
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:44,262
新的科学发现正推进着认识上的突破
new scientific findings are being made that push the envelope in understanding...

653
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:47,807
不仅是我们自己 而且还有宇宙间的生命
not only ourselves, but life in the universe.

654
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:54,689
那是一个全新的世界 或者更确切地说
There is a whole new world, or, rather, worlds...

655
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,692
是有待于我们去发现的世界
ready for us to discover out there.

656
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:04,282
如果宇宙其他地方的生命最终被发现
And if life elsewhere in the universe is finally discovered...

657
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:07,326
那么 恒星数量之多让我们确信
the sheer number of stars assures us...

658
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:12,957
一定会有丰富多彩 数量繁多的生命被发现
that there is a diverse, colorful, and vast array of life to be found...

660
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,901
陌生的面孔会多得超乎想象
and more alien faces than anyone could ever imagine.
