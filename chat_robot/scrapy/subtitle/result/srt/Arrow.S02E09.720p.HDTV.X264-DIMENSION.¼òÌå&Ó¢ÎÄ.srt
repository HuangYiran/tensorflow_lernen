00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,920
我的名字叫奥利弗·奎恩
My name is Oliver Queen.

11
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,700
五年里  我被困在地狱一般的小岛上
After five years on a hellish island,

12
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,950
我回来只有一个目标
I have come home with only one goal--

13
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,200
拯救我的城市
to save my city.

14
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,240
但要达到目标  我不能像过去一样成为凶手
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

15
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,560
为了纪念我的朋友  我只能伪装成另一个人
To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else.

16
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,880
{\an8}深切怀念托马斯·梅林
孝子

17
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,590
成为另一个存在
I must be something else.

《绿箭》前情回顾
Previously on "Arrow"...

19
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,810
我是巴里·阿伦  来自中心城市警局
I'm Barry Allen, from the Central City Police Department.

20
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,790
是犯罪现场调查组的工作人员
I'm with the Crime Scene Investigation Unit.

21
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,520
我有朋友能够帮我
I have friends that can help.

22
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,440
-这奇迹可能会杀死你  -动手吧
- This miracle could kill you. - Do it.

23
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,080
一种用来制造人体武器的血清
It was a serum designed to create human weapons.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,540
你觉得有人找到了配方
You think someone found the recipe?

25
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,440
离心机和血库被盗
A centrifuge and a large supply of blood.

26
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,760
我觉得有人想要生产更多的血清
I think someone wants to make more of it.

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,640
-奥利弗  -他还活着吗
- Oliver! - Is he alive?

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,330
-费利西蒂  我们救不了他  -对  我们救不了
- Felicity, we can't save him! - I know. We can't.

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,600
求你救救我朋友
Please save my friend.

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,740
按住他
Hold him!

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,190
他没法活下来了
He's not going to make it.

32
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,490
他会活下来的  只要找到他体内有什么
He will. We just have to find out what's in his system.

33
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,790
一般我只处理死人
I--I--I usually only work on dead people.

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,990
-巴里  -好  他的身体做出这样的反应
- Barry! - All right, I can think of four possible diagnosis

35
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,570
我能想到四种可能的诊断
for what's causing his body to react this way.

36
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,680
现在只有三种可能的诊断了
Make that three possible diagnosis.

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,120
两种
Two.

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,200
开始胸部按压
Start chest compressions.

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
我要抽血检查
I need to get to his arm.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,350
好了
Got it.

41
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,990
-他的静脉正在内凝结  -什么
- He's suffering from intravenous coagulation. - What?

42
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,550
血液里有异常肿块  就像枫糖浆一样
His blood is unnaturally clotting. It's like maple syrup.

43
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,020
你能救他  对吧
You can save him, right?

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,270
对
Right.

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,730
{\an8}杀鼠灵

46
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,810
幸亏你们这里老鼠成灾
Lucky you guys have a rat problem.

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,630
你开玩笑嘛  那东西有毒
Are you kidding? That'll kill him!

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,360
如果我不这样做  他就会死
He dies if I don't.

49
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,770
-费利西蒂  -动手吧
- Felicity... - Do it!

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,460
一定量的老鼠药会稀释他的血液
Just the right amount of this stuff will thin his blood enough

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,200
让其重新循环
to get it circulating again.

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,660
放弃吧  奥利弗
Let go, Oliver.

53
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,860
他在衰弱
He's crashing.

54
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,010
别再挣扎了
Don't fight anymore.

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,550
奥利弗  保持清醒
Oliver, stay with me!

56
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,290
跟我走吧
Stay with me.

57
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,470
绿箭
第二季第九集

58
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,290
-奥利弗  放开他  -奥利弗
- Oliver, let him go. - Oliver!

59
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,010
出什么事了
What the hell is going on?

60
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,310
你被注射了一种强效凝血剂
You were injected with a strong-acting blood coagulant.

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,590
你本来快死了
You would have stroked out,

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,960
但幸运的是  你们这里有十分有效的血液稀释剂
but fortunately you had a very effective blood thinner handy.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,280
华法令阻凝剂
Warfarin.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,340
又叫杀鼠灵
Better known as rat poison.

65
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,180
他救了你的命  奥利弗
Kid saved your life, Oliver.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,390
按照救生事件的情节发展
This is the point in a lifesaving emergency

67
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
你现在应该感谢救命恩人
where you thank the person that did the lifesaving.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,750
-你把我的身份告诉了他  -对
- You told him who I am. - Yeah, I did.

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,390
这秘密轮不到你来泄露  费利西蒂
That's not your secret to tell, Felicity.

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,330
由我来决定谁能知晓我的身份
I decide who finds out my identity.

71
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,640
我们没时间等你投票
Well, we didn't have time to get your vote,

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,530
你当时昏迷不醒  即将死去
what with you unconscious and dying.

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,300
如果他离开这里  然后直接去找警察怎么办
What happens if he leaves here and goes right to the police?

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,210
-他不会那样做的  -我不会那样做的
- He wouldn't do that. - I wouldn't do that.

75
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,550
-我信任他  -我不信
- I trust him. - I don't!

76
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,940
你打算怎么办  朝他射箭吗
What are you going to do, put an arrow in him?

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,950
-我在考虑  -别担心  他开玩笑的
- I am considering it. - Don't worry, he's kidding!

78
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,860
你妈妈开枪打了你  你不是也来找我帮忙了吗
How is this any different from when your mother shot you and you came to me for help?

79
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,220
你妈妈居然开枪打你
Your mother shot you?

80
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,600
狄格中了箭毒  你不是也把他带来了这里吗
Or when you brought Dig down here when he was poisoned with curare.

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,350
区别在于我调查过你们两个
The difference is that I did my homework on both of you!

82
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,970
我从来不会随便告诉别人
I don't just tell people easily.

83
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,200
我不会告诉别人的
I'm not going to tell anyone.

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,170
你没必要感谢我
And you don't have to thank me,

85
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,650
但你该感谢她  别这么混蛋好吗
but you should thank her instead of being kind of a jerk.

86
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,550
奎恩先生
Mr. Queen.

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,490
{\an8}来自妈妈
你能回家吗

88
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,600
我得回家了
I have to go home.

89
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,570
我在避难室里与之搏斗的男人
That man that I fought in the bunker,

90
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,170
他有能力批量生产岛上的血清
he has what he needs to mass produce the serum from the island.

91
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,510
我们得阻止他
And we have to stop him.

92
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,450
他抓住你脖子时  碰了你的皮肤
He touched your skin when he grabbed your neck.

93
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,960
我吸取了他皮肤中的残油
I was able to absorb the residual oils from his skin,

94
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,750
将其放入凝胶聚合物中
which, when added to a gel-based polymer,

95
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,540
也许能够重建他的指纹
might be able to recreate his fingerprint.

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,380
与偶像见面后总是会幻灭  对吧
Never meet your heroes, right?

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,270
妈妈
Mom?

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,410
谢谢你回家来  亲爱的
Thank you for coming home, sweetheart.

99
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,980
发生什么事了吗
Is everything all right?

100
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,560
我不知道  你妹妹把自己锁在房里
Well, I don't know. Your sister has locked herself in her room

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,230
不肯和我说话
and she won't talk to me.

102
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,420
-别担心  我和她谈谈  -好
- Don't worry, I'll talk to her. - Ok.

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,530
今天是圣诞节啊
It's Christmas.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,670
是的
Yes.

105
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,540
但考虑到我们最近举办的盛会
But given the last gala that we threw,

106
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,280
今年还是不要举办圣诞派对了
I think we're going to skip this year's Christmas party.

107
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,740
西娅  我是奥利  开门
Thea, it's Ollie. Open the door.

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,570
现在不行  奥利
Not--not now, Ollie.

109
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,080
闪电妞  快开门
Speedy, open the door!

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,650
妈妈和你一起来了吗
Is mom with you?

111
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,110
没有
No!

112
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,680
发生什么事了
What's going on?

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,190
-我不想让妈妈看到  -看到什么
- I didn't want mom to see. - See what?

114
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,010
他怎么了
What happened to him?

115
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,450
他做了治安维持者的靶子
Vigilante decided to use him as target practice.

116
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,870
你是对的
You're right--

117
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,470
那人是个疯子
the guy's a psycho.

118
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,180
你为什么不去医院
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

119
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,840
在这座城市
In this city,

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,390
中箭会像中枪一样引来警方的注意
an arrow's the same as a bullet if you want the cops involved.

121
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,850
虽然妈妈挺喜欢罗伊的
And mom actually likes Roy,

122
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,210
但要是她发现他和兜帽男纠缠不清
but something tells me she'd revoke his tree trimming invitation

123
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,190
她一定不会让他装饰圣诞树了
if she found out he was messing around with the hood.

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,550
罗伊
Roy.

125
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,280
会很疼的
This is going to hurt.

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,210
我的愤怒能冲淡疼痛
My anger's dulling the pain.

127
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,820
这个能冲得更淡
This will dull it better.

128
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,580
然后用力按住  就这样
Going to put pressure on it. Right there.

129
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,050
狄格尔  我需要你来一趟奎恩宅邸
Diggle, I need you to come to the Queen mansion.

130
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,250
罗伊被射中了
Roy's been shot.

131
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,440
中的是箭
With an arrow.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
说来话长
It's a long story.

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,620
先把急救箱拿来西娅的房间
Look, just bring the first aid kit to Thea's room.

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,850
谢谢
Thank you.

135
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,970
罗伊  我的司机狄格尔先生
Roy, my driver, Mr. Diggle,

136
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,500
在部队的时候受过医疗训练
he has medical training from his time in the army.

137
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,650
-他会帮你包扎  -谢谢
- He's going to patch you up. - Thank you.

138
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,960
不过是尽我所能
It's the least I can do.

139
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,780
我不知道你们三个想干什么
Look, I don't know what the three of you are up to,

140
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,840
但也许治安维持者只是想保证你们的安全
but maybe the vigilante was just trying to keep you safe.

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
所以他才射了罗伊吗
By shooting Roy?

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,100
我只是猜测
I... i'm just saying.

143
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,120
也许你们应该放手
Maybe you should let this go.

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,280
所以  你会放手吗
So... are you going to let this go?

145
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,330
不
No.

146
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,450
但现在起一切听我的
But now we're going to do things my way.

147
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,460
妈妈
Mom!

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,050
有人吗
Hello!

149
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,170
你好  我的爱人
Hello, my love.

150
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,800
莎朵
Shado?

151
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,240
你不可能是真的
You can't be here.

152
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,390
我必须来见你
I had to see you.

153
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,000
-我得警告你  -警告我
- Had to warn you. - Warn me?

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,420
你无法抵抗接下来要发生的事
You can't fight what's coming.

155
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,150
放下你的弓
Put down your bow.

156
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,080
脱下我父亲的兜帽
Take off my father's hood.

157
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,590
我戴兜帽是为了纪念你父亲
I wear that hood to honor your father.

158
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,310
也为了纪念你
And to honor you.

159
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,310
如果你想纪念我
If you want to honor me,

160
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,250
停止争斗  好好生活
stop fighting...and live.

161
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,550
不然所有你爱的人都会死
Or everyone you love will die.

162
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,650
奥利
Ollie?

163
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,780
你刚刚在和谁讲话
Who were you talking to?

164
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,750
放下武器
Put off your weapons.

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,630
滚过去
Get over there!

166
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,430
奇迹
Mirakuru.

167
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,340
把他们带走
Take them.

168
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,800
安东尼
Anthony...

169
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,000
你已经得偿所愿了
you got what you wanted.

170
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,070
你可以放了他们
You can let them go.

171
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,340
要是你真正在乎过我
If you ever cared about me.

172
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,490
我确实在乎你  莎拉
But I do care about you, Sara.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,080
所以我不会选择杀你
Which is why I won't choose to kill you.

174
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,880
但是他可能会
But he might.

175
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,880
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,850
是时候做出选择了  奥利弗
Time to choose, Oliver.

177
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,260
选出谁生  谁死
Who lives, and who dies.

178
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
不过你得选快点  因为30秒后
But pick quickly, because in 30 seconds,

179
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,500
我会把她们都杀了
I will shoot them both.

180
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,450
孵化已经开始了
The incubation process has begun.

181
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,940
48小时后就可以散播血清
Serum will be ready for distribution in 48 hours.

182
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,780
只要两天
Two days.

183
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,800
我们就能创造上百个像你一样的人
And we will be able to create a hundred more like you.

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,460
这座城市的掌权人
And the people who run this city

185
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,270
终于能见识到真正的力量了
will see what real power looks like.

186
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,840
我就知道治安维持者有同伙
I knew the vigilante had partners.

187
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,270
他现在比较喜欢绿箭侠这个称呼
He likes to be called the Arrow now.

188
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,290
你们三个和一些真正的人渣较量过
You three have messed with some really nasty people.

189
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,350
娃娃制造者  迷魂伯爵
The Doll Maker, Count Vertigo,

190
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,700
幕后者还有女杀手
Dodger, the Huntress.

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
我们没有记录在案
We weren't keeping score.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,660
我记着呢
I was.

193
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,650
巴里
Barry.

194
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,680
你给我用的老鼠药  有没有副作用
The rat poison that you gave me... are there any side effects?

195
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,050
有  可能出现幻觉
Um, yeah, I think hallucinations, maybe.

196
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,940
以及大量出汗
And excessive sweating.

197
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
你有没有出很多汗
Are you sweating excessively?

198
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,430
你产生幻觉了吗
You're hallucinating?

199
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,730
你看到什么了
What are you seeing?

200
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
一个叫莎朵的女孩  和我一起在岛上待过
A girl named Shado that was with me on the island.

201
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,570
莎朵
Shado.

202
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,760
莎拉
Sara.

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,270
你和多少女人一起被困岛上
How many women were you marooned with?

204
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,820
你确定那个岛不是虚构吗
Are you sure this wasn't fantasy island?

205
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,700
你果然是在森林或者丛林里接受的训练
You did train in a jungle or forest environment,

206
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,990
所以才选了绿色
hence the green.

207
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,770
让我抽点血  看看怎么样了
Hey, let me draw some blood, see what's up.

208
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,120
我能问你个事吗
Hey, can I ask you something?

209
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,820
为什么不戴面具
Why no mask?

210
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,380
我不是想教你该怎么去维持治安
Not to tell you how to do your vigilante...ing,

211
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,320
只是涂油彩
but the grease paint thing?

212
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,800
不是个隐藏身份的好办法
It's a poor identity concealer.

213
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,860
那你去帮我找个既能完美适合我的脸型
So find me a mask that conforms perfectly to my face

214
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,380
在我奔跑的同时又完全不妨碍到瞄准力的面具
and doesn't affect my ability to aim while I'm on the run.

215
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,900
你可以试试可压缩的超细纤维
You should look into a compressible micro fabric.

216
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,340
-会非常好用的  -发现塞勒斯·戈尔德
- It could be great. - Found Cyrus Gold.

217
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,660
塞勒斯·戈尔德是谁
Who's Gyrus Gold?

218
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,370
那天晚上差点把你弄死的那个人体武器
The human weapon that left you nearly dead the other night.

219
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,900
那家伙从你脖子上取下了他的指纹
The kid did manage to pull his print off your neck.

220
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,440
我用人脸识别软件
I've had facial recognition software

221
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,730
扫描全城的闭路式摄像机
scanning closed circuit cameras all over town.

222
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,110
他现在在德尔加多大街和第二十五大道处
He's at the corner of Delgado and 25th right now,

223
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,940
但是马上要跟丢了
but we're just about to lose him.

224
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,180
那个十字路口上还有什么
What else is at that intersection?

225
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,960
停车场  超市  汽车旅馆
A parking lot, a market, a motel.

226
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
很可能就是他的藏身之所
Could be where he's holed up.

227
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,840
-我来搞定  -奥利弗
- I got this. - Oliver...

228
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,710
这件事我来处理吧
Why don't let me handle this one?

229
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,470
只是侦察而已
It's just recon.

230
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,690
好吧
Fine.

231
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,570
我做你的后援
But I'm going as your back-up.

232
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,080
别担心
Don't worry.

233
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,840
我会查出奥利弗到底怎么回事的
I'll figure out what's wrong with Oliver.

234
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,290
你尽早吧
You'd be the first.

235
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,660
{\an8}需要议员陪你一起去做圣诞节采购吗

236
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
神秘的爱慕者吗
Secret admirer?

237
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,450
不是的  是我爸送来的
No, actually, they're from my father.

238
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,200
什么风把你吹来了
What brings you by?

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,340
我们需要你的帮助  辛迪的朋友被杀了
We need your help. Cindy's friend was murdered,

240
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,890
但是警方不肯介入调查
but the police aren't going to investigate.

241
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,440
说是吸毒过量致死  就这样
They said that he ODed, end of story.

242
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,700
看看这个
Check this out.

243
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,520
他献血赚外快
He earned extra money donating blood.

244
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,450
{\an8}贫民区救灾献血活动

245
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,140
我们在马克斯房间里找到的
We found it in Max's apartment.

246
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,850
如果他吸毒  他们不会要他的血  对吧
They wouldn't have accepted his blood if he was using, right?

247
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,120
马克斯和献血车同天消失的
Max went missing the same day as the blood drive.

248
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,940
如果他真的去那献血了
If he did donate blood there,

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,520
至少他们会知道点马克斯的情况吧
maybe they at least know something that happened to him.

250
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,930
我去打听一下
I'll ask around.

251
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,370
谢谢你  劳蕾尔
Thank you, Laurel.

252
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,040
{\an8}帕特丽夏饭店

253
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,650
如果无聊  储备箱里有本填字游戏的书
If you get bored, I keep a book of crossword puzzles in the glove box.

254
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,910
这话一点都不好笑
That's not funny.

255
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,180
你看到什么了
Ok, what do you see?

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,110
房间很干净
It's clean.

257
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,550
非常干净
Really clean.

258
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,280
"所罗门·格兰迪  周一出生..."
"Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday..."

259
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,700
周二洗礼
Christened on Tuesday.

260
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,490
我知道那首诗  象征着生命的七个阶段
I know the poem. It symbolizes the seven stages of life--

261
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
从出生到死亡
From birth to death.

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,600
这家伙现在处于哪个阶段
What stage is this guy in?

263
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,750
快走快走  快  快
Go, go, go, go, go!

264
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,250
他轻而易举地就能把我拎起来
He picked me up like I was nothing.

265
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,040
-费利西蒂  请求支援  -马上来
- Felicity, call for back-up.  - On it.

266
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,800
是莎拉的事吗
This about Sara?

267
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,820
你有她的消息吗
You heard from her?

268
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,360
没有
No.

269
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,810
抱歉  这是...
I'm sorry, this is...

270
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,390
是别的事
This is something else.

271
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,170
塞勒斯·戈尔德
Cyrus Gold.

272
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,710
上周他到奎恩联合企业的
He robbed the Applied Sciences division

273
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,510
应用科学部门偷了东西
of Queen Consolidated last week.

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,320
警探
Detective...

275
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,330
他是个危险分子
He's extremely dangerous.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,940
从中心城市派来的现场调查员
The CSI kid from central city,

277
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,210
他说这人就像某种怪物
he said this guy was like some kind of monster.

278
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,870
确实是
He is.

279
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,160
是什么东西  用了类固醇吗
Well, what is it, steroids?

280
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,470
更糟糕  是...
Worse. It's--

281
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,400
那个是...
It's...

282
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,070
好吧  就算我相信你  你为什么来找我
Well, assuming I believe you, why come to me?

283
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,860
我妥协了
I've been compromised.

284
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,800
什么意思
What does that mean?

285
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
意思是我现在是个累赘
It means I'd be a liability.

286
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,610
这事你必须相信我  警探
You have to take my word on this, detective.

287
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,970
尽可能召集多的人手
Gather as many men as you can,

288
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,870
能杀死塞勒斯·戈尔德的时候一定不要犹豫
and do not hesitate to kill Cyrus Gold.

289
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,390
因为如果他有机会
Because if given the opportunity,

290
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,960
他也会毫不犹豫地杀了你
he'll do the same to you.

291
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,650
你不需要这么做
You don't have to do this!

292
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,040
你拿到了你想要的东西
You got what you came for!

293
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,730
拿上东西走吧
Just take it and go!

294
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,430
还剩十秒
10 seconds.

295
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,360
你这变态的神经病
You freaking psychopath!

296
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,890
历史自有决断
History will make that judgment.

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,180
还剩五秒
Five seconds.

298
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,970
时间到
Time's up.

299
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,890
不  不
No, no!

300
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,410
我想你已经做出了选择
I guess you made your choice.

301
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
不
No!

302
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,930
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

303
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,380
我是来找西娅的
I came by to see Thea.

304
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,200
进来吧
Go on in.

305
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,210
她在楼上她的房间里
She's upstairs in her room.

306
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,620
我开车过来的时候注意到
I noticed on the drive up that your house

307
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,630
你们家没有布置圣诞装饰
wasn't festooned with Christmas decorations.

308
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,090
我们今年不是
Well, we didn't feel very much like

309
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,780
很想布置
festooning this year.

310
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,950
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

311
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,200
我记得去年圣诞节
I remember last Christmas,

312
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,900
汤米和我来参加你们的聚会
Tommy and I came here for your party.

313
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,960
那是我很长时间以来过的最好的节日
It was one of the best holidays I'd had in a really long time.

314
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,050
我该去找西娅了
Anyway, I should probably go talk to Thea.

315
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,690
我调查了献血活动
I checked into the blood drive,

316
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,220
是完全合法的
and it's all legitimate.

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,460
实际上  塞巴斯蒂安的工作
In fact, what Sebastian's done

318
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,130
已经帮忙拯救了许多生命
has helped save a lot of lives.

319
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,010
如果献血活动是合法有益的
So if the blood drive is on the up and up,

320
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,040
那我们该怎么找到杀马克斯的凶手
then how are we supposed to find Max's killer?

321
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,040
还有一件事
There's one other thing.

322
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,170
所有参加活动的献血者
All of the blood donors at the drive

323
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,700
都参加了兰福德研究所的
were subjected to a psych evaluation

324
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,160
精神评估
by the Langford Institute.

325
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,810
那是合法的吗
Is that, like, legal?

326
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,450
这并不是完全不合常理
It's not entirely out of the norm.

327
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,300
研究所的人
And while someone at the

328
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,880
应该知道马克斯有没有被下毒
institute might know if Max was on drugs,

329
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
{\an8}贫民区救灾献血活动

330
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,520
没有搜查令是没法查出来的
There's no way of finding out without a warrant.

331
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,580
我们又没法拿到搜查令
Which we're certainly not going to get.

332
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,890
很抱歉我只能帮到这里了
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

333
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,630
你在干什么
What are you doing?

334
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,860
只是随便弄点东西
Uh, just messing around with something.

335
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,740
你不是应该在查奥利弗
Shouldn't you be trying to figure out

336
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,540
产生幻觉的原因吗
what's causing Oliver's hallucinations?

337
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,270
样本还在扫描  应该快好了
Sample's still being scanned. Shouldn't be too much longer.

338
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,320
很好
Good.

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,890
你真的很担心他  对吧
You're really worried about him, huh?

340
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,680
他总是冒很大的险
He takes crazy chances.

341
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,360
即使是在他不幻想
Even when he's not hallucinating

342
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
岛上那些漂亮姑娘的时候
about beautiful island girls.

343
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,080
那天晚上  我问你是不是喜欢奥利弗
The other night, I asked you if you liked Oliver.

344
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,260
我跟你说了  我不喜欢
I told you. I don't.

345
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,120
我记得
I remember.

346
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,710
但如果你喜欢...
But if you did...

347
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,980
我能看出原因
I could see why.

348
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,610
我是说  奥利弗·奎因
I mean, Oliver Queen.

349
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,890
白天他是个百万富翁
He is a billionaire by day

350
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,200
晚上他拯救城市
and saves the city by night.

351
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,790
听起来你想跟他约会啊
Sounds like you want to date him.

352
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,970
我是刚刚开始喜欢一个
I just have a little experience with liking someone

353
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,920
用不同于他人的眼光看我的人
who doesn't see you the same way.

354
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
今晚粒子加速器的启动进入倒计时
Protests continue into the final countdown

355
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,630
对尖端科技研究实验室颇具争议的
for tonight's ignition of S.T.A.R.

356
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,040
抗议活动还在继续
Lab's controversial particle accelerator.

357
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,440
尖端科技研究实验室的创始人哈里森·威尔斯
S.T.A.R. Lab's founder Harrison Wells promises a new era

358
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,580
{\an8}硬粒子加速器开启倒计时

359
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,070
声称科技进步的新纪元即将到来
of scientific advancement is at hand.

360
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,270
我想我来不及回去看他们开启加速器了
I guess I won't be back in time to see them turn it on.

361
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,000
我知道  是听起来很疯狂
I know, it sounds crazy.

362
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,010
人体武器
Human weapons?

363
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,140
他的名字叫塞勒斯·戈尔德
Look, his name is Cyrus Gold.

364
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,640
他就是上周闯入奎恩联合企业的人
He's the one that broke into Queen Consolidated last week.

365
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,090
就是他抢了血库
He's the one that robbed the blood bank.

366
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,810
也是他杀了那些人
And he killed all those people.

367
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,900
等等
Wait, hold on a second.

368
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,600
你怎么知道这些的
Where are you getting all this intel?

369
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,330
伙计  你是怎么了
Oh, man, what's a matter with you?

370
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,170
你就是因为跟治安维持者联系而降职的
Talking to Wigilante's what got you demoted in the first place.

371
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,230
听着  我们带一支小队去
Look, we take a small squad.

372
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,840
特警队的麦卡西和埃文斯  还有琼斯
Mccarthy and Evans from SWAT, Jones.

373
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,260
我们可以抓住这个家伙的
We can bring this guy down.

374
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,510
我答应过珍妮带她去圣诞采购
I promised Jeannie I'd take her Christmas shopping.

375
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,440
卢卡斯
Lucas.

376
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
拜托
Please.

377
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,260
好吧
Fine.

378
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,340
但你得给珍妮打电话告诉她
But you get to call Jeanie and tell her

379
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,430
我没法带她去购物了
I'm not taking her shopping.

380
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,730
长官
Hey, Sir.

381
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,830
我不想越级
I don't mean to overstep,

382
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,290
但你能多带一个人吗
but could you guys use an extra man?

383
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,280
去穿件防弹衣  戴利警官
Grab a vest, Officer Daily.

384
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,060
警察盯上戈尔德了
The police are onto Gold.

385
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
他们在找他
They're looking for him.

386
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,080
我确信已经混进了队伍
I made sure I'm in the loop.

387
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
现在绝对不能让警察影响到我们
We are too close to let the police interfere.

388
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,990
塞拉斯兄弟
Brother Cyrus.

389
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
警察很想见你
The police are eager to meet you.

390
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,010
介绍一下你自己
Introduce yourself.

391
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,200
圣诞节有什么计划吗
So, any plans for Christmas?

392
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,250
点亮我的烛台[犹太节日所用]
Lighting my menorah.

393
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,610
感觉怎么样
Hi. How are you feeling?

394
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,830
还行
Fine. Just...

395
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,490
家里人多拥挤
It's a little bit crowded at my house,

396
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,050
我就想过来  一个人静静
and I wanted to come down here to get a little privacy.

397
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,450
没问题
Yeah.

398
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,950
走吧  巴里
Come on, Barry.

399
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,580
去大胃王汉堡店看倒计时也行
We can watch the countdown at big belly burger.

400
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,260
你的血液分析快完成了
Your blood analysis is almost done.

401
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,510
谢谢
Thank you.

402
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,940
怎么了  小子
What's the matter, kid?

403
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,850
一脸看到鬼的样子
You look like you've seen a ghost.

404
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,480
你确定他在里面吗
Are you sure he's in there?

405
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

406
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,360
有人看到塞勒斯·戈尔德进去
Sector car spotted Cyrus Gold entering.

407
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,170
一直没有出来
He hasn't left.

408
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,370
手枪保险都打开
Safeties off.

409
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,900
他在那边  包围过去
Over there. Surround him.

410
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,010
这地方不错啊
This is a nice place.

411
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,010
比荒岛上的破碎机舱
It's a bit more comfortable

412
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,740
稍微舒服点
than the fuselage on the island.

413
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,430
你不是真的
You're not real.

414
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,790
你也不是
Neither are you.

415
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,340
你对别人说  掀起这场变革
You told everyone when you started this crusade

416
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
是为了
that it was about

417
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,250
弥补你父亲犯下的罪恶
making up for your father's sins.

418
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,210
真是谎话连篇
That was a lie.

419
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,260
你是为自己赎罪
This charade is to atone for your sins.

420
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,920
你已经死了
You're dead.

421
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,510
你不是什么英雄
You are not a hero.

422
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,290
也不配当朋友兄弟  你屁都不是
Or a friend. Or a brother. You are nothing.

423
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,900
不要背对着我[背叛我]
Do not turn your back on me,

424
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,940
第二次了
not again.

425
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,890
你已经去世了
You're gone.

426
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,170
不管我现在在哪...
Wherever I am...

427
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,950
你应该加入我
It's time you joined me.

428
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,430
莎翁说过懦夫一生千次死
They say a coward dies a thousand deaths.

429
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,850
可是你死一千次也不够
But even that wouldn't be enough for you.

430
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,310
我试过救你
I tried to save you!

431
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,670
还有她
And her.

432
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,040
可你没做到
But you couldn't.

433
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,620
正如你也救不了这座城市
Just like you couldn't save this city.

434
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,890
那座岛根本没让你变强
The island didn't make you strong, kid.

435
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,120
反而暴露出你的软弱
It revealed you to be weak.

436
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,850
谢谢你当我的购物指导
Thank you for being my shopping guide.

437
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,010
你还好吗
Are you ok?

438
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,380
我没事  那个
Uh, yeah, it's just, um,

439
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,870
我可以问你个问题吗
can I ask you a question?

440
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,350
关于你发起的献血活动
It's about the blood drive you sponsored.

441
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,150
当然  那是好事一桩
Of course. It's a wonderful cause.

442
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,900
尤其是对于那些资金不足的医院来说
Especially with the underfunded hospitals we're dealing with.

443
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,150
怎么了
What about it?

444
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,530
喂
Hello?

445
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,950
什么
What?!

446
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,190
好的  我马上过来
Ok, I'll be right over.

447
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,040
怎么了
What happened?

448
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,810
我爸爸
My father.

449
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,740
他受重伤住院了  抱歉
He's in the ICU. I'm so sorry.

450
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,710
非常抱歉  我得先走了
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

451
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,400
不好意思
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,110
发生什么事了
What happened in here?

453
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,300
有人闯进来过吗
Did someone break in?

454
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,520
没有
No.

455
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,780
你的血液分析结果出来了  好消息
Your blood analysis is done. Good news.

456
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
查到里面有什么了吗
So you know what's in my system?

457
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,750
问题就在这里  你的血液很干净
That's the thing-- your blood's clean.

458
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,690
没有任何问题
There's nothing wrong with you.

459
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,270
那我为什么会产生幻觉
Then why am I hallucinating?!

460
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,510
我不知道
I don't know.

461
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,630
不管问题出在哪
But whatever your problem is,

462
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,060
肯定不是生理原因  而是心理问题
it's not pharmacological. It's psychological.

463
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,470
-是你的臆想  -是我的臆想
- It's in your head. - It's in my head.

464
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,260
老天
Oh, my god.

465
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,430
奥利弗
Oliver.

466
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,200
爸
Dad!

467
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,180
宝贝
Honey.

468
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,870
宝贝
Honey.

469
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,670
我的脚趾还能动  应该是个好迹象
Well, I can wiggle my toes, it must be a good sign.

470
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,270
我没事  亲爱的
I'm all right, honey, I'm fine.

471
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,810
卢卡斯怎么样  他还好吗
How's Lucas, is he all right?

472
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,560
对不起
I--I'm sorry.

473
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,210
你这是什么意思
What do you mean?

474
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,930
我得打电话告诉他妻子珍妮
I got to call Jeannie. I got to call his wife.

475
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,340
爸  你待着别动  我去打
No, dad, I'll do it. You just...stay here.

476
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,310
你好好休息
Get some rest.

477
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,800
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

478
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,850
来看看你爸爸有没有事
Wanted to make sure your father was ok.

479
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,080
他没事
He is.

480
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,760
顺便也看看你还好吗
I wanted to make sure you were, too.

481
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,680
你怎么样  警探
How are you, detective?

482
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,670
没死
I'm alive.

483
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,730
我的同伴就没这么幸运了
Unlike most everyone else in my unit.

484
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,500
关于您搭档的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your partner.

485
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,310
是我带他进去的
I took him in there.

486
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,310
是因为我
Because of me.

487
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,840
我不想让你失望
I hate to disappoint you,

488
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,380
但你没必要对这城市的每桩命案负责
but not every death in this city is on you.

489
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,260
从戈尔德身上拿到的
I got this off Gold.

490
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,230
希望能帮到你
Hopefully you can do something with it.

491
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,670
开始我还不相信  但这个人
I didn't believe it at first, but this guy,

492
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,400
根本不像是人类
I mean, it's like he's not human.

493
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,110
他是人类
He's human.

494
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,800
那就杀了他
Well, then you can kill him.

495
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,960
为希尔顿  也为我
For Hilton. And me.

496
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,090
我觉得够锋利了
I think those are sharp enough.

497
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,140
很显然我不这么认为
Apparently I'm not.

498
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,200
狄格尔  你觉得我是神经错乱了吗
Diggle, do you think I'm losing my mind?

499
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,270
没比我们差多少
No more than the rest of us.

500
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,610
我看到
I saw...

501
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,230
斯莱德·威尔逊
Slade Wilson.

502
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,330
斯莱德是我在小岛上的朋友
Slade was my friend on the island,

503
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,510
而且
and...

504
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,490
他和莎朵一样  因我而死
like Shado, he is dead because of me.

505
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,440
兰斯先生说
Mr. Lance just told me

506
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,140
我没必要对这城市的每桩命案负责
that not every death in this city is my fault.

507
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,560
确实
Fine.

508
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,100
但确实有很多是我的责任
There are plenty that are.

509
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,910
当我从阿富汗回来时  我
When I got home from Afghanistan, I...

510
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,200
也看到了个鬼魂
saw a ghost, too.

511
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,050
幸存者的内疚
Survivor's guilt.

512
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,020
为什么我们独活
Why us, not them.

513
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
我知道为什么
I know why.

514
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,310
那这"为什么"就不是你的问题
Then the "Why's" not your problem.

515
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,700
你是怎么赶走鬼魂的
How'd you make your ghost go away?

516
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,870
我明白了他们想告诉我的意思
I figured out what they were trying to tell me.

517
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,990
是什么
Which was?

518
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,810
那是说给我听的  奥利弗
That's for me to hear, Oliver.

519
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,380
你得搞清你的那鬼魂想告诉你什么
You have to figure out what yours is trying to tell you.

520
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,030
伙计们  有新发现
Guys, we got something here.

521
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,920
我扫描了兰斯给你的钥匙
I scanned the key Lance gave you,

522
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,150
通过序列号查到了它的生产商
and traced its serial code back to the manufacturer.

523
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,070
这把钥匙和贫民区新月环路某处
This particular key fits a locked gate

524
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,070
一个上锁的门相匹配
somewhere on Crescent Circle in the glades.

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,890
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

526
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,890
你这身体状况不能随便跑出去
You can't go out there in your condition.

527
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,680
我必须阻止他们
I have to stop this.

528
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,170
奥利弗  戈尔德没直接把你打死
Oliver, Gold left you half dead,

529
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,480
比起希尔顿警探的遭遇可真是手下留情了
which is 50 percent better than how he left detective hilton.

530
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,490
费利西蒂
Felicity...

531
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,150
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

532
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,620
我会回来的
I'll come back.

533
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,830
你发誓
Promise me.

534
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,150
{\an8}兰福德研究所

535
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,820
马克斯
Max.

536
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,550
{\an8}米拉库鲁

537
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,360
万事俱备
It's ready.

538
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,810
这就是你杀马克斯·斯坦顿的地方吗
Is this where you killed max stanton, hmm?

539
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,450
你要干嘛  敢用它扎我  我就杀了你
What are you doing? If you stick that in me, I'll kill you.

540
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,930
不  罗伊兄弟
No, Brother Roy.

541
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,320
你会为我杀人
You'll kill for me.

542
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,980
勒斯兄弟说他已经把你杀了
Brother Cyrus told me he killed you.

543
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,380
也许他没你想得那么强大
Guess he's not as strong as you'd hoped.

544
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,370
你从哪里得到的米拉库鲁  谁给你的配方
Where'd you get the Mirakiru? Who gave you the formula?!

545
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,380
那是一件可以用来拯救这座城市的礼物
It was a gift. A gift I would use to save this city from itself.

546
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,710
另一件失败品
Another failure.

547
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,830
站起来  奥利弗
Get up, Oliver.

548
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,630
汤米
Tommy?

549
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,420
你不能死在这里
You're not going to die down here.

550
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,820
汤米  对不起
Tommy, I'm sorry.

551
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,330
你是因我而死
I let you die.

552
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,230
我不是因你而死  奥利
You didn't let me die, Ollie.

553
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,520
你为了救我而战
You fought to save me.

554
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,570
因为你就是这样的人
Because that's what you do.

555
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,050
一如既往
What you have always done.

556
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,540
为生存而战
You fight to survive.

557
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,830
我知道我曾叫你杀人犯
I know I called you a murderer,

558
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,240
但你不是
but you are not.

559
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,350
你是个英雄
You are a hero.

560
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,970
你战胜了那座小岛
You beat the island.

561
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,040
你战胜了我父亲
You beat my father.

562
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,420
战斗下去  奥利弗
So fight, Oliver.

563
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,350
站起来
Get up,

564
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,650
以牙还牙
and fight back.

565
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,070
杀了他
Kill him.

566
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,640
我不会再眼睁睁看着别人死去
Hey. I am not leaving anyone else to die!

567
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,340
你很坚强  孩子
You're strong, kid.

568
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
加油  加油
Come on! Come on!

569
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,960
加油  罗伊
Come on, Roy!

570
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,780
战胜它  加油  战胜它
Fight. Come on, fight!

571
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,060
罗伊
Roy?!

572
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,560
罗伊
Hey, Roy!

573
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,430
你去哪了  我到处找你
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you!

574
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,640
我
I was...

575
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,430
我去追踪一条线索
I was running down another lead.

576
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,540
似乎不太成功
It didn't pan out.

577
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,250
我还以为你又去找治安维持者了
I thought you were chasing after the vigilante again.

578
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,960
我吓坏了  还以为你出什么事了
I got so scared. I thought something happened to you.

579
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,500
听我说  别担心
Hey, hey, don't worry.

580
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,890
我活得好好的
I'm alive.

581
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,530
我要为星城的人民大众服务
I want to serve the people of Starling,

582
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,740
{\an8}布拉德宣布参选市长

583
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,250
而不是为那些自以为拥有这城市的人
not the men and women who think they own it.

584
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,830
携起手来  重建我们的城市
Together, we can help rebuild our city

585
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,330
不再有阶级  不再有压迫
into a place where there are no elites and no oppressed.

586
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,440
人人都是兄弟姐妹
Where we are all brothers and sisters.

587
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,410
看来你的竞选开始了
So your campaign begins.

588
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,430
星城需要领袖
The city needs a leader.

589
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,250
让冒牌兜帽男刺杀市长
And putting the copycat hoods up to assassinating the Mayor

590
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,850
只是第一步
was just the first step.

591
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,150
治安维持者
The vigilante...

592
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,160
他摧毁了离心机
He destroyed the centrifuge

593
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,580
也破坏了血清
and the serum along with it.

594
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,730
我会再给你提供一份我的血样
I will arrange for you to receive another sample of my blood,

595
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,180
然后你就可以再次大批量制血清
and then you can begin to mass produce the serum again.

596
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,770
如果我不允许你与治安维持者对峙
When I ask you not to confront the vigilante,

597
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,260
你要听令
you will listen.

598
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,620
记住  你的面具别人也可以戴
Remember, your mask can be worn by another.

599
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,290
你知道兜帽男是谁  对吧
You know who he is under that hood, don't you?

600
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,140
我再清楚不过了
I know exactly who he is.

601
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,250
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

602
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,060
怪不得你不希望他死
That's why you don't want him dead.

603
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,630
死亡是一种解脱
Death would be a release from this life,

604
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,740
他还没有接受审判
and his sentence is yet to be carried out.

605
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,840
我要摧毁他所在乎的一切
I am going to tear everything he cares about away from him.

606
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,570
制裁所有追随他的人
Destroy those who choose to follow him.

607
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,090
蹂躏他至爱之人
Corrupt those he loves.

608
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,980
待他失去了
Once he has lost everyone

609
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,420
所有至亲至爱
and everything he values...

610
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,460
我再用箭刺穿他的头颅
I will drive an arrow through his eye.

611
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,150
莎朵
Shado...

612
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,240
莎朵
Shado!

613
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,950
不
No!

614
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,230
为什么
Why?

615
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,720
我...
I...

616
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,840
艾沃开枪打死了她
Ivo just shot her.

617
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,720
不知道为什么
He didn't say why.

618
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,070
不管是谁做的
Whoever did this to her...

619
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,410
我要他血债血偿
has got to suffer.

620
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,570
还有幻觉吗
Still have a ghost problem?

621
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,590
没有了
No.

622
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,120
我明白意思了
I got the message.

623
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,430
不过...
But we...

624
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,370
还有其他问题
We have other problems.

625
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,980
要没问题就奇怪了
Wouldn't be us if we didn't.

626
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,430
罗伊被注射了血清
Roy was injected with the serum.

627
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,940
天啊  他怎么样了
Oh, my god, is he ok?

628
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,750
还活着
He's alive.

629
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,670
不过我们得看着他
But we are going to have to keep an eye on him.

630
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,930
塞勒斯·戈尔德呢
And Cyrus Gold?

631
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,150
死于周六  周日安葬
Died on Saturday, buried on Sunday.

632
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,990
但他还有个同伙
But he was working with someone.

633
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,340
我看见他戴了一副面具
I saw him, he wore a mask

634
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,080
上边画着  骷髅
with the image of a...of a skull.

635
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,960
他想大批量生产血清  然后建立军队
He's trying to mass produce the serum to build an army.

636
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,880
为什么
For what?

637
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,590
你是一名军人
You're a soldier.

638
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,430
军队的首要天职是什么
What's the primary purpose of an army?

639
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,780
战争
War.

640
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,280
巴里呢
Where's Barry?

641
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,990
他回中心城市了
He went back to Central City.

642
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,150
想及时赶回去
Wanted to get home in time

643
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,230
看他们打开粒子加速器
to see them turn on the particle accelerator.

644
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,300
我接个电话
I should take this.

645
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,300
到了吗
Did you make it?

646
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,500
我及时赶回了中心城市
I made it back to Central City in time,

647
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,900
不过我很怀念尖端科研实验室与世隔绝的生活
But I missed the cut off in line at S.T.A.R. Labs.

648
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,120
跟往常一样  我迟到了
I was late, as usual.

649
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,660
但是我可不想再迟到了
But in spirit of not being late again,

650
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,810
你什么时候觉得
uh, if you ever decide that

651
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,970
奥利弗·奎恩不适合你
Oliver Queen isn't the guy for you;

652
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,560
或者觉得
if you decide that

653
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,660
想跟不一样的人
you want to go on a date with

654
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,440
约会
someone else, um...

655
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,930
我想告诉你  那个人一定会准时的
You should know that that guy, he'll be on time.

656
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,350
很好
Good to know.

657
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,800
我给奥利弗留了个东西
Oh, hey, and I left something for Oliver.

658
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,250
希望他会喜欢
I hope he likes it.

659
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,210
再见  巴里
Bye, Barry.

660
