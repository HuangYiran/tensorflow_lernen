00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're built to dust crops.

97
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you know what will happen if you push it too far?

98
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wing flutter, metal fatigue, turbine failure.

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Turbine failure? - Oh, no, I'm going down!

100
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why didn't I listen to Dottie?

101
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, why don't you listen to Dottie?

102
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She's the smartest mechanic in the world!

103
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, my gosh! - What?

104
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- The orphanage! - No.

105
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Not the orphanage! - Kids, out of the way!

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kaboom!

107
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The kids!

108
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow! That was vivid and specific.

109
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And exactly why I need you to come with us to the qualifier.

110
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're unbelievable.

111
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. Did you hear that? I'm unbelievable.

112
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The orphans!

113
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tune in, in two weeks for the start of the Wings Around the Globe.

114
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, I think we've got a really good shot at this, buddy.

115
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah! Especially if I finish this book by then.

116
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! I love this show!

117
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The 10 best air crashes of all time!

118
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Whoa! Oh. -  Not good.

119
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How does that happen?

120
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That is not going to buff out.

121
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, this might not cover everything you could run into out there.

122
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you getting at? - I don't know.

123
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just wondering if maybe we need, uh, some help.

124
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Help? From who?

125
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, well, like the Skipper.

126
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That old Corsair down at the end of the runway?

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Sure, he's a war hero. - He's an old crankshaft.

128
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My buddy, Sparky, says the Skipper

129
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}was a legendary flight instructor in the navy.

130
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right. He knows stuff.

131
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's been grounded for decades.

132
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why would I want to be coached by a plane who doesn't even fly?

133
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At least he's a plane.

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The number one crash of all time...

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, man!

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm okay.

137
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ooh! That's got to hurt.

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They say he shot down 50 planes.

139
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I heard stories about his squadron, the Jolly Wrenches.

140
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

141
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They were the roughest, toughest, meanest flyers in the navy.

142
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ruthless killers who showed no mercy.

143
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Uh, wait, so... - No mercy!

144
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They would shoot you as soon as look at you.

145
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I hope you're right about this.

146
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Chug!

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll wait here.

148
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh...

149
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, there, Skipper.

150
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Say, I'm trying out for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

151
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I know you can't fly anymore,

152
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but, you know, they say, "Those who can't do, teach."

153
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So...

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, what I mean to say is, you're not a truck.

155
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, I was wondering if you would train me?

156
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go on, he's warming up to you.

157
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, I heard you shot down 50 planes.

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You looking to be number 51?

159
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh... No.

160
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no, no! Wait, wait.

161
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just... I figured, with my guts and your glory...

162
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your guts would be a grease spot on a runway somewhere.

163
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go home. You're in over your head, kid.

164
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, you flew all those...

165
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's try the back door.

166
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,010

186
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, with all that self-promotion, at least he's modest.

187
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,360

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now he's back on that stick. Up he goes! Up and away!

284
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now only two-tenths of a second behind Fonzarelli!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sixth place, but what a close one, people.

293
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, folks, that wraps up the trials for the Wings Around the Globe Rally.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That was a heck of a run.

296
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, I think you actually missed a pothole!

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Man, you got to be the worst,

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean the worst delivery truck that has ever delivered a delivery!

304
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I help you?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I knew I'd remember. There he is, strutting on over here.

321
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you're mispronouncing it slightly.

322
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I am? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Smell that? It's like daffodils

332
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and like Sunday dinner. I just love it. I love it.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you familiar with the racing fuel additive, nitro methane?

337
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah! Zip juice! Go-go punch!

338
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That stuff will blur your vision and slur your speech.

339
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}-It's illegal. - Totally illegal.

341
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That substance was found in the tank of the fifth-place qualifier, Fonzarelli.

342
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Illegal fuel intake is an automatic DQ.

343
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, so you're saying...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? Are you serious?

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoo! Dusty.

351

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bad idea.

362
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You'll end up a smoking hole on the side of a mountain

00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}with your parts spread over five countries.

364

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What makes you say that?

365

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And some of them don't even finish.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You need to be tighter getting in and out of your knife-edge.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

373

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! I'm telling you to forget all this racing malarkey.

377
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You just ain't built for it. You're a crop duster!

378
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't think I know that? You don't think I know that?

379
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm the one who's been flying back and forth

380
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}across the same fields day after day, month after month, for years!

381
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have flown thousands of miles

382
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I have never been anywhere.

383
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Not like you.

384
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You were built to fight, and look what you did!

385
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're a hero.

386
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just trying to prove that maybe, just maybe,

387
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can do more than what I was built for.

388
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what? Just forget it.

389
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You'll never understand.

390
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}0500, tomorrow. Don't be late.

391
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait. 0500?

392
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, 5:00 a.m.

393
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Sparky, binoculars.

394
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Those are some mighty clean optics, there.

395
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What do you use? Some kind of shammy?

396
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, no, it's a special microfiber cloth. - Ah. Microfiber.

397
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, lint-free, scratch-free. I'll get you some.

398
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got an ex-Navy buddy who sells them to me wholesale.

399
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I helped him set up his web...

400
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Knock it off. We got a lot of work to do.

401
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I'll hook you up. - Thanks.

402
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, Dusty, remember this.

403
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It ain't how fast you fly, it's how you fly fast.

404
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Roger that. - Show me what you got.

405
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Watch this! Oh, yeah.

406
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great, you can go up and down. What else?

407
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Show me your turns. - Here we go!

408
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You think that was good? That stunk! Knife-edge those elm trees.

409
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. Keep your nose up!

410
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Skip.

411
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You want speed, right? - Yeah.

412
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Serious, bolt-rattling speed? - Oh, yeah!

413
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then look up. Do you see those clouds?

414
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The highway in the sky.

415
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tailwinds like nothing you've ever flown.

416
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you waiting for?

417
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, power up. Firewall thrust.

418
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Max torque, max torque!

419
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, looking good.

420
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold V-Y, Dusty. Max rate, now.

421
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Your nose is too high. Get your nose down.

422
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're going to stall. Ease off the pitch. Nose down!

423
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh!

424
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, what are you doing?

425
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What just happened up there?

426
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm low on fuel.

427
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do I look like I was built yesterday?

428
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No, no. It's a long story. - I got time.

429
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh...

430
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, well, um, you know,

431
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I feel like I was having some problems with my axial compressor so...

432
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Jolly Wrenches have a motto, Volo Pro Veritas.

433
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It means "I fly for truth."

434
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Clearly, you don't.

435
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sparky, push me back to the hangar.

436
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm afraid of heights.

437
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- But you're a plane. - I'm a crop duster.

438
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've never flown over a thousand feet.

439
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you kidding?

440
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Scared of heights and you want to race around the world?

441
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, Skip, during the attack of Tujunga Harbor,

442
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}why, even the P-38s had trouble at high altitudes.

443
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, they didn't have to fly over the Himalayas, did they?

444
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll still be low to the ground, just high up.

445
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And after the war, those 38s went on to win races.

446
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Really? Is that true?

447
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, true. Like in the Cleveland race of '46.

448
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- For real? - Wait, it gets better.

449
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}In '49, the P-38 Sky Ranger averaged 337 miles per hour.

450
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, 337?

451
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, actually 337.4, but they round it down in the record books.

452
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why would you do that?

453
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Some people just have no respect for decimal points.

454
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. - Why couldn't they round it up?

455
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Seriously, he... - All right, all right.

456
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, you're a flat-hatter. We'll work on that.

457
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But for now let's see if we can turn low and sloppy into low and fast.

458
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Roger that.

459
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It'll go like this.

460
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The flag marks the start line.

461
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Across the cornfield, three silos are waiting for you.

462
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Slalom those with a radial-G pass.

463
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait. "A radial" what pass?

464
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Once you get to the trees,

465
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}go to your optimal rate of climb to about 500 feet.

466
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Roll inverted and extend, trading altitude for air speed

467
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- and dive toward the finish line. - Uh, okay.

468
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You string all that together, you might have a chance to beat him.

469
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who am I racing?

470
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here he comes.

471
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's a twin commuter pushing about 1500 horsepower.

472
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, he's pretty high up.

473
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're not racing him, you're racing his shadow.

474
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Beat it to the water tower.

475
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's do this! Thread the silos!

476
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Tighter! Lean into your turns more.

477
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- His turns are terrible. - Yeah.

478
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go, Dusty. Faster.

479
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're falling behind.

480
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Begin your climb and catch him in the dive.

481
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Start your dive now.

482
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Never mind, you already lost.

483
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, we can increase power or we can decrease drag.

484
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Definitely increase power.

485
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}More torque means more speed.

486
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Lousy.

487
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, let's work that radial-G turn.

488
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do it again. One more time. Again!

489
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on! Push it, Dusty!

490
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Better!

491
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Remember now, altitude for airspeed.

492
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Gravity is your ally.

493
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The laws of physics govern speed.

494
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, Dusty. Give this run all you've got.

495
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Use your radial-G.

496
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let gravity work for you.

497
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looking good. That's what I'm talking about.

498
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Firewall the throttle! Go! Go! Go!

499
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got it, Duster!

500
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Begin your climb!

501
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, altitude for airspeed.

502
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Catch him in the dive!

503
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dive now!

504
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Ballistic!

505
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He kicked Aston Martins out there!

506
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Dusterino! - He's ready.

507
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Whoa! - Oh, that's cool.

508
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The piston and cross-wrenches. Your squadron insignia.

509
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You've earned it. - It fits you.

510
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- It fits you, Dusty.  - Now, listen.

511
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When the race starts and all those planes take off,

512
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}it'll stir up a bunch of swirlies

513
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}just like the Wrenches ran into in the Battle of Airway.

514
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Roger that. Sure wish you were coming with me, Skip.

515
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just radio back when you get to the check points.

516
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll be your wingman from here.

517
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Volo Pro Veritas, fight'?

518
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Volo Pro Veritas.

519
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Kick some tail, buddy. - We're all proud of you.

520
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoo-hoo! Dustmeister!

521

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow.

522
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Break, break.

523
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Air racer number 7, Air racer number 7.

524
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you read? Kennedy approach, over.

525
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm Dusty Crophopper, I'm looking for JFK airport.

526
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Crophopper 7, you are supposed to be on the Carnice visual.

527
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Turn further left, heading 1-9-5.

528
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maintain 1,000 feet. Intercept the 22 right localizer.

529
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You are cleared for the ILS 22, right approach.

530
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Roger. -Heavy is sectored in behind you.

531
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Run that by me one more time.

532
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Turn further left, heading 1-9-5. Maintain 1,000...

533
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Never mind. I got it.

534
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you see him?

535
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, radar does, but I don't see diddly.

536
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Check out this pavement! Nice! It's so smooth.

537
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Crophopper 7, you passed Foxtrot. Turn left onto Charlie.

538
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hold short at 22.

539
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, I thought...

540
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Get off the runway! - Whoa!

541
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh. Sorry. - Go back to Jersey, you bum.

542
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me, where can I...

543
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey-ho, do you mind? I'm working here.

544
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sorry.

545
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A nice enough guy, but way too much baggage, if you know what I mean.

546
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, there. I'm looking for pit row.

547
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The pits? Oh, yeah, that's easy.

548
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want to go down this way toward the fire station.

549
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then taxiway alpha forks off to the left.

550
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But don't go that way. You want to veer right.

551
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And if you get to the orange barrels, you went too far. So...

552
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just go straight ahead and to the right.

553
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great, thanks. Hey, nice paint job.

554
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, thank you! I'm kind of proud of it.

555
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I think he was talking to me. - Oh.

556
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, looky who's here. The Scandinavian.

557
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hey. Uh... - Miss your home town?

558
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't. Just about blocked that memory out of my mind.

559
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you're bringing it right back with that...

560
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, man, that nasty Vita-mina-stink-a-bunch.

561
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,450

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Landing gear down.

750
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, and locked.

751
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Begin your flare.

752
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Power back a little.

753
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Touchdown! Nicely done!

754
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks for your help, matey.

755
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I couldn't have done it without...

756
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You? You saved me?

757
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What did I tell you, boy? Every plane for himself, right?

758
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where I come from, if you see someone falling from the sky...

759
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, but this is a competition. Now, you're dead last.

760
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I owe you my life.

761
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you crying?

762
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't cry, I'm British!

763
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks, matey.

764
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure thing, Bulldog.

765
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I gotta say, crop duster, you are a nice guy.

766
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey. Thanks, Rip.

767
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And we all know where nice guys finish.

768
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah!

769
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dead last.

770
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You sad, you drink.

771
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Thanks. Great advice.

772
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At least you are not last in the race for love.

773
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Rochelle?

774
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Her passion is, sadly, not for me.

775
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Tough break, El Chu.

776
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

777
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My name is Franz, and I am a huge fan.

778
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I have fans? - Oh, no, no, no. Just me.

779
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I would like to say danke for representing all us little planes.

780
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh... You're a car.

781
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I am what you call a Flugzeugauto,

782
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}one of only six flying cars ever built!

783
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Whoa! - Guten Tag, Herr Dusty.

784
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am Von Fliegenhozen.

785
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Didn't you just say your name was Franz?

786
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nein, nein, nein.

787
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Franz is a guy with no spine

788
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}who is in charge when we putter about the cobblestones.

789
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}In the air, I am in charge.

790
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This guy needs to get his head gasket checked.

791
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Serious identity issues.

792
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This from the one wearing a mask?

793
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Touche.

794
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are both pulling for you, Herr Dusty.

795
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks for the support. I need all the help I can get.

796
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I have a humble suggestion.

797
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Would you not be much faster

798
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}without the pipes and tank and whatnot weighing you down?

799
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My Sprayer. Again?

800
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. Why carry around the extra weight?

801
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The little crazy car is right.

802
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Perhaps you need to start thinking like a racer.

803
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is reversible, right?

804
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Oh. Hey, you're being careful down there, right?

805
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa. Ooh! Yep, that's cold.

806
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So?

807
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, what do you think?

808
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wunderbar, Dusty.

809
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fantastico.

810
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is freeing, yes?

811
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, you took the words right out of my mouth.

812
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}BYE-DYE, sprayer!

813
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks for everything, Franz... Er, Von Fliegenhozen.

814
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guten luck, Herr Dusty.

815
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}BRENT'. It's our third leg

816
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and we've already lost several competitors to equipment failure.

817
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But the real story here, Brent, is Dusty Crophopper.

818
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Absolutely.

819
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's passing one flier after another.

820
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}BRENT'. That's right. This guy was built to dust crops,

821
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but he's dusting the competition.

822
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's next, Colin?

823
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Brent, this could be Crophopper's leg, all the way.

824
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The racers will have to fly under a hard ceiling of 1,000 feet.

825
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stay under the clouds and in the hills.

826
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Number 20 is disqualified.

827
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What a move. Incredible.

828
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Look at that radial-G pass. - Oh, yeah!

829
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}From last place, all the way up to eighth.

830
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. Ripslinger, you were built for racing.

831
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}RIPSLINGERI Yeah! You knowit.

832
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So how can a crop duster out-fly you?

833
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Wait, what? -There he is!

834
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:55,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty!

835
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Wow! - How do you keep up with the pros?

836
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did working on the farm make you stronger?

837
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty! Why do you fly so low?

838
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why are they wasting their time with him?

839
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's a tractor with wings.

840
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually, it's a really compelling underdog story.

841
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's like Rocky.

842
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's more like David and Goliath.

843
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Or Old Yeller. - That's not an underdog story.

844
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Well, there's a dog in it. - Enough!

845
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, enough!

846
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, they shot Old Yeller at the end, you twits.

847
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Spoiler alert!

848
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Soon, we'll be overrun by every banner tower, skywriter and air freighter

849
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}who thinks they can be one of us.

850
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That farm boy forgot who he is and where he came from.

851
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's not about to stop me from making history.

852
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty, Dusty, where did you learn to race?

853
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}From my coach, Skipper.

854
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's the reason I'm even here. He's an amazing instructor.

855
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And a great friend.

856
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He flew dozens of missions all around the world.

857
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I'm sure, if he could, he'd be with us right now.

858
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa, your engine sounds kind of rough.

859
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Must be a mag misfire.

860
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's probably not a good night for flying anyway.

861
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Okay. Come back soon. - Hey, you got anything new?

862
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm glad you asked.

863
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm now selling these one-of-a-kind Dusty commemorative mugs.

864
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Huh?

865
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa!

866
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is Dusty Crophopper calling...

867
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- I'll be back in 10. - Dusty, eighth place!

868
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Way to go, Dustmeister!

869
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hey! You finally removed your M5000. - His what?

870
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}His Micro-Air-5000-D-L Aerial Applicator.

871
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Use your words.

872
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}His sprayer.

873
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right! Sprayer.

874
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty, you got a big leg tomorrow.

875
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - How you feeling?

876
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can't believe it. The mighty Himalayas.

877
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty, that vertical wind shear

878
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}is going to be wicked over those mountains.

879
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, the good thing about being that high up,

880
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you see, there's not a lot of oxygen.

881
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, if you crash, no explosion.

882
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Great, Chug.

883
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course, you could die of hypothermia

884
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or an avalanche could get you.

885
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then, of course, there's pneumonia, or even frostbite.

886
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Chug, Chug, I got it.

887
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Skip, what if a guy wanted to fly

888
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}through the mountains instead of over them?

889
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bad idea. The Wrenches flew through terrain like that

890
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}in the Assault of Kunming. And Dottie is right.

891
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wind coming over the peaks can stir up rotors

892
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that'll drag you right down.

893
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you ask me, it's time to lug-nut up.

894
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can fly a whole lot higher than you think.

895
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Roger that. - Hola, corazen.

896
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Are you tired? - What?

897
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because you have been flying through my mind, nonstop.

898
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hmm. And why would I be tired flying through such a teeny, tiny space, huh?

899
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can only pretend for so long.

900
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, El Chu, what's the problem?

901
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am Icarus and she is the sun.

902
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I fly too close and I melt.

903
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe you're trying too hard.

904
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, all you got to do is go over, open your mouth and say...

905
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hello.

906
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wha... Uh...

907
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Whoa.

908
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}El Chupacabra!

909
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:05,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think someone is calling me. I have to go.

910
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wanted to compliment you on your success, Dusty.

911
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're doing very well for your first race.

912
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aw, that means a lot, coming from you.

913
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, come on,

914
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you were named most aerodynamic racer by Air Sports Illustrated.

915
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And let me just say, you are so aerodynamic.

916
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty.

917
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's with all the tractors around here?

918
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're sacred.

919
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Many believe that we will be recycled as tractors.

920
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. Well, I believe in recycling.

921
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Have you ever been to the Taj Mahal?

922
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No. No, I haven't.

923
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. Let's go.

924
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It must be nice to be back home.

925
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, it's complicated. I have a billion fans.

926
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And they're all expecting me to win.

927
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Maybe this time, you will.

928
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow.

929
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This place is amazing.

930
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It really is.

931
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And tomorrow, you'll fly over the magnificent Himalayas.

932
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Those little hills? Yeah, well... No big deal.

933
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You like to fly low, don't you?

934
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. Oh, that? Uh, that's strategic.

935
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Air density and, uh, combustion.

936
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know, you could follow the Iron Compass, instead.

937
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:57,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Iron Compass? - Yeah, rail road tracks.

943
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a short leg ahead, but extremely treacherous.

944
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

949
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hello?

950

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Is this where I'm supposed to be?

951
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That is one of life's great questions.

952
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm dead!

953
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,470

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't understand. Have the others left already?

956
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually, no one else is here yet.

957
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,930

959
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He flew through a what?

960
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- A tunnel? - That is crazy!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Si, crazy like a Firefox.

962

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But more than anything, I'm just happy I fit through that tunnel.

965
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys, I gotta tell you, if you're ever in a tight squeeze just...

966

973
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Aren't those made exclusively for Ripslinger's race team?

974
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Are they? - Yeah. Yeah, they are.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You set me up. - Look, I didn't ever want to hurt you.

977
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Why? -It's complicated, okay?

978
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You could have gotten me killed out there today.

979
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I really thought that you'd just turn around.

980
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, you were wrong.

981
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I was wrong about you.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you knew the truth about my past,

1220
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:46,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}would you have asked me to train you?

1221
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

1222
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Dusty.

1223
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty?

1224
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can you believe it?

1225
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He hasn't been straight with me this whole time.

1226
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}At least you were honest.

1227
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You said I wasn't built for this.

1228
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I guess I should have listened to you.

1229
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:36,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty, if you had listened to me I would never ever forgive myself.

1230
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, the Skipper may have been wrong for what he did,

1231
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but he was right about you.

1232
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're not a crop duster. You're a racer.

1233
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And now

1234
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the whole world knows it.

1235
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks, Dottie.

1236
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That means a lot.

1237
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:11,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've gone as far as I can go. I'm busted up, look at me.

1238
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, look at you.

1239
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:24,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Dusty, I cannot bear the thought of competing without you.

1240
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:28,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, that's the wing of a T-33 Shooting Star.

1241
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}When the great Mexican Air Force needed help,

1242
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}American T-33s came. They did not ask questions.

1243
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They did not hesitate. They were there.

1244
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:42,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because that ts what com pad res do.

1245
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And what's that?

1246
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That is my lunch. Don't touch.

1247
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But the wings are yours.

1248
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}El Chu, I really appreciate...

1249
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Silencio.

1250
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}After all, you helped me with my pursuits of the heart.

1251
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now we are here to help you.

1252
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- We? - Oui.

1253
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:06,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good luck tomorrow, Dusty. I am so proud to compete with you.

1254
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:10,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're a good egg, Dusty. Look, here's a sat-nav device.

1255
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just in case...

1256
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}In case you ever find yourself lost, you know, without a...

1257
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Without a friend to help you through it.

1258
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you, Bulldog.

1259
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:23,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here's a flow control valve for you.

1260
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How about a starter generator?

1261
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is honor to fly beside you.

1262
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks, everyone. Really.

1263
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is fantastic.

1264
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looks like all you need now is a...

1265
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A new propeller?

1266
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How about a Sky Slycer Mark Five?

1267
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:46,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, that's your propeller. You could still win the race.

1268
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I intend to, but with my old propeller.

1269
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one didn't really suit me.

1270
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I think you will have a lot better luck with it.

1271
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks, lshani.

1272

1273
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Does a PT6A have a multi-stage compressor?

1274
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh...

1275

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes! Yes it does.

1276
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, you guys, let's get him ready to race.

1277
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one's...

1278
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What'?

1279
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hmm.

1280
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are live from Mexico. And here they come.

1281
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is it, race fans. The final leg back to New York.

1282
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,200

1285
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,880

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You gotta hand it to him. He never gives up.

1287
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, Chug, we have a jet to catch.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}New York City. Finish line, here we come!

1289
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey. So are you ready to go, Skip?

1290

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Probably best if I don't.

1291
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:17,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What...

1292
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh. Okay.

1293
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

1294
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1295
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Dusty! - He's back.

1296

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got to be kidding me.

1297
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Who's that guy? -It's the crop duster.

1298
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Another one? -It's the same one, Knucklehead.

1299
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Move aside, idiots.

1300
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bolting on a few new parts doesn't change who you are.

1301
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I can still smell the farm on you.

1302
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what? I finally get it.

1303
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:04,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're afraid of getting beat by a crop duster.

1304
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, check six, because I'm coming.

1305
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:11,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And what are you punks looking at?

1306
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Nothing. Nothing. - Sorry.

1307
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:19,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We are going to end this, once and for all.

1308
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Yeah, man. - This is going to be fun.

1309
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This one's all about speed and the willingness to give it all.

1310
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}First to cut the ribbon in New York takes home the trophy and the glory.

1311
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ya!

1312
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And we're off as the first flyers take to the air.

1313
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I will wait for you at the finish line, hermosa.

1314
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no, no. I will be waiting for you.

1315
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ya!

1316
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:02,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The rest of the field is now off and running.

1317
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And though Crophopper did not complete the previous leg,

1318
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:08,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}race officials ruled his radio had been tampered with.

1319
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So he'll be allowed to compete.

1320
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But with a severe time penalty.

1321
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've never seen someone come back from this far behind.

1322
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's going to take both horsepower and willpower

1323
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:36,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to even have a chance.

1324
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good show, Dusty.

1325
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Um, boss? - What?

1326
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He's here.

1327
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, we're out of camera range.

1328
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what to do.

1329
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, farmer. Time to plow the fields.

1330
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:38,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Looks like you've run out of airspace, Crophopper.

1331
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey!

1332
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Skipper? Whoa! - Dusty, pull up!

1333

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Skipper? You're flying!

1334
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, you noticed.

1335
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Listen, I got Rip. You take care of the other two.

1336
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Got it.

1337

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They're on your six, kid. You gotta lose them.

1338
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm trying.

1339
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Skip, I can't shake them.

1340
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pull hard right. I'll break left and take out Rip.

1341
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Use the rocks. - Roger that!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, that's going to leave a mark.

1345
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

1346
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Say hello to the Warsaw Windmill.

1347

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Whoa! You're crazy! - That's right.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That was pretty good for a crop duster.

1350
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And not bad for an old-timer who doesn't fly.

1351
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:01,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Well, I may be old, but at least I ain't afraid of heights.

1352
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}on, okay.
