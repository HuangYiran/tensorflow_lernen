1
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,670
哦 天啊
Oh, boo ya.

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,207
现在让我瞧瞧有什么可大惊小怪的
Now let's see what all the fuss is about.

3
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,459
这个太像突击者了
Oh, this is so Raiders.

4
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,498
希望这个方舟里能有更少的纳粹面孔
Here's hoping this Ark contains less Nazi-face-melting goodness.

5
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,551
哦 是尤那达人
Oh, the Una Mens...

6
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:39,829
确实是 他们来了
Indeed. They are coming.

7
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,330
而且他们很饿
And they will be hungry.

8
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,033
让我走 僵尸男! 
Let me go, zombie boy! 

9
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,702
惠彻 等等
Whicher, hold on...

10
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:52,341
她已被捕 竟敢玷污血法
She is claimed. Yet dares to defile the blood laws.

11
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,343
她将被交给尤那达人
She will be delivered by the Una Mens.

12
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:56,845
而你伙计 你应该被交给一个牙医
And you need to be delivered to a dentist, buddy.

13
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,182
你的呼吸问起来像是雪人的屁眼
Your breath smells like the anus of a Yeti.

14
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:02,117
来自袭击避难所的人类大胆言论啊
Bold talk from the human who attacked a place of sanctuary.

15
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:04,119
惠彻 你犯了一个错误
Whicher, you're making a mistake.

16
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,621
你应该放她走
You should just let her go.

17
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:09,792
我一直告诉你我不是人类
I keep telling you I am not human.

18
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,807
蛮可爱的嘛
That's cute.

19
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:29,444
你看到了 这个女人不是你要找的
As you can see, this one cannot be the one you're looking for.

20
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:32,146
- 她是... - 宝贝 纯异种啊
- She is... - All Fae, baby.

21
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,582
感受下热度吧!
Feel the heat!

22
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,318
这怎么可能
How is it possible?

23
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,688
- 我弄错了? - 嘿 妖无完妖
- I am mistaken? - Hey, "pobody's nerfect".

24
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,656
我们会带她离开这的 使者先生
We'll get her out of here, your emissary.

25
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:45,492
下次我见到她 她的皮会被剥掉
The next time I see this one, her skin will line

26
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,494
放在在尤那达人的神圣屋中
the Una Mens Holy chambers.

27
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:04,378
- 我把他骗的团团转 - 走吧
- I totally had him. - Let's go.

28
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,113
谢谢 无为侦探
Thanks, Detective Do-Nothings.

29
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:09,216
你怎么不用厚重的狼爪一下拍在他屁股上?
What, you couldn't have whomped his ass with your massive wolf paws?

30
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,785
然后错过了秀? 不错啊 小火花飞溅
What, and miss the show? Nice work, Sparky.

31
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,220
太悬了 肯吉
That was too close, Kenz.

32
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:15,255
那些临时能量不是个好主意
These temporary powers are not a good idea.

33
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,067
不过很有必要 
Yeah, but necessary, 

34
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,624
因为我是个恐怖分子 记得吗?
because I'm a terrorist, remember?

35
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,493
闻起来像向日葵和夏敦埃酒的恐怖分子?
You terrorists all smell like sunflowers and Chardonnay?

36
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,330
好吧 我得带汀科贝尔回家了 好吗
Okay, I'm gonna take Timkerbell home, all right?

37
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,365
是啊
Yep.

38
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,801
- 你先请 - 我做文书工作吧
- After you. - I'll go do the paperwork.

39
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:29,502
向日葵?? 什么烂比喻
Sunflowers?? Nice.

40
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,645
这儿没人 戴森 别闻了
No one's here, Dyson. Stop sniffing.

41
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,682
只有你 我 还有丁字裤 哈?
Just you, me and the, uh, thongs, huh?

42
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,318
顺便说一句 这儿的丁字裤真不少
That's a whole lot of thongs, by the way.

43
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:50,256
你要知道 这些都是业务需要
Well, I will have you know, that these are all business thongs.

44
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,360
我根本不想知道那是什么意思
I don't even wanna know what that means.

45
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,768
不过我明白你为什么需要这么多丁字裤
I can see why you need all this stuff, though.

46
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,969
一种填补空虚的方式嘛
Sort of fills the place up a bit.

47
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:11,142
好吧 如果你想问的话 我不孤单 老狼
Well, I am not lonely, if that is what you're asking, wolfie.

48
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:14,579
事实上 我没问
I wasn't, actually.

49
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:21,319
和我在这里你怎么会孤单?
Why would you be lonely with me here?

50
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:29,760
那是个...不错的问题
That is a very... good question...

51
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:00,023
该死...
Shit...

52
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,060
是不是所有的狼都这么浪漫?
Are all wolves this romantic?

53
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,846
我只是在想黑尔 我... 
I'm just thinking about Hale, I... 

54
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,131
你想的挺开
That's very open-minded of you.

55
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,734
他疯狂地爱着你 对吗?
He's crazy about you, right?

56
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:15,472
我们什么时候开始...这样的?
Since when are we... this?

57
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:20,744
议会的来了
More Council douche-hats.

58
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:25,647
不是 闻起来太过...愉快了
No, smells a little too, uh... pleasant.

59
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:29,986
你好
Hello.

60
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,964
请你...
Please...

61
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:35,624
我需要和天才私家侦探聊聊
I need to speak with the talented private investigator.

62
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:36,993
我叫艾尔弗
My name is Aife.

63
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:38,794
女士 我记得你
I remember you, lady.

64
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:41,764
你让阿什说话像个蝙蝠侠 滚吧
You made Ash who talks like Batman, go boom.

65
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:53,008
哦 这个季节穿山羊皮? 你这个红颜祸水
Oh, suede, in this weather? You beautiful badass.

66
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:57,312
- 让她走 - 我不是来这打架的
- Let her go. - Look, I'm not here to fight.

67
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,281
我需要帮助 帮我找到女儿
I need help, finding my daughter.

68
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,716
她的名字叫波
Her name is Bo.

69
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:04,085
波
Bo.

70
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:09,229
听起来像个哥们名字 我说的对吗?
Kind of a dude's name, am I right?

71
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,129
当你不知你是谁时 生活会很艰辛
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.

72
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,031
当你知道真相后 生活会更艰难
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

73
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,667
我的爱伴随死神的降临
My love carries a death sentence.

74
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,770
我迷失了多年
I was lost for years.

75
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,705
在藏匿中找寻
Searching while hiding.

76
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,743
那个不为人知的属于我的世界
Only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans.

77
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:33,780
但我已厌倦躲藏 我要过自己想要的生活
I won't hide anymore. I will live the life I choose.

78
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,613
第四季第一集 为了记忆
4x01 - In Memoriam

79
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,556
所以你是淫妖?
So you are a Succubus?

80
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,460
那位曾试图刺杀光明派异种长老的淫妖
The Succubus who tried to assassinate the Light Fae elders.

81
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,628
- 我心里七上八下的 - 现在呢?
- I was agitated. - And now?

82
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:51,798
比以前好点 现在我有个更高的目标了
I'm less agitated. And I have a higher purpose:

83
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,767
就是找到我丢失的女儿
to find the daughter that I lost.

84
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,608
哦...我们之前见过
Oh... we've met before.

85
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,743
你没给我留下什么印象
You didn't leave much of an impression.

86
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:08,514
亲爱的 我之前见过很多男人
Ha. Darling, I've 'met' many men before.

87
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:11,417
无论如何 他们之后都会对女朋友说
And whatever they claim later in front of their lady friends,

88
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:13,652
他们印象深刻
they're always impressed.

89
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:17,556
但是我说的是近期 在塔夫特的...实验室
But I was speaking more recently. At Taft's... lab.

90
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,360
确实是 你当时在那儿
That's right, you were there.

91
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,764
所以你有一个三十岁的女儿?
So, you have a thirty year old daughter?

92
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:28,534
一位从未被听说或看见过的成年女儿?
A grown daughter no one has ever heard of, or seen... ?

93
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:30,202
是真的 没有任何记录
It's true, there's no record,

94
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,437
或者生理标志能表明我曾经生育
or physical indications that I ever gave birth.

95
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:34,206
然而淫妖的武器就是她身体
Though a Succubus' weapon is her body,

96
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,009
所以可以说 武器不会磨损
so there would be no wear and tear, so to speak.

97
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,776
你想自己找找吗?
Would you like to see for yourself?

98
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,778
找妊娠纹? 算了吧
Scanning for stretch marks? Pass.

99
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:44,782
我打心底知道我生了个女儿
I know in my heart I gave birth to a baby girl.

100
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,120
我知道会给她取我母亲的名字
I know I would have named her after my own mother.

101
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,538
我还知道这是她 
And I know this is her. 

102
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,789
当我发现照片的时候我就知道
I knew as soon as I found the photo.

103
00:07:51,824 --> 00:07:54,158
我赌五块那是她家猫的照片
Five bucks says it's a picture of her cat.

104
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:55,359
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

105
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,938
这个女人真... 漂亮
This woman is... beautiful.

106
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,575
如果你迷恋脸蛋和身材的话 随便了
Yeah, if you're into, like, faces and bodies. Whatever...

107
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:12,743
我们不感兴趣
We're not interested.

108
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:15,079
- 抱歉... - 我知道 你持怀疑态度
- Sorry... - You're skeptical, I get it.

109
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:17,114
我爸爸没养过傻子
My Daddy didn't raise no fool.

110
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:23,720
那是记忆线圈
That's a Recuerdo coil.

111
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,425
铁证如山 异种的记忆被弄乱了
That's hard proof that a Fae has been messing with her memory.

112
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,960
我只想知道为什么
I just want to know why.

113
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:34,264
我会付钱 当然了 我会给一大笔
I'll pay, of course. I'll pay well.

114
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,766
您的女儿 立马找到
One daughter, coming right up.

115
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,468
当然 是收取费用的情况下
With, you know, expenses, naturally.

116
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,636
那是自然
Naturally.

117
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,476
- 抱歉 - 等等 现在?
- Excuse me. - Wait, now?

118
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:49,879
每天的同一时间
Same time. Every day.

119
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:53,116
你已经找了一个月了 一无所获
You've been going for a month and you have found squat.

120
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,117
她救了我 
She rescued me. 

121
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,052
戴森 她开车带你跌下悬崖
Dyson, she drove you off a cliff.

122
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,321
我要是不转形的话早死了
And I would have died if I hadn't shifted.

123
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:00,923
所以我要找到塔米辛 找出原因...
That's why I need to find Tamsin. Find out why...

124
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,426
好吧 你欠我一次 让我独自面对客户和账单
Okay, you owe me for leaving me alone with the client, and the tab.

125
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,329
好消息 她打算接你的案子
Good news. She's gonna take your case.

126
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:10,700
你很幸运 肯吉是最棒的
And you're lucky. 'Cause Kenzi is the best.

127
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,571
我也赶时间 这周是军舰周
I'd like to get going, as well. It's Fleet Week.

128
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:17,739
- 好的 - 还需要点别的吗
- Okay. - Can I get you anything else?

129
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,575
- 让我来 - 棒极了
- Allow me. - Great.

130
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,744
我现在有些缺钱
I'm a little short right now.

131
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,747
也许我可以下次再来
Maybe I could come back sometime,

132
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,781
给你补偿...
make it up to you...

133
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,718
天啊 好的
God... yes.

134
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:39,460
女士 你缺经纪人嘛
Lady, what you need is some kind of manager.

135
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,478
新嗜好吗
New hobby?

136
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,482
你跟史黛拉闹矛盾了
Is this because of what happened between you and Stella?

137
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,617
什么
What??

138
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,785
没 没闹矛盾
No. Nothing happened.

139
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:08,188
没闹 是闹分手 还是你让她怀孕了
Nothing like it's just a break or nothing like you knocked her up.

140
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,289
别碰...
Don't touch... !

141
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,224
有些突发事件
Something's out of step.

142
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,794
有人干扰了时空平衡
Someone's been messing with the balance of space and time.

143
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,797
我打赌是新议会 他们看似很蛋疼
My money's on the new Council. They seem really easily butt hurt.

144
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:21,334
尤那达人是接近全知的委员会
The Una Mens are a near-omniscent council

145
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,803
异种当权唯一的目的...
of Fae authority who's sole purpose...

146
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:28,107
...确保旧规章能继续
...is to ensure the old laws are followed. Uh huh.

147
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,580
这是什么种子
What's with the seed?

148
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:36,783
尤那达人的一个象征
It's a symbol of the Una Mens.

149
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:39,318
他们袭击我们的移民队
They're descending on our little 'colony' because

150
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,788
因为之前几年里 事情真的变得很糟糕
things have gotten real messy in the past few years.

151
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,190
都怪比伯太红
I blame Bieber Fever.

152
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,762
他们 呃 不会...
They, um, wouldn't do...

153
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,363
使记忆丧失 是吗
memory loss, would they?

154
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,328
不会 尤那达人从不会做这种
No, the Una Mens would never stoop 

155
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,602
有失身份的...狡猾之举
to something so... subtle.

156
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,837
等等...怎么了
Wait... why?

157
00:10:58,871 --> 00:10:59,938
呃 新客户
Oh, uh, new client.

158
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:03,209
我得打击当地一个使人失忆的异种
I need a beat on the local Fae that can cause amnesia.

159
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:04,976
- 失忆症 - 嗯
- Amnesia? - Mm-hmm.

160
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,750
尖吻鲈 医生
Dr. Snook.

161
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:15,787
他是奥坎克斯 鱼类异种 靠记忆为食
He's an ortenax; fish Fae; feeds off memories.

162
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,655
同时也是一位眼科医生
Moonlights as an eye Doc.

163
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,991
鲑鱼类 明白了
Trout-tometrist. Got it!

164
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,994
说到医生 劳伦怎么样了
Speaking of Doctors, any word on Lauren?

165
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,767
她在塔夫特的手术中施计 之后又违背阿什
She tricked Taft during surgery, after disobeying the Ash.

166
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,532
她抛弃了光明派异种 
She abandoned the light Fae. 

167
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,804
她救了戴森的命
She saved Dyson's life!

168
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,008
很难搞懂路易斯医生是敌是友
It's always been difficult to know what makes Dr. Lewis tick.

169
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:44,014
那是因为她尴尬 拘束 害羞
That's because she's awkward, and formal and shy.

170
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,784
她挚爱的人已经死了
The love of her life is dead.

171
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,820
劳伦失去纳尼达后 一直在查找 
Lauren lost Nadia, then had to keep working

172
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:51,521
杀害她的真凶
for the people who killed her.

173
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,026
无论如何 她是我仅有的人类盟友
Anyway, she's the only other human ally I've got.

174
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,563
虽然这几天很少见到她
Even though I'm barely human these days.

175
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,098
我们的人在找她
We have people looking for her.

176
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,967
这我听说过 爷爷
Yeah. I've heard that one before, Gramps.

177
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:08,972
魔术师 诡计
Trickster. Trick.

178
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,475
阁下
Sir.

179
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,480
谢啦 这个...
Thank you. For this...

180
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,748
总之小心一点
Just be careful out there!

181
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,754
邪恶之面千变万化
Evil comes in many faces.

182
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,040
我看到了好多古驰和普拉达
I'm seeing lots of Gucci and Prada...

183
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,676
嗯哼...还有磨皮术 肉毒杆菌
Uh huh... dermabrasions, botox.

184
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:41,679
- 哈喽 - 简宁特
- Hello! - Janet!

185
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:47,018
简宁特 医生在吗 我们要见他
Janet, is the Doc in? We need to see him.

186
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:50,821
在床上有这笑容该多好
Now, with a smile like that, you could talk me

187
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,090
可惜不该在这里
into your bed, but not through those doors.

188
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,626
在我叫警察之前赶紧走
Now, skedaddle before I call the cops.

189
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:57,928
真正的警察
The real cops.

190
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,398
- 或者... - 或者...
- Or... - Or...

191
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,634
嗷嗷嗷嗷 够了
Ow, ow, ow, ow, okay!

192
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:07,437
- 坐下 待着 - 要翻滚吗
- Sit. Stay. - Roll over?

193
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:11,307
- 偷窥者... - 你没必要解雇保姆
- Jeepers Peepers... - You don't have to fire the Nanny.

194
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,143
什么事都没发生
The affair never happened.

195
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,414
你丈夫是在帮奥尔加舒展身体
Your husband was only helping Olga stretch.

196
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,950
让妻子忘掉丈夫的不忠吗
Helping wives forget their husbands cheated on them?

197
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,284
真高尚的催眠
What a noble calling.

198
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:23,420
尖吻鲈 医生 我们想问你一些问题
Dr. Snook. We have some questions for you.

199
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,955
你似乎在给人们灌输错误的记忆
Seems you've been messing with the wrong people's memory.

200
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,157
我们先到这里 简宁特 
We're done here. Janet, 

201
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,127
你能帮我 呃 收钱吗
could you, um, get the, uh, bill?

202
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:34,297
这边 亲爱的... 来这边
Come on, darling. Okay... this way.

203
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,332
好的 做的很好
Yep, you were great.

204
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:37,907
往这走... 好的 
This way... okay. 

205
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,135
哦 看看你...
Oh, look at you...

206
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,360
你真行 伙计 
Nice one, buddy. 

207
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,138
至于你们的好奇心 - 我还是 呃...
As for you curious carps. - I'm, um...

208
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:45,474
嘿嘿 冷静点
Hey, hey! Snook, chill.

209
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:47,476
只是问你几个问题
Just want to ask you a few questions.

210
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,412
不不 抱歉 尖吻鲈 只做记忆抽出
No, no, sorry. Snook only does memory extractions.

211
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,247
不做记忆修复
He does not restore them.

212
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:56,418
不过 这活干得漂亮啊
Although, that is some beautiful work...

213
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:57,919
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

214
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,261
我们都忘记了吧
I guess we forgot.

215
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,932
噢...
Oh...

216
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,268
不出所料... 转形者也有记忆线圈
as expected ... the shifter does have a Recuerdo coil.

217
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:18,306
不过正如尖吻鲈 所说的... 不是我干的
But like Snook explained... this is not my work.

218
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:22,443
好吧好吧 所以你想说
Okay. Okay, so what you're saying is somebody's

219
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,445
有人抽出了我们的记忆
been in here extracting our memories?

220
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,781
- 嗯 - 真令人不安
- Mm-hmm. - This is very disturbing

221
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:29,450
是的 你在说 也许我超级出名
Yeah, you're telling me. I could be famous.

222
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:32,286
我可能是卡戴珊吗
I could be a Kardashian?

223
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,321
你可能超害羞
You could be shy.

224
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,795
这人要很有天份
Someone very talented...

225
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,433
而且比尖吻鲈 要强大的多
and someone infinitely more powerful than Snook.

226
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,838
这个级别的记忆咒语
A memory spell of this magnitude,

227
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:54,074
你得找到并破坏那个记忆罗盘
you'd need to find and shatter the Recuerdo compass.

228
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,375
真邪恶 给我讲讲
Wicked, vault it to me.

229
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,279
易趣网 异种交换?
Ebay? Fae-jiji?

230
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:02,915
那个罗盘丢在了马达加斯加海滨
The compass was lost off the shore of Madagascar

231
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,286
- 埃斯梅・菲尔斯停留时 - 噢 完了
- when the Esme Fierce ran aground. - Oo, burn.

232
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:12,425
但据说拥有者花了一大笔钱
But rumor has it, that someone's paid quite a bit of money

233
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,427
捞了回来
to have it salvaged.

234
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,396
太好了 现在在谁手里
Nice save! So who's got it?

235
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,132
依哥拉姆 一个收藏家
Engelram. The Collector.

236
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,100
尤那达人之前的打击任务
Last bash before the Una Mens

237
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,803
一副总是无精打采的依哥拉姆吗
permanently party poops all-over this town Engelram?

238
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:26,438
- 是的... - 啊呸
- Yes...? - Ugh!

239
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:29,441
我听说他画廊里全是从古老异种那抢来的东西
I hear he keeps his gallery of antique-y Fae swag

240
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,977
锁的严严实实的
well under lock and key.

241
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,114
干嘛看我 我得监视富人异种的交易买卖
What, I keep tabs on wealthy Fae dealings.

242
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,317
出于科学研究嘛
For my science. Mmm...

243
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,454
以防万一 我跟戴森讲帮我们
But just in case, I will tell Dyson to score us

244
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,424
留两张票去看那个怂人烂秀
two tickets to this loser recluse's shit show.

245
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,227
不乐意小清新的社交哈?
Not a fan of a nice strawberry social?

246
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,897
跟异种? 知道他们以人类为食
With the Fae? Watching them dance and drink,

247
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,665
还看他们载歌载舞 歌酒升平?
knowing that they feed on my kind?

248
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,702
再别说什么光明黑暗派的假设游戏了
That their whole Dark/Light system is completely hypocritical?

249
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,937
本姑娘还是免了吧
No, thank you.

250
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,139
可是你有漂亮裙子穿哦
You get to wear a pretty dress.

251
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,242
我要走了 谢啦
I gotta jet. Thanks for the Oolong.

252
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:06,411
你忘记什么事了吗?
Um... Aren't you forgetting something?

253
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,180
人人都健忘的
We are all forgetting something.

254
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,381
我的戒指?
My Kingmoor ring?

255
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:25,295
谢啦 没别的了?
Thank you. Anything else?

256
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,639
我的夏夜女孩收藏!
My Lass of the Summer's Eve collector's item!

257
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,442
你知道这限量一千份吗?
You know they only made a thousand of these?

258
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:39,676
姑娘混口饭吃
Girl's gotta eat.

259
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,419
这是什么?
What's this?

260
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,361
哇哦 哇哦 你还好吧?
Whoa, whoa, whoa... are you okay?

261
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,364
把这位客户的一切告诉我
Tell me everything you know about your client.

262
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,672
不不不 我不生气 亲爱的
Oh. No, no, no. I'm not angry, darling.

263
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:12,011
我真心好奇
I'm genuinely intrigued.

264
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:17,316
当我说"设计一件配得上"
When I say "design me one last costume

265
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,318
"新黑暗异种领袖服装"时
befitting the new Dark Fae leader",

266
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:23,288
你怎么给我听成了"打扮一个性爱玩偶"
why do you hear: "Dress me like an asexual hobo?"

267
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,858
- 我... - 啊...
- I... I... - A-a-a...

268
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:29,661
我真心希望你意识到依哥拉姆的派对
I-I-du-du-do hope you realize Engelram's party

269
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,830
是本季最热最潮的活动
is "the" event of the season,

270
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,882
也是我最后野性的机会
and my last chance to get the freak on.

271
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:38,903
在议会到达 让一切乐趣荡然无存
Before the Council arrive, to put the moratorium on all fun.

272
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:41,773
乐趣 比如...
Fun like this, for example...

273
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,146
伐克斯!
Vex!

274
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:52,617
你无权来此 马默杜克
You got no authority here, Marmaduke.

275
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:55,686
无权? 我看明明就是个有恋母情结
Authority? All I see is a bully taking out

276
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,735
的恶霸在肆意发泄罢了
his Mommy issues on the help.

277
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,293
你可阻止不了我转化 伐克斯
You can't stop me from shifting, Vex.

278
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,630
一但我变身为狼 就紧扼你的喉咙
And once I'm a wolf, I'm going straight for your throat.

279
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,299
是吧 不好意思我也是个死脑筋
Yeah, well, I'm as stubborn as I am well endowed.

280
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,001
而且很偏爱墨西哥式对峙呢
And I do love a good Mexican Standoff.

281
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:15,839
好了?
Ol?

282
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,276
照片不错 
Nice picture, by the way.

283
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:23,881
是呀 我跟大家一样惊讶 
Yeah, I was as stunned as anyone to find out she had

284
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:27,751
她让我登上黑暗派的王位
named me heir to the Dark throne, so to speak.

285
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,820
临表涕言 不知所言啊
I shed so many tears.

286
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:32,989
不过我得坚强
But I had to stay strong.

287
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,659
这是死绝绝小姐希望的
It's what Miss Died-on-the-toilet would have wanted.

288
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,328
那你的先者若得知你要给光明派异种
And what would your predecessor say to you

289
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,096
收藏者舞会的入场卷的话
giving your Light Fae enemies...

290
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,231
又该对你如何评价呢?
tickets to the Collector's ball tonight?

291
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,234
你什么时候喜欢舞会了?
Hmmm... Since when have you liked balls?

292
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,938
我们要找回失去的东西
We need to get back something we've lost.

293
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:51,640
那我凭什么帮你呢?
And why the hell would I help you do that?

294
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:54,277
若你不帮
Because if you don't:

295
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:58,281
那我就告诉尤那达人...
I may have to tell the Una Mens that you...

296
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:02,150
你夸张了年轻伊娃的让位细节
exaggerated the details of young Evony's demise.

297
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:03,485
什么?!
What?!

298
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,256
我那时闻得到她 伐克斯
I can smell her back there, Vex.

299
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,827
- 她小小的细胞 - 她死了
- In her little cell. - She died.

300
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:16,031
腐朽不堪 没错 可她还没死绝
Oh, she's rotten, all right, but she's not rotting .

301
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:20,268
- 没人帮忙结束掉? - 你个疯子
- Not man enough to finish the job? - You're mental.

302
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,379
对伊娃来讲真是憾事啊
It's a shame about Evony, you know?

303
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:26,574
她是邪恶又神经质 不过是个好对手
She was evil and insane, but she was a worthy foe.

304
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:29,277
比你这个领袖强十倍
And ten times the leader you'll ever be.

305
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:33,981
好消息是...
The good news is...

306
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,985
你给三张依哥拉姆晚会的邀请
you cough up 3 invitations to Engelram's little shin dig.

307
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,721
我不揭发你
And I won't rat you out.

308
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:41,956
你看如何?
What do you say?

309
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:53,334
辛西娅? 给探长戴森拿几张
Cynthia? Could you provide Detective Dyson

310
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:56,203
我们富有盛誉的派对入场卷
with our complimentary party tickets?

311
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,873
没错 我的票
Yes! My tickets!

312
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:04,078
- 看来我不需要他们了 - 谢啦 伐克斯
- Looks like I won't be needing them. - Thanks a bunch, Vex.

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,848
当然 一旦我恢复记忆 我不保证
Of course, I can't guarantee that once I get my memory back,

314
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,883
我会让你保住这饭碗
I'll let you keep this cushy little job.

315
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:12,318
抑或是你的小命
Or your life.

316
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,980
别冲我笑 你个贱人
Stop smiling at me, you smug bitch.

317
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:30,370
这曾经是精神之夜
This used to be a spirit night.

318
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,306
我曾是阿什 如今却是耻辱
I used to be the Ash and now I'm a disgrace.

319
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,209
别让我在大庭广众下 泣不成声
Don't see me crying... in public.

320
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,977
姑娘们都在摇摆... 
Lot of ladies shaking their, uh... baby grands.

321
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:42,147
- 我可不在乎... - 好吧
- Not that I mind... - Yeah, well...

322
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:45,918
每年 一位女孩被选中单独会见收藏者
every year, one girl gets chosen to meet the elusive collector.

323
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:47,986
私会 富得流油吧
Elusive, as in, filthy rich.

324
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:51,990
与钱无关 也不是无价的异种收藏
It's not the money, or his collection of priceless Fae memorabilia.

325
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,026
依哥拉姆的双头蛇
Engelram's amphisbaena.

326
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:57,462
- 实现愿望的? - 没错
- A wish granter? - Yep.

327
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:59,831
有些幸运女生美梦成真了
So some lucky lady gets her deepest desires granted.

328
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:00,999
那不错啊
That's nice.

329
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,835
希望我的女神来了
I wish my lady would get here.

330
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:09,874
趾裂?
Toe cleavage?

331
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:15,046
真裂? 浓郁假发?
Real cleavage? Mata Hari wig?

332
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:30,727
嗨
Holla!

333
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:32,896
是肯吉
It's Kenzi.

334
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,069
我明白我们关系没那么好
Uh... I know we weren't always... copacetic.

335
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:45,008
可我现在急需你的灵光假设
But I could use your nerdy hypothesis on some color blocking right now.

336
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:50,914
我只愿你一切平安
And, um... I just hope... you're safe.

337
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,317
那么...
So...

338
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:58,188
如果收到这条信息 打给我 回个电话 劳伦
you know, if you get this, call me, call me back... Lauren.

339
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,024
好的 再见
Okay, bye.

340
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:17,870
你最好是来这推销饰品的
You better be here to advise on accessories.

341
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:23,320
我的新玩具 你想近看吗?
My new toy. You want a closer look?

342
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:24,321
瞧我烦什么傻?
Oh, what am I saying?

343
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,423
你这种女孩当然想近看看了
Girls like you always want a closer look.

344
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:29,693
什么耽搁了? 我一小时前就打给你了
What took you so long? I called you, like, an hour ago.

345
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:34,364
这东西可要鞭打的 转念一想 我也需要
This stuff doesn't whip itself. Come to think of it, neither do I.

346
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,565
东西给我
Give it to me.

347
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:42,372
火花提取哦
Wooo... Spark extract,

348
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:45,375
我家货可是来自与灵魂深处哦
mined straight from the genitals of a sprite.

349
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,577
别过度推销了
Ya, don't oversell it.

350
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,251
你还是让专业的来吧
You better let a professional handle this.

351
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:20,887
就这样?
That's it?

352
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:24,413
你的上两次都是记账来的
You're already on the books for your last two visits.

353
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:28,351
- 知道了 - 当然 如果现金周转不灵
- Noted. - Of course if cash flow is a problem,

354
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:33,221
还有别的方式能付嘛
there are always other ways to pay.

355
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,061
你没把我变成异种 你玩我
You didn't make me Fae. You tricked me.

356
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:43,198
我是只人类待宰羔羊躲在精灵的衣服下罢了
Now, I'm just a hot human sheep in twinkly fairy clothing.

357
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:45,366
那么躲在我天才捏造的伪装下
So shed my brilliantly concocted disguise

358
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,368
看看议会来敲你家门时
and see what happens when when the Council

359
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,736
会发生什么事吧
comes knocking on your door.

360
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:52,873
马西莫 拜托
Massimo, please.

361
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,242
我会给你钱的
I'll get your money.

362
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,386
很好 要不下次
Good. Or next time,

363
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:08,755
我会带咬人的东西来哦
I'll show up with something with teeth.

364
00:24:17,932 --> 00:24:20,667
我应该去审审那位 你觉得如何?
Maybe I should interrogate that one? What do you say?

365
00:24:22,437 --> 00:24:24,371
还真是对你的口味
You certainly got a type.

366
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,878
- 肯吉 - 肯吉?
- Kenzi. - Kenzi?

367
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:37,884
天啊
Oh, my God...

368
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:43,356
嗨 你们觉得怎么样?
Hi... Hi. What do you think?

369
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,357
我觉得你迟到了
I think you're late.

370
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,826
依哥拉姆已经选了他最喜欢的
And Engelram already has his eye on a favorite.

371
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,329
我还是能吸引他注意力 拿到罗盘针的 
I can still get the compass. Get his attention.

372
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:52,331
你成功吸引我的注意啦
You've got my attention.

373
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,801
听着 你可不能带只狼
Look, I'm just saying you don't bring a wolf

374
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:57,002
来照看羊
to guard the sheep.

375
00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:00,373
- 什么意思? - 看见那俩个了?
- What does that mean? - You see those two?

376
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,675
他们可是体育画册的封面
They've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

377
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,343
我喜欢运动
I like sports.

378
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:06,711
也许除了你的众多才能外
I'm just saying that despite your many talents,

379
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:09,381
这是你从未涉及的领域
maybe this is a little outside of your area of expertise.

380
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:12,184
我是说 我们需要个甜心杀手
I mean, we need a killer kiss here.

381
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,618
我会让你知道
I will have you know

382
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:16,355
我可勾引过不少款爷
that I have seduced many a rich-dork before.

383
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:17,923
大概吧
I think.

384
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:21,393
你到底还想不想要我们的记忆了?
Okay, do you want to get our memories back or not?

385
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:23,094
并忘了这个诡异瞬间?
And forget this magic moment?

386
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,401
你想看看我的技术活哈?
You wanna see my 'skill set'?

387
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:31,969
没问题 但愿你的筋骨活动开了
Fine. I hope you stretched.

388
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,415
嗨 你能帮我买杯酒吗?
Hi! Can you buy me a free drink?

389
00:25:49,154 --> 00:25:52,023
- 似曾相识 - 不 我是柯丽鸥
- Deja vu. - No, I'm Clio.

390
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,691
似曾相识什么的都是虚话
Deja vu came down with a case of the crabs.

391
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:55,359
聪明
Charming.

392
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:57,561
天啊 
Oh, my God...

393
00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,897
我认识你
I know you.

394
00:26:01,232 --> 00:26:03,567
你是个警察
Wow... you're a cop.

395
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:06,369
不管这是什么花招? 我不感兴趣
Whatever this is? I'm not interested.

396
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:10,040
- 我是仙女精 - 我真心不感兴趣
- I am a nymph. - Now I'm really not interested.

397
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:12,708
- 真伤人 - 被伤过 好吗?
- Ouch. - Just bad memories, you know?

398
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:15,045
醉倒龙舌兰 全裸
Tequila-soaked, nakedness.

399
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,381
我们可不都那么坏
You know, we're not all bad.

400
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:22,218
我们那样产卵罢了
We're just kind of spawned that way.

401
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,699
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four...

402
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,334
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four...

403
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:41,303
- 一 二 三 四 - 别数了 黑尔
- One, two, three, four... - Stop counting, Hale.

404
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,709
把我抱紧点 我可不是你的诺娜
And hold me closer, I'm not your Nona.

2
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:50,712
别扭了
Stop squirming.

3
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:54,316
该死 你现在就好像要扒我的衣服!
Dammit, act like you wanna tear my clothes off!

4
00:26:58,888 --> 00:26:59,888
神啊
Oh, golly.

5
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:03,892
这比你想要搭话还来得尴尬
That's more awkward than your attempt at small talk.

6
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,060
我同意 对不起
I agree. Excuse me.

7
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:12,300
- 伙计 她是我舞伴 - 当然不是
- I got it, partner. - You really don't.

8
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,042
那个深色皮肤女人是谁?
Who's the brunette?

9
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:23,844
你能闭会嘴 让我领着你么?
Would you just shut up and let me lead for once?

10
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:43,921
认真的?
Seriously?

11
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,033
也许我们原来做过这件事 
Maybe we have done this before. 

12
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,298
那个 我会记住的
That, I would remember.

13
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,153
最后一次托举
The final rose.

14
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,787
太原创了
How original.

15
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:23,159
看起来好像有些人要去私人住所了
Looks like someone's going private chambers.

16
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,003
当然 去掠夺战利品
Pirate booty, sure.

17
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:41,910
为什么不呢
Stuffed unicorn... Why not.

18
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:45,080
有人吗?
Hello?

19
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,320
极好的关门!
Great door!

20
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:53,355
太大声了
Really loud.

21
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:59,361
我喜欢这些箱子 十足的
And I love all your crates. Very Pottery Barn.

22
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:03,899
这个场景是不是像
Is this situation going Indecent Proposal?

23
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,735
因为我需要看看提前看看宝石 伙计
'Cause I'm gonna need to see the jewels up front, buddy.

24
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,380
欢迎...可爱的女孩
Welcome... pretty girl.

25
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:22,950
依哥拉姆先生?
Mr. Engelram?

26
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,622
很高兴为您服务务务
At your sssservice.

27
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:45,306
请别因为我而停下!
Please, don't stop yourselves on my account!

28
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,776



29
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:56,016
该结婚就结婚吧!
Make merry while ye may!

30
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,754
因为尤那达人正在来的路上!
For The Una Mens are on their way!

31
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,389
我也在我的路上!
And I'll be on mine, too!

32
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,059
当你勉强说出
As soon as you cough up what I,

33
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,762
黑暗派庄严的长老 也就是我 想要的
the venerable leader of the Dark, want.

34
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:12,265
那就是我想要的东西:狼
And what I want: is the Wolf.

35
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,768
嗷嗷嗷嗷
Ooowwww!

36
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:20,406
给我点钱 我带你离开这里
I can get you out of here for a price.

37
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:23,376
我认为我更想扯断他的喉咙
I think I'd rather stay; rip out his throat.

38
00:31:23,744 --> 00:31:26,279



39
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,414
你知道怎么用绳子下去吗?
Do you know how to rappel?

40
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:31,016
怎么 你从伊诗比蒂裙子上拿到了绳子?
Why, you got some rope in that itty bitty dress?

41
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:33,552
我需要做什么吗?...凭自己?
Do I have to do everything... myself?

42
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,323
哦 尖吻鲈 
Oh, Snook.

43
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:40,826
哦 你自力更生吧 老狼
Oh, you're on your own, Wolf.

44
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:46,632
你是什么?
What are you?

45
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,804



46
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:56,275
一个你的忠实舞迷...
a big fan of your dancing...

47
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,180
我是阿佩斯纳蜥蜴龙
And I am Amphisbaena.

48
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:05,349
慢点滚 斯莱特林
Slow your roll, Slytherin.

49
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:09,387
我只是想向里看看
I merely want to look inside.

50
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:13,792
所以我可以同意你未出口的愿望
So I may grant your unspoken wish.

51
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:15,732
不用了 我会说出来 
No need, I'll speak it. 

52
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,830
我想要里卡德・蒙特尔班
I want the Ricardo Montalban...

53
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:19,831
里克・马丁
Ricky Martin...

54
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:22,366
呃 
Uh, the, the Compass thing-y.

55
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:24,298
就这些? 
That's it? 

56
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,037
好吧...我还想要你的独角兽
Well... I'll take your unicorn too,

57
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,406
如果你想裁员的话
if you're looking to downsize.

58
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,275
看起来你的欲望永无止境啊
Just when it comes to unlimited wishes,

59
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,679
你这个肤浅的女人
you kind of landed on sssshallow.

60
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:35,946
好吧 你说话的样子
Well, you're one to talk.

61
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,249
就像那些学步小孩
Like those toddler-esque pores happen au natural.

62
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,185
现在
Now, now.

63
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:45,804
我只是每两个月蜕一次皮
I simply shed my skin every two months.

64
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:51,361
- 太不公平了 - 你可以试试
- That is so unfair. - You could try...

65
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:56,199
在你昏倒之前卸一下妆
removing your makeup before you pass out

66
00:32:56,233 --> 00:33:00,371
在午夜之时享用奶酪玉米和伏特加
atop your midnight helping of cheese popcorn and vodka.

67
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:02,572
我 啊哦
Me-ow.

68
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:08,378
- 回到话题上来? -对 不好意思 
- Back to the task at hand? - Right. Sorry.

69
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:11,914
我只是认为渺小的人类会有欲望
I merely thought the little human would wish

70
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,816
想要回报
for her return.

71
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,586
不
No.

72
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,156
还有 什么?
Also, what?

73
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:26,595
很遗憾
Pity.

74
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:30,899
你不知道你失去了什么么么
You don't know what you're misssssing.

75
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:33,602
我知道我想离开了
I know I'd like to get out of here

76
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,337
在你整个吞下我之前 所以
before you swallow me whole, so...

405
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:36,304
谢啦
thank you.

406
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:42,846
- 你叫我人类 - 我早就该发现了
- You called me human. - I should have realized it ssssooner.

407
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,317
你的探戈跳的太无力了
There was something so vulnerable about your tango...

408
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:53,355
- 噢 眼镜蛇大人 - 我给过你机会
- Oh, Cobra Commander. - I granted your wish,

409
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:57,726
现在我要整吞了你
now I "am" going to swallow you whole.

410
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:03,430
这不是很公平嘛
Isn't that a fair trade?

411
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:06,994
装扮不错呀 伐克斯 
Nice costume, Vex. 

412
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:08,936
你去年不还是个小挫样吗
Weren't you the impotent dick last year?

413
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:12,805
哼 现在是时候来看看是谁厉害
Well, now it's time to see who really is the bitch.

414
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,441
而谁刚刚死了
And who's just dead.

415
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:19,412
你大老远到这来
Did you come all the way down here just

416
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:21,181
就为了向我展示新鞋子吗
to show me your pretty new shoes?

417
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:24,850
恐怕不是 这是为了铭记
Hardly. This is about remembering.

418
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:28,387
或者 是确保没人记得
Or, making sure that no one else does.

419
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,257
你也失忆了
Your memory's gone, too.

420
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,195
我早就知道啦
I worked it out ages ago.

421
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:38,931
- 这才能解释一切 - 真的吗
- It's the only thing that makes sense. - really.

422
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:41,133
这更不对劲了
This is making less and less sense.

423
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:44,970
你真的认为我该成为莫瑞根吗
Do you really think I was meant to be the Morrigan?

424
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,976
我以前从未有过权力 我是说 不像这样
I've never really had power before. I mean, not like this.

425
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,112
如果
And what if...

426
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:56,448
大家的记忆会导致他们
the thing everyone remembers leads them

427
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:59,251
挑战我努力争取来的统治
to challenge my hard-fought reign?

428
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:03,121
我会不择手段来重掌权利
I did terrible things to get my mesmer back.

429
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,762
我都觉得很可怕 
Even for me. 

430
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:06,691
为我泪流成河吧伐克斯
Cry me a river, Vex.

431
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,462
我仍然会做噩梦 梦到自己孤独无助
I still have nightmares about being helpless.

432
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:15,834
无足轻重 穷困潦倒
 Unable to influence. Unable to feed.

433
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,968
但是 这...嗯
But, this... hm...

434
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:20,704
这样对我来说是最好的结果
this is about as good as it gets for me.

435
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:25,075
如果我让肯吉和大家想起没有我一切都很好
And I'm damned if I'm gonna let Kenzi let everyone else

436
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,612
那我就完蛋了
recall how good it was to be without me!

437
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,276
那现在要怎么办呢 伐克斯 
How's this going to work, Vex? 

438
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,385
你不能再催眠我一次了 我转变了
You can't mesmer me once.I shift.

439
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:40,757
对 不过... 还好我可以催眠你的同伴
Yeah, well... it's a good thing I can mesmer your mate!

440
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,794
伐克斯 别动他
Vex! Leave him out of this!

441
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,270
苍天啊
Evan-nescence!!

442
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,377
你什么时候这么大题小做了
Since when do you do the dramatic?

443
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,037
你想玩点大的吗
You want drama?

444
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,158
那我就杀了你
I'm gonna end you.

445
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,062
小箱子...
Small crate...

446
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,763
大箱子 蛇精来啦
big crate, snake man coming...

447
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,242
加油 小肯
Come on, Kenzi...

448
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,278
加油 你没朋友 没天赋 快长树枝呀
come on, you no friends, no talent, Glow Stick... !

449
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:39,681
好吧
Okay...

450
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,753
还我 不不不
"Pay me." No, no, no.

451
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,122
我要重新变回人类
Of all times to get my human back on... !

452
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,699
你曾经和我们并肩作战
You fought by our side!

453
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,902
对不起
Guilty!

454
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,406
你违反了伊娃协议
You betrayed our agreement about Evony!

455
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,308
再来呀
Harder!!!

456
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,114
你是爱肯吉的 你怎么能这么对她
You love Kenzi! How could you do this to her?!

457
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:15,449
我们都爱肯吉
We all love Kenzi.

458
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,715
可是你的手下正在处理她呢
Hell, your Alpha Male's 'doing' her right now...

459
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:24,891
前艾什真要杀了莫瑞根吗
Is the former Ash really gonna kill the current Morrigan?

460
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:27,593
我觉得尤那达人不会同意的
I don't think the Una Mens would like that.

461
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:29,929
那只有一个办法来证实了
There's only one way to find out.

462
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:07,399
- 大狼爪 - 忘了告诉你 发型真不错哦
- Massive Wolf Paws... - Forgot to tell you: love the hair.

463
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,235
哦 我的...
Oh, my...

464
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:25,649
伊娃
Aife?

465
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:31,255
好久不见了
It's been a long time...

466
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,171
你好 爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

467
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:45,669
指南针
The Compass!

468
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,373
- 它坏了 - 是因为被那个破坏了吗
- It cracked... - Well, did that do it?

469
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,376
不 你还有菜籽油
No, you still got canola oil.

470
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:57,180
等下...也许我们要让指针和北极重合
Wait... maybe we have to align the needle to the true North.

471
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:58,215
明白
Roger that.

472
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,952
- 肯吉... - 怎么了
- Kenzi... - What??

473
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:08,791
- 你一直都在我身边 - 你也是
- You've always been there for me. - And you for moi.

474
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,397
我愿为你献出生命
I would give my life for you.

475
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,401
永不抛弃你
I'd never desert you.

476
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:24,440
也许伐克斯是对的 这是最好的结果
Maybe Vex is right. Maybe this is as good as it gets.

477
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,808
也许
Maybe...

478
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:30,145
也许我们可以再进一步
Maybe we can make it better.

479
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,991
我..大概有八十条丁字裤
I... have, like, eighty thongs.

480
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:44,994
嗯 很棒啊
Well, that's great.

481
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:49,831
我是说 我 很孤独
I mean... I am... lonely.

482
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,804
而这 这一切 都是不对的
And this for... all of it, it isn't right.

483
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:57,439
这段时候都不对
It hasn't been for a while.

484
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:02,977
而我的 我的心很难受
And my... And my heart hurts.

485
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:05,446
戴森 我说不出原因
Dyson, and I don't know why.

486
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:13,955
而且 当你陷入爱里 你会知道的
Besides: when you're in love, you know.

487
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:17,601
对吧
Right?

488
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,028
嗯
Yeah.

489
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,401
不管发生什么 你和我 一起面对 对吧
Whatever happens, though, you and me, we're in it together, right?

490
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,939
嗯 生死之交 绝不重色轻友
Yes. Friends 'til the end. Bros before hoes.

491
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,241
- 豆吧的好兄弟 - 恩 全部同意
- Pals at the Dal... - Yeah, all that.

492
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:36,155
嗯
Yeah.

493
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:41,415
把它给我
Gimme that.

494
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,838
- 波 - 波
- Bo... - Bo...

495
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,345
不
No.

496
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,683
你好呀 爸爸
Hi... Daddy.

497
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:18,684
伊娃
Aife...

498
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:22,921
伊娃...别这样
Aife... please...

499
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:24,915
这是我仅剩的一切了
It's all that I have left.

500
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,426
是我的仇恨支撑我活下来
It's all that's kept me alive! Is my hate!

501
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:31,429
我知道有一天我们会重聚的
Knowing one day we would have our reunion.

502
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:35,300
而你会血流成河
And it would end in you spilling your cursed blood.

503
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,202
我会为我们找到她的
I'll find her for us.

504
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,080
这就是为她所做的
This is for "her!"

505
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,907
- 黑尔 黑尔 你没事吧 - 哦他没事
- Hale! Hale, are you okay? - Oh, he's fine.

506
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:50,077
真不错 海妖音超棒的
Very effective. Splendid siren-ing.

507
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:53,113
真高兴你没被蛇咬到 小肯
You know, I'm glad you didn't get bitten by the snake, Kenz.

508
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:55,917
我还得说 真喜欢
And I gotta tell you, I love what you're doing

509
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,151
你最近的睫毛
with your mascara these days.

510
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,719
- 我也是 - 对不起
- I do, too. - I'm so sorry...

511
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,221
不 停 停 我们要找到她
No, stop... stop, we're going to find her.

512
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:04,558
- 她失踪多久了 - 我们从哪开始
- How long has she even been missing? - Where do we even start?

513
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:07,094
通过找到
By finding whomever could have erased

514
00:42:07,128 --> 00:42:09,096
消除我们爱的人记忆的家伙
the memory of the one we love most.

515
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,667
哦 你会后悔的 那躺着几个古老的魔术师
Oh, you'll regret it. There lies some old, wild magiks.

516
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:18,171
不不不 戴森 你不能走
No, no, no... No, Dyson, you can't go now!

517
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,609
最后见到波生还的是塔姆辛
The last person to see Bo alive was Tamsin.

518
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:25,878
好吧 那你还等什么 快去
Well, then what are you waiting for?! Go, go!!!

519
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:28,682
你没事吧
Are you okay?

520
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,984
小肯 我们要谈谈
Kenz... we need to talk.

521
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:35,421
她没回来之前 我都没法呼吸
Not until she's back. I can't even... breathe.

522
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,758
我得走了 好么 我得走了
I gotta go. Okay, I gotta go...

523
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,091
波
Bo?

524
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:18,796
波
Bo...

525
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:23,200
噢 我想起来了...
Oh... I remember...
