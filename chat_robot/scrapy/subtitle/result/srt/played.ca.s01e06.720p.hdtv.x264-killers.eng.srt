1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,410
- Everyone in the back, into the kitchen. - Excuse me?

2
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,160
- Let's go, move! - Ok, all right.

3
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,930
Mr. Gazi, I was just about to call you.

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,380
I talked to Raman, he said I have more time. That's not what he told me.

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,170
He said I should come and break some bones.

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,040
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, no! Wait! no!

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,280
C'mon, don't do this. Please.

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,120
Calm down, just... You don't have to do this, all right?

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,450
I can get you the money. Just give me one more day.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000

13
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,470
- Good run? - Jesus!

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,590
You scared the hell out of me.

15
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,870
You have any idea how easy it is to get in here?

16
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,570
You should try locking your door for starters. Yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,820
What's going on? Rebecca called an early briefing.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,510
You weren't picking up so... I decided to come by.

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,110
You thinking about putting some furniture in this place?

20
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,800
I got the important stuff. How long have you been here, four months?

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,490
- Six and a half. - Six and a half months?

22
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,840
And you have one plant, and you killed it.

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,220
Look at that. Look, it's a metaphor.

24
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,600
Just because you're divorced doesn't mean you have to live like a slob.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,560
Separated. All right? There's a big difference.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,330
All right. I'm just saying, John.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,450
This isn't a home, it's depressing.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,570
Does Emily stay here? Where... where does she sleep?

29
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,710
Alright. That's enough, okay. I'm going to have a shower.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,810
- Make yourself some coffee, if you want. - All right.

31
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,690
- Hey, look at this. - Who's that?

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,610
He's been cracking her up for the last twenty minutes.

33
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,150
You have any idea who that guy is? None.

34
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,070
...they're pointed at you, so...

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,390
All I remember is you were a sloppy drunk.

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,870
- I was an exceptional drunk. - Oh. Okay, I remember it.

37
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,450
That you... uh, I remember shots of tequila lined up.

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,400
I remember, correct me if I'm wrong, lime green underwear.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,490
- More of a minty green. - Oh, I see.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,260
I do remember you drinking me under the table, though..

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,900
What's this, an early briefing?

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,110
John, there you are, good.

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,280
- This is Marcus Jakes, he's a U.C. - Right.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,170
Hey. John Moreland, in the flesh.

45
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,190
- The stories I hear about you, brother. - How you doing?

46
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,190
Jakes and I were in uniform together. Same division.

47
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,590
Small world.

48
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,920
I used to make her laugh so hard that coffee would shoot out her nose.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,910
She still do that?

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,650
- All the time. - Okay. So. Briefing.

51
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,600
- Right. - Yeah.

52
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,320
Ali Raman, runs a protection racket.

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,210
Illegal gambling, torture, murder.

54
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,490
He's got an underground fight club, it's pretty intense.

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,710
Yeah, I've heard of this guy, he's a borderline psychopath.

56
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,160
Jakes has been deep undercover.

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,470
- Eight months. - Cool.

58
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,530
My path into Raman's operation has been through his lieutenant. A guy named Ric Gazi.

59
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,920
- Oh. Look at that. - It's magic.

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,830
Ok, I'm in deep with Gazi... Worked my way onto his crew.

61
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,130
And you've been doing what?

62
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,120
You know, collections. Trashing stores, intimidating folks, that kind of thing.

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,750
I could arrest Gazi right now, but he is not my focus.

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,600
I want this guy. I want Raman, I want the boss.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,050
- Major Crimes is asking us to help out. - Why, where's your handler?

66
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,880
The handler was Stu Crowder, he's out of the picture.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,590
Out of the picture, what does that suppose to mean?

68
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,490
What happened to him? Uh, whiskey...

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,190
...happened to him. Followed by gin, followed by paint thinner,

70
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,660
if that's what he had around. After a while he just stopped checking in.

71
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,450
I'd called for surveillance, and backup, I get nothing.

72
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,880
I was completely on my own.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,810
So, what can we do for you, Mr. Jakes?

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,610
My boy Gazi, he's got ambitions.

75
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,960
He's wants to take out Raman. He's planning a hit.

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,790
We can't let that happen.

77
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,850
- So we're going to get in front of it. - Mh-hmm...

78
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,600
You are going to be my old friend John the hit-man.

79
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,650
I'm going to introduce you to Gazi.

80
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,050
You're gonna meet him, you're gonna talk to him, you're gonna take the contract.

81
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,020
- And then we pick him up. - Conspiracy to murder, that's big.

82
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,480
Yeah, I need him out of the way. I need a clear shot at his boss.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,290
I want Raman in prison, not dead.

84
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,310
Alright, listen up. Our first step... Just wait a second.

85
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,990
How do you know about this hit he's got planned? He told me.

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,110
So you didn't offer?

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,280
No, of course not.

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,240
What's your point?

89
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,240
My point is, is just I want to know what I'm walking myself into here.

90
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,040
Make sure this meet is clean.

91
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,570
Relax. I know what I'm doing. The job is solid.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,790
Jesse, you'll cover things from the inside, you'll be a fighter, training at Raman's club.

93
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,010
You'll be our eyes in there.

94
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,940
I'm going to have to wire you.

95
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,620
With what you're wearing, I'm gonna have to do your chest.

96
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,500
- Can you take your shirt off? - Yeah.

97
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you kidding me?

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,880
What?

99
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,890
Nothing.

100
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,580
Come here.

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,310
Gazi will be at the club, that's where he does business.

102
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,190
Jakes, you're gonna walk John inside, introduce him. We'll be recording everything.

103
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,880
As soon as Gazi offers John the contract, we got him.

104
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,160
Alright, they just came in.

105
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,930
Jesse, make sure you keep them in sight. Copy that.

106
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,570
On the face of it is completely legit, but after hours it's a whole different thing.

107
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,020
The gloves come off, bare knuckle fights. A lot of gambling, a lot of blood.

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
- They never get shut down? - No, never.

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,330
Raman knows exactly who to pay off, and exactly how much.

110
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,630
The guy in there right now, the guy behind me, green shirt,

111
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,620
that's the trainer Duffy, Eli Duff. He runs all the fighters.

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,360
Every single one of them does double duty as enforcers. The kid in there with him, that's Gavin.

113
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,950
If you don't pay your debt, he comes by, he breaks your arms.

114
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,200
Ok.

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,190
So, over there. That's my guy Gazi,

116
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,370
Raman's second in command.

117
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,300
He wants Raman gone so he can take over the whole operation.

118
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,360
He's a little paranoid, so don't take it personally.

119
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,130
Well, he's planning to kill his boss, I'd be paranoid too.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,400
They're approaching Gazi. There he is.

121
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,170
What... whoa, wait, wait, wait for it, wait.

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
Chewy says he's sorry, won't be late again.

123
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't say I never gave you nothing.

124
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,070
Oh, this is my friend. This is the guy.

125
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,050
- The guy I told you about. - How you doing? John.

126
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,260
He does the thing, the service.

127
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
I have no idea what you're talking about.

128
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,830
What did I tell you? He hates new people, this guy.

129
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,780
Gazi, we had the conversation, you wanted to meet a guy,

130
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,970
<i>now you're meeting him.</i>

131
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,970
- What's happening? - I don't know. Looks like a stand off.

132
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,870
You're imagining things, my friend. You need to walk away right now.

133
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,350
I told him this was a bad idea.

134
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,630
- He's got zero judgment, this guy. - What are you talking about?

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,350
You think he's going to discuss business in front of all these people? Come on.

136
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,660
Apologize. Come on, let's go.

137
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,150
You're killing me here, you know that?

138
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,660
Tell him we're gonna meet somewhere else. Brickworks, north side.

139
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,200
- Yes. - In the parking lot.

140
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,870
Alright that'll work, that's good. I'll ask him.

141
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,110
Brickworks, north side, parking lot.

142
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,030
Be there in twenty minutes, your last chance.

143
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,890
Alright, they're on their way out.

144
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,690
When we're going to wait here in the car. Let Gazi come to us.

145
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,030
When he comes in, let him drive the conversation.

146
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,900
- Don't lead him, alright? - All right.

147
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,240
Maria and Danny are going to be at 2 o'clock running spin.

148
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,320
What's he thinking with these tinted windows,

149
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,620
how are we going to see Gazi when he's in the backseat?

150
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,840
Rebecca will be in the lot behind us. She'll have eyes on the entrance.

151
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,290
Here's Rebecca.

152
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,620
Ok, she's in position.

153
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,090
It's good to see Rebecca, she looks good.

154
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,690
You two getting along? Most of the time.

155
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,800
Yeah, she takes a while that one.

156
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,290
You two will be fine.

157
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,540
She's worth it. She's one of a kind, seriously.

158
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,190
The best cop I've ever known.

159
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,530
John, Gazi's approaching the entrance.

160
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,870
Get ready.

161
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,820
We got eyes.

162
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,380
OK, here he is. We're good, Gazi's alone.

163
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,080
- John, do you have a clear view? - Yeah, we're good.

164
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,950
- What is he doing? - Is he gonna get out?

165
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,550
Relax. He's just being cautious.

166
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,990
Come on, Gazi.

167
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,810
Alright, here we go.

168
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,260
Shots fired, Rebecca Where's... where's the shooter?

169
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,640
There he is, by the warehouse. Daniel, stay with him.

170
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,380
I got him. I got him, he's headed south. We're in pursuit.

171
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,420
Shots fired. Brickworks, north side parking lot, send an ambulance.

172
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,530
Alright, hold on.

173
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,890
All I'm saying is this whole thing is based on Jakes' information.

174
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,280
Jakes' judgment, all right?

175
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,480
If he was doing his job, he would have known about the hit.

176
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,560
- But you're not placing blame. - No I'm not placing blame.

177
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,190
Rebecca, wait, okay?

178
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,660
I've worked with guys like this before, all right?

179
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,490
- They fly by the seat of their pants. - And you don't?

180
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,440
If Gazi was exposed... he should have been on top of that...

181
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,530
He didn't know it was going to happen, John. You would have made the same call.

182
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,120
I know this guy's a friend of yours, all right,

183
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,380
but maybe you've got a blind spot for this guy. Do you ever think of that?

184
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,860
He's a good cop, you need to back off.

185
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,220
Ric Gazi was DOA at Mount Sinai.

186
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,580
Homicide wants you to call.

187
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm sure they do.

188
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,600
You're gonna have to give a full statement. We all are.

189
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
- Shooter? - He got away.

190
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,200
I had no idea guys, I swear to God.

191
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,070
So, what happened. Raman caught wind of the hit?

192
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,400
Found out his boy's coming after him, got there first?

193
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,740
- Yeah, must have been. - Could have been a pre-emptive strike.

194
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,250
It means you might be done, Jakes. Too bad. That's eight months work down the drain.

195
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,900
Or maybe it works in my favor.

196
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,790
It's an opportunity, maybe it's a chance to move up.

197
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,610
How do you figure that?

198
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,740
You're one of Gazi's boys, Raman's going to smell you a mile away.

199
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,990
All I gotta do is make a move, guys.

200
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,160
I just gotta send a message. Show Raman that I'm loyal, that I wasn't involved.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,740
John could be right. You could be next in line for a bullet.

202
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,990
And if my guys are with you, they're in danger too.

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,710
We need to make sure Jakes is safe. That's our next move.

204
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,100
We could put Jesse in as a fighter slash enforcer, maybe?

205
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
He's already been in the club. He's established.

206
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,900
John?

207
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,630
Yeah, he could be looking for extra cash. Jakes, you can walk him in, make the intro.

208
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,900
He could be one of your boys. It'll give us a sense.

209
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,190
If anyone looks at you sideways, Jakes, that's it, we're out.

210
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,310
Copy that. Kid, I hope you know how to fight.

211
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,100
Raw talent, quick learner.

212
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,130
You need a guy to do collections, he can do that too.

213
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,750
You said you were looking for new people. How you doing?

214
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,860
Where'd you find him? This girl I know, he's her kid brother.

215
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,250
She's insane, she thinks he's the next big thing.

216
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,770
Maybe she's right.

217
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,190
Yeah, listen kid, this is Duffy, you do exactly what he says, all right?

218
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,660
Yeah.

219
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,230
Throw him in there with Gavin, see what he does.

220
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,730
First spar doesn't go to one of my boys.

221
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,320
It goes to me.

222
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,500
Good luck, kid.

223
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,900
Alright, here we go.

224
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,050
Take it easy on him, Duff.

225
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,050
Come on, Jesse, here we go, make this count.

226
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,520
Keep it together. Let's go, let's go.

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,920
Watch his feet, c'mon.

228
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,650
That's it, that's it, wait for an opening.

229
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,920
That's alright, you got this, c'mon!

230
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,550
Shake it off.

231
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,590
Come on, stay on him. Let's go, let's go.

232
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,670
Alright, Duffy, I think you made your point.

233
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,430
Alright, you can let him up I think. He can't breathe.

234
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,010
Let him up, man. What are you doing?

235
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,570
Your boy's okay. Tell him to come see me later.

236
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,460
You made the right choice, by the way.

237
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,870
You had a front cross. You saw it, but you didn't take it.

238
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,450
You let Duffy smoke you. You noticed?

239
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,230
I did the same thing, my first time.

240
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,530
You're gonna do just fine here.

241
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,850
Come on.

242
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,230
What'd I tell you? I'm safe, we're good to go.

243
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,240
- What have you got? - All right. Bear with me.

244
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,510
Raman is in the business, among other things, of collecting debts, right?

245
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,400
And sometimes he buys a debt from someone else.

246
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,800
For example, you're a gambler. You're Gambler Dan.

247
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,230
And you owe John here, two-fifty, three hundred grand. You're not paying.

248
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,840
And Gentleman John here is an old friend of mine from way back, you know, he's not a violent man.

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,380
He can't go around breaking people's fingers,

250
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,010
he doesn't have the stomach for it.

251
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,550
So I bring Raman the debt, and he buys it for, say, I don't know, 50 grand.

252
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,890
He's like a collection agent.

253
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,800
Now Gambler Dan owes him. And if he doesn't pay, his legs get broken.

254
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,710
But we've already established, John as a hit-man.

255
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,660
But no one knows that.

256
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,610
They only saw him in the club. So why was he in the club?

257
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,840
- You were introducing him to Gazi. - Right.

258
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,620
Because of the debt Gazi was going to buy. And now that Gazi's dead...

259
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,810
You're going to take it all the way up to Raman.

260
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,210
Yes... This is the move I've been waiting to make.

261
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,280
Raman goes after gambler Dan...

262
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,070
And just as he's about to break some fingers...

263
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,100
In comes the dream team. Guns a'blazin. Ready to make some arrests.

264
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,140
Loan sharking, extortion, assault.

265
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,990
Guys, what do you think?

266
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,750
It's not terrible.

267
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,460
Thoughts?

268
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,040
Let's do it. Let's take it for a spin.

269
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,780
Yes?

270
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,910
Marcus.

271
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,590
This is John Bain.

272
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,210
Pleasure. Please sit.

273
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,780
Marcus, has told me about your predicament.

274
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,750
I love my sister.

275
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,200
Only she has terrible taste in men.

276
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,800
He's a gambler, they were together for two years.

277
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,720
He stole three hundred thousand from her.

278
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,840
And when she found out, he became very violent.

279
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,360
He almost killed her.

280
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,180
And now you want your money back.

281
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,520
I want him to pay.

282
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,190
I want your personal attention on this. I hear you're the best.

283
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,100
Can you do it?

284
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,300
Possibly.

285
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,980
I'll need time to have Gavin check him out.

286
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,160
Whatever you need. He lives at 19 West Elm Street.

287
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,220
John has a special request.

288
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,970
Go ahead.

289
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,980
I want to be there when you do it.

290
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,020
When you collect.

291
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,360
I want to look into his eyes, when you're making him pay.

292
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,200
Hey. John asked me to check into Jakes' files.

293
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,680
Really?

294
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,470
Yeah, and I think we might have a problem.

295
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,150
So I've been pulling all of Jakes' case work from the last eight months. And it's full of holes.

296
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm not surprised, the handler was AWOL...

297
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,410
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's just the handler.

298
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,300
I mean, he's got paper, just not a lot of evidence.

299
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,110
There's no video, there's no audio.

300
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,600
His hand-written notes are sketchy at best.

301
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,860
There's nothing here that would stand up in court.

302
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,970
And there's this woman, Abi Rand.

303
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,150
Jakes has been using her as a CI. Former heroin addict.

304
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,970
Her information hasn't led to a single arrest, and yet he keeps paying her.

305
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,820
Thousands of dollars for nothing.

306
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Look, this all could have an explanation,

307
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,530
but if Jakes is lying to us, if he's out of control...

308
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,890
So he's sleeping with his C.I. Probably, yeah.

309
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,420
I'm going to bring her in, talk to her.

310
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,110
- Have you looked at the case work? - It's a mess.

311
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,210
It could be the handler. You're going to blame the handler on this one?

312
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,280
I know Jakes, he would never jeopardize a case like this.

313
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,250
Rebecca, you knew him fifteen years ago.

314
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,500
If you ask me, I think you should shut down this whole thing right now.

315
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,070
Maybe he's been in too long...

316
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,550
Rebecca?

317
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,710
He believed in me, John.

318
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,360
He was the first.

319
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,810
He use to say, "I'd follow you anywhere. "

320
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,540
"I'd walk off a cliff for you. "

321
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,700
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on this.

322
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,340
- What's the C.I.'s name? - Abi.

323
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,740
Alright, when she comes in, Maria should talk to her,

324
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,630
not you.

325
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,040
We need to know we can trust Jakes.

326
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,790
Until then, I'll look after things myself, all right?

327
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,210
I'll cover Jesse at the set-up house. Soon as Daniel checks out Raman, we move.

328
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,700
Put Jakes' play in action, Gambler Dan.

329
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,540
You want to head over, take a look inside?

330
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,390
Not yet. We're gonna sit tight. See who comes and goes.

331
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,580
So what happens if he won't pay? Rough him up a little?

332
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,700
We're just doing research, that's all.

333
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,970
Alright, they're in place. Let's give it a few minutes.

334
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,920
<i>I'm ready. Just say the word.</i>

335
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,030
I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out.

336
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,520
So, the boss is Raman. And Gazi, he got shot, he's dead.

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,830
But then, Duffy, he's the one who gives you the orders, right?

338
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,670
You ask a lot of questions.

339
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,720
Whatever, we don't have to talk.

340
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,810
Okay, Daniel. Any time.

341
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,980
Here he is.

342
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,830
Sweet car.

343
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,100
That's a hundred grand easy, right there.

344
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,840
Yeah, that's him, that's our guy. No question

345
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,950
- Are you kidding me? - What?

346
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Hang on a sec.

347
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,730
What's wrong? I don't believe it.

348
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,960
- That guy arrested me. - What?

349
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,230
Like seven, eight years ago. That guy's a cop!

350
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,000
What? You're sure?

351
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,180
My first bust, man. I'll never forget his face.

352
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,250
- Daniel, you just got made. - You're kidding me.

353
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,960
You're busted. Stay in the house, stay out of sight.

354
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,980
Man, what are the friggin' odds?

355
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,390
So what are we gonna do?

356
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,710
What do you think we're gonna do? We're going to tell the boss.

357
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,900
Son of a...

358
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,980
Ah, come on...

359
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,520
What are you doing?

360
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,930
You want to tell me where I am?

361
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,090
Abi, I'm Detective Constable Cortez.

362
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,570
Am I under arrest?

363
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,470
Are you a confidential informant for Marcus Jakes?

364
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,290
Is this your C.I. number?

365
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,830
Was I supposed to memorize it?

366
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,350
What about this, is that your signature?

367
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,330
Where's Marcus?

368
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,200
These are all payments made to you,

369
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,870
in exchange for information. False information by the looks of it.

370
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,540
But he kept paying you.

371
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,390
Are you sleeping with him, Abi?

372
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,640
He's not paying me for sex.

373
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,700
- Is Marcus Jakes your boyfriend? - So what if he is?

374
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,150
I get it, Abi. You probably thought you'd never get in trouble for this.

375
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,880
I mean he's a cop, right?

376
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,410
Here's the thing, though, it's bogus information.

377
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,890
It won't hold up in court. You both knew it.

378
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,900
That's an offence.

379
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,860
I should arrest you, right now.

380
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,420
- I want to talk to Marcus. - That's not happening.

381
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,890
I can't go to jail, okay? I can't. I can't do that.

382
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,440
I need to show you something. Do you know who this man is?

383
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,110
Abi?

384
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,200
Can you tell me his name.

385
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,900
That's Chip.

386
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,930
- That's my ex. - Do you know who did this to him?

387
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,570
He was stalking me, he wouldn't leave me alone.

388
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,360
Abi. He almost died.

389
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,670
Who did this? Who was it?

390
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,190
It was Marcus. Marcus did it.

391
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,120
Chip came by my apartment and Marcus just lost it.

392
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,250
I thought he was gonna kill him.

393
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,720
What are you doing man, what are you doing here?

394
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,250
- Hey, can I come in? - Yeah, come on in.

395
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,190
Uh... Give me a minute.

396
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,800
- Alright. - Yeah.

397
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,080
- Nice digs. - Yeah, it does the job, right?

398
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,980
This place wired?

399
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,130
Bedroom's on the fritz, but you know...

400
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,370
Yeah.

401
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,570
- Here you go. - Thank you.

402
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,600
So you had a late night last night?

403
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,570
What are we doing here, what's going on?

404
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,230
Rebecca's worried about the case.

405
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,280
She wants you to come in.

406
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,560
What else is new? She loves to worry, that girl.

407
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,300
That what you came by, to tell me? Could've just called.

408
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,240
- Your phone's off. - I would've got the message.

409
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,220
So how's Danny-boy? How's our play shaking out?

410
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,390
Daniel...

411
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
got made.

412
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,660
- He, what? - Yup.

413
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,840
- What did he do? - The muscle guy, Gavin.

414
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,050
Turns out Daniel arrested him back in the day.

415
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,160
- You're kidding me. - Nope.

416
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,620
That's just bad luck, that's what that is.

417
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,220
Seems to happen a lot on this case.

418
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,890
Let me ask you something.

419
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,940
If I were to go through this whole place, what kind of contraband would I find?

420
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,640
What are you talking about?

421
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:40,070
Jakes, I've been here. I've done all this.

422
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,370
Okay? I know the temptations.

423
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,870
I must be good if I'm fooling you.

424
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,280
You're falling for the look, man. The props.

425
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,330
I'm squeaky clean. You know what, John?

426
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,940
I would have thought you of all people would know what I'm doing here.

427
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,670
I had to forget everything, but who I was.

428
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,820
Just to be this guy.

429
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,140
I watch guys get beaten every day and I just gotta stand there.

430
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,030
You think that's fun for me?

431
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,820
I'm doing police work, are you going to help me or what?

432
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,090
We talked to Abi. We brought her in.

433
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,130
She told us the full extent.

434
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,750
She's prepared to testify.

435
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,780
- The full extent of what? - You've been collecting debts.

436
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,440
You've been there when guys have gotten beaten.

437
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,480
And you haven't just been watching, you've been doing it yourself.

438
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,610
No no no, that's the cover, it's not real, she doesn't understand

439
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,020
- Guys... - You've funneling cash to your C.I.

440
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,080
You've been making money and not reporting it.

441
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,160
- That's not true. - You know me, you know what I'm like.

442
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,770
If it's true, I'm gonna find out.

443
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,510
I've been working this case for eight months.

444
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,680
I dream of this, why would I put that in jeopardy?

445
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
You like the lifestyle you like playing the part.

446
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,680
You don't want to leave it.

447
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,040
Is that what you think, Rebecca?

448
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,500
Is that what this guy's telling you?

449
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,440
I swear to God, Marcus, I don't know what to think.

450
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,860
Okay, this guy John-boy, I've heard a lot of stories.

451
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,720
You don't think he bent the rules sometimes?

452
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,530
Okay look, this guy was abusive.

453
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,880
He wouldn't leave her alone, I was worried for her.

454
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,200
The case is good.

455
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
So what they know Daniel's a cop? That's workable.

456
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,480
We could use that, he's not the first cop to owe a debt.

457
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,800
They'll never guess that's our cover. Rebecca, look at me.

458
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,650
Come on, you know me, you know I wouldn't do this.

459
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,770
I know who you were.

460
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,930
I need it.

461
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,950
I need this Raman guy, he is a scumbag.

462
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,140
And he ruins people's lives.

463
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,020
I need something good to come out of all this.

464
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,640
Don't.. Don't turn me into the guy...

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,940
The cop who goes off the rails, and blows the big case.

466
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,050
Don't do it to me.

467
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,680
Can you give us a minute?

468
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,420
Yeah, yeah.

469
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,380
This guy Raman, he's vicious, he beats people up for a living.

470
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,970
He killed someone right in front of us.

471
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,250
We need to get him, Rebecca.

472
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,350
Look, Jakes is on the edge, he has to be, it's what got him close to Raman.

473
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,660
I think Jakes can do it.

474
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,650
Really? After all this?

475
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,420
You're going to put your life in his hands?

476
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,720
You know as well as I do, that could be me outside that door right now..

477
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,070
You believed in this guy. Let's give him a chance to redeem himself.

478
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,890
Let's take Raman down.

479
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,490
So the good news is, Gavin doesn't remember your name, just your face.

480
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,380
Say hello to Daniel Winacott.

481
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,890
<i>You're part of Guns and Gangs, just like the real Daniel.</i>

482
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,380
And after a couple years, you blew it. Infractions, bad performance reports,

483
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,530
caught in a few gambling dens and then down-graded to a desk job.

484
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,530
- So, I'm a file-clerk. - With a temper.

485
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,640
And a gambling problem, you just can't resist a big fight.

486
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,410
Listen, you think this is going to work?

487
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,900
Raman deals with cops all the time, probably some of his best clients.

488
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,720
OK, It's fight night at Raman's club.

489
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,160
Daniel, you're there to bet on the fight, and Maria, you're his new girlfriend.

490
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,510
Jakes and John, you're gonna make contact with Raman,

491
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,370
and deliver Gambler Dan right to him.

492
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,170
All Raman has to do is try and collect and we got him, we'll take him down.

493
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,760
Yo, focus man, I need you here.

494
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,170
- How's our boy doing? - To be honest, a bit shaky.

495
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,480
But he's obsessed with Raman. He'll get through it.

496
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,260
- That Rebecca? She worried about me? - She's fine.

497
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,300
- Is that the best you can do? - Come on, tell me.

498
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,150
- Jakes, we're wired. - I don't care about the wire.

499
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,170
Give it to me straight, brother John. Is this my last day on the job?

500
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,990
This is our last chance at this case.

501
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,200
I mean as a cop. She's gonna take my badge, isn't she?

502
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,060
That's up to you. Look, we'll talk about that tomorrow.

503
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,690
Tonight, let's just focus on getting the bad guys, all right?

504
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,200
Rebecca wouldn't put you in play if she didn't think you could do this.

505
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,830
You don't know Becks like I do.

506
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,460
Once you lose her trust, it's over. Right, Rebecca?

507
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,810
Well you're going to have to earn it back. Jakes, you are good at this job.

508
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,840
You just got to remind her that, alright?

509
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,660
Okay? Okay?

510
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,080
Yeah, yeah, okay.

511
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,410
Heads up. Here comes the target.

512
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,880
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the man

513
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,890
you asked me to collect from is a cop.

514
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,740
He is, I should have mentioned that to you. I didn't want you to say no.

515
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,270
Did you know about this, Marcus? Did you know?

516
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,690
It's my fault I didn't even tell him.

517
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,560
Look, this cop a screw-up. He has no friends.

518
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,200
There will be no payback. You have my guarantee.

519
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,830
He's over there at the bar right now.

520
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,940
He's with his new girlfriend.

521
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,990
You brought him here.

522
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,670
I brought him to the fight as a peace offering.

523
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,270
Trust me, he has absolutely no idea you're about to collect on his debt.

524
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,660
Look, you're going to make a lot of money tonight, my friend.

525
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,280
And you're going to have me to thank for that.

526
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,020
Let's do it right now, I'll call him over.

527
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,990
No, leave him there for a minute, he's fine.

528
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,590
He's enjoying himself. My problem is this.

529
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,110
I don't like police.

530
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,230
And to be perfectly honest, I'm starting to have an uneasy feeling about you, Jakes.

531
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:34,430
- What are you talking about? - And I always listen to that feeling.

532
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,090
What's he doing?

533
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,710
Stop, why are you killing this?

534
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,360
This is not happening. I'm sorry, Jakes.

535
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,710
Not tonight. Enjoy the fight.

536
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,650
You and your friend.

537
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,230
- That's it? He can't just walk away. - He can and he just did.

538
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,530
Rebecca, I think we're done here.

539
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,480
You want to give him some time, circle back?

540
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,190
No, there's no point. It's over. He just closed the door.

541
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,000
Come on, are you kidding me? You're just giving up?

542
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,070
Calm down Jakes, we're done.

543
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,590
So what? We're just shutting down?

544
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Let's pack it up.

545
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,280
Here we go, boys.

546
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,100
No head butts, eye gouging, groin attacks,

547
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,320
or head kicking to a grounded opponent.

548
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,170
- Alright, so that's it I guess. - Next time, right?

549
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,130
I'll see you back at the shop.

550
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,990
Okay, but I'm staying for the fight.

551
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,770
What do you wanna do, wanna watch the fight?

552
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,080
It's not over.

553
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,280
Jakes!

554
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,430
You think you can just walk away? You think we're done?

555
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,310
Come here!

556
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,080
Where do you go?Where do you go?

557
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,790
Jakes.

558
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,810
What are you doing?

559
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,340
He's unarmed. He's going to tell us everything.

560
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,940
Every crime, every detail.

561
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,020
Or I'm going to put a bullet in him.

562
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,400
Hey, where's John? Have you seen him?

563
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,680
No, and no Jakes.

564
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,050
- You think this is gonna work? - He's gonna confess.

565
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,940
He's gonna say we beat it out of him.

566
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,220
And then we're gonna deny it.

567
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,770
What do you mean "we"?

568
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,040
I, mean you and me. You're gonna get my back.

569
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
- You want me to lie for you? - Yes.

570
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,220
Eight months, John, I've been after this guy for eight months.

571
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,580
I'm not just gonna let him go. If you're not up for it, you leave.

572
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,480
Wake up!

573
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,220
Wake up!

574
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,120
Alright, Jakes. Come on, don't do this.

575
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,610
I'm gonna back you up on this one, okay?

576
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,350
We'll say he came after you, it was self-defense.

577
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,930
You will not be charged.

578
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,240
But after that, Jakes, you've got to walk away from this one right now.

579
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,900
Right now, you need to walk away.

580
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,720
Wake up!

581
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,790
Maria, what's going on in there?

582
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,170
- Jakes and John, where are they? - We left them watching the fight.

583
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,500
- What about Raman? - He's not here either.

584
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,710
<i>Find them.</i>

585
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,570
We gotta split up.

586
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,980
I've been where you are. All right?

587
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,820
Thanks to this job... I've racked up a divorce,

588
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,030
I got a bleak apartment I can barely unpack,

589
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,900
I lie awake in my bed at night full of anger, full of this constant rage.

590
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,860
Good for you.

591
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,660
Awww, there he is!

592
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,190
Wait, Jakes, I get it, all right? Oh no, you don't get it.

593
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,550
This guy tortures people, and takes pleasure from doing it!

594
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,020
And he's gonna say it, into the phone or I'm gonna put a bullet in his brain.

595
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,530
Talk, tell it! Tell me how you torture people!

596
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,910
You're right. This guy is scum.

597
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,940
- Talk! - He's an animal, he deserves it.

598
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,360
Okay, you could kill him right now, no one would shed a tear.

599
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,420
Let me tell you something...

600
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,610
if you do that, if you shoot him,

601
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,250
you will be lost, my friend.

602
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,280
You are done.

603
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,680
You will never come back from that, ever again.

604
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,750
You understand me?

605
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,730
Jakes,

606
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,900
right now you are standing on the edge.

607
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,890
You need to step back now. Just one step back.

608
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,980
Come on, I'm right here.

609
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,760
I'm not forcing you.

610
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,140
Come on.

611
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,060
You gotta step back.

612
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,810
- You're gonna charge him? - I'm gonna try.

613
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,350
- Jakes. - You need to arrest me.

614
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,580
- You need to take me in. - I'm sorry.

615
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,780
Let's go.

616
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,370
This is gonna sound strange.

617
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,550
I'm glad it was you.

618
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,640
Daniel. Want to come and help me unpack?

619
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,310
There's a couple beer in it for you.

620
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,630
<i>Tempting, but I got a thing tonight.</i> Well, that's your loss, pal.

621
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,580
Tell you what, save me a cold one.

622
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,720
Nice place. You need to start locking your door, though.

623
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,020
Everything's unpacked.

624
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,710
You did this all for me?

625
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,190
Someone needed to take responsibility.

626
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,880
I'm gonna get you all keys, alright?

627
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,850
Guys...

628
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,540
Okay, tough guy. What would you do if I did this...

629
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,300
Not bad.

630
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,770
It's the reflexes of a jungle cat.

631
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,280
Is that right?

632
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,630
- Yeah... - Yeah?

633
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,280
I can still see that skinny kid in his uniform.

634
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,840
Never really fit him. Didn't fit any of us.

635
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,200
All he wanted was to catch the bad guy.

636
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,140
I should've seen it.

637
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,960
You did. I pushed.

638
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,960
I let you.

639
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,910
You ever worry it'll happen to you?

640
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,210
Every day.

641
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:10,490
