1
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It scares us just thinking about it.

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you hear it, you're gonna think we're insane.

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try us. Please, from the start.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It started out small,like a hand or a leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then its head was looking up instead of down.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then one day, it was in a completely different room.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was moving around by itself.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever think maybe somebody had a key to your apartment and was playing a trick on you?

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But never once did we find any sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this all led you to believe that the doll was possessed?

12
00:00:59,154 --> 00:00:59,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Camilla got in touch with a medium.We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...named Annabelle Higgins had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was lonely and took a liking to my doll.

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All she wanted was to be friends.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we heard this,we felt really sorry for her.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we gave her permission to move into the doll.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wanted to live with us by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We said yes.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then things got worse.

25
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,443


26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we came home,she was sitting in the hallway.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we had left her in the spare room.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Debbie! Debbie, wait!

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are beyond terrified.

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know what's going on or what to do. Can you help us?

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we can.

33
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, firstly, there's no such thing as Annabelle, and there never was.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ghosts don't possess such power.

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something inhuman.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And through that,the inhuman spirit tricked you.

39
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave it permission to infest your lives.

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's an inhuman spirit?

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something that's never walked the earth in human form.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something demonic.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the doll was never possessed?

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, it was used as a conduit.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was moved around to give the impression of possession.

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Demonic spirits don't possess things,they possess people.

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wanted to get inside of you.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, that's good, Drew.You can shut it down now.

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit the lights.

50
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we got the church to send a priest over...

51
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to perform a blessing on the house and the occupants.

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever was oppressing that apartment was no longer with them. Any questions?

53
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

54
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the doll now?

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someplace safe.

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.  - So, what are you guys?

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what do people call you?

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.That's one name for us.

59
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kooks.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wackos.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

63
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,588


64
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:53,713


65
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,484


66
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:00,255


67
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,014


68
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:14,972


69
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:34,552


70
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we are.

71
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, hear that?

72
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't hear anything.  - Exactly.

73
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Okay!

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Guys, we are here!Get out of the car.

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

76
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you so excited?Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

77
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll race you!

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you guys excited?  - Yes!

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so excited!  - Come on, Sadie!

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get my own room!

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?No dibs on the rooms!

82
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?  - What?

83
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do I get to pick my own room?Or do I have no choice in that either?

84
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, first cute boy she meets,she'll forget about Jersey.

85
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.  - I hope.

86
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Sadie.

88
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sadie, let's go.

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come.

90
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you?

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on, girl.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, suit yourself.

93
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your step.

94
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming through.

95
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, watch out, Dad.

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you want it?  - In the living room.

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrea, where's my wind chime?  - I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks! Hey, Nancy,have you seen my wind chime?

99
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this one?  - Yeah, thanks.

100
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to catch it.  - Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

101
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so mean.

102
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Mom, can I hang up my wind chime?

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. There's a line outside you can hang it on.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, have April come in, okay?It's gonna be dark soon.

105
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

106
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This clock stopped at 3:07,and so did the one in the hallway.

210
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's weird.

211
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

212
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speaking of knocked around,what did you do to me last night?

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?  - I don't know.

214
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sadie!

215
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}April! April!

216
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's...? April! What's going on?

217
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?  - Oh, my God!

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Sadie.

219
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,884


220
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We keep everything locked in here.

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel free to look around.

222
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't touch anything.

223
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

224
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is crazy.

225
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So all these are taken from cases you've investigated?

226
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Everything you see in here is either haunted, cursed...

227
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or has been used in some kind of ritualistic practice.

228
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's a toy.

229
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not even the toy monkey.

230
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch it.

231
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,  Well, isn't it scary,or doesn't it worry you...

232
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to have all these items right in your home?

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we have a priest that comes by once a month to bless the room.

234
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the way I see it is...

235
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's safer for these things to be in here than out there.

236
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kind of like keeping guns off the street.

237
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not just throw them in an incinerator? Destroy them.

238
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

239
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes it's better to keep the genie in the bottle.

240
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

241
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right this way.

242
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

243
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said she's a conduit?  - That's right.

244
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does that mean?

245
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A very powerful demonic has latched itself onto her.

246
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when you guys investigate these hauntings...

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how do you stop them from latching onto you?

248
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to take great precaution.

249
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about your wife?

250
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about her?

251
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Father Gordon told me that...

252
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that was different.

253
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to my wife happened during an exorcism.

254
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what's the difference?

255
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

256
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, what are you doing?

257
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

258
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know better. All right?

259
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Georgiana?

260
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Did you touch anything?  - No.

261
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, come on, honey.

262
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?  - Oh, sure.

263
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go into this room,no matter what, remember?

264
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Daddy.  - All right.

265
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.  - Okay, come on.

266
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see if I can find you a little snack, okay? Come on.

267
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What's going on in here?

268
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, look.  - You look very pretty.

269
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, all done.Go get dressed for dinner.

270
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm wearing it to dinner.  - No, you're not!

271
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

272
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd it go?

273
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

274
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh, a non-skeptic.

275
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a pleasant change.

276
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

277
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop blaming yourself.

278
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No sugar.

279
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be right back.

280
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not funny, Nancy.

281
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

282
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop grabbing my foot.

283
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, I didn't do anything.

284
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right.

285
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And stop farting.

286
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It really stinks.

287
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't blame that on me. It's you.

288
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

289
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

290
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that sound?

291
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Cindy. She's in my room.She's sleepwalking again.

292
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen her do this before.

293
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remembered you saying not to wake her if she's like this.

294
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we just put her back to bed.

295
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

296
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go back to bed.

297
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's okay. Good night.

298
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night.

299
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's sleepwalking again?She hasn't done that for awhile.

300
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She ended up in Andrea's room too.I think kind of freaked her out.

301
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not good. What are we gonna do?  - I don't know.

302
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, you got another bruise here.  - Hmm?

303
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that hurt?

304
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's weird.

305
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Will you do me a favor,go see a doctor for that?

306
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I will. Drive safe.  - Yeah.

307
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.  - I love you too.

308
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye!

309
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love you!

310
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cindy, you have your lunch?  - Yeah.

311

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss Sadie a lot.

313
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was my best friend.

314
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're my friend, right?

315

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, let's play.

316
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you talking to?  - Rory.

317
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rory?

318
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my new friend.  - Oh, really?

319
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, do you want to see him?  - Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

320
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With this.

321
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the music stops, you see him in the mirror standing behind you.

322
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

323
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you have to twist the key.

324
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

325
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boo, Mommy!  - Oh!

326
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}April, you just gave me a heart attack.  - Got you!

327
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, okay, I guess Rory doesn't want to see me, huh?

328
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well.

329
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we play hide-and-clap?

330
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide-and-cla--?Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

331
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! Nobody ever lets me play.  - Okay, okay.

332
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, you get to ask me for three claps.

333
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

334
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three.

335
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go hide now!  - Okay.

336
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four, five...

339
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...ten!

340
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First clap!

341
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow. Shit.

345
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I know where you're hiding.

346
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the third clap.

347
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get you now.

348
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039

353
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta have some routes here,or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

354
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's like half of my rate, man.

355

359
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

360

364
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to sleep,please stop grabbing my feet.

365
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,034

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's someone standing over there.

375
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see anyone.

376
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's looking right at us.

377
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nancy, don't! Nancy.

378
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. Look. Look.

379

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh. It's that smell again.

381
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

383
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christine?! Christine! Christine!

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, it won't op...

385
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christine!  - No! No! No!

386
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on? What happened?  - There was someone else in here!

387
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?  - Where?

388
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the door. It was behind the door.

389
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, there's nothing in here.There's nobody in here.

390
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was someone else in here!

391
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just sleeping, and then I felt somebody grab my feet.

392
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I thought it was Nancy.

393
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, honey, I'm pretty sure that it was just a bad dream.

394
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! It talked to me!

395
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It said...

396
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that it wants my family dead.

397
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Winston!

398

399
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get behind him.

400
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you off to?

401
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just gotta run to the store for a few things.

402
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you even try?  - What? What do you mean?

403
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 15 years have you ever been able to lie to me?

404
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father Gordon called. He's got a case he wants us to look into.

405
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said I'd go check it out myself.Lorraine, myself.

406
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with you.

407
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're worried it's gonna happen again.

408
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I am. I really am.

409
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's just time we take a break.Write that book.

410
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember what you said to me on our wedding night?

411
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Can we do it again?"

412
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that.

413
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said that God brought us together for a reason. Right?

414
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

415
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get dressed.

416
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've isolated the disturbances to the attic.

417
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I just want you to listen for a second.

418
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, that's it.

419
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it again, Ed.

420
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now it's just my weight.But you take the water coming off the pipe...

421
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...combined with the wind coming through the broken window...

422
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...these boards are gonna expand and rub against each other.

423
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard it all through the house because of these pipes leading to the radiator.

424
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this place isn't haunted?

425
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it rarely is.

426
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there's usually always some kind of rational explanation.

427
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

428
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that?

429
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's ever down there,I'm gonna lock you in now!

430
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

431
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrea! Help!

432
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

433
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cindy?

434
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, now....

435
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right?

436
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, come on.

437
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

438
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

439
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,all right?

440
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

441
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

442
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrea?  - Help! Help! Help!

443
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's in here?  - Andrea!

444
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrea? Andrea!

445
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In here!

446
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

447
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's in here?  - Andrea!

448
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

449
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody, goddamn it,tell me what's going on here?

450
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation and anxiety caused by the presence...

451
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or imminence of danger.

452
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whether it's a ghost, a spirit or an entity, they all feed on it.

453
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take Maurice here.

454
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A French-Canadian farmer with no more than a third-grade education...

455
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...yet after he was possessed,spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

456
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes backwards.

457
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd been molested by his father,who had also tortured him repeatedly.

458
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dark spirit made its home in this man.

459
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you look into his eyes,you can see him tearing blood.

460
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And like that...

461
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...an upside-down cross started to appear from within his body.

462
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

463
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you personally perform the exorcism?

464
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not authorized.But I've assisted on many.

465
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, an exorcism can be very dangerous...

466
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...not only for the victim,but for anyone in the room.

467
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to Maurice?  - He tried to kill his wife...

468
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but instead shot her in the arm and then turned the gun on himself.

469
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maurice had a very troubled life with little to live for...

470
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and not even an exorcist could bring him back.

471
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which brings us to the three stages of demonic activity:

472
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Infestation, oppression and possession.

473
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, infestation:

474
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the whispering, the footsteps,the feeling of another presence...

475
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which ultimately grows into oppression, the second stage.

476
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this is where the victim,and it's usually the one...

477
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who's the most psychologically vulnerable...

478
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is targeted specifically by an external force.

479
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breaks the victim down.Crushes their will.

480
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, once in a weakened state, leads them to the third and final stage: possession.

481
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Ed? Lorraine?  - Yeah.

482
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's someone here that would like to talk to you.

483
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.  - Thanks, Drew.

484
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440


485
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can we help you?

486
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something horrible happening in my house. Could you come and take a look?

487
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

488
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We really need to be head to our family.  - No,You don't understand.

489
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we do. There's usually some sort of rational explanation...

490
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have five daughters who are scared to death.I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

491
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do anything you could to protect her? Please.

492
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please can you come and take a look?

493
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course we will.

494
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course we will.

495
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,You guys straighten up? Thanks.

496
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Hi.  - Hi. Hi.

497
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for coming.

498
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm Roger.  - Lorraine.

499
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

500
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for coming.  - Please, come in.

501
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

502
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So....

503
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Look at you all.Who are these beautiful young women?

504
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Andrea, the oldest,Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

505
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and April.

506
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

507
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all sleeping down here now.

508
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

509
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm constantly turning up the heat,but the house is always freezing.

510
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a problem with the furnace.

511
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, not that I can find.

512
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

513
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.It moves around the house.

514
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh....

515
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What is it?

516
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, rancid smells could indicate some type of demonic activity.

517
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

518
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's to keep those doors from banging at night.

519
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise, it's like...All night long, just like that.

520
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it come in threes?  - Yeah.

521
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It stops at dawn?

522
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh.

523
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, sometimes it's meant as an insult to the Trinity:

524
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

525
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's the damndest thing,but we also get all kinds of birds...

526
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that will just fly against the side of the house and break their necks.

527
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm. Really?

528
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

529
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of them?  - Every one.

530
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, we were hanging those along the stairs.

531
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something just kept knocking them down,so we stopped hanging them up.

532
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I was talking about.

533
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was here when we moved in.

534
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

535
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me the cellar.

536
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what she made me do.

537
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You picking up anything in here, hon?

538
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something awful happened here, Ed.

539
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those bruises, they from something that happened here?

540
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

541
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, with all that's been going on,why haven't you just moved out?

542
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where we'd move to, you know?

543
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got all our money tied up in this place and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

544
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't know anybody whose gonna take in a family of seven indefinitely.

545
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we tracked you down.

546
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're glad you found us.

547
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's get started.

548
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

549
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

550
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

551
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, go ahead.

552
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do I start?

553
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the first occurrence.

554
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess it was the clocks.

555
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom and Dad tell me that you have a friend.

556
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name's Rory.He lives here too.

557
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm.  - But he's always sad.

558
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is that?

559
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He won't tell me but I think something bad happened to him.

560
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

561
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

562
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

563
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We bought it at auction from the bank, so,you know, we never knew who lived here.

564
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Lorraine and I both feel that what your house needs is a cleansing.

565
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An exorcism.

566
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, exorcism?

567
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that was something that you do to people.

568
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not necessarily, no.

569
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to get out of here.

570
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

571
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lorraine saw something, which--

572
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead, hon.

573
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house...

574
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and your land.

575
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw it first when I came through your door.

576
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was latched to your back.

577
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I saw it again with the girls when we walked into the living room.

578
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it doesn't matter where you go...

579
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this dark entity has latched itself to your family...

580
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and it's feeding off you.

581
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if we leave?

582
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes when you get haunted,it's like stepping on gum.

583
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take it with you.

584
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I gotta tell you,you have a lot of spirits in here...

585
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but this is the one that I'm most worried about, because it is so hateful.

586
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, so what do we do?Can we call a priest?

587
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish it were that easy.

588
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Performing an exorcism is an archaic procedure. Requires years of training.

589
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And even then,I have seen it go horribly wrong.

590
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But before we even get that far,the church has to authorize it first.

591
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means we gotta investigate,gather evidence and provide proof...

592
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and that's the hard part.

593
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have your children been baptized?

594
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, no, we never got around to that.We're not really a churchgoing family.

595
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you may want to rethink that.Our presence here could make things worse.

596
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

597
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we're a threat.

598
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And whatever you're dealing with here isn't gonna like us.

599
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far it hasn't done anything violent,and that's a good sign.

600
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we're gonna have our guy do some homework on the property...

601
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to see what we're up against.

602
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Judy, what are you up to?

603
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got you a present.

604
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and Nanna got these at the church's yard sale.

605
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey.  - One for you and one for me.

606
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She put a picture...

607
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of you and Daddy in mine.

608
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nanna said this way we'll always be together.

609
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

610
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss you and Daddy.

611
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hon.

612
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yup.

613
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna believe this.Carolyn's voice didn't record.

614
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

615
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen.

616
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

617
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

618
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

619
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, go ahead.

620
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the first occurrence.

621
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

622
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole time.

623
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. You find anything?  - Lots.

624
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's no wonder they're going through what they are.

625
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the original farmhouse.

626
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was built in 1863 by a man named Jedson Sherman...

627
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who was married to a woman named Bathsheba.

628
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

629
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was one of the women accused of witchcraft in Salem.

630
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was hung during the trials.  - Wow.

631
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After Bathsheba married Jedson,they had a baby...

632
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and when the baby was 7 days old...

633
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Jedson caught her sacrificing it in front of the fireplace.

634
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She ran out to that tree by the dock...

635
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...climbed up, proclaimed her love to Satan...

636
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...cursed anyone who tried to take her land, and hung herself.

637
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time of death was pronounced at 3:07 in the morning.

638
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that explains a few things.

639
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, so does this.

640
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her last name's Walker.She lived there in the '30s.

641
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She had a boy named Rory who ysteriously disappeared in the woods.

642
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then she killed herself in the cellar.

643
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's not all.

644
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what was the original 200-acre farm as since been subdivided and sold off.

645
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was another boy who drowned in pond here. He lived in a house over here.

646
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a woman who worked as a maid in a eighboring home, she committed suicide too.

647
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People who took her land.

648
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

649
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who, with her family, has been xperiencing supernatural occurrences.

650
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, go ahead.

651
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the first occurrence.

652
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's Brad.

653
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You find it okay?   - Oh, yeah.

654
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drew, this is Officer Brad.

655
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officer Brad Hamilton,Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

656
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

657
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're the lucky new cop, huh?  - Guess so.

658
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?  - Take it easy on him, Drew.

659
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, guys,help me get this stuff unloaded.

660
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take this.

661
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Roger.

662
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. When you're finished here,why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

663
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it.

664
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with the Chevy?

665
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

666
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needs a new carburetor to start.  - Oh, yeah?

667
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of put fixing her up on hold for a while.

668
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Ahem.

669
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,would you?

670
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this, uh, do?

671
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When there's an instant drop in temperature...

672
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the thermostat triggers the camera to take a picture.

673
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've actually caught things on film?

674
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

675
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why,uh...? Why out here?

676
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is where the witch committed suicide.

677
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She hung herself from that branch right above where you're standing.

678
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could a mother kill her own child?

679
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was never a child to her.

680
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just used her God-given gift as the ultimate offense against him.

681
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Witches believe it elevates their status in the eyes of Satan.

682
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

683
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know?

684
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an insight. It's like a peek through the curtain into another person's life.

685
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That day meant so much to me.We were driving along the coast.

686
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nancy pointed out how pretty the view was.

687
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought this is a perfect opportunity for a photo.

688
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna start fresh, you know?A new house, a new beginning.

689
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have seen Roger and the girls.I've never seen them so happy.

690
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheese!

691
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They mean the world to me.

692
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hand flat on the desk.

693
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and take it off.

694
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go.

695
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See?

696
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just reveals to us what the naked eye can't see.

697
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty far out, isn't it?

698
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's groovy.

699
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

700
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

701
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I had to go.

702
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

703
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

704
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in the bottle?

705
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy water.

706
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Presence of religious icons...

707
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...will get a reaction from anything unholy.

708
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sort of pisses them off.

709
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I set these throughout the house,see if I can stir things up a bit.

710
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like holding a cross to a vampire?  - Yeah. Exactly.

711
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except I don't believe in vampires.

712
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wasn't me.

713
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brad, get the camera.

714
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

715
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

716
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton with me.

717
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's keep the cellar light off.

718
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us a sign that you wanna communicate with us.

719
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hon, you all right?

720
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's definitely something here.

721
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, close the door. Move something.  - My hands are so cold.

722
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

723
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

724
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gone. It's gone.

725
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got nothing.

726
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

727
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, like I said, it doesn't always work when you want it to.

728
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, maybe the camera picked something up.

729
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out!

730
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a guy who doesn't believe...

731
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you looked a little freaked out when that door slammed shut.

732
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must have been a draft.

733
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's funny.

734
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A draft never put that look on my face before.

735
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe the clock.

736
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 3:08.

737
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see your glasses.

738
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For you.

739
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on. What do you say about that?

740
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!  - Honey, you wanna come?

741
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.The late nights are getting to me.

742
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's probably a good idea.Why don't you get some rest.

743
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.  - Really?

744
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take off.I have a shift starting in an hour.

745
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The house hasn't felt like this in a long time.

746
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think the kids feel a lot safer with you around.

747
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could get used to this.  - What, me doing laundry?

748
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're funny.

749
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this place.

750
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice, fresh country air.

751
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have such a beautiful family,don't they?

752
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that little one, April,did you see her bring me pancakes?

753
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:37,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

754
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've gotta help them.

755
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

756
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll start with the Chevy.

757
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carolyn!

758
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

759
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carolyn, open the door.

760
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Carolyn, open up!

761
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

762
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm fine.  - Are you sick?

763
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.  - I thought I saw...

764
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear Roger and the girls.

765
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One minute.

766
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, do you wanna play a game?  - Boring!

767
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Daddy.

768
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go inside.

769
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that was you.

770
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I hope you don't mind.

771
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a good deal on a rebuild at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

772
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you look like you know what you're doing.  - Yeah, we'll see.

773
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a nice place here, Roger.

774
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lorraine and I always wanted a spot in the country.

775
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll sell you this one.

776
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

777
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, uh, it really means a lot to us to have you here.

778
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta admit, I was a little bit skeptical going in.

779
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wanna say thank you, though,for coming out when you did.

780
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take the credit.That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

781
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't want to.  - Oh. Why's that?

782
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,it helps people.

783
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it also takes a toll on her.

784
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little piece each time.

785
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple months ago we were working on a case.

786
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She saw something.

787
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took a real big piece.

788
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we got home...

789
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...she went into our room,locked herself in...

790
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...didn't talk, didn't eat,didn't come out for eight days.

791
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd she see?

792
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

793
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

794
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I won't ask.

795
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to reload. You want some?

796
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good, thanks.

797
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

798
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what she made me do.

799
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what she made me do.

800
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

801
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed?

802
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what she made me do!

803
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed! Ed!

804
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed!

805
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, you okay?

806
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

807
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw someone. There was a woman dressed as a maid.

808
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

809
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.  - No, wait. We need this.

810
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

811
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't trigger it.

812
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean she didn't trigger it?  - Somebody's with her.

813
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

814
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cindy!

815
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,915
