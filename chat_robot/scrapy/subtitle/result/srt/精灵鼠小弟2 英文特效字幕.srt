00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George, wake up.

4
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's Saturday.

5
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I know, but it's the first day of soccer. It's our first game.

6
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Soccer?

7
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't today. I caught a cold while sleeping.

8
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You'll be fine.

9
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, come on, it'll be great.

10
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We're going to play like Brazilians.

11
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Here you go. -Thanks, Mom.

12
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart, don't forget your water bottle. George....

13
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't forget your cleats.

14
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You look especially beautiful today.

15
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.

16
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay, open up.

17
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Did you hear that? She said "blah-blah."

18
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't believe it.

19
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Her first word.

20
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where's the baby book? I'm writing it down.

21
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not sure that's technically a word.

22
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Of course it is.

23
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But your Uncle Crenshaw says that every Little starts

24
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}talking by nine months.

25
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}In Uncle Crenshaw's case, never stops.

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you both coming to the game?

27
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wouldn't miss it.

28
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Frederick...

29
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...this soccer game's making me very....

30
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Proud? -Anxious. Especially about....

31
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I'm fine. -He's fine.

32
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All those boys stomping around with cleats.

33
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What if someone....

34
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, honey. He's a Little. All Littles are natural athletes.

35
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Do you need.... -Could you?

36
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay, that's it for you.

37
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snow, food.

38
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Food? Is it tuna? Or herring?

39
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or, dare I say it, is it lox?

40
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh! Please be lox!

41
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's for you.

42
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Boys, are we ready to play some soccer? -You bet, Dad.

43
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, great. It's glop.

44
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Look what I'm reduced to. I'm a Handi Wipe with hair.

45
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wallace! Get up! There we go!

46
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's right! Dig! Dig! Go downfield! Downfield!

47
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You guys, spread out! Spread out!

48
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,840


49
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, George is getting a workout.

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except Stuart.

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There's plenty of time.

52
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Plenty of time? There's 40 seconds.

53
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices.

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's not as easy as it looks.

55
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay, I'm glad he's not in the game. I don't want him to get hurt.

56
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's Pee-Wee soccer. Nobody gets hurt.

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Irwin, are you okay?

58
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you all right, lrwin?

59
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Do I look all right?

60
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Here. Come on.

61
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Better substitute.

62
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Tie game. We could play with just 10.

63
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But we have George, so it's like having nine.

64
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We'll have none of that.

65
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, coach.

66
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Go in for lrwin!

67
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mom! Dad! I'm going in!

68
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, Stuart!

69
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, dear.

70
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Watch your tail out there.

71
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't worry, I won't let you down.

72
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now, go get them.

73
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let's go, let's go! Come on!

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Over here! I'm open!

75
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I got it! I got it!

76
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I'm going to snatch him off the field. -Honey, honey.

77
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Knowing boys as I do, I think he might find that a little....

78
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Embarrassing.

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Get it, George!

80
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Go after it!

81
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Pass me the ball, lame-o. Come on.

82
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George, shoot!

83
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I got it! I got it!

84
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Shoot!

85
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I got it! I got it!

86
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, I did it!

87
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I have to start wearing a cup.

88
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He just looked so small out there.

89
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So lacking in bigness. Does he really have to go back next week?

90
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We have to give him room to grow.

91
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I do. I let him slice his own banana.

92
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}With a spoon.

93
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I let him drive his car to school. No other mother does that.

94
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}With George walking beside him every step of the way.

95
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How much more room should I give him?

96
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A bit more than you're giving him now.

97
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe Mom was right. Maybe I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore.

98
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What does she want you to go out for?

99
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Painting or dancing.

100
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I guess it's my fault.

101
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm sorry I kicked you into the goal.

102
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's okay. You won the game. That's the main thing.

103
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No. The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.

104
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Bogeys, 12:00! I got him, Brooklyn!

105
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wouldn't it be cool if I actually flew this?

106
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah. There's only one problem.

107
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mom.

108
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Hello, Mrs. Little. -Hi, Will.

109
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-ls George home? -He's with Stuart.

110
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We just need to tighten her up and she's ready to fly.

111
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hi, George. Hi, Stuart.

112
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hi, Will.

113
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You want to take a break for a while? I brought my PS2.

114
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, okay.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But what about the plane?

116
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I want to play with Will for a while. Play with Snowbell.

117
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,640


118
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, well. Guess I'll have to finish it myself.

119
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If I can just....

120
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,350


121
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, dear.

122
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, what's that noise?

123
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sounds like a lawnmower.

124
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Inside the house?

125
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart!

126
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you doing?

127
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not doing anything!

128
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Pull the brake!

129
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Get the book!

130
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is cool. All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.

131
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."

132
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Takeoff? I'm in the air!

133
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell, get out of the way!

134
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Please, don't hurt me!

135
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's going on?

136
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart's just flying in the house.

137
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Flying in the house?

138
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}At least he's indoors, nothing bad can happen.

139
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Watch out!

140
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hit the dirt!

141
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart!

142
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Duck!

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Are you all right? -Are you okay?

144
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm okay.

145
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Everything's fine.

146
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Fine? Stuart, you destroyed it.

147
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm sorry I wrecked it, George.

148
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm sure we can fix it with some glue.

149
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, we can't. That's going in the trash. It's much too dangerous.

150
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Thanks, Stuart.

151
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why don't you take the boys home?

152
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.

153
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Good idea.

154
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, boys. Let's go home.

155
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She treats me like a baby.

156
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll fix you both some lunch.

157
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She just loves you so much. It's hard for her to think ofyou in danger.

158
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, this has been a bad day.

159
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mom's mad, George won't play with me....

160
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I know. But every cloud has a silver lining.

161
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Doesn't that make them kind of heavy?

162
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, it's an expression, Stuart.

163
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The thing about being a Little is that you can look at any situation...

164
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...no matter how bleak, how hopeless...

165
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and still see the bright side. The silver lining.

166
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Like in this situation,

167
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}the silver lining would be....

168
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Help me, Dad, because I'm struggling.

169
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George has found a newfriend. So you could find a newfriend, too.

170
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're a lot better at this than I am.

171
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I've been a Little a lot longer than you have. You'll get the hang of it.

172
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Meantime, keep your chin up...

173
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...your back straight and your heart open.

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Then what? -One step at a time.

175
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And Canada is separate from the United States because...

176
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...Canadians like to be alone.

177
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Review tomorrow, test on Friday.

178
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And please take your leftover lunches with you.

179
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami.

180
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Tony, would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?

181
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sorry, pal. I've got karate.

182
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, Mark.

183
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Guitar lessons.

184
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Some of the guys are going over to Will's house to play basketball.

185
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Can I come?

186
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They didn't exactly mention that you were invited.

187
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, that's okay. I'm busy anyway.

188
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Just tell Mom I walked you home.

189
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I owe you one.

190
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sure.

191
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Whoa!

192
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Miss?

193
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Miss?

194
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you alive?

195
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She's alive.

196
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Out of the way, please. Injured bird coming through!

197
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's going on?

198
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My wing.

199
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where am l? Hey! Where's the falcon?

200
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What falcon?

201
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That falcon! Drive! Get out of here!

202
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, my!

203
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Get lost, you disgusting vulture!

204
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!

205
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Do we really want to antagonize him?

206
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, boy, we've got a problem.

207
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, you can make it. Don't slow down.

208
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You did it.

209
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah. I did.

210
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So, who do I have to thank?

211
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Forgive me. My name is Stuart. Stuart Little.

212
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm Margalo. Just Margalo.

213
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo.

214
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're so strong. Are you an athlete?

215
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, yeah.

216
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I play a little soccer...

217
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...fly airplanes...

218
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...race boats.

219
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You can put me down now. My legs are fine. It's my wing that's hurt.

220
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh. Yeah. Of course.

221
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,950


222
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There used to be bandages in here.

223
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Hey, why don't we try your scarf? -Good idea.

224
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My pin, it's....

225
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Must have happened when that falcon smashed into me.

226
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was part of our nest when I was a baby. I've had it my whole life.

227
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's the only thing I have left of my mother's.

228
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Gee, that's too bad.

229
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah.

230
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There. How's that?

231
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's much better, thank you.

232
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So tell me, Stuart Little, do you actually live here?

233
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, yeah. I'm a real Little. I'm the middle child.

234
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The middle Little.

235
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Cute.

236
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So, where do you live?

237
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You know, here and there. -You mean you don't have a home?

238
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Once, we lived in a box. Well, not really a box.

239
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was one of those things where people keep their jewelry.

240
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A jewelry box?

241
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yes! That's what it must have been. A jewelry box.

242
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was wonderful.

243
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, I've taken too much of your time.

244
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'd better go before it gets dark.

245
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, wait. You can't go out there.

246
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Not while you're hurt. You should stay here.

247
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I couldn't impose. I mean, you'd really do that for me?

248
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sure, I have just the thing. I'll be right back.

249
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Meanwhile, you can use my cat's bed. -You have a cat?

250
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't worry about Snowbell. He wouldn't hurt a fly.

251
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Those flies really come back on you.

252
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.

253
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe more food will help.

254
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hi there.

255
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you!

256
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Scare me? That's a laugh.

257
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hear that? That was a laugh.

258
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hairball. Major hairball.

259
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And yet we continue to lick ourselves. Unbelievable.

260
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, Snowbell. Meet Margalo. She'll be staying with us for a while.

261
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Staying? Are you out of your mind?

262
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You can't just drag stray birds in here.

263
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Do you think this is a halfway house?

264
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Look, she's filthy.

265
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No offense. She could have germs.

266
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief? Get rid of her.

267
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We're home. Sorry we're late.

268
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Little hi, Little low. -Little hey, Little ho.

269
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What the heck was that?

270
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's just how we greet each other.

271
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Interesting.

272
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Nauseating is more like it. You're in for it now, missy.

273
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mother Little hates when animals walk in here off the street.

274
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.

275
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Such a pretty little birdie.

276
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe it's just my friends she hates.

277
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I found her. -Found me? He saved my life.

278
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He did?

279
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-From a falcon. -What's that?

280
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.

281
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A falcon? They are fierce creatures.

282
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why does the city have falcons?

283
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That shouldn't be allowed. Write a letter.

284
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}On the other hand, we have a hero here. Way to go, Stuart.

285
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Hey, Dad. -What?

286
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Silver lining.

287
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's a guy thing.

288
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is it?

289
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Isn't it nice that Stuart has a friend?

290
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I don't think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.

291
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-What do you mean? -I mean he's smitten.

292
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He's infatuated. He's bedazzled.

293
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But he's a baby.

294
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Boys start having crushes really young.

295
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Frederick, did you have many crushes?

296
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm still having one.

297
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?

298
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Whip you up an omelet? Pop you a tart?

299
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart, I'm full.

300
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Full? You eat like a bird.

301
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, Stuart, time for school.

302
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not going to school. I'm staying home to take care of Margalo.

303
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Guess again. You are going to school, and I'll take care of Margalo.

304
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Look both ways crossing the street...

305
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...wear galoshes and, in art class, don't run with scissors.

306
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll get your backpack.

307
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mothers.... You know.

308
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Well, I don't really know. -No?

309
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}See, my mom just kind of one day...

310
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...wasn't there anymore.

311
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So you've been completely on your own all your life?

312
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You bet. -I'll bet it's been scary.

313
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, it's been an adventure.

314
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I wish I had some adventures.

315
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm only allowed to paint.

316
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, life is an adventure. Just walking out that door is an adventure.

317
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, Stu. We're late.

318
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Go for it, kid.

319
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The adventure begins.

320
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That feels like enough adventure for one day.

321
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, look! The Yankees won.

322
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There we go.

323
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Can you say, "Walk with Mommy"?

324
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}"Mommy"?

325
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}"Walk"?

326
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Nothing.

327
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Martha and I are going out for a bit. Can I bring you anything?

328
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, thanks.

329
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

330
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say, "Bye-bye." Martha. Say, "Bye-bye, birdie."

331
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Fresh air.

332
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Remember me?

333
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You scared me.

334
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What can I say? I'm a scary guy.

335
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So, Margalo, you case the joint?

336
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Any valuables? Come on, thrill me. Chill me.

337
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They ain't got much. The mom's got a ring, but it's only two carats.

338
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All right, fine.

339
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What else have they got?

340
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, you know, not that much.

341
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I mean, they mostly just have each other.

342
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A moment while I vomit.

343
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why don't we just try somewhere else?

344
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Because you're set up here.

345
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They trust you. They like you.

346
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And maybe...

347
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...you like them.

348
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, Margalo, come on.

349
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't con a conman.

350
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.

351
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, really? Who found a pitiful orphan bird...

352
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and plucked her out of the gutter?

353
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Who shared his food with her...

354
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and, I hasten to add, taught her a trade? Who?

355
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You did. -I did. Right.

356
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, then, straighten up and fly right.

357
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And remember, you are here on business.

358
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're not here to play around.

359
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, Falcon! When I'm on a job, I never play around!

360
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you cold?

361
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I guess when the weather gets too cold,

362
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}you'll just fly south for the winter?

363
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, to tell you the truth, I've never flown south.

364
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's kind of a dream of mine.

365
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Get out of this cold, windy city, catch that jet stream....

366
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.

367
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I hear it's paradise. -Then how come you haven't gone?

368
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Something's always stopping me.

369
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Something's always stopping me, too.

370
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Everybody around here thinks I'm too small to accomplish anything.

371
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, the way I see it, you're as big as you feel.

372
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah. Boy, I'm really glad you fell into my car.

373
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I mean, you know.... I mean

374
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not glad you fell. I just....

375
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Want some more popcorn?

376
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay.

377
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What?

378
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My pin.

379
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's fixed. How--

380
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}On my way home from school, I drive right past where you crashed.

381
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was no big deal.

382
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I mean, there was finding it...

383
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...figuring out how the pieces fit together...

384
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and you know, fixing it.

385
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And no big deal. Just...

386
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, Scottie.

387
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...one, two, three.

388
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Good as new.

389
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, Stuart, it's not.

390
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's much, much better.

391
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Stay with me. -All the time.

392
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

393
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you talking about?

394
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm talking about you and your little mouse friend.

395
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Big mistake! Never make a friend I can eat.

396
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now, get me that ring!

397
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or the mouse is lunch.

398
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I'll do the dishes. -You did them last night.

399
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}For you, I'd do dishes every night.

400
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That way, I don't have to change the baby.

401
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She just dropped her dolly.

402
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll just--

403
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Frederick! -What?

404
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-My ring. It's gone. -What do you mean?

405
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's gone!

406
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Are you absolutely.... -Positive.

407
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Unless....

408
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll call the plumber!

409
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's going on?

410
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mom's ring went down the drain. I can't reach it.

411
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey! What about me?

412
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can do it. Let me go, Dad.

413
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Go where? -Down the drain.

414
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.

415
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I don't know. It's awfully dark down there.

416
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And smelly. And cold.

417
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But it's Mom's ring. She loves that ring.

418
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on, Dad. Let me try.

419
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...

420
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...you just tell us.

421
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't worry, Dad. I can handle it.

422
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Or yank on the string, we'll pull you up. -Will do.

423
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How's it so far?

424
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wet. There's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls.

425
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-What does it look like? -Like the inside of your nose.

426
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Can you see the bottom yet? -No, just more pipe.

427
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And everything we ate for dinner last week.

428
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And the pipe seems to go on and on.

429
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, the plumber said....

430
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's going on?

431
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is that a new top?

432
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You know, you have such taste. Simple elegance is what I call it.

433
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's on the other end of that string?

434
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-This string? -Yes.

435
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, now, don't get excited, but someone that you and I love...

436
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring.

437
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Stuart? -Good guess, Mom.

438
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You let our son go down the kitchen drain?

439
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now, Eleanor, don't be upset.

440
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's been well thought out.

441
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If there's a problem, I pull on the string and....

442
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now you can be upset.

443
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you okay? Can you hear me?

444
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hurry! I'm slipping.

445
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Get more string. -Great.

446
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There must be string here.

447
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-There is no more. -What else can we use?

448
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Spaghetti? -We're out of spaghetti.

449
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Well, do we have macaroni? -That's too short.

450
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-We can tie it together with---No.

451
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hurry!

452
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hang on, Stuart!

453
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo, what are you doing?

454
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart, I'm coming! Grab on!

455
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Lower! Lower!

456
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I got it!

457
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Are you all right? -Are you hurt?

458
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't scare me like that.

459
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had.

460
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal?

461
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I would not have let that happen.

462
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You let him go down the drain. -He wanted to go.

463
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...

464
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...or George wanted to go into the toilet, would you let them?

465
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I love Stuart as much as you do.

466
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I just don't happen to be quite as....

467
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Emotional? Irrational? What were you going to say?

468
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I forget.

469
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I know I'm overprotective, it's just...

470
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...I can't stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.

471
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm sorry, Stuart.

472
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What?

473
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You people sure like your meat loaf.

474
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You find the ring?

475
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Everything but.

476
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Has anyone seen Margalo? I can't find her anywhere.

477
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighborhood.

478
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sure, to strengthen her wing.

479
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, maybe. But why'd she leave me her pin?

480
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, you know, Stuart...

481
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...Margalo is kind of a free spirit.

482
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe she just felt it was time to go.

483
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Without even saying goodbye?

484
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you doing?

485
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think I know what happened. I think that falcon got her.

486
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Yeah? -I'm going to find her.

487
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And don't try to talk me out of it. I've made up my mind.

488
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you crazy? You can't go out there.

489
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Because I'm too small?

490
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let me tell you something, you're as big as you feel.

491
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then let me come with you.

492
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, I need you to stay and cover for me.

493
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Cover for you? How?

494
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Make something up. You're smart.

495
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart, she's just a bird.

496
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, George, she's my friend.

497
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And when you're friends with Stuart Little, you're friends for life.

498
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, ifyou won't let me come, at least get somebody to go with you.

499
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snow!

500
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The good silverware's in the dining room.

501
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Take anything, but don't hurt me.

502
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's me. Stuart.

503
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You. This better be important.

504
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo's still missing.

505
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I should've been more specific. I meant important to me.

506
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm going to look for her. I hoped you'd come.

507
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Look, Stuart, do yourself a favor. Buy a parakeet and forget her.

508
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't forget her. She's in terrible trouble and I have to help her.

509
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I mean what am l, a man or a...

510
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...mouse?

511
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is that a trick question?

512
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's important. You got to help me.

513
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And why would I do that?

514
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, because we're family...

515
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and because I'd do the same for you.

516
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And if you don't, and the Littles ask where I am,

517
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George'll say you ate me.

518
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What?

519
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why you little rat!

520
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You know something?

521
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Everybody thinks you're so nice. You're not so nice.

522
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come on! It'll be fun. It's an adventure.

523
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey! Mario Andretti, slow down. Let's pace ourselves.

524
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll have a heart attack.

525
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think I'm having a thrombosis and I don't even know what it means.

526
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George! Stuart! Breakfast!

527
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Get it while it's hot.

528
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say, "Mama."

529
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say, "Dada."

530
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say anything?

531
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}'Morning, George.

532
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where's Stuart?

533
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He already left.

534
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He did? Without eating breakfast?

535
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He had to get to school early...

536
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...because he's in a school play.

537
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Really?

538
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yes. He plays a mouse. And they rehearse every morning before school.

539
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why didn't he tell us?

540
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He forgot. You know, being worried about Margalo.

541
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Right.

542
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Good. This'll keep his mind off it.

543
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Got to go.

544
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Say, "Oatmeal."

545
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, boy. This is a sign, Stuart. Like the burning bush.

546
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Except it's a carburetor and I'm not Moses.

547
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But it's telling us something.

548
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let your people go!

549
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-We're not giving up. -Oh, why not?

550
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Giving up is fun. And look at all the time you save.

551
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm telling you, if more people gave up, there'd be fewer wars.

552
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Bill.

553
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George.

554
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hi, Mom.

555
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where's Stuart?

556
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He's not home?

557
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, I just remembered. He told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again.

558
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}At Will's house. And he's sleeping over there tonight.

559
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sleepover? On a school night?

560
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, that's what he said. Got to go.

561
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hello?

562
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, Will. It's me, George.

563
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If my mom calls, Stuart's at your house, okay?

564
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hold on a second.

565
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hello?

566
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Will, hi. It's Mrs. Little. May I speak with Stuart, please?

567
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Stuart? -You know, my son.

568
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, Stuart. You mean now?

569
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, now is when I'm calling.

570
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, he just went in the bathroom.

571
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think he'll be a while. He brought a magazine.

572
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Well, then, is your mother there? -Hold on a second.

573
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I told her. -Did she buy it?

574
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom. What will I tell her?

575
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Make something up. You're smart.

576
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If I was smart, I wouldn't be in this situation.

577
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She can't come to the phone right now. She's in the bathroom, too.

578
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But not the same bathroom!

579
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Just let her know I called. Thanks. -Okay, Mrs. Little.

580
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-It's all clear. -I owe you one.

581
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Now will you tell me what's going on? -It's too complicated. Later.

582
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Little hi, Little low.

583
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Little hey, Little ho.

584
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Boys home? -Well, George is.

585
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But Stuart is rehearsing his play.

586
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then he's sleeping over at Will's house.

587
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-He's going without George? -I think it'll give him room to grow.

588
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, Stuart, we've been walking for hours.

589
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't take another step.

590
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You know me, I hate to be negative. But when I walk this much, I chafe.

591
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Also, I hate to bring this up...

592
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...but I need to go tinky.

593
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How about the alley?

594
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm a house cat. We're fastidious creatures.

595
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We don't just yell, "Bomb's away!" and go wherever we are!

596
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, look, let's face it. We'll never find her.

597
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If only we knew someone who really knew the city.

598
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, someone who knows the city's disgusting underbelly.

599
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Who do I know that's disgusting?

600
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,350


601
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,020


602
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,960


603
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't threaten me! What I could tell the health inspector...

604
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...would close you down in a New York minute!

605
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Monty!

606
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell! What are you doing here?

607
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-We've been looking all over for you. -We need your help.

608
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, Snow, are you two still friends or can I eat him?

609
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-No, Monty, you can't eat him. -Please.

610
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No! Now, pay attention.

611
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What do you know about a bird called Falcon?

612
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Falcon? Oh, that's a bad guy. You don't want to fool with him.

613
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where would we find him?

614
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You don't want to find him.

615
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You don't want anything to do with him. Trust me.

616
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop before you could yell for help.

617
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Falcons are vicious.

618
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They grab you by your neck and carry you so high,

619
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}you can't even see the ground.

620
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then they drop you. And when you land,

621
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}they drink what's left through a straw.

622
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell, are you all right?

623
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, yeah. In fact, good news:

624
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I no longer need a litter box.

625
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mop up on aisle three.

626
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stu, listen. This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...

627
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...but it's important to know when the fun's over.

628
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party.

629
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I told you. I'm not giving up. We're going to find the falcon.

630
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All right, then. It's your funeral.

631
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay, listen. Listen carefully.

632
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The falcon lives across the park...

633
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.

634
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Not many people go up there. And even fewer return.

635
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, here we are, Snowbell. This is it.

636
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,180


637
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}"Salmon, catfish, tuna."

638
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why do they taunt me?

639
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How can you think of food at a time like this?

640
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stay on track, will you?

641
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm nervous. When I'm nervous, I eat.

642
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Because I know in my growling gut

643
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}if anything happens to you, I'll be blamed.

644
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm sure they already know we're gone and plan to replace me with a hamster.

645
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't worry. George has us covered.

646
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George? George doesn't know poop from applesauce.

647
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And I say that with a great deal of affection.

648
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Hello, Little residence. -Oh, George. I'm glad you answered.

649
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Who is it? Can you speak louder?

650
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George, it's me, Stuart.

651
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where are you? How are you?

652
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Did you find her? Are you all right?

653
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How's Snowbell? When'll you be home?

654
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mom and Dad are asking lots of questions.

655
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So are you.

656
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I only have a second.

657
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I just want you to know that we're on the trail...

658
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and with any luck, we'll be home by dinner. And, George...

659
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-...thanks for covering for me. -Sure.

660
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But where are you?

661
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Now, listen closely. We're at the Pishkin Building.

662
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Please deposit $0.35 for the next five minutes.

663
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Snowbell, I need more change. -What do I look like, a fanny pack?

664
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you still there?

665
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is that Stuart?

666
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let me think. Yeah.

667
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I thought he was coming home.

668
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He is. Later. He and Will just need to rehearse some more.

669
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}In fact, I just left him at Will's.

670
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hello, Mrs. Little. Is George home?

671
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Will, I found it! -Found what?

672
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-The calculator. -The calculator?

673
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Will, where's Stuart?

674
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's okay. She knows about the play.

675
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's supposed to be a surprise.

676
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I had to tell her so she'd know Stuart's at your house.

677
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We're going back there.

678
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, yeah. Right. It's going to be great.

679
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I just need to get the calculator?

680
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-To figure out how long to rehearse. -It's a very complicated play.

681
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Come on. Let's go. -See you later, Mrs. Little.

682
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George, don't forget you two have a soccer game later.

683
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:45,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We'll meet you there!

684
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't handle this. I'm too stressed.

685
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All this lying. I've never lied before.

686
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's why she believes you.

687
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Boy, are we in trouble. -"We"?

688
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, "we." He didn't spend the night rehearsing at my house.

689
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,810


690
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you planning to do, Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?

691
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll think of something.

692
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}So long, Snowbell!

693
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You've got guts, kid.

694
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Guts and spunk.

695
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Not to mention moxie.

696
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You've got guts, spunk and moxie.

697
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay. Here we go.

698
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All right, Falcon. Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.

699
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You up here?

700
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is anybody here?

701
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm here.

702
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I came for my friend Margalo. If you've hurt her, I'll--

703
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You'll what? -Tell me right now. Is she all right?

704
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?

705
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo, run!

706
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Fly away while I've got him covered. What are you waiting for?

707
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This kid's priceless. Tell me, Cheese-face, does this sound familiar?

708
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}"Oh, my wing. I don't think I can fly."

709
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you talking about?

710
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't drill through the wood.

711
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She scammed you. She played you like a harp.

712
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo, what does he mean?

713
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okay, now it's getting sad. Maybe this will clear things up.

714
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My mom's ring.

715
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.

716
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But, Margalo, why?

717
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't be upset, Mouse-boy.

718
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She has conned smarter than you. Or did you think you were special?

719
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A real friend?

720
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I didn't lie about that, Stuart.

721
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You are my friend.

722
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then come with me.

723
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She's not going anywhere.

724
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, yes, she is.

725
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Was that your best shot? Now, let me show you mine.

726
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't hurt him, Falcon!

727
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I won't hurt him. The sidewalk will!

728
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Can't we talk this over?

729
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No! Stuart!

730
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let me go! No, Falcon!

731
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment.

732
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What have I done?

733
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:59,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll bet something terrible has happened. The Littles will kill me.

734
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:03,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I know, I'll bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit...

735
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as Stuart.

736
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Who am I kidding? I have to get up there. But how?

737
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I hope I live to regret this.

738
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart? Yoo-hoo?

739
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Come out, come out wherever you are.

740
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Please don't jump out from behind anything.

741
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Remember, I have a strong stomach but a very weak heart.

742
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Here, Mousie-Mousie.

743
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell? Is that you? Is that really you?

744
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Margalo? Where are you? -ln the can.

745
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, okay. I'll wait.

746
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, in the paint can.

747
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Why are you in there? Is this some kind of trick?

748
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Just get me out.

749
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is Stuart in there, too?

750
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, Snowbell, he's dead.

751
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What? Stuart is dead?

752
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Falcon killed him.

753
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No. He can't be, he's....

754
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I was supposed to protect him.

755
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I wish it was me who had been killed.

756
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Really?

757
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No. But I am very unhappy!

758
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, dear. I'm dumped on a boat.

759
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:05,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm on a garbage barge. I got to get off.

760
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hello there!

761
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm over here! On the barge! Can you hear me?

762
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Help!

763
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not supposed to be here!

764
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I need to get off!

765
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Help me!

766
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Help!

767
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Rita, hi. I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd get the boys.

768
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-George and Will? -George and Stuart.

769
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George is here, but I haven't seen Stuart.

770
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But he slept here last night.

771
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No.

772
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George!

773
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What are you going to do now?

774
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Which way's Canada?

775
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}This is terrible.

776
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I just want to go home.

777
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:16,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I know a Little is supposed to always see a silver lining.

778
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe this means I'm not really a Little.

779
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Maybe I'm just Stuart Nobody.

780
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart Nothing.

781
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There is no silver lining!

782
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, no. What have I done?

783
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My plane.

784
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My plane!

785
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The silver lining! This is it!

786
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-All right, George, where is he? -And this time, the truth.

787
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not sure.

788
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It is never okay to lie to your parents.

789
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?

790
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's wrong to promise your brother you'll lie to your parents.

791
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Listen to the tone of my voice. Tell us where Stuart is.

792
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:45,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It was a promise. Brother to brother.

793
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}George, I understand. I have a brother.

794
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But whatever I promised, if he was in danger,

795
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}that would matter more to me than the promise.

796
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}How would we all feel if anything happened to Stuart?

797
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He's at the Pishkin Building.

798
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Dad. -What?

799
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Am I in trouble? -No, son. You're in big trouble.

800
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Mom, Dad, I'm really sorry. -You should be.

801
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}For all we know, Stuart could be out there now, lying face down with his--

802
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or, he could be fine. We don't have to assume the worst.

803
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}After all, it's not the Little way.

804
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yes, you're right.

805
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He could be puttering home right now in his shiny little car.

806
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Smiling and happy.

807
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.

808
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Mom. -Yes, George.

809
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I don't think he's puttering home.

810
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Who would do this?

811
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Tiny little vandals.

812
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That miserable falcon!

813
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}From this day forward, I vow revenge.

814
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:35,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If that falcon were here right now, I'd rip his throat out.

815
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'd scratch his face off. I'd--

816
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's him.

817
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't hurt me.

818
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Kill the bird, not me.

819
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm going to be falcon poop.

820
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:51,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, well, well. The canary is out of her cage.

821
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And how nice. She's brought a friend for dinner.

822
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Too bad I don't like canned food.

823
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell, get out!

824
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Can't. Stuck. Too fat!

825
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't do it, Falcon. Or else!

826
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Do what? What's he doing?

827
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or else what?

828
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Or else you'll lose this.

829
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Put that down, Margalo.

830
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm through doing what you tell me to do.

831
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm leaving you, Falcon, forever.

832
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:38,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, and what do you think you'll be without me?

833
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Free.

834
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Big mistake. I'll be back for you, Fur-ball.

835
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Don't hurry!

836
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Stuart! You're alive! -So far!

837
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Where'd you get the plane?

838
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A garbage dump.

839
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Sorry I asked.

840
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-I hope we're not too late. -Keep your eyes peeled. He could be anywhere.

841
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Careful now. One step at a time.

842
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}That's it. You're going to make it. Yeah!

843
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm alive. I'm alive.

844
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Is that you? Take me with you!

845
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What about me? How will I get down from here?

846
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think this is it. Turn here.

847
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okey-dokey. No problem.

848
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, look! It's Stuart.

849
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stop the car!

850
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart!

851
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Look at that bird. He's bigger than me.

852
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We got to save him. Come on.

853
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's the Littles. I'm saved!

854
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wait! It's me!

855
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Follow that flying mouse.

856
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-No problem. -Hey-Little, Ho-Little...

857
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...Hoo-Little, Hey-Hottle, Ho-Wottle, Wo-Wittle.

858
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There he is!

859
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:54,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}If we get out of this, I'm sticking to painting and dancing.

860
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Hey, lady! Get out of the way!

861
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He's closing in.

862
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,550


863
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, my goodness.

864
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Keep it running.

865
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Okey-dokey. No problem.

866
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}He can't hear you.

867
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I think we lost him.

868
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Going up?

869
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Frederick, I feel so helpless.

870
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}A mouse needs to know his limitations.

871
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Pull up!

872
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I can't! It's stuck!

873
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, try harder!

874
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:17,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Margalo! Get out! Save yourself!

875
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:21,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}No, Stuart! If we go, we go together!

876
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Pull up!

877
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Pull up, Stuart! -Stuart, pull up!

878
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You should've stayed in your little hole, Mouse-boy.

879
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart, we can't outrun him.

880
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then we'll just have to face him.

881
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.

882
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But I have to try. I'll be back for you later.

883
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What do you mean?

884
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Don't do it!

885
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Party's over, Fur-face.

886
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's he doing?

887
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}They'll crash!

888
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Turn! Run away!

889
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Bye-bye, Birdbrain!

890
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, dear.

891
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Got you.

892
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Can't I get a decent meal in this city?

893
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Thank you.

894
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart! Are you okay?

895
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I am now. Margalo saved me.

896
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We saved each other.

897
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What did you think you were doing?

898
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You almost gave me a heart attack. -I'm sorry, Mom.

899
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-You ran away from home. -I know.

900
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And you had George lie to us.

901
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah.

902
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Then why am I so proud of you?

903
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.

904
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}My ring.

905
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, I took it.

906
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And now she's giving it back.

907
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm just happy to have all ofyou back.

908
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell!

909
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You made it.

910
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Thank goodness you're all right.

911
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snowbell, where have you been?

912
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You wouldn't believe what Stuart and Margalo have been through.

913
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:17,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You should have seen it. These two were so brave.

914
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Let's go home.

915
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}And how about me? I played no part in this?

916
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:31,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, I have had enough! I'm staying right here, folks!

917
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Oh, yeah. You'll never see me again!

918
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Snow, want some tuna when we get home?

919
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Tuna? I love these people.

920
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Wait! Wait for me!

921
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I guess they're flying south for the winter?

922
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I guess.

923
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You've always dreamed of going, haven't you?

924
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}But Falcon never let you.

925
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:06,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Every year I'd just watch all the other birds go.

926
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The ones who were free.

927
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're free.

928
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We'd be so far apart.

929
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}It wouldn't change a thing.

930
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well....

931
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You're sure of the way? We can call AAA.

932
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}We can get you maps, discount coupons.

933
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}There's a place in South Carolina

934
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}where they do the best pecan pie.

935
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm a bird. Instinct should take over.

936
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I guess you've waited for this a long time.

937
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}All my life. Only....

938
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Only what, dear?

939
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:08,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Well, now it's not just talk. Now, it's the real thing.

940
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Are you scared?

941
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}The world's pretty big, and I'm pretty small.

942
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Somebody once told me, "You're as big as you feel."

943
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Just spread your wings...

944
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}...and soar.

945
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll miss you, Stuart.

946
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:32,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll miss you, too.

947
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'll miss all ofyou.

948
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}You, too, Snowbell.

949
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}I'm not going to cry.

950
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Little hi, Little low.

951
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Little hey, Little ho.

952
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Stuart?

953
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Yeah, Dad?

954
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}What's the silver lining this time?

955
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}She'll be back in the spring.

956
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Bye-bye, birdie.

957
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Did you hear that? -Her first words! She spoke!

958
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:26,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}-Of course she did. -I knew she could do it.

959
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}Big deal. When she can fall from a tree

960
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:30,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}and land on her feet, then I'll be impressed.

961
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:51,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&}亲，有空的时候可以来交流电影哦 加我QQ：1610169789
