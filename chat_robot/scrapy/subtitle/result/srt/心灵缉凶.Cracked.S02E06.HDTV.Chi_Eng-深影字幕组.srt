然后打给了心理科

疑犯对着树林开枪

But this may be a chance to close some. I want you

113
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:07,126
去调查同一条公路上亟待解决的案子
to look into the active unsolveds along the same highway.

114
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,127
确定这家伙的惯用伎俩
Identify this guy's M.O.,

115
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,897
把所有你认为可能符合的案件档案都整理出来

116
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,813

So you're turning us into a task force? 

117
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:14,700
与此同时

128
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,678
身份不明 因此也没有
No identification, so no family

家庭或犯罪历史作为参考
or criminal history to reference.

130
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:07,750
他不说话 因此做不了评测
They can't do the tests because he won't speak.

131
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:10,419

00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,256
基本算当场擒获
Basically in the act.

134
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,424
- 基本 - 他抱着尸体
- Basically? - He was carrying the body.

135
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,523
杀她的凶器上全是他的指纹 
His prints were on the knife that killed her. 

136
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:19,794
他袭击了一辆警车
He assaulted a police car.

137
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:22,731
当值的警官还说他是个疯子
And the officer on duty said he was psychotic.

138
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,004
我想让你进去看看他 
I want you to go in and see him. 

139
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,202
你说了他不开口的
You said he won't talk.

140
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:30,071
他可能会跟你说话
Maybe he'll talk to you.

141
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:36,010
我有一种感应
I had a reaction.

142
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,980
我当时...
I was...

143
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,648
我还很小的时候 有时会感觉
When I was a little girl I used to feel sometimes

144
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:44,051
我好像被天使的翅膀抚过
like I had been brushed by an angel's wing.

145
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:47,520
- 所以他现在成天使了 - 不
- So he's an angel now? - No.

146
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,823
你就进去看看他吧 求你了
Just go in and see him. Please.

147
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,694
当然
Of course.

148
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,212
你有名字吗
You got a name?

149
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,551
你有什么要说的吗
You got anything to say for yourself?

150
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,457
立刻就做 放下武器
Do it now! Drop that weapon!

151
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,481
我觉得那人不是凶手
I don't think that man is a killer.

152
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,184
- 是啊 你觉得他是个天使 - 不是的
- No. You think he's an angel. - No.

153
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,019
我认为...
I think...

154
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:01,445
不是我认为 我感觉到了一些东西
I don't think. I feel something.

155
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,526
你也感觉到了 我看见了 
You felt it too. I saw it. 

156
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,394
你就是这么跟你同事说话的吗
You talk to your colleagues like this?

157
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:09,197
从不
Never.

158
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,732
难道我说错了吗
Am I wrong?

159
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,837
我有个疑问
I have a question.

160
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,205
- 真震惊 - 你入读医学院的时候
- Shocking. - When you started med school,

161
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,207
你知道你会成为一个精神病医生吗
did you know you were going to be a psychiatrist?

162
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:23,344
- 不知道 -什么改变了你 
- No. - What changed your mind?

163
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,312
这些疾病更复杂
The diseases are more complex.

164
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,181
是更大的挑战
Bigger challenge.

165
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,816
癌症是个很大的挑战 不是吗
Cancer's a pretty big challenge, no?

166
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,786
对 确实是
Yes, it is.

167
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:39,359
你认识的人有得癌症的吗
Someone you know have cancer?

168
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:44,898
我妈妈 我十五岁时她患病的
My mom. She got it when I was fifteen.

169
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,532
她去世了吗
Did she die?

170
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,835
我妈妈...
My mom...

171
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,339
坚信如果她的信仰足够坚定
believed that if her faith was strong enough,

172
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:55,375
那么...
that...

173
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,277
上帝会拯救她
God would save her from it.

174
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:01,547
但他没有
He didn't.

175
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:04,750
所以我决定去上医学院
So, I decided to go to med school.

176
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,520
- 去抗击癌症 - 是 我最初是这么想的
- To fight cancer. - Yeah, I thought so. At first.

177
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:10,088
但我其实是想抗击魔鬼
But really I wanted to fight evil.

178
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:14,760
这很滑稽
Which is funny,

179
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:18,430
因为我并非成长于信仰魔鬼之家
because I wasn't raised to believe in evil.

180
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:21,633
而且你很确定精神科医生不该信仰它
And you sure as hell aren't trained to believe in it

181
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:25,036
我们都不用那个词
as a psychiatrist. We don't even use that word.

182
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,340
但我亲眼见过
But I have looked it in the eye.

183
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,978
癌症根本不知道它在干嘛 它只是吞噬你
Cancer doesn't know what the hell it's doing. It just eats you.

184
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,980
但人知道
People do.

185
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,049
某些人知道
Some of them.

186
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,718
- 你想直面魔鬼 - 是的
- You want to face evil? - Yeah.

187
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:45,388
有问题吗
Something wrong with that?

188
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:47,424
没有
No.

189
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:52,194
只是不是我期待的答案
Just not what I was expecting.

190
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,437
这么说他没向巡逻车开枪 
So he never fires at the cruiser. 

191
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,667
他只是朝树林里开枪
He only fires into the trees.

192
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,271
她在动
She's moving.

193
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,395
她还活着 
She's still alive. 

194
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,575
为什么那个巡警没叫救护车
Why didn't the uniform call an ambulance?

195
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,576
波比 查一下无线电抄本
Poppy, check the radio transcription.

196
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,311
- 他打电话叫救护车了吗 - 没有
- Did he call for an ambulance? - Nope.

197
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,781
全弄错了 他是在求助
This is all wrong. He's asking for help.

198
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:15,717
我同意 他根本不是在威胁警官
I agree. He's not threatening the officer at all.

199
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,154
- 好吧 现在是了 - 可他心烦意乱
- Okay, now he is. - Well, he's distraught.

200
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,123
他怀里有个濒死的女孩 他是在恳求帮助
He's got a girl dying in his arms. He's just pleading for help.

201
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,367
死因是多处刀伤
The cause of death is multiple knife wounds.

202
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,068
那枪绝对没用于受害者
The gun definitely wasn't used on the victim,

203
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,762
- 只用了刀 - 我能看看吗
- only the knife. - Can I see that?

204
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:30,998
我们有个问题
We've got a problem.

205
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:32,833
- 什么 - 你看录像了吗
- What? - Have you see this footage?

206
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,047
这警察慌了 我是说 
The cop panicked. I mean, 

207
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,936
他的报告什么都说明不了 他在掩饰
his report doesn't mean anything, he's covering.

208
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,905
我知道 我已经提请了纪律指控
I know. I already filed discipline charges.

209
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,806
我当时和你现在一样生气
I was as angry as you are right now.

210
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,140
- 你最好处理好 - 至少我们抓到了凶手
- Well, you cover it better. - Well, at least we have the killer.

211
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,165
是吗
Do we?

212
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:47,096
我认为没抓到 你看过这个了吗
I don't think we do. Have you looked at this?

213
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,065
才送来的
It just came in.

214
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,134
这女孩被折磨过
This girl was tortured.

215
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,604
不管是谁做的 都造成了极端的痛苦
Whoever did this inflicted...extreme suffering.

216
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:57,473
这些伤口是精心设计的
These wounds are elaborate.

217
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,342
这或许就更容易把他与别的案子联系上
Maybe it'll make it easier to connect him to another case.

218
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,578
这些是我想让你查的案子
These are the cases I want you to look at.

219
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,748
高速公路抛尸 全都是土著女性
Highway body dumps. All Aboriginal women.

220
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,549
看看你能不能把他和这些联系上
See if you can link him to these.

221
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,552
- 克拉拉 做一份侧写 - 没问题
- Clara, I want you to work up a profile. - Absolutely.

222
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,552
侧写是指根据罪犯的行为方式推断出他的心理状态
从而分析出他的性格、生活环境、职业、成长背景等

223
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,464
难道你打算忽略
You just going to ignore everything 

224
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,220
我们刚刚说的有关嫌疑人的一切
we just said about the suspect?

225
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:16,257
录像上的什么都不能使他免罪 艾登
Nothing on that video footage exonerates him, Aidan.

226
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,993
搞清他是谁 找出他与这其中的关联
Find out who he is, link him to these.

227
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:22,930
- 关联 不是他干的 - 好 那你证明啊
- Link him? He didn't do it. - Okay! Prove it.

228
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,856
你觉得我想要什么 卡娅 
What do you think I want, Kaya? 

229
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:03,802
我怎么知道
How would I know?

230
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,336
别这样 你知道的
C'mon, you know.

231
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,176
发生什么了
What's going on?

232
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,279
- 你怎么不去问他们 - 你好吗
- Why don't you ask them? - How you doing,

233
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,615
我是布劳尔警探 这是韦涅夫斯基警探
I'm Detective Brauer, this is Detective Wisnefski.

234
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,684
服务员说你昨晚在这
Waitress says you were here last night?

235
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,219
是的 我吃了晚饭 然后在我的卡车里睡了觉
Yeah, I had dinner. Went to sleep in my truck.

236
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,087
你在附近见过这个人吗 
You see this guy around? 

237
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:26,356
当然 见过几次
Sure. Couple of times.

238
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,706
你知道他叫什么吗 
You know his name? 

239
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,860
不知道 你记得这家伙 对吧 卡娅
Nope. You remember this guy, right, Kaya?

240
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,631
到底发生什么了
What's going on anyway?

241
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,134
我想你们当差的不能随便说吧
I guess you're not at liberty to say, being cops and all.

242
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,671
- 你叫什么 - 雷金纳德斯莱德
- What's your name? - Reginald Slaider.

243
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,573
朋友叫我雷金
Reg to my friends.

244
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:47,343
谢谢你抽空
Thanks for your time.

245
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:52,380
这个蠢货就是在妨碍我吃早餐
All this baloney is interfering with me getting my breakfast.

246
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,382
我应该去投诉
I should file a complaint.

247
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,418
艾伦在哪
Where's Ellen?

248
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:01,089
上次我来的时候她是早班 她还好吗
Last time I was through she had the early shift. She doing okay?

249
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,893
稍等一下 真漂亮
Just a minute, pretty thing...

250
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,235
又一个收藏
That's another keeper.

251
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:21,340
嘿 我有东西给你
Oh, I got you something.

252
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,743
我想让你帮我保管
I want you to keep this for me.

253
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,712
我不想让任何人的唇
I don't want anyone's lips

254
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,947
碰到它 除非那是你的
touching it unless they're yours.

255
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,042
凶案组那边情况如何 气氛好点了吗
How are things over in Homicide? The air better over there?

256
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,778
他们发布了嫌疑人的照片
They released a photo of the suspect.

257
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,715
- 还没人来认 - 你在餐厅附近问了吗
- No one's come forward yet. - You show it around the restaurant?

258
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:47,049
问了 有几个人认出了他 但没人知道他的名字
Yeah. Couple of people recognized him, no one knows his name.

259
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,452
- 我们对她了解些什么 - 不多
- What do we know about her? - Not much.

260
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,388
艾伦欧文斯的驾照上的地址过期了
The address on Ellen Owens' driver's license is out of date.

261
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:55,157
凶案组也很难找到她的近亲
Homicide's having a hard time locating next of kin.

262
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,493
不过 我们找到了这些
But, we did find these

263
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,829
在她工作的地方留下的包里
in a bag that she left at her work.

264
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,965
- 知道是什么吗 - 没头绪
- Any idea what they are? - No idea.

265
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,035
手写体
Handwritten,

266
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,971
符号
symbols.

267
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,439
土著符号
Native symbols?

268
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:17,043
好吧 我去网上查查 谢谢大家
Okay, I'll do a web search. Thanks, guys.

269
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,915
- 嘿 里奥 - 嗯
- Hey, Leo? - Yeah.

270
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:24,684
艾登和我今早尝试和嫌疑人对话
Aidan and I tried to talk to the suspect this morning.

271
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,520
运气不佳 你想试试吗
No luck. You want to give it a try?

272
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:30,122
为什么是我
Why me?

273
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,191
为什么不是你呢
Why not?

274
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,367
嘿 你好
Hey there.

275
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,173
我是里奥
I'm Leo.

276
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,974
我和警察一起工作
I work with the police.

277
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:05,255
你能告诉我这些是什么吗
Can you tell me what these are?

278
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,501
凯什纳诺
Kay she na no

279
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:20,501
[请原谅我放荡不羁用音译 因为我不懂土著语]

280
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:20,503
凯什...
Kay she...

281
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,839
凯什纳诺
Kay she na no?

282
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,474
凯什纳诺
Kay she na no.

283
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:27,109
我们
Us.

284
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,048
我的名字叫里奥
My name, Leo.

285
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,983
贝克特
Beckett.

286
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:37,319
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

287
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,888
贝克特
Beckett.

288
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:41,824
贝克特
Beckett.

289
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:44,826
妮萨...
Neetha...

290
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,028
拉扎勒斯 拉扎勒斯基夫
Lazarus. Lazarus Keefe.

291
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:51,699
阿瓦...
Awa...

292
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:55,436
艾伦欧文斯 我朋友
Ellen Owens. My friend.

293
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,740
# * $ & @
Niweecheewakan.

294
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:09,249
朋友...
Friend...

295
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,588
他说他叫拉扎勒斯基夫
He says his name is Lazarus Keefe.

296
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:16,158
他也就会这么点儿英语 
And that's about all the English he knows. 

297
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,222
那他说的是什么语言
So what does he speak?

298
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:17,894
我们还不知道 
We don't know yet. 

299
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,170
所以我才要求语言学家(支援)
So I requested a linguist.

300
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,173
系统里有他的记录吗
Is he in the system?

301
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:21,150
波比说没有 
Well, Poppy says no. 

302
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,295
但唯一一个有记录的拉扎勒斯基夫
But the only Lazarus Keefe on record

303
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,297
曾在一战中服役
served in the first world war.

304
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:28,033
这倒挺逗 这么说那把枪是一战的
That's funny. The gun used was a World War I issue.

305
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,869
M17左轮手枪
M17 revolver.

306
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,903
也许是他祖父
Maybe his grandfather.

307
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,905
或者太祖父
Great-grandfather?

308
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,451
他还说什么了 
Did he say anything else? 

309
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:38,309
还有就是"艾伦欧文斯是我朋友"
"Ellen Owens is my friend." That's it.

310
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,244
- 看来她对他很重要 - 是的
- She was important to him. - Yeah.

311
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,114
这家伙不是卡车司机 他不怎么会说英语
This guy is no trucker. He can barely speak English.

312
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:44,616
那他是谁
So who is he?

313
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,318
我得回去了 克莉格拉还等着我的侧写呢
I've got to get back. Caligra wants my profile.

314
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:49,937
你是不是想到什么了 
Did you come up with anything? 

315
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,655
是的 我还有很多事要做
Yeah. I actually had a lot to work with.

316
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:56,993
我的侧写完全基于杀手的惯用伎俩
My profile is based solely on the killer's M.O.

317
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:58,995
太平间的照片
The morgue photos

318
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,765
在艾伦欧文斯的尸体上发现了形状奇特的伤口
show the distinctive wound patterns on Ellen Owens' body.

319
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
同样的形状也出现在
This same pattern occurs

320
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,802
她的胃部胸部还有背部
on her stomach, chest and back.

321
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,405
小的辐射圈状切口
Small cuts in radiating circles.

322
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,608
外围浅越往中间越深
Shallow at the perimeter, and then gradually becoming deeper,

323
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:15,010
直到切口最深的中心点
with the central cut being the deepest.

324
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:17,146
受害者的腕关节和踝关节都有挫伤
Bruising of the victim's wrists and ankles

325
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,181
说明她曾经被绑过
indicate that she was restrained.

326
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:22,484
考虑到不断加深的伤口
Consideration has gone into the alternating depths of the wounds

327
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,119
受害者
so that the victim

328
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,121
是失血过多致死
gradually bleeds to death.

329
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,691
这意味着杀手花了很长时间折磨她
That way the killer gets to spend time with her.

330
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,161
当他终于决定杀她时 他刺穿了她的肺
When he was ready to kill her, he punctured her liver.

331
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,530
鉴于切口规则流畅
Note that the cuts are not ragged.

332
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:41,001
是他精雕细琢出来的
He has executed his wounding with finesse.

333
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:43,637
他做过这事
He's done this before.

334
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:46,373
他还会再做
He will do it again.

335
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,375
- 有问题吗 - 这个拉扎勒斯基夫
- Questions? - This Lazarus Keefe,

336
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:51,178
- 那个嫌疑人 你见过他了 - 见过了
- the suspect, you interviewed him? - I have.

337
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:54,013
其实我也见过了
Actually, I have too.

338
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,182
通常当你和一个施虐狂共处一室时
Normally when you're in a room with a sadist,

339
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:58,184
你能感觉到
you can feel it.

340
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,319
你会想要快点儿离开这鬼地方
And you just want to get the hell up out of there.

341
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,989
我们可以把这种感觉称为内心干扰
We call them feelings of visceral disturbance.

342
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:05,825
是一种处于捕食和被捕时的应激反应引发的
There's a predator/prey response that triggers.

343
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,294
- 我没有过这种感觉 - 我也没有过
- I didn't get that feeling. - I didn't either.

344
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:10,614
这家伙身高一米九八 
This guy is 6'6, 

345
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,931
手中持刀 脚边还有一具女孩的尸体
with a knife in his hand and a dead girl at his feet.

346
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,205
显然是他干的 
Come on, he did this. 

347
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,134
不 我觉得他只是发现了她
No. I think he found her.

348
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,970
我们到底怎么评估他
Where are we with his assessment?

349
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,706
被困住了 我们没法儿跟他交流
It's stalled. We can't talk to him.

350
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,975
你知道我的座右铭 让律师解决
Well, you know my motto. Let the lawyers figure it out.

351
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,462
这可不够好 利兹 
That's not good enough, Liz. 

352
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,444
是不够好 艾登 但这是工作
Yes, it is, Aidan. That's the job.

353
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,692
我们不一定喜欢它 只是收集证据而已
We don't have to like it. We just collect the evidence.

354
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,123
我们就是在这样做啊
That's what we're doing.

355
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:35,185
好吧
Okay.

356
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,669
好了 把照片发到网上 
Alright, put the photos on the wires. 

357
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,360
并传到暴力犯罪的连锁分析系统
And run 'em on ViCLAS too.

358
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:57,506
你还好吧
You okay?

359
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,609
听着 即使我找对了人 尽管拉扎勒斯基夫
Look, even if I find the right guy, Lazarus Keefe

360
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,094
符合所有合理的怀疑 
is all the reasonable doubt that he needs. 

361
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,979
我意思是这案子还是毫无头绪
I mean, this case is a mess.

362
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:07,550
你就是在烦这个
Is that what's bothering you?

363
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,384
是的
Yeah.

364
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,277
怎么样 
Anything? 

365
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,242
语言学家正在跟进拉扎勒斯基夫
The linguist is working with Lazarus Keefe.

366
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,179
- 但没啥进展 - 又有了个案子
- No progress yet. - We've got another hit.

367
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:42,115
- 在哪儿 - 帕里湾区
- Where? - Parry Sound.

368
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:44,183
三周前
Three weeks ago.

369
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:48,153
帕里湾区 多伦多 圣玛丽...
Parry Sound, Toronto, Sault Ste. Marie...

370
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,089
这是货车走的路线
That's a truck route.

371
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,320
我们能用这案子来澄清拉扎勒斯基夫吗
Can't we use any of this to clear Lazarus Keefe?

372
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,674
还不行
Not yet, no.

373
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,928
- 你知道不是他干的 - 他是在手之鸟
- You know he didn't do it. - He's a bird in hand,

374
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,897
局里不会放他走的 
the department's not going to let him go. 

375
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,664
尤其是在已经发现了三具尸体的情况下
Not with 3 bodies.

376
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,600
很可能是个极少疏忽的货车司机
A trucker makes sense. Little or no oversight.

377
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:04,102
有很多犯罪的机会
Lots and lots of opportunity.

378
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,701
别跟在我屁股后面
Get off my butt!

383
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,227
我最多能判定是克里族方言
Best I can tell, it's some kind of Cree dialect.

384
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,227
北美印第安人的克里族

385
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:09,229
说实话
To be honest,

386
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:11,666
我从没接触过类似这样的语言
I've never come across anything like it.

387
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,301
也就是说你没法儿跟他说话
So you can't talk to him?

388
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,138
一旦一门语言灭绝了...
Once a language dies...

389
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:44,020
我请你吃早餐 而这里 这儿
I offer to buy you breakfast, and this... this

390
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:46,053
就是你选的地方 谢谢 
is the place that you pick? Thank you. 

391
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:47,590
跟我约会可不破费
I'm a cheap date.

392
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:50,092
这不是约会 你是在工作
This isn't a date. You're working.

393
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:52,995
说吧什么目的
What's the angle?

394
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,098
卡娅格雷女士
Miss Kaya Grey

395
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,300
有所隐瞒
knows more than she's saying.

396
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,236
我不明白的是她为什么不说
What I don't get is why she won't talk.

397
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,505
我们是警察 她是土著人
We're cops. She's Native.

398
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,073
也许是这个原因
That might have something to do with it.

399
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,311
嘿
Hey,

400
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:11,980
你是不是从未停止过工作
you ever stop?

401
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:14,683
我们发现了和其它一些案件的联系
We found links to some other cases

402
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:16,718
就在昨晚我走之前
before I left last night.

403
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,719
我们认为你抓错了人
We think you've got the wrong guy.

404
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,335
你是说布莱克认为吗 
You mean Black does? 

405
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:21,522
我们都这么觉得
All of us do.

406
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:23,290
艾登没告诉我该考虑什么
Aidan doesn't tell me what to think.

407
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:26,159
对你是好事 但你关于那家伙的看法还是不对
Good for you. But you're still wrong about the guy.

408
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:33,233
我打赌他是她儿子
I bet you he's her son.

409
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:37,470
我今天早上查了数据库
I checked databases this morning.

410
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:38,692
有个土著妇女
There's a Native woman 

411
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,473
昨晚在桑德贝失踪了
who went missing outside of Thunder Bay last night.

412
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,475
她的车和孩子们
They found her car and her kids

413
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,677
被发现遗弃在一个休息站 时间吻合
abandoned at a rest stop. The timing fits.

414
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,986
发现尸体前这什么也说明不了 
It means nothing until there's a body. 

415
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:47,981
这没有任何意义
It means nothing

416
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:50,116
除非你能找到这个杀手和尸体间的联系 
until you can link that body with this killer. 

417
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:51,817
她叫露西麦克
Her name's Lucie Mack.

418
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:55,487
别这样 我们唯一能做的就是正确处理这件事
Don't do that. All we can do is work it properly.

419
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:56,679
我在努力啊 戴安 
I'm trying, Diane! 

420
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,124
但我们现在所知的就是一个第一民族的家伙
But right now all we got is a First Nations guy

421
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:00,298
跟一把刀和一具尸体 
with a knife and a body. 

422
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,894
而我们都知道这会让人们怎么想
And we both know how that goes down.

423
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:04,029
如果他是无辜的 你必须拿出证据
If he is innocent, you will prove it.

424
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,678
如果我拿不出呢 
And what if I can't? 

425
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,832
艾登 你整晚都在这里
Aidan. You been here all night.

426
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,267
你应该回家
You should go home.

427
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,837
休息一下 整理一下你自己
Get some rest and clean yourself up.

428
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:15,907
这是命令
That's an order.

429
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,942
遵命 警官
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:36,125
圣母玛利亚 
Mother of God.

431
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,264
嘿
Hey...

432
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,836
这些都是相关的 艾登一夜之间发现的
These are all linked? Aidan turned them up overnight.

433
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:50,706
大多是暴力犯罪联动系统热点 四个省
Most are ViCLAS hits. Four provinces.

434
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,009
是辆卡车 你们还认为我们不对
It's a trucker. You guys still think we're wrong?

435
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,816
我最好记录下
I better check in.

436
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,652
一会见
I'll see you later.

437
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,426
关于艾伦我还有些问题
I've got a few more questions about Ellen.

438
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:15,696
我跟你没什么好说的
I don't have anything to say to you.

439
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,475
你画的画很漂亮
That's a pretty great drawing you've got there.

440
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,777
我能仔细看看吗
Can I see it close up?

441
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:37,950
这是你的名字吗
Is that your name?

442
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:40,519
以利亚
Elijah?

443
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:45,790
这个漂亮的天使是谁
Who's the beautiful angel?

444
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:49,628
- 是妈妈 - 艾伦妈妈
- That's Mommy. - Mommy Ellen?

445
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,530
以利亚 把你的午饭吃完
Elijah! Finish your lunch.

446
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,534
他是艾伦欧文斯的儿子
He's Ellen Owens' son.

447
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,700
你不觉得你应该早告诉我们吗
You don't think you should have told us that?

448
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,008
为什么 那样你就能把他带走了是吗 
Why? So you can take him away? 

449
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,506
必须通知艾伦妈妈的家人
Ellen's family needs to be informed.

450
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,842
由他们决定孩子的命运
It's their decision what happens to the boy...

451
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,844
我就是他的家人
I'm his family.

452
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:09,212
艾伦是我妹妹 
Ellen is my sister.

453
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:14,951
别来打扰我们
Leave us alone.

454
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:17,253
我做不到
I can't do that.

455
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:27,163
必须有人去认领艾伦的尸体
Someone needs to claim Ellen's body.

456
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,200
以利亚 收拾好你的东西 好吗
Elijah? You get your things together, okay?

457
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:39,708
你好 我是侦缉警长艾登布莱克 公安局的
Hi, it's Detective Sergeant Aidan Black, Metro Police.

458
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:41,982
我之前打过电话询问过一名失踪女士

露西麦克

460
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:45,747
有进一步消息吗
Have you heard anything further?

461
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:49,316

Hey. Did you get any sleep?

463
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,055
我没事
I'm fine.

464
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:01,428
艾登
Aidan...

465
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:09,436
艾登
Aidan?

466
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,406
这是以利亚欧文斯 艾伦的儿子
This is Elijah Owens. Ellen's son.

467
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:22,881
抱歉 这是艾登的办公桌 
I'm sorry. This is Aidan's desk.

468
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,984
没关系 请坐
No. That's okay, that's okay. Sit.

469
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:39,063
你在画什么
What are you drawing?

470
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:42,767
我还没想好
I don't know yet.

471
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,110
怎么不试试这些画笔
Why don't you try these?

472
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:57,914
如果你想要可以留着
You can keep them if you like them.

473
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:00,751
谢谢
Thank you.

474
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:16,232
艾登

475
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:20,202
你介意我跟你一起进去与卡娅格雷谈谈吗
Would you mind if I came in and talked to Kaya Grey with you?

476
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:22,338
抱歉
Yeah, sorry...

477
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:25,440
我今天不在状态
I'm a little off today.

今天是十六号
It's the 16th today.

480
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:35,417
一年前的今天我害死了一个孩子
A year ago I got a kid killed.

481
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:39,120
我们里面见
Want to meet me in there?

482
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:42,122

谢谢
Thanks.

484
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,466
你们像对待罪犯一般对待我
You treat me like I'm some kind of criminal!

485
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:54,702
抱歉 没有空房间了
I'm sorry. There's no other room available...

486
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:57,837
- 以利亚在哪里 - 他没事 在隔壁
- Where is Elijah? - He's okay. He's just next door.

487
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,345
卡娅
Kaya,

488
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:08,281
我们会安排把你妹妹的尸体送去殡仪馆
we'll arrange to have your sister's body moved to a funeral home.

489
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:11,284
你选一个
You choose one.

490
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,084
你需要的话我可以帮你
I can help you if you want.

491
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,917
我想跟你谈谈拉扎勒斯基夫  
I want to talk to you about Lazarus Keefe. 

492
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:25,531
艾伦怎么认识他的
How did Ellen know him?

493
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:28,999
他曾经是我们的朋友
He was our friend.

494
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,303
他一直陪着我们 他没有杀艾伦
He was always there for us. He didn't kill Ellen.

495
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,259
对 我相信不是他干的 
No, I don't believe he did. 

496
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,006
我搭档也是这么认为的
My partner doesn't believe so either.

497
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,177
卡娅 我需要你跟他谈谈
Kaya, I need you to talk to him.

498
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,147
我们得查明那天晚上发生了什么
We need to find out what happened that night.

499
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,982
我没法跟他讲话
I can't talk to him.

500
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:47,092
我跟他没法交流 
I don't speak his language. 

501
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:48,385
但是你一定认识什么人
But you must know someone...

502
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,421
没人能跟他交流
There's no one who speaks his language.

503
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,358
他是最后一个 
He's the last.

504
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,396
拉扎勒斯跟他的高曾祖父住在一起
Lazarus lived with his great-great-grandfather.

505
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,233
在他小时候这个老先生带他去了北方
The old man took him up north when he was a boy.

506
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,870
他不想让他上学 他们与世隔绝  
He didn't want him in school. They lived there by themselves.

507
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,573
他死时 拉扎勒斯很孤独
When he died, Lazarus was alone.

508
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,675
但是艾伦在研究他的语言 
But Ellen was learning his language.

509
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:16,010
是的
Yes.

510
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:19,748
拉扎勒斯有人聊天 
And Lazarus had someone to talk to.

511
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:22,884
他靠什么过活
But how does he live?

512
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,886
他住在哪里
Where does he live?

513
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,055
拉扎勒斯没活着
Lazarus doesn't live.

514
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:33,326
他死了
He's a dead man.

515
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:39,308
卡娅认为拉扎勒斯徘徊在
Kaya believes that Lazarus moves between the worlds

516
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:41,802
生死之间的世界
of the living and the dead.

517
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:44,772
她认为他能与鬼魂对话
She believes he communicates with spirits.

518
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:47,307
评估组有不同的看法
The assessment team have a different take.

519
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:49,770
他们认为他有创伤后精神紧张性障碍 
They think he has PTSD. 

520
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:50,410
很符合
It fits.

521
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:52,673
他饱受失眠和焦虑困扰 
He suffers from sleeplessness, anxiety. 

522
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:54,046
护士们无数次
The nurses have recorded

523
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,783
见到他神志昏迷
numerous moments when he seems to fall into a trance.

524
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:59,752
他们也见到过
They've also observed

525
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:01,754
他突然惊慌失措的样子
sudden startling,

526
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:03,789
似乎他听到或者看到什么 
as if he's hearing or seeing things.

527
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:07,726
- 幻觉 - 创伤后精神紧张性障碍有两种
- Hallucinations.- There are two types of PTSD.

528
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,463
你的情况 由灾难性的事件引起的
Yours, brought on by a sudden catastrophic event.

529
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,232
而他的情况 日益积累的精神创伤
And his, cumulative strain trauma.

530
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,902
他所有的人生经历
The sum total of his life experience,

531
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:19,670
失去高曾祖父
the loss of his great-great-grandfather,

532
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:21,972
语言壁垒
language barrier,

533
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,842
寂寞
the loneliness,

534
00:31:24,876 --> 00:31:26,844
艾伦欧文斯的死亡
the death of Ellen Owens...

535
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:29,546
其他还有多少 
And how many others?

536
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,918
收到地方居民报告 
We got a report in from the Provincials.

537
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:52,958
发现了一具尸体

538
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,994
身份鉴定定为露西麦克 
Identified as Lucie Mack. 

539
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:56,174
她被折磨了吗
Was she tortured?

540
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,244
手法相同 是我们要找的人
Same pattern. It's our guy.

541
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,648
有什么发现吗
Did they find anything?

542
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:06,684
当地居民忘记遮盖现场 昨晚下雨了
Locals forgot to tent the scene. Rained last night.

543
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:10,221
现场本来有车轮印 但已经消失了
There were tire tracks,but now they're gone.

544
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,234
我们发现一具尸体

545
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:26,236
露西麦克
Lucie Mack.

546
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,404
居民搞砸了犯罪现场 但是没关系
Locals screwed up the crime scene, but it doesn't matter.

547
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,241
拉扎勒斯基夫已经被排除嫌疑
Lazarus Keefe is eliminated as a suspect.

548
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,309
- 他可能有帮凶 - 与侧写不符 
- He could have an accomplice. - Doesn't fit the profile.

549
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,745
也不可能是模仿的 我们隐瞒了伤害形态
It can't be a copycat, we've held back the wound pattern.

550
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:38,680
- 好的 - 他是无辜的
- Okay. - He's innocent.

551
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:40,915
- 我们差点判他入狱 - 不 
- And we nearly sent him down.- No.

552
00:32:42,985 --> 00:32:46,855
你刚救他免于牢狱之灾 
You just saved him from that.

553
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:48,857
什么
What?

554
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,893
我是说 他们都不能遮盖下犯罪现场吗 
I mean, they couldn't even tent the crime scene?

555
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:55,563
我们尽力而为 
We do what we can.

556
00:32:55,597 --> 00:32:58,399
我会释放拉扎勒斯基夫
I will get Lazarus Keefe released.

557
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,904
做得好
Good work.

558
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:19,386
抱歉
Excuse me.

559
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,188
挨拳头的又不是我
Wasn't me you punched.

560
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:37,636
你多久没睡觉了
How long has it been since you slept?

561
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,871
我睡不着
I can't sleep...

562
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:42,607
我总是忘不了
I'm on the bus again.

563
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:45,610
你说已经1年了吧
One year, you said?

564
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,645
也不算是很长时间
That's not a lot of time.

565
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:52,617
这种感觉不会消失
It doesn't go away.

566
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:54,585
你必须习惯它
You learn to live with it.

567
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,801
这里
There.

568
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:13,470
看到了吗
See?

569
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:16,605
只是墙上的一个洞而已
It's just a hole in the wall.

570
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:27,516
我得走了 他没事吧
Listen, I gotta go. Is he going to be okay?

571
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,819
谢谢
Thank you.

572
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,657
把当前所有的发现写份书面报告给我 
I want detailed written reports of your recent findings, 

573
00:34:57,658 --> 00:34:58,346
我要把它们
and I will pass them on

574
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,937
交给省级相关机关以及皇家骑警队 
to the provincial authorities and the RCMP. 

575
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:01,648
然后呢
And then what?

576
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,649
他们会继续调查
Homicide will continue their investigation

577
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,353
艾伦欧文斯一案的凶手 拜托快点整理吧
into Ellen Owens' murder. Pack it up, please.

578
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,355
怎么了
What's going on?

579
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,161
心理科已为疑犯洗脱嫌疑 
Psych Crimes has cleared the suspect. 

580
00:35:10,162 --> 00:35:11,491
我们要准备移交工作
We're handing off.

581
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:13,493
移交给谁
Handing off to who?

582
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,196
- 问得好 - 这不关我们的事了 里奥
- Good question. - It's out of our hands, Leo.

583
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,830
剩下的案子不在我们的管辖范围内
The other cases are out of our jurisdiction.

584
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:21,600
我想真正的凶手也不在
The killer probably is too.

585
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:24,003
快点 赶紧整理吧
Come on, pack it up.

586
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,414
我准备走了 你呢
Alright, I'm going. You too.

587
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,882
这些我们可以明天早上再整理
We'll finish this in the morning.

588
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:17,151
- 我在等布劳尔 - 没事吧
- I'm waiting for Brauer. - Things good?

589
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:20,122
嗯 案子是...
Yeah. Case is...

590
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:22,390
不 以前是牵绊
was getting in the way.

591
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,127
还会有新的案子的
There'll be another one.

592
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,499
- 我是布莱克 请留言 - 艾登
- This is Black. Leave a message. - Aidan,

593
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:09,002
我发现了相关案子的一份目击者笔录
I just found a witness report on one of the linked cases.

594
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:11,069
之前被我们忽略了
It was misfiled.

595
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:12,671
目击者说最后一次看到受害人时
Witness fingered a trucker 

596
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:13,472
提到个卡车司机
last seen with the victim.

597
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:16,375
司机的名字是雷金纳德斯莱德 艾伦被杀那晚
His name is Reginald Slaider. He was at the restaurant

598
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:18,968
他在那家餐厅 我跟他的雇主确认过了
the night Ellen was murdered. I just checked with his employer,

599
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:20,025
他的行驶路线完全符合我们的假设
and his routes fit our pattern.

600
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:22,313
猜猜目击者是谁
Guess who the witness was?

601
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:25,683
是卡娅格雷 我现在就去餐厅
Kaya Grey. I'm headed to the restaurant now.

602
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:28,686
没错 是我做的笔录
Yes, I made the report.

603
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,200
为什么你没告诉我们 
Why didn't you tell us? 

604
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,556
做完笔录就没有下文了
Nothing happened then.

605
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,019
现在又有什么区别吗 
Why would it be any different now? 

606
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,925
但你知道我们正在调查...
But it was followed up...

607
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,995
我当然知道 就跟这次一样
Sure it was. Just like this time.

608
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,463
你们根本就没调查清楚 你们抓住了拉扎勒斯
No, you didn't 'follow up.' You had Lazarus.

609
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:42,465
你们已经准备让他当替罪羊了
You were all ready to hang it on him.

610
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,501
- 卡娅... - 滚
- Kaya... - Go to hell.

611
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:53,676
我是布莱克 请留言
This is Black. Leave a message.

612
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,246
艾登 快来载货汽车停车场 记得带上支援
Aidan. Get over to the truck stop right away, and bring backup..

613
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,582
雷金纳德斯莱德 他就在这里
Reg Slaider. He's here.

614
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,265
我是艾登布莱克警探
Detective Aidan Black.

615
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,446
你是雷金纳德斯莱德
You Reginald Slaider?

616
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,648
没错 有事吗
Yeah. So?

617
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:35,550
你怎么会有个这么蠢的名字
How'd you get such a stupid name?

618
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:40,455
你父亲帮你取的吗
From your dad?

619
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:44,125
不 你根本不知道你父亲是谁 是吗
No, you wouldn't know who your father is, would you?

620
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:49,964
你 你想知道些什么
You, uh, you want something?

621
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:52,200
不久前有一份目击者笔录
There was a witness came forward a while back.

622
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,202
关于你之前搭载的一个女孩儿的
About a girl you gave a ride to.

623
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:56,770
目击者吗 还真是有趣
A witness? Well, that is interesting.

624
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:01,774
之前也有一个不知道名字的白痴警官
Once upon a time, there was an Officer Joe Idiot

625
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:03,910
问过我同样的问题
asked me some questions.

626
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:06,880
你问的是同一个女孩儿吗 蠢蛋警官
You asking about the same girl, Officer A-hole?

627
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:11,784
她叫查斯媞 不是你们问的那个
Her name was Chastity. She wasn't.

628
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,087
在路边我就让她下车了
I dropped her off. Side of the road.

629
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,856
当时周围一个人都没有 但是她坚持要下车
No one around for miles, but she wanted out.

630
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,859
- 当时她还活着吗 - 我记得是的
- Was she alive? - Far as I recall.

631
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:22,127
但是据那个警官所说
Not for long, though.

632
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:24,430
她不久之后就死了
According to the officer.

633
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:25,582
那露西麦克呢 
What about Lucie Mack? 

634
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,067
被绑架的印度少妇 还有两个孩子的那个
Indian chick. Kidnapped. Couple kids?

635
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,069
没错 
That's right.

636
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:32,070
报纸上登了
That was in the paper. 

637
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,205
或许我见过她
Maybe I saw her.

638
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,856
是吗 你这么了解
Yeah, you were up that way? 

639
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:37,242
没错 不过她跟其他人一样
I was. But, she'd be like the rest of them.

640
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,111
不合身的内衣 廉价的香水 还有纹身
Underwear that doesn't match. Cheap perfume. Tattoos.

641
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,913
你喜欢那样的女孩吗
You like girls like that?

642
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,948
是她们喜欢我
They like me.

643
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,219
你杀过人没有
You ever kill anyone?

644
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,792
哦 你的表情已经告诉我了
Well, I bet that's something.

645
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,827
当你的双手感受到他们温热的鲜血
You feel their blood warm on your hands.

646
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,929
闻着就像潮湿的金属味
That wet metal smell of it.

647
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,932
看着他们痛苦挣扎
Something to watch them suffer.

648
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:05,502
听着他们的祈求声
Hear them beg.

649
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,940
你是什么感觉
How'd that make you feel?

650
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,211
说说看吧
Tell me.

651
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,313
我真的非常想知道
'Cause, I'd like to know.

652
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:25,253
尿完了回来找我
Come back and see me after you take your piss.

653
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:28,123
我可不是要去卫生间 雷金
Yeah, I'm not going to the bathroom, Reg,

654
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,125
我只是要去检查你的装备
I'm going to search your rig.

655
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,160
逮捕令已经到了
Warrant just arrived.

656
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:46,240
盯着他 看好门
Keep an eye on him. Watch the door.

657
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:49,109
我今天早上捡了一辆空拖车
I just picked up an empty trailer this morning.

658
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:55,281
他们说的那个目击者是谁 卡娅
Who's that witness they're talking about, Kaya?

659
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:58,618
是你吗
That you?

660
00:40:58,653 --> 00:41:03,156
我听说他们已经找到了凶手
I hear they got the guy that did it.

661
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,391
那让你觉得心里好受些了吗
That puts your mind at rest.

662
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:09,895
没错
Yeah.

663
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:17,336
我从后面进
I'll take the back.

664
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:28,713
放下刀 雷金 放下刀
Hey! Put it down, Reg, put it down.

665
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:31,148
- 现在就放下 - 照他说的做 斯莱德
- Drop it! Now! - Do it, Slaider.

666
00:41:31,183 --> 00:41:34,385
是她 把她铐起来
Arrest her! Put the cuffs on her!

667
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:47,931
# $ & @ 
Kitooteemuk.

668
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,186
你为什么没告诉我们
Why didn't you tell us?

669
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,188
我不相信你们
I don't trust you.

670
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:16,190
我只相信拉扎勒斯
I trust Lazarus.

671
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:19,027
你策划了这一切 你知道是雷金做的
You planned this. You knew about Reg.

672
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:22,096
拉扎勒斯来这里就是为了杀他
Lazarus came here to kill him.

673
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:24,098
你应该告诉我们的
You should've talked to us.

674
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,567
我跟你们说了雷金会死吗
Would Reg be dead if I did?

675
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,936
那艾伦呢
Would Ellen?

676
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,640
你们那帮人都没有救艾伦斯
Yes. You people don't save Ellens.

677
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:42,516
她会怎么样
What's going to happen to her?

678
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,684
至少会被判袭击的罪名
She'll get assault. At least.

679
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:46,037
在量刑时应该要考虑到
Reg Slaider tortured these people. 

680
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:47,620
雷金纳德斯莱德的所作所为
That should count for something.

681
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,355
嗯 也许她因此会得到一些同情 但是...
Well, she'll get some sympathy, but...

682
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:51,791
不公平的是他会获得最大量刑
Odds are he'll get the maximum.

683
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:54,027
至少他的目的已经达到了
He's done what he came for.

684
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:58,730
# 我无所畏惧 #
I fought a careless way

685
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:05,837
