1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,180
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,100
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,410
I have come home with only one goal...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,620
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,620
But to do so,I can't be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,340
To honor my friend's memory,I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,260
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,150
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,660
The defendant is found not guilty.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,450
Hello,Moira.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,690
What do you want,Malcolm?

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,920
Thea is my daughter.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,380
What do these guys want with a seven year old sub?

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,340
What's on it,it'll save the human race.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,640
Will it save him?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,550
Sir,there's been a development.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,470
Brother Cyrus...

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,670
How do you feel?

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,910
Stronger.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,680
What was that?

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,860
<font color=#70DBDB>-=http://bbs.sfile2012.com=-Proudly Presents</font>

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,590
Mrs.Queen,welcome back to the company.

25
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,230
Thank you.

26
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,320
- You look fabulous. - Really,better than ever.

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,390
Did you do something to your hair?

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes,I shampooed it without eight women and a guard watching me.

29
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,690
Is it ok to laugh?

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,290
Because I was ordered not to say anything about you being in prison,

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,760
just to avoid any awkward...exchanges.

32
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,880
Like that one.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,800
Right.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,680
We need to drill down on these numbers before the earnings call.

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,490
Oliver.I didn't realize your mother was stopping by for a visit today.

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,680
Well,it's not a visit.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,380
This is her company,too.

38
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,000
Of course.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,860
How are you,Moira?

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,090
Back,Isabel.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,880
Mr.Queen,may I speak to you for a minute?

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,920
What sort of message does it send to the investment committee,to the city,

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,620
if we hand Queen Consolidated right back to your mother?

44
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,570
- She was acquitted. - By a jury.Not by the city.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,310
Oliver.Stop thinking like a son and start thinking like a CEO.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,440
Oliver.There's been a break-in.

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,490
Damn!

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,260
This door was made of expanded reinforced titanium.

49
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,150
What did they use to do this?

50
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,640
Not sure yet.No sign of any explosives.

51
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,590
Maybe a crane,maybe a forklift.

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm guessing there was at least three of them,maybe four.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,420
And given how quick they got in and out of here...

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
They were fast.

55
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,530
Whoa,hey,stop,wait!You don't even have a fare!

56
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,190
Any idea what these guys were so hot to break in here for?

57
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,860
You didn't happen to leave a spare earthquake machine lying around,did you?

58
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,360
Sorry.

59
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,770
This is what we're able to pull off the security cameras.

60
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,530
He was the only guy we got on video.

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,870
The rest of the crew must have come in after him.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,630
Actually,it was only one guy.

63
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,280
Ah,sorry I'm late.

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,900
But actually,my train was late.

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,830
Well,the second one.The first one I did miss,

66
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,670
but that was my cab driver's fault.

67
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,970
I've got this great traffic app,and...

68
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,800
But he thought that he was right.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,890
I'm here now,though.So.

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,420
Great.Who the hell are you?

71
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,080
And do your parents know that you're here?

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm Barry Allen.

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,320
I'm from the Central City police department.

74
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,450
I'm with the crime scene investigation unit.

75
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,010
We're working on a case with some similar unexplained elements in Central City,

76
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,170
so when the report of your robbery came over the wire,my captain sent me up here.

77
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,940
And you think one guy ripped through this door like it was tin foil?

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,470
One very strong guy,yeah.

79
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,650
Uh,it takes about 1,250 foot pounds of torque to break someone's neck.

80
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,640
You see the marks on the guard's neck?

81
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,230
The bruising pattern suggests the killer used only one hand.

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,610
I'm guessing you don't know how hard it is to break someone's neck.

83
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,910
Hmm?No.No idea.

84
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,540
Uh,we're going to need a list of the entire inventory here to figure out exactly what was stolen.

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,850
Actually,I think I know what was stolen.

86
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,410
A centrifuge.

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,460
An industrial centrifuge.

88
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,520
Probably the Cord Enterprises 2BX 900.Maybe the six series.

89
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,800
Both have a three column base.

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,130
Here,you can see the three sets of broken bolts where the thief just...

91
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,530
ripped it out of the ground.

92
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,070
And what exactly is a centrifuge?

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,540
It separates liquids.

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,420
The centripetal acceleration causes denser substances to separate out along the radial direction.

95
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,380
And lighter objects move to the top.

96
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,290
What did you say your name was again?

97
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,990
Barry.Allen.

98
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,780
Felicity.Smoak.

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,220
Um,you can see the cracks heading towards the door.

100
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,480
Footsteps.

101
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,180
One guy.

102
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,500
Anyway,it's just a theory.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,520
One backed by a lot of evidence.

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,410
There has to be another explanation.

105
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,860
Yeah.I'm sure you're right.

106
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,110
You might want to fill our mutual friend in on this.

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,210
Yeah.Don't worry.

108
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,970
I'm sure he's already on it.

109
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,050
We need to change directions 10 degrees north.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,330
We need to rest.

111
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,010
If Ivo and any of his men survived that blast,they'll be tracking us.

112
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,410
We keep moving.

113
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,770
Five minutes.

114
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,440
- You watch him,please. - Of course.

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,960
Do you believe them?

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,790
That this Hosen will lead us to a wrecked Japanese sub?

117
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,110
Ivo seems to think so.

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,570
I just hope whatever miracle serum they're after is actually onboard.

119
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
For his sake.

120
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,640
How do you know that girl?

121
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,200
Sara was on my father's boat...

122
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,280
with me.

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,170
What about the girl in the picture?

124
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,490
Laurel?

125
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,900
The girl you told me you were in love with.

126
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,980
Sara is her sister.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,060
I feel like taking a walk.

128
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,000
Anyone care to join me?

129
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,710
I guess a lot's happened in the last year.

130
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,590
Oliver.

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,790
Got the final inventory from applied sciences.

132
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,800
That CSI from Central City was right.

133
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,250
The only thing missing is a centrifuge.

134
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,080
You have to see this.

135
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,510
I pulled up CC traffic camera footage from across the street of applied sciences.

136
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,140
This is three minutes after the alarm went off.

137
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,400
Can we help you with something,Detective?

138
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,130
Oh,CSIs aren't actually detectives.

139
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,570
We don't even carry guns.

140
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,150
Just some plastic baggies.

141
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,850
- Uh,where should I set up my equipment? - I'll show you.

142
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,090
What's going on?

143
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,980
Your assistant said that you preferred to keep the investigation in house,

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,790
so I cleared it with my captain to give you a hand.

145
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,570
What are you doing?

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,940
We need to find this intruder.

147
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,220
And he seems to know more about it than any of us.

148
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,000
Forensic science isn't exactly my forte,so...

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,160
I'd say we need him.

150
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,500
Wouldn't you?

151
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,990
Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,460
I'll show you around.

153
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,060
Why am I getting the feeling you know more about this than Felicity's new friend?

154
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,370
Pray I'm wrong.

155
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,640
Hi.

156
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,140
I'm sorry about what happened at the office this morning.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,250
There are a lot of people who think I got away with murder,Oliver.

158
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,650
Maybe I did.

159
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,240
Mom,the trial,the Undertaking,Malcolm Merlyn,all of that is behind us now.

160
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,820
And we need everyone to see that.

161
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,000
How are we going to do that?

162
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
We throw a party.

163
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,180
Thea.

164
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,980
Roy.

165
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,240
Did I hear you guys say something about a party?

166
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,500
A welcome back to Queen Consolidated party for mom.

167
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,460
I don't think so.

168
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,870
If things are going to get back to normal,then we need to start acting normal.

169
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,500
Normal for us is a lavish party.

170
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh.I'm sorry,Mrs.Queen,I can't stay for brunch.

171
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,700
I guess we got to go.

172
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,100
Bye.

173
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,740
I'll take care of everything.

174
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,020
What exactly are you looking for?

175
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,280
Your thief's shoes touched the ground,

176
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,080
which means he tracked in dozens of clues as to where he's been the past few days.

177
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Got ya.

178
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,950
Shouldn't take long.

179
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,530
So you've seen him,right?

180
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,900
The Vigilante?

181
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,440
I read that he saved you.

182
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,670
What was he like?

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,340
- Green. - Green.

184
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,750
That's interesting,right?

185
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,930
I mean,why green?

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,420
Black would be better for stealth,and urban camouflage.

187
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,990
Me,personally,I think that he trained in some sort of like forest or jungle environment,

188
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,230
and the green is a nod to that.

189
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,500
I don't give the vigilante much thought.

190
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,660
Police reports show that he uses carbon arrows,

191
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,150
but if he switched to an aluminum carbon composite,

192
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
he would have far better penetration.

193
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,780
Maybe he thinks he penetrates just fine.

194
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,060
Do you want to know something else?

195
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,010
I think that he has partners.

196
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,250
Definitely someone with a background in computer sciences.

197
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,010
Yeah.

198
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,880
Why are you so interested in the Vigilante?

199
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,370
When I was 11,my mom was murdered.

200
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm so sorry.

201
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,550
They never caught the guy who did it.

202
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,550
Maybe he would have.

203
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,590
The soil...

204
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,700
there's a crystalline structure in it.

205
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,430
That's weird.

206
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
What's weird?

207
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,660
It's sugar.

208
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,570
Sin,you said this was an emergency.

209
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,790
No offense,but Thea,you shouldn't be here.

210
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,340
In the alleyway of the club I own?

211
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,370
It's my friend Max.He's missing.

212
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,110
I haven't seen him for a week,no one has.

213
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,350
Something happened to him.

214
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,020
I figured you knew someone who could help.

215
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,970
Roy can help you.

216
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,910
I thought you wanted me to stay out of trouble.

217
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,710
I kind of like that you never turn away from someone who needs help.

218
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,890
I'll just get someone to cover the club.

219
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,090
What do you mean?

220
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,600
Oh,I'm coming with you.

221
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,680
I hear you're throwing a party.

222
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,100
I didn't get my invite.

223
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,290
Where exactly should I have addressed it?

224
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,320
Starling City cemetery?

225
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,280
I know that's where you wish I was right now.

226
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,400
Lying beside my son.

227
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,020
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you,Malcolm?

228
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,890
You killed Tommy.

229
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,490
You killed your son.

230
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,560
You cannot have my daughter.

231
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,750
Our daughter.

232
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,570
I think we both needed someone that night.

233
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,560
I felt so bad about betraying Rebecca's memory

234
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,070
that I left Starling.

235
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,880
Left Tommy behind.

236
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,950
That's when I made my way to Nanda Parbat,

237
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,330
where I found my new purpose.

238
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,820
In a way,Moira,

239
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,940
you made me the man I am today.

240
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,010
Thea is innocent.

241
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,890
She loved Robert.

242
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,460
Please don't take that away from her,I'm begging you.

243
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,160
Thea is all I have left.

244
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,140
Tell her the truth,and tell her soon.

245
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,790
You found something?

246
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,680
We found something.

247
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,720
There were trace amounts of sucrose and a spec of dirt the killer dragged in here on his boot.

248
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,670
Which got me thinking.

249
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,690
There is a sugar refinery two miles from here.

250
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,450
The land around it is suffused in waste sugar.

251
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,560
So I checked.

252
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,260
They had a delivery truck stolen a few days ago.

253
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,640
Their truck matches the make and model of the truck the thief used to steal the centrifuge.

254
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,680
Can you track the vehicle?

255
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,860
We've been trying.

256
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,200
What was that?

257
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,100
You're not going to believe this.

258
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,010
The truck,it was just used to rob a blood bank.

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
Are you sure?

260
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,530
Yeah.Our guy just made off with 30,000 ccs of O-negative.

261
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,510
What,he has super strength,likes blood?

262
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,110
Please don't tell me we suddenly believe in vampires.

263
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,430
We should give this information to the local police.

264
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,170
I'll...take care of that.

265
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,640
Did you say that you were working a similar case in Central City?

266
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,800
Oh,yeah,um...

267
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah,you know,it's similar.

268
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,820
Has similar elements.

269
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,720
A lot of similarities.

270
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,750
Right.

271
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,840
Yeah.I want you to look into this Allen kid.

272
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,260
There's more to him than he's letting on.

273
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,850
His intentions seem pretty clear to me.

274
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,540
Just do it,please.

275
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,150
Oliver,when are you going to tell me what exactly we're up against?

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
Yeooww!

277
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,000
Sorry.

278
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Thank you.

279
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,730
You were right to ask if I knew more than I was letting on.

280
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,240
I've seen men with abilities like that before.

281
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
You have?

282
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,310
Where?

283
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,550
The island.

284
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,950
My second year marooned there,we...

285
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:26,020
I came across the remains of a Japanese World War II military project.

286
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,180
It was a serum designed to create human weapons.

287
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,340
Human weapons.

288
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,590
My God,what's next,aliens?

289
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,330
This is real,Diggle.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,140
Those five years that I was away,I came across things that just...

291
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,820
defy explanation.

292
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,700
There's a doctor,his name is Ivo,

293
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,500
and he came to the island to test the serum on people.

294
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,240
The ones that survived,their endurance,reflexes and strength were all enhanced.

295
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,850
And you think this Ivo's in Starling City?

296
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,480
He's dead.

297
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,230
And so is everyone that he injected with the serum.

298
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,880
The last of which...

299
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,090
I burned.

300
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,460
You think someone found the recipe.

301
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,590
The centrifuge and a large supply of blood.

302
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,260
I think someone wants to make more of it.

303
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,510
A lot more.

304
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,310
Why couldn't you have been marooned on Aruba?

305
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,510
There's a third component...

306
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,510
a strong sedative.

307
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,350
I think I preferred it when you left these in people.

308
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,270
I need you to analyze the blood on the arrowhead.

309
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,360
If we can figure out which sedative they're using...

310
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,460
We can figure out where the next robbery will be.

311
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,070
Barry and I will get right on it.

312
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,390
I think our Miss Smoak is smitten.

313
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,710
Diggle,what did you find out about Mr.Allen?

314
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,730
He's not who he says he is.

315
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,250
How are you holding up?

316
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,280
I could do with a better looking crutch.

317
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,330
You two seem like you've gotten pretty chummy.

318
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,130
We're here.

319
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,780
There must be a fissure in the island below the waterline for it to come that far inland.

320
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,360
Unbelievable.

321
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,990
They have nitric acid next to hydrazine?

322
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,390
Permanganates on top of acetone?

323
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,730
This is the definition of dangerous.

324
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,260
If it's so dangerous,maybe you shouldn't be touching them.

325
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,690
- Barry. - Yeah.

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,380
I managed to get a sample of the perpetrator's blood from the police department.

327
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,790
We need to isolate a sedative in the blood.

328
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,430
It could lead us to the thief.

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,780
How did the police get it?

330
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,020
Apparently the Vigilante shot him with an arrow.

331
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,570
You're kidding.

332
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,700
You know what this means,right?

333
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,690
This means the Vigilante's working the same case we are!

334
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,460
Heh.Go figure.

335
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,920
How did you get it?

336
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,860
Oliver has a lot of connections.

337
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,600
Wow.Pays to work for a billionaire.

338
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,300
Actually my take home's nothing special.

339
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,140
Especially given I am rarely at home,since I'm with him every night.

340
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,740
Well,I didn't realize you and he were...

341
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,970
Oh,no.

342
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,710
Work.He...

343
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,870
and I are not,no,I do not like Oliver.

344
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,390
Um,I was invited to a work function.

345
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,410
It's a party.

346
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,020
And I have a plus-one.

347
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,240
I was thinking you would make a really good...

348
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,440
plus one.

349
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,100
There's not going to be dancing,is there?

350
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,930
I'm not just not too good on my feet.

351
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,530
It reeks in here.

352
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,960
I guess your friend wasn't too into painting seascapes.

353
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,620
Max is like any starving artist...

354
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,120
starving.

355
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,600
But I could always crash here when I didn't have a place to stay.

356
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,670
Hey,this blood drive was a week ago.

357
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,400
When did you say he went missing?

358
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,440
That day.

359
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,150
It's Daily.

360
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,500
Someone's looking for Maxwell Stanton.

361
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,060
And they should find him.

362
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,470
Yes,brother blood.

363
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,020
Blood provides life.

364
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,780
Blood provides power.

365
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,110
And with power...

366
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,640
There's no limit to what I can do.

367
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,330
Central City is just a day away from making history

368
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,810
when the controversial S.T.A.R.Lab's particle accelerator is finally turned on.

369
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,810
Pretty cool,right?

370
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,500
You know there's been a hundred percent increase in earthquakes

371
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,410
since they've turned on the Large Hadron Collider.

372
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,070
That data is misleading.

373
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,940
Oh,do tell.

374
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
You know about misleading,don't you?

375
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,620
What are you talking about?

376
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,520
He's not from CSI,he's an assistant.

377
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Whose bosses don't know you're in Starling.

378
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,610
And there is no similar case in Central City.

379
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,010
So tell me,Barry...

380
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,350
What are you really doing here?

381
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,530
I told you my mom was murdered.

382
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,990
By your father.

383
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,420
He didn't do it.

384
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,610
You said that the police didn't find the man who killed her.

385
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,790
The police think they did.

386
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,480
My dad has been serving a life sentence.

387
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,030
They didn't believe me.

388
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,670
About what?

389
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,000
I was 11.

390
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,250
One night...

391
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,720
something just came into our house,like a tornado.

392
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,480
A blur.

393
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,430
Somewhere inside The Blur,I saw a person.

394
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,330
My dad went to fight it.

395
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,760
I tried to get 'em when suddenly...

396
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,230
I was 20 blocks away from our house.

397
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,710
Nobody believed me.

398
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,160
They thought I was trying to cover for my father.

399
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,400
But what I saw that night was real.

400
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,440
As real as the man that ripped down that metal door with his bare hands.

401
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,920
That's why I look into cases like this.

402
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,640
The ones nobody believes are possible.

403
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,190
Maybe if I can just make sense of one,

404
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,510
I might be able to find out who really killed my mother.

405
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,750
And free my dad.

406
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,700
I am sorry I lied to you.

407
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,640
Better find another plus one.

408
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,170
He did lie about who he really was.

409
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,090
And what do we do every day?

410
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,210
Hey.

411
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,890
How's everything going in there?

412
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,270
Good evening,Queens.

413
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,800
Can I have a word?

414
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,210
Yeah.

415
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,830
I'm sorry if I overreacted a little bit earlier.

416
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,230
Oh,you think?

417
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,190
Look,right now you need to apologize to your mother.

418
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,230
Not me.

419
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,030
- For what? - Your being wrong.

420
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,340
I guess these days,I only draw a crowd when I'm on trial for murder.

421
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,740
Mom,you don't have to...

422
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,480
We have guests.

423
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,120
However few of them there are.

424
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,770
This is not your fault,Ollie.

425
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,510
How's your mom doing?

426
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,160
Oh,you know us Queen women...

427
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,900
nothing gets to us.

428
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,410
You must take after your dad.

429
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,680
Sorry.

430
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,620
Sin.What's up?

431
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,210
I found Max.

432
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,510
Where?

433
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,200
I'm on my way.

434
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,330
They find Max?

435
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,720
Um,no.

436
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,390
She just wants me to stop by.

437
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,880
I can come with you.

438
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,400
You should stay here.

439
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,920
Your mom needs you.

440
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,250
Ok,I'll call you later.

441
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,120
Time for a dance?

442
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,840
Not really feeling like dancing with you,Oliver.

443
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,040
I know.

444
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,460
And that is why I called him.

445
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,700
Fyi... they will card him at the bar.

446
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,610
- Hi. - Hi.

447
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,420
I was serious about not being able to dance.

448
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,860
But I'll hold your hands and sway.

449
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,500
Sold.

450
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,740
Ok.

451
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,450
I tried to warn you.

452
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
I tried to ignore you.

453
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,750
I am sorry,Oliver.

454
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,380
Yeah.

455
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,890
Oliver threw you a lovely party.

456
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,450
Oliver's a good son,if not the best judge of character.

457
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,650
Is everything ok?

458
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,830
Everything's going perfectly.

459
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,380
He doesn't have long.

460
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,390
If this miracle drug is onboard,then we need to find it now.

461
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,060
Slade,be back in a few minutes,ok?

462
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,270
I'll just get comfortable.

463
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,000
Come on.

464
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,930
There.

465
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,600
Mirakuru.

466
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,060
Miracle.

467
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,920
I was never sure it was real.

468
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,500
What happens if we give it to Slade?

469
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,730
He needs a sedative in his bloodstream first.

470
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,690
They might have potassium bromide or barbital.

471
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,980
Ohh.It's empty.

472
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,490
What happens if we give it to him without the sedative?

473
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,520
Sarah!

474
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,020
He'll die,for sure.

475
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,570
He's going to die anyway.

476
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,160
What was that?

477
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,560
Ivo and his men.

478
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,910
They're on the sub.

479
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,830
Have you made contact?

480
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,840
Yes.

481
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,820
He said to tell you that your information was gratefully accepted.

482
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,330
Thank you.

483
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,570
- Who was that? - Nothing to worry about.

484
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,460
Thank you for tonight,Oliver.

485
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,700
It was a lovely party.

486
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,230
I'm so sorry that I put you through that.

487
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh,listen,I don't care what anyone else in this city thinks of me.

488
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,550
I only care what you two think.

489
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,500
And I have to get back to the office.

490
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,940
Excuse me.

491
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,880
Thea.

492
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,740
There's something I need to tell you.

493
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,810
Sure.What is it?

494
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,910
I love you.

495
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,070
I love you,too.

496
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,130
Yes.

497
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,070
Yes,sir.I...

498
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,570
yes,director,I know that this is not the first time.

499
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes,sir,I do value my job,very much.

500
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,970
Look,I will be on the next train.

501
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,060
Mm-hmm.I'll be back tonight.

502
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,950
Ok.Thank...

503
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,220
Well,my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.

504
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,020
I need to get back to Central City if I still want to be employed.

505
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,470
Which I do.

506
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,660
Tell the SCPD that the sedative in the thief's blood is Ketamine.

507
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,270
It's a schedule three controlled substance.

508
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,490
It shouldn't be too hard to track.

509
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,710
Yeah,I'll make sure they get it.

510
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,870
Thank you.

511
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,990
- It was really nice...  - thank you for...

512
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,410
- working with you. - everything,We couldn't have done it...

513
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,030
Without you.

514
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,460
Good-bye,Felicity.

515
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,420
Good-bye.

516
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,640
Max!Get off,let go!

517
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,590
- Max!Get off of me! - Hey!Let her go.

518
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,900
Cut it out!

519
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,880
Stupid cops.

520
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,100
They're saying Max ODed.

521
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,860
- Was he using? - No!

522
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,790
He made extra cash donating blood.

523
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,910
You really think the hospital would let him be a donor if he was an addict?

524
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,370
Hey.Can't be here,kid.

525
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,110
They found trace amounts of Ketamine in the thief's blood.

526
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,950
It's a common surgical anesthesia derived from hydrochloric salt.

527
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,660
Can you use that to track him?

528
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,910
With the current concentration ratio in the blood sample,

529
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,910
there's only one possible location with a large enough quality of the sedative

530
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,910
that correlates with the amount of blood the stolen centrifuge can process.

531
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,470
What is it?There's no sign.

532
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,420
A.R.G.U.S.doesn't like to advertise.

533
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,220
It's a disaster bunker.

534
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,420
Right on the edge of the Glades.

535
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,820
A.R.G.U.S.has them all over the country.

536
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,550
They store relief supplies... food,clothing...

537
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,670
Medicine.

538
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm on my way.

539
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,340
Oliver...

540
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,420
I can't believe I'm actually saying this.

541
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,770
The way this arrowhead is bent...

542
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,890
It means our thief's muscle density is at least 120 pounds per cubic foot.

543
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,650
That's almost the same density as common concrete.

544
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,600
Your arrows may cut this guy,but they will not stop him.

545
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,690
Well,I've beat someone like this before,Felicity.

546
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,570
I can do it again.

547
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,010
What if you can't?

548
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,180
Oliver.

549
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,720
Now this,it could save you...

550
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,830
Or it could kill you.

551
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,830
By the looks on your faces,I'm going to die anyway.

552
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,690
Sorry.

553
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,180
For what?

554
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,200
For not telling you how I really feel.

555
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,650
Do it.

556
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,030
No!

557
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,600
What?

558
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,670
I need your help.

559
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,260
A friend of mine's friend,well,

560
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,240
the cops think he ODed,but we think he was murdered.

561
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,180
Why?

562
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,340
Well,he wasn't an addict,for starters.And this...

563
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,400
This doesn't look like any OD I've ever seen.

564
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,560
Stay away from that.

565
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
You know something?

566
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,180
What happened to him?

567
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,830
You're the one who told me to be your eyes and ears on the streets.

568
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,640
You know what,that is not good enough for me anymore.

569
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,700
Fine.

570
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,380
Then we're done altogether.

571
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,330
I don't need you!

572
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,360
I have friends that can help me.

573
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,000
You can't stop us.

574
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,350
Slow you down.

575
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,920
And I thought it couldn't hurt to add extra security guards.

576
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,540
It hurt them.

577
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,920
Badly.

578
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,360
Have you prepared Thea?

579
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,420
No.

580
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,370
You will not go near Thea,

581
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,820
you will not speak to her and you will never set foot in this house again.

582
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,300
I set you free,Moira.

583
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,070
Your life belongs to me.

584
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,210
I am through being afraid of you.

585
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,780
You think you can stop me?

586
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,960
Even the Vigilante couldn't kill me.

587
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
No,he couldn't.

588
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,050
But I know someone who can.

589
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,780
Ra's al Ghul.

590
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,460
How do you know that name?

591
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,110
Well,I didn't.

592
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,760
Until you mentioned Nanda Parbat.

593
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,160
The League of Assassins,however twisted their aims,

594
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,260
believes very deeply in a code of honor.

595
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,070
Your undertaking betrayed that code.

596
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,450
You told Ra's I'm still alive?

597
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,560
He was so grateful to hear it.

598
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,480
Because he so very much wants to kill you himself.

599
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,030
So my advice to you,Malcolm...

600
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,760
Run.

601
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,420
This isn't finished,Moira.

602
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,260
Who are you?

603
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,360
Merely a follower.

604
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,300
Of who?!

605
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,360
My brother.

606
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,030
Did he give you the mirakuru?

607
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,380
Did he inject you with it?!

608
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,660
No.

609
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,270
He saved me with it.

610
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,670
No.

611
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,670
Please.Please!

612
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,260
Oliver!Oliver!Oliver!Oliver!

613
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,980
Is he alive?

614
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,080
His pulse is weak,but it's there.

615
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,170
Oliver!

616
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,250
Can you hear me?

617
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,820
His pupils are dilated!

618
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,150
What the hell was that?

619
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,680
I don't know,it's coded.

620
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
Damn it.Damn it!

621
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,060
I can't break into the dispensary files.

622
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,480
I have no idea what he was injected with!

623
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,510
Poisoned with.

624
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,920
All right,we have no choice.

625
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,750
What are you doing?

626
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,890
Calling 9-1-1.

627
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,950
- Dig,wait! - Can't wait!

628
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,630
How are we supposed to explain this?

629
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,120
Everyone's going to find out Oliver's the Vigilante!

630
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,560
Which won't matter if he's dead.

631
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,520
Felicity,we can't save him!

632
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,760
I know,you're right...

633
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,890
We can't.

634
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,950
One way to Central City.

635
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,360
It left ten minutes ago.

636
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,520
Of course it did.

637
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,440
When is the next one?

638
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,890
In the morning.

639
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,100
Ohh.Please save my friend.

640
