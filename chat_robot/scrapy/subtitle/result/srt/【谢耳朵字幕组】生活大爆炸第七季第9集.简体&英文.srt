1
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:03,295
我们都算过了
The math is all there.

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:05,313
-那是不可能的  -才不是  是真的!
It's not real. Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:08,550
你看啊  从科学的角度说
Yeah... uh, look. It is scientifically impossible

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,735
一个人想要把一头牛绊倒是绝对不可能的
for a person to tip a cow.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,557
就算是你这种敦实健壮的女汉子也是不可能的
Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn't do it.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
太恶劣了  你们干嘛要把牛推倒?
It's horrible. Why would you push a cow over?

7
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,194
牛是神圣的动物
They're sacred.

8
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,445
你还有脸说
Oh, stop it.

9
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,414
你都吃了几千几万个汉堡了(夹着牛肉饼)
I've seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.

10
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,500
动物可以既神圣又美味的
Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.

11
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,169
我不骗你们  我真的干过
Look, I'm telling you I've done it, okay?

12
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,904
我清楚地记得那头牛先是站着的
I clearly remember the cow standing up

13
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,456
后来就倒在了地上
and then the cow on its side.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,375
你是喝高了吧?
Were you drunk?

15
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,911
我当时可是16岁的西部牛仔小青年  你觉得呢?
I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?

16
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,848
我觉得你才是那个摔倒的
I think you're the one who fell over.

17
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,469
难怪当时天空也是倒着的
That would explain why the sky was also on its side.

18
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,089
Howard  推倒一头牛  你觉得是真的吗?
Howard. Cow tipping: real or not?

19
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,475
我觉得应该是假的
Mmm. I'm gonna say... not.

20
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:54,696
我是根据在我妈打呼时我想给她翻个身的经历得出的
That's just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she's snoring.

21
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,900
说到我这个大肉球老妈啊
Speaking of that big side of beef,

22
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:02,203
她邀请你们所有人来她家过感恩节
uh, she's invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.

23
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:09,461
他们告诉我直接拒绝别人的邀请很不礼貌
You know, I've been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude

24
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,246
应该给一个客气的借口  所以...
and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so...

25
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:15,584
我想去的  但很遗憾  这个主意简直太可怕了
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.

26
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:21,039
别这样嘛  会很好玩的
Come on, it'll be fun.

27
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,390
其实我们想在这儿过节的
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.

28
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,142
拜托了  Bernadette要带她老爸过来
Please. Bernadette's bringing her dad

29
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,260
因为她妈妈有事出去了
'cause her mom's out of town,

30
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,395
我跟他完全没话讲啊
and I never have anything to say to that guy.

31
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,797
既然你这么说了  我想去的
Oh, since you put it that way, I'd love to go,

32
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,483
但这听起来更可怕了
but that sounds even more awful.

33
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,737
其实不用听Sheldon整天跟我抱怨菜很难吃也挺好的
It'd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.

34
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,155
容我说一句
Yo... uh, excuse me,

35
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:40,025
每年你都做一桌难吃的菜
but every year you prepare a terrible meal

36
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,160
每年我都批评你
and every year I criticize it.

37
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,479
我们的这个传统对你来说就一点也不重要吗?
Do our traditions mean nothing to you?

38
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,199
-我想去  -我也想去
-I want to go.  -Yeah, me, too.

39
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,584
我也去  Sheldon你呢?
I'm in. Sheldon?

40
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,037
好吧  我会去的
Ugh, fine, I'll go.

41
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,489
但是如果她做的菜很好吃  感恩节就算毁了
But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined,

42
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,657
而且全都是你的错
and it's on you.

43
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:01,012
Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state

44
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:04,349
Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait!

45
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,000
The Earth began to cool

46
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,536
The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools

47
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,189
We built the Wall We built the pyramids

48
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,875
Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery

49
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,777
That all started with a big bang

50
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,746
Bang!

51
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:22,131
The Big Bang Theory 7x09 The Thanksgiving Decoupling Original Air Date on November 21, 2013

52
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:29,613
我们真的一定要去Wolowitz夫人家吗?
Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

53
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,495
当然
We do.

54
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,314
而且我希望你能表现出最好的一面
And I expect you to be on your best behavior.

55
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,534
我现在知道非洲奴隶的心情了
Now I know how the African slaves felt.

56
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:40,721
从家里被人拖走
Being dragged from their homes

57
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:44,124
在白人的统治下劳动
to labor under the yoke of the white man.

58
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,294
你真的是要把去Wolowitz妈妈家吃感恩节晚餐
Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz's mom's

59
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:51,765
和人类历史上最大的悲剧之一相提并论吗?
with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,835
嗯
Yes.

61
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,887
Sheldon  不论在哪儿  你都可以过一个开心的感恩节
Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

62
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,355
我有次就在拉斯维加斯过的
I spent one in Vegas.

63
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,339
真的?
You did?

64
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,341
是啊  我当时还在跟Zack谈恋爱
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.

65
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,976
比我想的要有意思多了
It was actually more fun than I thought.

66
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,529
赌赌博呀  逛逛那种山寨的婚礼小教堂呀
We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels,

67
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,147
那顿火鸡晚餐真的很棒
we had a really good turkey dinner.

68
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:10,350
很让人惊喜  因为我们是在脱衣舞夜总会吃的
Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.

69
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,203
等等  你们去了教堂?
Wait, you went to a chapel?

70
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,571
是呀  怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

71
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:17,524
我们还办了那种超搞笑的假婚礼
We had one of those silly fake weddings.

72
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,512
Penny...
Penny...

73
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,731
你知道那是真的结了婚  对吧?
you know those are real, right?

74
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,217
不  才不是
No, they're not.

75
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:29,369
是真的
Yeah, they are.

76
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,422
不  才不是
No, they're not.

77
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,040
真的是真的
Yeah, they are.

78
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,709
-他说得对  -是真的
-He's right.  -They're real.

79
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,314
但是  看着不像真的啊
But it... didn't seem real.

80
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:42,649
我来问你一下
Let me ask you a question.

81
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:47,988
是不是有那么一段时间  拉斯维加斯是躺着的?
At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?

82
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,693
嗨  老爸
Hi, Dad.

83
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,027
嗨  宝贝
Hi, honey.

84
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,331
哇  你给大家都带了啤酒
Oh, you brought beer for everybody.

85
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,834
好吧  是的  这是给大家喝的
Uh, okay, yeah, it's for everybody.

86
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:07,858
我本来只是想安安静静地在家看球赛的
I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,293
在这里也可以安静地看球赛呀
You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.

88
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:13,797
Howard  这药不管用!
Howard, the medicine's not working!

89
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,867
你才刚吃下去
You just took it.

90
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,369
起码等这药到你的第一个胃再说吧!
At least let it reach your first stomach!

91
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,192
你好呀  Mike
Hey, Mike.

92
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,393
我来帮你拿
Let me help you out, there.

93
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,528
谢谢  亲家母怎么了?
Thanks. What's wrong with your mom?

94
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,896
她的痛风又发作了
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

95
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:33,033
看来每天一个苹果派不能让医生远离你
Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.

96
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,703
一个小小的脚指头怎么能痛成这样?
How can one little toe hurt so bad?

97
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:42,959
可能是因为那头小猪(脚指头)正被牲口棚压着呢!
Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn!

98
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,213
她马上就能安静下来了
She should quiet down soon.

99
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:49,216
我给她吃了能把一头... 把她放倒的止痛药
I gave her enough pain meds to choke a... well, her.

100
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,704
看来得我们自己来做饭了
I guess we're gonna have to do all the cooking.

101
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,888
我有个更好的注意
I have a better idea.

102
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,641
如果你想全让我来做  你脑子就有问题
If you think you're gonna make me do all this by myself, you're crazy.

103
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,509
我是想全让Raj来做
I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.

104
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,960
这个主意超棒
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

105
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,982
不堵车  真是一帆风顺呀
No traffic, we're sailing.

106
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,100
是啊
Yes.

107
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:08,935
我们就好像在船上
Like we're on a ship.

108
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,656
从非洲到美洲
Coming from Africa to America.

109
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,611
Sheldon  这完全不合适
Sheldon, that's completely inappropriate.

110
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,480
你不能一直把你自己和奴隶相比
You can't keep comparing yourself to a slave.

111
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,166
是的  Amy小姐
Yes, Miss Amy.

112
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,171
真是难以相信你居然和那个白痴结婚了
I can't believe you're married to that idiot.

113
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:30,657
能不能别再说了? 我们这么做只是玩玩而已
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.

114
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,209
不管你们是不是认真的  你的确已婚了
Well, a goof or not, you're actually married.

115
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,010
你必须把这件事料理好
You need to get this taken care of.

116
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,463
我会的  为什么你这么大惊小怪的?
I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?

117
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,598
哦哦哦  我是有个理由
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,518
也许是因为你和Zack结婚了
It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack,

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,136
但是每次Leonard求婚时
but every time Leonard's proposed,

120
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,638
他都会得到一个响亮的"不"
he's gotten a resounding no.

121
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,810
是啊  这只是我立刻能想到的理由
Yeah, that's just off the top of my head.

122
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,645
那么我该如何弥补呢?
So how do I undo this?

123
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,146
我希望你能废除这个婚姻
I'm hoping you can get an annulment.

124
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,698
就好像从来没发生过一样
It's just like it never happened.

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,399
好极了  那么我该怎么做呢?
Great, well, what do I have to do?

126
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:58,068
上面说以下这些情况满足的话
It says here you can get an annulment

127
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,870
你就可以废除婚姻了
if any of the following conditions are met.

128
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,872
你是否无法完成夫妻生活?
"Were you unable to consummate the marriage?"

129
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,824
哈哈  Penny? 下一条
Penny? Next.

130
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,328
是否有任何欺骗  重婚
"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy,

131
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,913
或者理解匮乏?
want of understanding?"

132
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:10,964
理解匮乏?
"Want of understanding?"

133
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:11,998
那是什么意思?
What does that even mean?

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,034
叮叮叮  我们找到赢家了
Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.

135
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,754
感谢今天能来
Thanks for saving the day.

136
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:18,872
啊  没关系
Ah, no problem.

137
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,039
如果今天没有印度人给你们做菜的话
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

138
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,209
今天就不能算得上感恩节了
without an Indian providing the food.

139
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,213
唔  你妈妈把油放哪了?
Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?

140
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,348
唔  我不知道
Um, I don't know.

141
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,183
大概在她脸上的一团肉里吧
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

142
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,604
我在这里帮Raj  你为啥不去陪陪我爸爸呢?
I'll help Raj in here. Why don't you go keep my dad company?

143
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:37,073
他不想我呆在那  我是那个睡了他女儿的
Oh, he doesn't want me in there. I'm the creepy little guy

144
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,392
变态的小矮子
who has sex with his daughter.

145
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:43,997
-别傻了  他爱你的  -是吗?
-Don't be silly, he loves you. -Does he?

146
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,533
-好吧  他很关心你  -真的吗?
-Okay, he cares about you a lot. -Really?

147
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,619
我总是为你擦屁股  滚粗去
I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.

148
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:59,045
那么你妻子去亚利桑那州看孙子了?
So your wife's in Arizona with the grandkids?

149
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,714
嗯
Uh-huh.

150
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,251
知道吗  我老妈曾经去过亚利桑那
You know, my mom's been to... Arizona.

151
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,938
她曾骑驴到大峡谷里
She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon.

152
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,607
简而言之  他们不得不把驴杀了
Long story short, they had to shoot it.

153
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,096
因为她太胖
'Cause she's so fat.

154
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,037
我去开门  你接着笑
I'll get the door while you finish laughing.

155
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,825
大家好
Hey, guys.

156
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:29,826
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

157
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,411
闻起来真不错
It smells wonderful.

158
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:33,663
是不是有人在厨房里干苦力呢?
Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen?

159
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,114
-因为我也知道...  -Sheldon
-Because I, too, know... -Sheldon.

160
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,252
给你  谢谢你的邀请
Here. Thank you for having us.

161
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,286
你怎么了?
What's with you?

162
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,471
哦  她生我的气
Oh, she's mad at me

163
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,840
因为她发现她已经和Zack结婚了
because she just found out she's married to Zack.

164
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:44,841
真的?
Really?

165
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,810
你以前约会的那个二货?
That dumb-ass she used to date?

166
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:49,429
太搞笑了
That's hysterical.

167
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,933
不敢相信我在车里打开酒时居然会觉得抱歉
I can't believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.

168
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,940
需要帮助吗?
You need any help?

169
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,609
嗯  你能把那个肉汁壶拿过来吗?
Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?

170
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:03,977
-当然  -好的
-Uh, sure. -Great.

171
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,246
总算有人能够得着了
That makes one of you.

172
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:10,984
好的  我们要做很多事但是时间却不够了
Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it.

173
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:13,587
Bernadette你负责玉米,肉汁和红薯
Bernadette, you're on corn, gravy and yam detail.

174
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,988
Amy  你负责面包卷,小红莓
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

175
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,350
并且确定Bernadette不再偷吃棉花糖
and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows.

176
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,961
没错  我看到了
That's right, I see you.

177
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,780
好的  如果有任何问题
Okay, if you have any questions,

178
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,482
我就在这里忙着给我的烤火鸡涂汁
I'll be over here basting my ass off.

179
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,550
专注是最关键的
Focus is key.

180
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:30,220
你们知不知道三年前Penny和Zack已经结婚了
Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?

181
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,022
-什么?  -什..?
-What? -Wha...?

182
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,012
你打过橄榄球没?
You ever play football?

183
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:40,614
大学时打过
A little in college.

184
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,648
你呢?
You?

185
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,782
没有
No.

186
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,452
但是我在走廊被拦截摔倒过一次
But I did get tackled in the hallway once.

187
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,156
整个学校都沸腾了
The whole school cheered.

188
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,210
嗨  我找到了你和Zack需要填写的
Hey, I found the, uh, court papers

189
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,695
法律文件了
that you and Zack need to fill out.

190
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,414
当我们回家的时候我就把它打印出来  好的
I'll print them when we get home. Fine.

191
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,699
然后我们就当他完全没发生过
And we can just put this whole thing behind us.

192
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,667
够了没?
Are you done?

193
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,469
-怎么了?  -听着  我知道了  我犯了错
-What? -Look, I get it, I screwed up.

194
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:04,170
我们接下来的一整天都要一直谈论这个吗?
Is this all we're gonna talk about the rest of the day?

195
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,422
干啥冲我发火?
Why are you mad at me?

196
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:07,090
你才是那个做傻事的人
You're the one that did the stupid thing.

197
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,725
-我只是在想解决办法  -噢!
-I'm just trying to fix it. -Ugh!

198
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,126
我要去透透气
I need some air.

199
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,678
Penny
Well... Penny.

200
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,546
我不知道和女人相处的第一准则是什么
Now, I don't know the first thing about women,

201
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,382
但是我不会追她的
but I would not follow her.

202
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:20,570
听这个竹竿的没错
Listen to Stretch.

203
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,716
我怎么成了坏人了?
How am I the bad guy?

204
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:34,485
她才是和别人结婚的人  我是受害者
She's the one who married someone else. I'm the victim.

205
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:38,239
听起来Zack才是受害者  你把他老婆睡了
Sounds like Zack's the victim. You're sleeping with his wife.

206
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:43,327
我已经结婚35年了
I've kept my marriage together for 35 years.

207
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,812
我能在这儿发表点意见吗?
Can I weigh in here?

208
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:45,913
当然
Sure.

209
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,981
我想看比赛  闭嘴
I'm trying to watch the game. Shut up.

210
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,018
噢!
Oh!

211
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,021
你在那儿首攻怎么会不成功呢?
How do you not make a first down there?

212
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,790
他们过了个五防守阵型
They passed against a nickel defense.

213
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,558
他们应该跑躲避拦截的路线
They should have run it off-tackle.

214
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,196
你怎么知道这个的?
How the hell do you know that?

215
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:03,831
我爸以前喜欢橄榄球
My father loved football.

216
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,549
他总逼我看
He always made me watch it

217
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,319
没看完之前我不许做作业
before I was allowed to do my homework.

218
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,336
现在你会很乐意知道
PENNY: Well, you'll be happy

219
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:10,838
我刚刚和Zack通过电话
to know I just spoke to Zack

220
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,523
他说他愿意在法庭文件上签字
and he's willing to sign the court papers.

221
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,841
他就在来的路上了
He's on his way here now.

222
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,677
-等等  你邀请他来这儿了?  -对啊
Wait, you invited him here? Yeah.

223
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,512
我又准备好发表意见了
I'm getting ready to weigh in again.

224
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,180
来这边吧
Come on.

225
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,868
你觉得他们现在该怎么做?
What do you think they ought to do now?

226
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,186
如果是我会做个迅速斜线进攻扔个一个边线
I would throw a quick slant to a wideout,

227
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,656
鉴于防守呈现闪电战局面
given that the defense is showing blitz.

228
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:31,792
噢  我超爱绝佳闪电战  尤其是有酸奶油的
Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream.

229
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,130
没听懂吗?
Get it?

230
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,499
因为这听着像"薄饼卷"啊
'Cause it sounds like "blintz."

231
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,752
有人说薄饼卷吗?
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Did someone say "blintz"?!

232
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,037
我就是不明白
I just don't understand

233
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,539
你今天为什么邀请他来
why you invited him here today.

234
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,640
因为你就是咬着不放
Because you wouldn't shut up about it.

235
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,142
我打给他的时候  他没事可做
When I called him, he had nothing to do,

236
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,176
所以我想着...
so I just thought it would...

237
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:50,978
嘿  我在这儿做饭呢
Hey, guys, I'm trying to cook in here.

238
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,313
噢  对不起  我们会小点声的
Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.

239
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:55,065
不不不  大点儿声
No, no, speak up.

240
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,517
我马上要用搅拌机了
I'm about to use the blender,

241
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,319
我可不想错过任何事情
and I don't want to miss anything.

242
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:01,221
好吧  你可能得再做多一人份了
Well, you might have to cook for one more

243
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,406
因为她邀请了Zack来
because she invited Zack.

244
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,241
-神马?!!!  - 噢天啊!
BERNADETTE: What? AMY: Ooh!

245
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,227
啧啧啧
My, my.

246
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:10,831
剧情如我的肉汁  愈发香浓呢
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

247
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:17,421
我不喜欢你母亲的卫生间
I don't care for your mother's bathroom.

248
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,623
没有一个角度可以解决私人问题
There's not an angle to do one's business

249
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,242
而不被一个小丑雕像盯着的
without a clown figurine staring at you.

250
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,013
这就是我坐着的原因
That's why I sit.

251
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,432
对  原因是这个
Yeah, that's why.

252
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,770
你记得那场感恩节时的比赛吗
You remember the Thanksgiving game

253
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,755
达拉斯州下雪的时候
when it snowed in Dallas?

254
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:38,392
1993年  Leon Lett在最后一秒毁了比赛
1993-- Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds

255
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,361
然后Dolphins获胜了
and the Dolphins emerged victorious.

256
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,364
而我终于可以做微积分去了
Then I finally got to do my calculus.

257
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,817
我当时气得想一枪射了我的电视
I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.

258
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,736
我爸也是
So was my dad.

259
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:51,038
而且他也那么做了
And then he did.

260
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,874
-有人要喝啤酒吗?  -好的
Anyone need a beer? Yeah.

261
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:56,276
谢谢老天爷
Thank God.

262
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,213
那么  你爸爸还住在德克萨斯州吗?
So, does your dad still live in Texas?

263
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,832
不  他在我14岁时去世了
No. He died when I was 14.

264
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,002
听到这个真难过
I'm sorry to hear that.

265
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,721
当地小酒馆的老板也很难过
So was the man who owned the local liquor store.

266
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:12,193
他哭了一遍又一遍
He cried and cried.

267
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,894
给
Here you go.

268
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:15,930
哦谢谢
Oh, thanks.

269
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,732
这么说  如果你父亲在你14岁时过世了
So, if your dad died when you were 14,

270
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,902
你年龄还从未大到可以和他喝啤酒
you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.

271
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,187
是的
No, sir.

272
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,156
他确实试图在我高中毕业时给我一瓶
He did try to give me one for my high school graduation,

273
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:29,493
但我才11岁  我妈说不行
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

274
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:36,000
好吧  你来跟我一起喝一罐吧
Well, you're having one with me.

275
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:42,373
好吧
All right.

276
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,676
敬你的父亲
To your dad.

277
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:53,217
我也从未和我爸喝过啤酒
I never had a beer with my dad, either.

278
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:59,223
不好意思  我们在这共度时光呢
Do you mind? We're having a moment here.

279
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:09,233
难以置信Penny已经嫁给Zack了
I can't believe Penny's married to Zack.

280
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,935
不知道她看上那小子什么了
Wonder what she saw in that guy.

281
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,436
我不知道
I don't know.

282
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,455
他又温柔  又高  又帅
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

283
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:16,373
宽厚的肩膀  漂亮的头发
Broad shoulders, good hair.

284
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,909
嗯  不知道他看上Leonard什么了
Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.

285
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,497
外面怎么样?
How's it going out there?

286
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,217
Sheldon在和你爸联络感情  我被完全忽视
Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.

287
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,303
我了解你的感受
I know how you feel.

288
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:33,140
Sheldon有Roomba自动吸尘器的时候  忽视了我一周
Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum.

289
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,877
我会趁他不注意的时候踢它
I kick it when he's not looking.

290
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,230
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing?

291
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:44,685
-喝啤酒看橄榄球  -那你怎么不一块儿?
They're drinking beer and watching football. So why don't you do that with them?

292
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,053
他们不想让我一起
They don't want me.

293
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,154
这是什么意思?
What do you mean?

294
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,639
Sheldon说起
Well, Sheldon started talking

295
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,941
他爸爸已经不在了
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

296
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,392
然后他们就开始祝酒  我也试着
and they were toasting, and I tried

297
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,861
去告诉他们
to tell them about how sad I was

298
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:54,995
他爸抛弃我时有多难过...
when my dad abandoned...

299
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,847
Zack到了!
AMY: Zack's here!

300
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,116
搅拌肉汁
Stir the gravy.

301
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,537
抱歉  我真的想听你有多难过
Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are.

302
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,956
我会在五到十分钟后回来
I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.

303
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,546
抱歉她让你在节日里跑一趟
Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.

304
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:14,598
没什么  我反正也没在做什么
It's all right. I didn't have anything going on.

305
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,216
再说Penny告诉我  我们结婚了
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

306
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,836
感恩节就是亲人团聚的日子嘛
and Thanksgiving's a time to be with family.

307
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:20,688
行行
Yeah, okay, great.

308
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,890
那就赶紧签了吧?
Can we just get this over with?

309
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,808
好  你们要在这里... 还有这里签名
Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here.

310
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,610
周一就可以申请废除婚姻
On Monday, we'll file for the annulment,

311
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,445
然后这场"婚姻"就结束了
and this "marriage" will be over.

312
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,780
签好了
Okay.

313
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,232
我还没想好要不要签
I don't know if I want to sign it.

314
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,451
-唔?  -唔~~
-Ooh. Ooh.  -Ooh.

315
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:37,871
为什么你不想签?
Why won't you sign it?

316
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:41,608
我只是觉得离婚了  孩子们不好过啊
I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.

317
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:43,744
我们又没小孩
We don't have any kids.

318
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:45,379
你确定吗? 因为你也是今天早上
Are you sure? 'Cause you didn't know

319
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,131
才知道我们结婚了
we were married until this morning.

320
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,834
Zack  你听我说
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

321
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,003
你清楚我们俩谁也没以为那是真的啊
You know neither of us thought this was real.

322
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:55,973
我们的证婚人还是猫王模仿达人啊
I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.

323
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,457
当然是找模仿达人啦
Of course it was an impersonator.

324
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,144
我们哪有钱请猫王本人啊
We could never afford a real Elvis.

325
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,848
你嫁给他  而不嫁我?
You married him instead of me?

326
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,650
有眼光
Good call.

327
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,235
快签
Sign the papers.

328
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,520
等下  你知道吗?
Hang on. You know what?

329
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,405
你一天都因为这事咄咄逼人
You have been a jerk about this all day.

330
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:12,906
你老是这样... 我每次搞砸什么事
You always do this... whenever I mess up,

331
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,908
你就不遗余力地让我感觉更糟
you're right there to make me feel even worse about it.

332
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,976
才不是呢
That is not true.

333
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:17,144
是吗  我们明明可以等到周一
Yeah, we could've waited till Monday,

334
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,696
直接签字  这件事就可以结束了啊
signed the papers, this all would have been over.

335
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,280
是你请他过来的
You're the one who invited him here.

336
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,865
又来啦... 又一个推卸到我身上
Oh, there you go again... just another mistake

337
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,916
的错误
you're throwing in my face.

338
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,651
这可不对哦  兄弟
Not cool, bro.

339
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:27,921
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

340
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:30,541
我不喜欢你这样的人和我老婆约会
you're not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.

341
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,327
那个...
Yeah, well,

342
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,929
她很快就不是你老婆了
she's not gonna be your wife for long.

343
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,832
不是吧  你快死了吗?
Oh, no. Are you dying?

344
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,885
快了... 签字吧
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

345
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:47,608
俗话说得好  媳妇开心  夫复何求
Know what they say: "Happy wife, happy life."

346
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,360
开饭吧
Let's eat.

347
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:58,652
二  三  八  四  六
Two, three, eight, four, six.

348
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,490
我只能做到这里了  不然就吐了
That's all I can do without throwing up.

349
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,693
你说你要打嗝打出个“派”的时候
That is not what I expected

350
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:09,663
我可没想到是这样的
when you said you were gonna burp "pie."

351
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,584
是不是有人说要"派"呀?!
Did somebody say "pie"?!

352
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,170
我都说不清以下哪样更恐怖:
I don't know what's scarier:

353
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:17,671
浴室小丑呢
the bathroom clowns

354
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,474
还是把小丑放在浴室的女人
or the woman that put them there.

355
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,212
我只知道你只能把一个她放到车里去
All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car.

356
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,067
这就是她生出来的那个小丑
And there's the clown that came out of her.

357
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,524
我本来挺不想来的
I really didn't want to come here,

358
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:39,443
但是这马上就要变成
but this is shaping up to be

359
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,995
多年来我过的最棒的感恩节了
one of the best Thanksgivings I've had in a long time.

360
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:44,231
我也是
Me, too.

361
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,234
嘿  Howie说你们一整天都在拿他开涮
Hey. Howie says you've been making fun of him all day!

362
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:48,418
你们俩现在就向他道歉
Now, both of you apologize

363
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,087
现在!
right now!

364
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:53,123
她好迷你啊
She's so tiny.

365
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,179
她发飙了好有趣哦
It's funny when she's mad.

366
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,967
好了  这位先生
All right, mister, I think you owe

367
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,804
我觉得你欠Howard和Bernadette一个道歉
Howard and Bernadette an apology.

368
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,942
你说得对
Perhaps you're right.

369
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,426
我对我的所作所为感到抱歉
I'm sorry for my behavior.

370
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,612
我喝了点酒
I've had alcohol, and it's caused me

371
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,814
导致我行为不端
to be inappropriate.

372
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,816
-没事  -别放心上
-It's okay.  -Don't worry about it.

373
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,734
谢谢
Thank you.

374
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,236
她是不是很棒?
Ain't she great?

375
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,320
是呀
Mmm.

376
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,655
Sheldon别闹
Sheldon.

377
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,606
那去给我们拿点啤酒来吧
Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?

378
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:45,144
再次谢谢你下厨掌勺
Thanks again for cooking.

379
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,662
是呀  每样都很好吃
Yeah, everything was delicious.

380
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:50,133
要是没两位我最爱的姑娘帮我  我也搞不定
Well, I couldn't have done it without my two favorite girls.

381
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,369
Martha Stewart(富商及专栏作家)和Rachael Ray(电视烹饪女王)
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

382
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,842
Sheldon  我们要不要出去
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside

383
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,928
去玩玩老猪皮(即:橄榄球)?
and throw around the old pigskin?

384
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,764
这是个犹太家庭
This is a Jewish house.

385
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,516
我觉得不会有猪皮
I don't think they have pigskin.

386
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:11,938
是不是有人说到"猪皮"啦?
Did someone say "pigskin"?

387
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,391
亲爱的  今天的事我很抱歉
Hey, honey, I'm sorry about today.

388
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,510
我向你保证  下次我结婚的时候
And I promise, next time I get married,

389
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,061
不会再当玩笑了
it won't be a joke.

390
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,679
我会为爱而结婚
It'll be for love.

391
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,815
或者为钱
Or money.

392
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,120
我也很抱歉
I'm sorry, too.

393
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,654
别内疚
Don't be.

394
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:29,655
都是我的错
It's my fault.

395
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,073
我是个糟糕的丈夫
I was a terrible husband.

396
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,378
我从来没好好陪她
I was never around.

397
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,215
我知道我对你很严格
I know I'm hard on you,

398
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:42,001
但你还不算是世界上最烂的女婿
but you're not the worst son-in-law in the world.

399
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,921
Mike  这是你对我过说的最感人的话了
Mike, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

400
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,723
是呀是呀  我喝多了
Well, I'm drunk.

401
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,229
我刚刚吐了很多小丑一身
I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
