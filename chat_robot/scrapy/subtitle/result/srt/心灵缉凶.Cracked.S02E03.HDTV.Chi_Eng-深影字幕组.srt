00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:13,721
西蒙
Simon.

2
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:15,756
只有我 哈瑞
It's just me, Harry.

3
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,792
别紧张伙计
Don't freak out man.

4
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:24,632
西蒙
Simon?

5
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:29,335
嗨 伙计 你没事吧
Hey, man, are you OK?

6
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:38,010
救命 救命
Help! Help!

7
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,853
救救救救救命
HEEEEEELP!

8
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:54,259
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

9
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,295
# 对上帝发誓我看不见我的脸 #
Swear to god I couldn't see my face


10
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,000
# 我今早起床注视着一缕灵魂 #
I got out of bed today staring at a ghost

11
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,837
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 #
Oh have you seen my ghost

12
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:08,706
# 感觉到它了么 看到它了么 #
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost?

13
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,610
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 它凝视着地面 #
Oh, have you seen my ghost staring at the ground?

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,410
心灵缉凶 第二季第3集

15
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,618
行动起来
Let's move.

16
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,920
昨晚某个时辰有个流浪汉被杀了
We've got a homeless man killed sometime last night.

17
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:27,557
现场警察称之为"迷上疯狂"
Uniforms on scene called it in as "Crazy on Crazy".

18
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:29,058
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

19
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,059
应该给他们来些敏感性训练
They're due for some sensitivity training.

20
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:33,228
但很明显这是起心理犯罪
But this is definitely one for Psych Crimes.

21
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,531
- 情节非常匪夷所思 - 比如说
- Very bizarre details. - Such as?

22
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,032
你会发现的
You'll see.

23
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,569
- 凶案组在查这个案子吗 - 要联合调查
- Homicide on this one? - It's a joint investigation,

24
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:41,435
不过大清早
but there was a gang shooting 

25
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:42,905
在狄斯路上发生了持枪火拼案
on Dixie Road early this morning,

26
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,907
多个凶杀案 所以这个现在是你的了
multiple homicides, so this one's yours for now,

27
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,008
但他们赶上来时要让他们知情
but keep them in the loop when they catch up with you.

28
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,911
那就是发现尸体的人
That's who found the body.

29
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,913
我认识他
I know him.

30
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:56,017
- 他是疑犯吗 - 哈瑞 我表示怀疑
- Is he a suspect? - Harry? I doubt it.

31
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,052
他可是相当人畜无害
He's pretty harmless.

32
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,023
好好看着他 让里奥引导 但是...
Take a good look at him. I mean, let Leo lead, but...

33
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,992
明白 他已经取得联系了
I know. He's got the touch.

34
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,827
嘿 哈瑞
Hey, Harry.

35
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:09,429
你还好吗 我的朋友
How are you doing, my friend?

36
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,498
是我 里奥
It's me. Leo.

37
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,594
- 里奥 - 去年我经常去看你
- Leo? - I used to see you last year, 

38
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,436
那是你正被汉伯困扰
when you were hanging over by the Humber.

39
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,204
你现在住在这里吗
You living down here now?

40
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,909
我只是拜访 我是个护士 记得吗
I'm just visiting. I'm a nurse, remember?

41
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,047
这是我朋友波比 她是个警察
This is my friend Poppy. She's a police officer.

42
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:30,416
我不喜欢条子
I don't like cops.

43
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:37,055
漂白剂(的味道吗)
Bleach?

44
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,174
对 整个现场都被冲刷了
Yeah, the whole scene's been washed down. 

45
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,532
没有武器的迹象
There's no sign of the weapon, 

46
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,026
并且尸体是在人死后摆成这样的
and the body's been staged post-mortem.

47
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,594
这个现场很复杂
It's a complicated scene.

48
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,095
他的喉咙被切断了吗
His throat was cut?

49
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:46,431
对 颈静脉和颈动脉都被割断了
Yeah, both the jugular vein and the carotid artery were

50
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:49,967
克莉格拉 先别跟媒体说
severed. Caligra. Let's keep that out of the media.

51
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,942
血都哪里去了呢
Where's all the blood?

52
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,044
这些可能是自卫受得伤
These could be defensive wounds.

53
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,345
他挣扎了 所以刀划到了一些其他地方
He struggled, knife bounced around a bit.

54
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,448
但接下来的这个
But then there's this.

55
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,683
- 更多自卫伤口吗 - 伤口太浅了
- More defensive wounds? - Too superficial.

56
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,941
手和胳膊在持刀搏斗中自卫受得伤
Defensive wounds on hands and arms in a knife fight 

57
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:10,053
通常都会切至骨头的
usually cut to the bone.

58
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,121
这些伤至少有些时日了 我说得对吗
These are at least a few days old, am I right?

59
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,356
正确
Yeah.

60
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:17,827
这些伤痕看起来也像旧的
These injuries look older as well.

61
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,229
这孩子过去几周
This kid has taken some serious beatings 

62
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,597
遭受过严重毒打
in the last few weeks.

63
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:23,665
貌似这些伤都是他磨出来的
Looks like he's been dishing 'em out too.

64
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:26,676
你能描述一下
Can you describe 

65
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:29,404
你发现时尸体的样子吗
what the body looked like when you found it?

66
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:35,777
我不想谈论此事
I don't want to talk about it.

67
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,979
对不起 哈瑞 但你必须得说
I'm sorry, Harry, but you're gonna have to.

68
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,978
如果你不肯配合警方
If you don't cooperate with the police, 

69
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,649
他们会开始对原因有疑惑
they're gonna start wondering why.

70
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:43,183
好了
OK.

71
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,024
好吧
OK.

72
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:55,194
我只是去看西蒙
I was just... going to see Simon

73
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,563
给他带回了些菜
and bring him back his dish.

74
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,566
- 被害人叫西蒙 - 是的
- The victim's name was Simon? - Yeah.

75
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,435
你知道他姓什么吗
Do you know his last name?

76
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,738
卡林 科里
Carling? Curley?

77
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,643
凯利
Kelly.

78
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,645
我觉得是凯利
I think it was Kelly.

79
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,847
这么说 西蒙是你的朋友喽
So, Simon was your friend?

80
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,655
西蒙是我的朋友
Simon was my friend.

81
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:35,167
- 我们都有些什么线索 - 你知道什么
- So, what have we got? - What do you know?

82
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,668
流浪汉 被割喉
Homeless guy. Throat cut.

83
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,670
有关于现场被抹干净的吗
Something about the whole scene being wiped clean?

84
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,438
漂白剂 大量漂白剂
With bleach. A lot of it.

85
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,439
有人大费周章地区消灭证据
Someone went to a lot of trouble to destroy evidence.

86
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,608
我们认为远不止这样
Well, we think there's more to it than that.

87
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,278
瞧这尸体造型摆得多仔细啊
Look how carefully the body is posed...

88
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:51,315
干净的衬衫 纽扣紧扣 好像是为隐藏切口
clean shirt, all buttoned-up, as if to hide the cut.

89
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,384
整个现场都有某种痴迷的感觉
There is something obsessive about the whole scene.

90
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,319
痴迷于逃脱被捕
Obsessed with not getting caught.

91
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,521
以及或者说是痴迷于消除暴力迹象
And/or obsessed with erasing signs of violence.

92
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:58,380
为什么洗墙呢
Why wash the walls? 

93
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,690
我们又不会漏掉他被割喉
It's not like we're gonna miss the guy's throat was cut.

94
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:03,393
好吧 我知道为什么这是起心理犯罪了
OK. I see why it's a psych crime.

95
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,094
你很幸运
Lucky for you.

96
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:06,796
怎么会
How so?

97
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,926
这意味着调查警司布莱克
It means Detective Sergeant Black 

98
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:10,186
可以承担高水平职责
can assume the high-level responsibilities 

99
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:12,302
参与这样一个异常敏感的案子
involved in a uniquely sensitive case like this.

100
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,369
那意味着在她返回调查狄斯路杀人案时
It means I get to do the grunt work on a homeless

101
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,038
我得处理枯燥乏味繁重的谋杀流浪汉案
murder while she gets back to the killings on Dixie Road.

102
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:19,133
差不多是这样 你能替我担负这个责任吗
Pretty much. You can carry the ball for me on this?

103
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,109
有情况会及时通知你的
I'll keep you in the loop.

104
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,811
谢谢你 艾登
Thank you, Aidan.

105
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:25,547
你跟这个警探 有过一段历史吗
You and the detective - some history there?

106
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:29,551
理耶特 历史 对 没什么大不了的
Liette? History? Yeah. As in not an issue.

107
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,320
- 很显然 - 有什么好消息吗
- Obviously. - Any luck?

108
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,322
我想我们确认了死者的身份
Think we've got an ID for our victim.

109
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,157
发现尸体的流浪汉告诉我们一个名字
Homeless guy who found the body gave us a name.

110
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:38,826
西蒙凯利
Simon Kelly.

111
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,729
- 就是他 - 二十二岁
- That's him. - Age 22.

112
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:43,731
十六岁时被诊断为患有精神分裂症
Diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.

113
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:45,733
从那时至今经常进进出出医院
In and out of hospitals ever since.

114
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,534
有他的档案吗
He got a record?

115
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:50,203
没有 被警察逮到过几次
No. Picked up by uniforms a couple times,

116
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,205
不过都直接被送去精神病病房
but taken straight to the psych ward.

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,207
当然 那不应该收录在档的
Yeah, that shouldn't be in his record.

118
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:56,142
有精神分裂又不是犯罪
Having schizophrenia is not a crime.

119
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,868
就我而言 我想知道 
Personally, I'd like to know. 

120
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,279
发现他的那个人呢
How about the guy who found him?

121
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,615
哈瑞布拉克斯顿 可以排除他的嫌疑了
Harry Braxton. We can rule him out as a suspect.

122
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,082
他的手和衣服都很干净 无血迹 总之
His hands and clothes are clean - of blood, anyway...

123
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,611
他看着不像过不久洗干净的
and... it doesn't look like he's washed in a while.

124
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,001
他对西蒙凯利了解多少
How well did he know Simon Kelly?

125
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,322
他说他们曾是最好的朋友 可爱的小伙子
He says they were best friends - lovely guy,

126
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:13,091
没有敌人 任何人都没有理由想要伤害他
no enemies, no reason anyone would want to hurt him.

127
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,075
有暴力史吗 
Any history of violence? 

128
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:16,094
哈瑞说他连苍蝇都不会伤害
Harry says he wouldn't hurt a fly.

129
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:19,063
这跟他身体上的痕迹可不相符啊
That doesn't fit with the marks on his body.

130
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:21,399
有什么近亲吗
Any next of kin?

131
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,735
他的父母 罗伯特凯利和爱丽丝凯利夫妇
His parents, Robert and Alice Kelly.

132
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,928
你们继续仔细搜查山谷
You guys keep canvassing the valley. 

133
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:28,973
看能否找到知道些什么的人
See if you can find anyone who knows anything.

134
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:31,643
你要一起去吗
You want to come with?

135
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:42,055
你以前做过死亡通报吗
You ever done a death notification before? 

136
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:42,919
在医院做过
At the hospital.

137
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,564
这会有些许不同
Well, this is a little bit different. 

138
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,346
我们突然出现
We're showing up out of the blue 

139
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,041
并且带来的消息可能是最坏的
with the worst news possible.

140
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,324
所以表现出同情和支持是很要紧的
And it's important to be sympathetic and supportive.

141
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:50,128
明白了
Got it.

142
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:52,447
不 这是谋杀调查
No. This is a murder investigation; 

143
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:54,830
在被证实之前每个人都有嫌疑
everyone's a suspect until they're not.

144
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:58,233
我们的任务是获取尽可能多地信息
Our job is to get as much information as possible

145
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,803
不放过任何蛛丝马迹
without giving anything away.

146
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:03,639
确实不一样
Wow. That is different.

147
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:07,942
有点像同情和支持的对立面
It's kind of the opposite of sympathetic and supportive.

148
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,945
- 还有什么是我得知道的吗 - 有
- Anything else I should know? - Yeah.

149
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,749
我宁可挨枪子也不愿这么做
I'd rather take a bullet than do this.

150
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:17,018
准备好了吗
You ready?

151
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:25,793
- 罗伯特凯利 - 什么事
- Robert Kelly? - Yes?

152
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:27,795
我是艾登 布莱克警探
My name is Detective Aidan Black.

153
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,797
麦德龙警局的 这位是克拉拉马龙医生
I'm with the Metro Police. This is Dr. Clara Malone...

154
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:32,833
西蒙 西蒙出事了
Simon. Something's happened to Simon.

155
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,170
他不是个坏人
He wasn't a bad person.

156
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:42,942
你们得理解 他病得非常 非常重
You have to understand, he was very, very sick.

157
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:45,010
我们理解 凯利夫人
We understand, Mrs. Kelly.

158
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,647
那他是怎么死的
So, how did he die?

159
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,649
我们要等尸检报告出来
We're waiting for the autopsy

160
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,151
才能做出推断
report before making a determination.

161
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:54,919
你们上次见到西蒙是什么时候
When was the last time you saw Simon?

162
00:08:56,283 --> 00:09:00,272
- 很久以前 我们很久没见过他了 - 对
- Never. We never saw him. - Yeah, 

163
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,294
我们和西蒙已经有几年没联系了
we haven't had contact with Simon in a couple of years.

164
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,795
我们也别无选择
Not our choice.

165
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,683
是他不愿意见你们吗 
So he refused to see you? 

166
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:08,166
能告诉我们原因吗
Can I ask why?

167
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,270
他有精神分裂症 警探先生
He had schizophrenia, Detective.

168
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,272
谁知道他怎么想的
Who knows why he did anything?

169
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,875
他不愿让我们帮他
He didn't want us to help him.

170
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,110
他不知道我们这是为了他好
He didn't understand it was for his own good.

171
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,444
他... 他会变得很愤怒
He'd... he would get so angry...

172
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:25,582
- 我们应该更尽力一些的 - 爱丽丝
- We should've fought harder. - Alice.

173
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,485
行了 让我说吧
Please, just... would you let me do this?

174
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,289
这事让我们备受煎熬
This has been extremely difficult for us.

175
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,925
尤其是我的妻子
Uh... especially for my wife.

176
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,427
爱丽丝在他刚得病那段时间全天候的照顾他
Alice cared for Simon full time when he first became ill.

177
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,044
到头来却发现
And then eventually we found out that 

178
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,364
他流落街头
he was living on the street.

179
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:42,986
他有自己的法律代表 
He had a case worker, 

180
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:44,733
但她什么事都没告诉我们
but she wouldn't tell us anything.

181
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:48,437
她说这是为了保护他的隐私
She said it was to protect his privacy.

182
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:51,240
可现在呢 有谁能保护他呢
Well, who's protecting him now?

183
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,574
到底发生了什么
What happened?

184
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:57,045
是毒品 还是... 疾病
Drugs? Or... some sort of disease?

185
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,947
他是被谋杀的 爸爸
He was murdered, Dad.

186
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:02,117
懂了吗 不然你以为他们来干什么
OK? Why do you think they're still here?

187
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,055
是真的吗
Is that true?

188
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,423
具体情况还在调查中 先生
The investigation is ongoing, sir.

189
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:13,227
失陪一下
If I may...

190
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,707
我能和你坐一会儿吗
Mind if I join you?

191
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:45,723
西蒙被诊断出有病的时候你多大 十二岁吗
You were, what, 12 when Simon was diagnosed?

192
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,694
我有很多患精神分裂症的病人
I've had a number of patients with schizophrenia.

193
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,696
我知道这对家庭来说很艰难
I know how hard it is on the family.

194
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,033
病人 我以为你也是警察
Patients? I thought you were a cop.

195
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,002
精神科医生
Forensic psychiatrist.

196
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,305
你是想了解西蒙
Ah, you want to know about Simon. Um...

197
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,908
典型的症状 你知道的 幻听 不洗澡
Textbook case. You know, heard voices, stopped showering,

198
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,678
会对着灯柱大吼大叫 都是常见病症
yelled at lamp posts. You know, "The ush".

199
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:13,283
曼迪 我不是来帮助西蒙的
Maddie, I'm not here to help Simon.

200
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,285
他已经去世了
He's dead.

201
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,287
那你来干什么
Then why are you here?

202
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:21,358
如果我们能弄清楚你哥哥的死因 也许
If we can figure out what happened to your brother, maybe

203
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:24,294
你和你的家人能因此得到慰藉
you and your family can get some closure.

204
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,329
你不希望这样吗
You don't want that?

205
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:29,798
我见过这样的情况
I've seen what happens

206
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,967
当亲生兄妹得了精神分裂症
when a sibling develops schizophrenia.

207
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:35,504
他们病得越重 得到的照顾就越多
The worse they act, the more attention they get.

208
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,272
不用多久
Pretty soon 

209
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,274
家里其他的孩子就会被忽视
the other kids in the family are getting nothing.

210
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:41,477
无论他们多优秀
No matter how good they are,

211
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:45,179
无论他们等了多久
no matter how long they wait for their turn,

212
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:47,181
都得不到父母的关注
it never comes.

213
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,717
你是这么觉得吗
Is that how you felt?

214
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,571
你是说我是否
You mean, am I so starved for attention

215
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,324
非常渴求父母的关注吗
to fall for your little act?

216
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:59,727
不是我不懂礼貌 但我们家
I don't want to be rude, but we've been

217
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,861
不依赖外人照顾过西蒙好几年了
dealing with Simon on our own for years, so, you know,

218
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,863
所以我觉得讽刺的是你们来到我家
I think it's kind of ironic, you coming here,

219
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,166
拒绝透露他的死因
refusing to say how he died, and then, what,

220
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,701
却想要了解我们的生活
expecting me to spill my whole life story?

221
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,373
我不需要你的帮助 懂吗
I don't need your help, OK?

222
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:16,808
我过得很好
My life is fine.

223
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:20,646
西蒙经常惹麻烦吗
Did Simon get into a lot of fights?

224
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,715
没有 他从来不会伤害任何人 是谁告诉你的
No. He would never hurt anyone. Who told you that?

225
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,751
这不是真的 告诉他们这不是真的
It's not true. Tell them it's not true.

226
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,633
你们知道有谁会想伤害西蒙吗
Do you know anyone who wanted to hurt Simon?

227
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:28,601
抱歉 打断一下
Excuse me,

228
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,842
你是想说他是被谋杀的吗 
are you saying that he was murdered? 

229
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:32,357
很抱歉 先生 我...
I'm sorry, sir, I...

230
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:37,795
我们应该强迫他待在家里的
We should have forced him to stay at home.

231
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:41,766
他为什么不让我照顾他
Why wouldn't he let me take care of him?

232
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,268
别这么说 别这么说
Please, please.

233
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,836
行了
OK...

234
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:48,672
给我们点时间吧 抱歉
you're going to have to give us some time. I'm sorry.

235
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:49,949
能否请你们
Why don't you come back 

236
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,276
准备好告诉我们儿子的死因时再来
when you're prepared to tell us what happened to our son?

237
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,213
节哀
I'm sorry for your loss.

238
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,248
我们会联系你的
We'll be in touch.

239
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:05,354
这算是常见的情况吗
Is that what it's usually like?

240
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,291
从来没什么常见的情况 你有什么收获吗
There's no usual. What's your take?

241
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,460
他们的女儿什么都不肯透露
The daughter is completely shut down.

242
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:12,962
母亲质疑自己过去所做的一切
Mom is second-guessing everything she ever did.

243
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,490
父亲发怒
And the father is in a rage 

244
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:17,800
因为觉得自己无力帮助家人
because he feels powerless to fix the family.

245
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,802
可能因为他们很久没见过西蒙
Probably made worse by the fact that they haven't

246
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:22,237
- 感觉会越发糟糕 - 他们会不知所措
- seen Simon in so long. - They're reeling.

247
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,132
当西蒙这样的人死后 
When someone like Simon dies, 

248
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,807
家人会感到如释重负
the family often feels relief

249
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,810
却又悲痛不已 感情非常复杂
as well as grief. It's confusing,

250
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:32,314
他们会有愧疚感 木已成舟无法挽回
they feel guilty, and it's downhill from there.

251
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:33,815
现在说什么都太晚了
And now it's too late.

252
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,584
对西蒙来说是晚了
Well, too late for Simon.

253
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,785
但对他的家庭来说并不晚
But there's still a family there.

254
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:48,496
你好 有人在吗
Hey there. Anybody home?

255
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,016
这个月底
You know the city is gonna do its annual sweep

256
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:51,999
市里会开展年度大清扫
at the end of this month,

257
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,167
把所有一起的帐篷和棚户全部清理掉
clear out all the tents and shelters.

258
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,603
希望那些地方在那之前能保住
May as well keep it dry until then.

259
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,605
你可真是心软
You are such a bleeding heart.

260
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,140
是啊 没错
Yeah, sure, sure.

261
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,525
他死了
He's dead.

262
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:17,130
两个流浪汉 同一处山谷 
Two homeless men, same ravine, 

263
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,140
相隔仅数日
within a few days of each other.

264
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,142
你真觉得这是巧合吗
You really think that's a coincidence?

265
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:23,145
他们都受了外伤 街头流浪的日子不好过
So they both had bruises. Life on the street is rough.

266
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,989
我也说不清 
I don't know. 

267
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,148
像是他们突然想要打架 然后就死了
It's like they suddenly took up kickboxing, then died.

268
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,184
犯罪现场的情况完全不一样
The crime scenes are completely different.

269
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,820
也许凶手在清理现场之前
Maybe the killer was interrupted before he could

270
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:32,954
- 被打断了 - 验尸官怎么说
- clean this one up. - What does the coroner say?

271
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,346
无名氏的报告还没有出 
Still waiting for the report on John Doe, 

272
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,630
但是西蒙凯利已被认定是谋杀 
but Simon Kelly's been ruled a homicide. 

273
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:37,626
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

274
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,661
我联系了一个我认识的医生
I made contact with a doctor I know,

275
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:41,997
阿尔贝托桑切斯 他有个车载设备
Alberto Sanchez. He has a mobile unit

276
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,432
专为无家可归者派送
that dispenses long-acting antipsychotics 

277
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,833
长效的抗精神病药物
to the homeless.

278
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:47,269
有什么情况记得告诉我
Let me know how that goes.

279
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,069
我们走
Let's go.

280
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:57,879
你怎么认识他的
How do you know this guy?

281
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,881
我和他一起做过一段时间的志愿者工作
I volunteered with him for a while,

282
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,883
确保没有人冻死或饿死
made sure no one was starving or freezing to death,

283
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,385
如果他们身体情况不佳就把他们带回医院
helped bring them in if they weren't doing too well.

284
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,386
你们对病人的了解有多少 我猜
How well did you get to know the patients? I'm guessing

285
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,388
给人打针不是什么交友的好办法
giving needles isn't the best way to make friends.

286
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,557
不光是药物治疗
Well, it wasn't just about the meds.

287
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,027
桑切斯 他还会发放食物和被褥并和他们聊天
Sanchez, he distributes food, blankets, conversation.

288
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,685
这些人面临最大的问题
You know, the biggest problem 

289
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:17,997
其实是孤独
most of these folks have is loneliness.

290
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:19,999
你刚是说现场被清理过了吗
You said the scene was cleaned?

291
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:20,982
十分彻底 
Thoroughly. 

292
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,069
你知道有谁会做这种事吗
Do you know anyone who might do something like this?

293
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,738
每个人都觉得精神病患者是暴力罪犯
Everyone thinks the mentally ill are violent criminals.

294
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:28,073
相信我 他们更多时候是受害者
Believe me, they're far more often the victims.

295
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:31,457
- 说说西蒙吧 你治疗过他是吗 - 是的
- Tell me about Simon. You treated him? - Yeah.

296
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:34,520
西蒙是个不折不扣的好人 
Simon was genuinely a good guy. 

297
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,747
他只想痊愈
All he wanted was to be well.

298
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:36,831
他吃些什么药 
What medication was he on? 

299
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,583
氟哌啶醇 一种长效的安定药
Haloperidol long-acting.

300
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,552
能帮助治疗幻听
It helped with the voices.

301
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,054
但他三个月之前就不再来了
But he stopped coming in about 3 months ago.

302
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,555
为什么
Why?

303
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,924
他对副作用很反感
He was really frustrated with the side effects.

304
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,541
他说他不想
He said he wanted to get better 

305
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,059
通过注射的方式来治疗 但是
without the injections, but...

306
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,318
不注射治不好 
Only you don't without them. 

307
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:52,496
是 至少对西蒙这样的来说是的
No. Not for someone like Simon.

308
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,871
他走后你没有找过他吗
You didn't keep track of him after he left?

309
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:56,546
我尽力了 探员先生 
I do the best I can, Detective. 

310
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,540
流浪汉都是来去无踪的
The homeless are transient by definition; 

311
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,136
不会留下什么转寄地址
it's not like they leave a forwarding address.

312
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,374
这你怎么看
What do you make of this?

313
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,444
他打过架了
He was fighting.

314
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,880
- 和谁打的 - 有人花钱雇他打的
- Fighting who? - Whoever he was paid to.

315
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:13,215
那些小流氓 他们会来这儿
These young punks, they come down here

316
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,417
给我的病人们提供钱 毒品和酒
and they offer my patients money, drugs, alcohol.

317
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,163
然后让他们对打
And then they get them to fight each other 

318
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:18,386
并拍下视频
while they make videos.

319
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:19,427
我报过警
I've called the police about this 

320
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,270
但是没有任何回复
and nothing ever happens.

321
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,780
现在有回复了 
Well, something's happening now. 

322
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,760
你知道他们的名字或是相貌体征吗
You got names of these kids,descriptions?

323
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,462
我从没见过他们
I've never seen them.

324
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,965
我只知道他们年轻而且有钱
All I know is that they're young and they've got money.

325
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:33,066
- 使劲打 使劲打 - 流浪汉格斗
- Get him harder! Get him harder! - Bum fighting.

326
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,971
- 名字都这么恶心 - 这个山谷在几年前
- Even the name is disgusting. - There was a lot of talk

327
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,973
就有关于这种事的传闻
about this a few years ago in the valley.

328
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,542
我从来没有直接看到过
I never saw it firsthand.

329
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,611
现在这几乎是秘密活动
It's mostly underground these days,

330
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:47,447
但仍有人用这个赚钱 这是
but someone's still making money off it. This is

331
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:50,884
个高端华丽的网站 会员费可不便宜
a decently slick site. Membership's not cheap.

332
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:52,552
把他拉起来
Get him up!

333
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,321
- 那是他吗 - 是的 是西蒙凯利
- Is that him? - Yeah, that's Simon Kelly.

334
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,790
你认为做这个的人有可能杀了他吗
Do we think whoever made this could have killed him?

335
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,542
他们会从拍打斗片
Would they go from making fight films 

336
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,260
进而去拍凶杀片吗
to making snuff films?

337
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,696
我觉得不像正常进程
Doesn't feel like a natural progression.

338
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,797
好吧 我们来查清楚 你能追踪这网站吗
Well, let's find out. Can you trace the website?

339
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:08,466
能 他们是些傻瓜 他们提供了贝宝账户
Yeah, they're idiots. They have a PayPal account.

340
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,902
我给网络犯罪部门打电话 
I'll call E-Crimes. 

341
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,903
让他们追踪那些钱
Follow the money.

342
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:15,173
对 找到那些做这垃圾的寄生虫
Yeah. Find the parasites who are doing this crap.

343
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:18,043
我不喜欢这些家伙
I don't like these guys.

344
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:27,585
你认识这个人吗
Do you recognize this man?

345
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,620
真恶心
That's gross.

346
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,622
他是谁
Who is he?

347
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,123
西蒙凯利
Simon Kelly.

348
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:35,960
他两天前在山谷里被杀了
He was murdered 2 days ago in the valley.

349
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:36,699
两天前
Two days ago 

350
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,463
我在慕斯科卡参加高尔夫慈善锦标赛
I was at a charity golf tournament in Muskoka.

351
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,763
如果你不信 
If you don't believe me, 

352
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,835
你可以给司法部长打电话
you can call the attorney general.

353
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,154
他和某个法官 
He and some judge, 

354
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:49,539
跟我与家父搞了个四人对抗赛
they made up a foursome with me and my dad.

355
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:54,643
你看 我们还有证据证明你网站上的
You know, we also have proof that the PayPal account

356
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:56,284
贝宝账户是你的同伙
on your website was set up 

357
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,713
伊恩辛克莱建立的
by your associate, Ian Sinclair.

358
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:00,173
他在隔壁的房间里 和我同事谈话
He's in the next room, talking to one of my colleagues.

359
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:03,886
我的同伙 你把它说得那么不吉利
My associate? You make it sound so ominous.

360
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,976
伊恩是我最好的朋友 
Ian's my best friend. 

361
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,455
但这不代表我们什么事都一起干
Doesn't mean we do everything together.

362
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,757
就出卖你最好的朋友了 不错啊
Selling out your best friend? Nice.

363
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,332
你之前见过这个人吗
You ever see this man before?

364
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,671
没有 他是谁
Nope. Who is he?

365
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,505
目前是无名氏
John Doe for now.

366
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,808
他三天前被杀了
He was killed 3 days ago.

367
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,843
你那个时间段也有不在场证明吗
You got an alibi for that timeframe?

368
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,681
我们认为他的伤是你和你的同伙伊恩辛克莱
We think his injuries were a direct result of a fight

369
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:37,651
在山谷里组织的打斗的
that you and your associate Ian Sinclair arranged

370
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:41,487
直接结果 现在 我们可能只能证明你们共谋
in the valley. Now, we might only get you on conspiracy

371
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,656
犯了侵犯人身罪 但是相信我
to commit assault, but believe me,

372
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,093
等法官查出他的死因
when the judge finds out that it resulted in a death,

373
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,096
你会得到最重的刑 不得假释
you're getting maximum jail time, no parole.

374
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,064
不会的
No.

375
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,600
如果你有证据的话 你会逮捕我的
If you had anything on me, you'd arrest me.

376
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,371
所以如果我是在密谋策划或者随便什么
And so what if I was conspiring or whatever?

377
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,373
谁在乎呢
Who cares?

378
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,609
他连个名字都没有
He doesn't even have a name.

379
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,879
你有没有想过也许这些流浪汉 我也不知道
Do you think that maybe these hobos, I don't know,

380
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,381
想要喝醉 找点乐子呢
might wanna get drunk, have some fun?

381
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,316
我是说 如果有人给他们点钱 
I mean, so what if someone gives 'em a couple of bucks 

382
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,217
还让他们感觉自己像电影明星呢
and makes 'em feel like movie stars?

383
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:16,920
哦 所以你才这么做 为了
Oh, so that's why you do it? To fulfill

384
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,922
- 满足他们做明星的梦想 - 不
- their dreams of stardom? - No,

385
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,191
不是的 好吧 我什么都没做
no! OK, I'm not doing anything!

386
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,962
你们这些警察可真不现实
You cops are unreal!

387
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,931
你们保护那些垃圾 然后你们来骚扰
You protect garbage like that, and then you harass

388
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,932
像我这样的纳税公民
tax-paying citizens like me.

389
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,801
喔 你这会儿成纳税人了
Oh, you're a taxpayer now.

390
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,336
那么 告诉我吧 等我们检查你的银行账户
So, tell me, when we check your bank accounts

391
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:37,106
找到你售卖非法音像制品的收入证据时
and find evidence of income from illegal video sales,

392
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,108
我们还会发现你曾经申报过吗
are we also going to find out that you declared it?

393
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:42,478
或者我应该在逐渐增多的起诉里
Or should I add tax evasion to the list of charges

394
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:46,114
加一条逃税吗 麦肯齐先生
that are mounting against you, Mr. MacKenzie?

395
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,591
什么
What?

396
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,794
他在西蒙凯利案件中的不在场证明查证了
His alibi checks out for the Simon Kelly murder.

397
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:00,599
反正我就从没想过要把他扯到那件案子上去 
I never liked him for that one anyway. 

398
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,663
我想让他承认那起无名氏案
I want to get him on the John Doe.

399
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:04,499
你做不到了 这个刚刚送来了
You won't. This just came in.

400
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:07,235
法医判定他是自然死亡
The coroner ruled it death from natural causes.

401
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,803
这不可能啊 
That can't be right.

402
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,038
晚期肝硬化导致的肝衰竭
Liver failure due to advanced cirrhosis.

403
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,337
结束了 艾登 法医已经裁定了 
It's done, Aidan. The coroner has ruled. 

404
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:13,941
得放他走
Gotta let him go.

405
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,359
我能帮你吗
Can I give you a hand with that?

406
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,033
好吧
OK.

407
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,636
我的双手
My hands,

408
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,205
它们不是很灵活
they don't work so good.

409
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,974
是 呃 关节炎
It's the, uh, arthritis.

410
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:51,343
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell is that?

411
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,077
鹰嘴豆
Chickpeas.

412
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:55,313
试试看 它们对你有好处
Try 'em. They're good for you.

413
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:59,183
西蒙 兄弟 他总是给我些像这样的东西
Simon, man, he was always giving me stuff like this.

414
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:03,154
西蒙还给过你什么
What else did Simon give you?

415
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,289
他给我各种各样的东西
He gave me all kinds of stuff.

416
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,627
因为他在准备他的重大旅行 哈
'Cause he was going on his big trip, eh?

417
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:13,464
对啊 他给了我这个
Yeah, he gave me, uh, this.

418
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:16,166
棒球棒

419
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,936
用来保护我自己
To protect myself.

420
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:22,739
我不...我不用它 我只是带着它
I don't... I don't use it; I just carry it around.

421
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,975
- 你说西蒙要去旅行吗 - 哦 是的
- You say Simon was going on a trip? - Oh, yeah.

422
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,977
去北方
Up north.

423
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,012
住在野外
Live in the wild.

424
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,917
远离一切
Get away from everything.

425
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,788
对了 他还给我钱
Yeah, he gave me money too.

426
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:41,790
- 他给你钱 - 是的
- He gave you money? - Yeah.

427
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:43,958
- 他从哪得到的钱 - 打架
- Where'd he get the money? - Fighting.

428
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:47,362
还有他妈妈
And his mom.

429
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:50,332
他妈妈 爱丽丝吗
His mom? Alice?

430
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,367
爱丽丝 是的
Alice, yeah.

431
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,236
她是个好厨师
She's a good cook.

432
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:01,409
当然 西蒙可不想让我告诉你这个
Of course, Simon wouldn't want me to tell you that.

433
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,385
他不喜欢她来这儿 
He didn't like her coming around, 

434
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:05,112
他不喜欢她来这儿
he didn't like her coming around.

435
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:07,915
爱丽丝两天前的晚上在这儿吗
Was Alice here 2 nights ago,

436
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:11,785
- 当西蒙... - 我不知道 我不知道
- when Simon was... - I don't know, I don't know.

437
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,090
我们能不能不...
Can we not...

438
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,393
我们能不说那事儿吗
can we not talk about that?

439
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:28,834
鹰嘴豆怎么样
How are those chickpeas?

440
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:33,339
还行
They're OK.

441
00:22:35,642 --> 00:22:37,142
给你
Here you go.

442
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:45,650
我为你朋友感到遗憾
I'm sorry about your friend.

443
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:50,087
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Me too.

444
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,929
凯利夫人
Mrs. Kelly.

445
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:07,604
不好意思 现在真的不合适
I'm sorry, now is not a good time.

446
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:10,507
凯利夫人 我知道你一直和你儿子有联系
Mrs. Kelly, I know you've been in contact with your son.

447
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,476
我很多年都没见过西蒙了
I haven't seen Simon in years.

448
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,544
我们能就谈一下吗
Can we just talk?

449
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:20,349
我儿子已经死了 还有什么好谈的
My son is dead. What good will talking do?

450
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:22,351
好吧 我在努力找出是谁杀了他
Well I'm trying to find out who killed him.

451
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:25,488
你能不能就帮我一个忙 看一眼这张照片
Can you do me one favour and take a look at this picture?

452
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,366
你认得这个盘子吗
Do you recognize that dish?

453
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,671
对不起 我帮不了你
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

454
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,336
指纹与现场
Fingerprints are a match 

455
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:04,971
打碎的盘子上的相吻合
for the broken dish at the scene.

456
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,307
爱丽丝凯利谎称
Alice Kelly is lying 

457
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,913
她和儿子没有任何联系 为什么呢
about having any contact with her son. Why?

458
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,559
她不想让家里其他人知道
She didn't want the rest of her family to know.

459
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,095
因为...
Because...?

460
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:16,064
因为她丈夫和女儿明白西蒙病的有多严重
Her husband and daughter understood how ill Simon was.

461
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,628
但爱丽丝仍然希望他能好起来
But Alice was still hoping that he'd get better 

462
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:19,601
然后回家来
and then he could come home.

463
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,164
母亲通常是最后一个
The mother is often the last one 

464
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,204
放弃患精神分裂症孩子的人
to give up on a child with schizophrenia.

465
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:26,207
罗伯特和曼迪想知道西蒙是怎么死的
Robert and Maddie wanted to know how Simon died.

466
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,709
爱丽丝看起来一点也不好奇 这正常吗
Alice doesn't seem the least bit curious. Is that normal?

467
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:30,878
没什么是正常的
There is no normal.

468
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:32,914
但当我们一开始告诉他们的时候
But when we first told them,

469
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:36,117
她直接就进入了防御模式 仿佛她已经知道了
she went straight into defensive mode, as if she knew.

470
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:39,519
但却不想知道 典型的创伤后应激障碍症状
But didn't want to know classic PTSD symptoms.

471
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:40,829
我不知道你有没有听说 
I don't know if you've heard, 

472
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,455
我就某些话题差不多算个自学者
I'm a bit of an autodidact on the subject.

473
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:44,718
- 自学者 - 白昼俱乐部里的词
- Autodidact? - Word of the Day Club.

474
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:48,512
是我新学的 意思是自学的
It's my new thing. It means self-taught.

475
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:51,166
好吧 那么
OK, so,

476
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:53,316
关于西蒙的谋杀 爱丽丝有可能知道些什么
it's possible Alice knows something about Simon's murder

477
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,351
但她无法应付心理创伤
but is too traumatized to deal with it.

478
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:57,565
也许她知道凶手是谁 
Maybe she knows who the murderer is 

479
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:58,655
她在保护他
and is trying to protect him.

480
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:01,357
或者她可能在保护她自己
Or maybe she's trying to protect herself.

481
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:02,858
她杀了她自己的孩子
She killed her own kid?

482
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:05,194
他给她造成了很多痛苦
He caused her a lot of pain.

483
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:07,530
他不是故意的 但...
He didn't mean to, but...

484
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:09,765
这会发生 我见过
it happens. I've seen it.

485
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,266
好吧 所以
OK, so,

486
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,868
她努力想要照顾他 而他跑开了
she's trying to take care of him, he runs away.

487
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:16,305
她想保持联系 他不让她这么做
She wants to stay connected, he won't let her.

488
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,307
然后他告诉她他断了药
Then he tells her he's going off his meds

489
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:20,342
准备北上 居住在大陆之外的地方
and heading up north and gonna live off the land.

490
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:22,344
或许她生气了
Maybe she got angry.

491
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:25,571
或许她认为是在帮他
Or maybe she thought she was doing him a favour.

492
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,563
或许她只是失去了理智
Or maybe she just lost her mind.

493
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:32,787
好吧 不管发生了什么
Well, whatever happened,

494
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:36,290
爱丽丝凯利是新的头号嫌犯
Alice Kelly is our new prime suspect.

495
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,213
搜查队带回了一个园林工

496
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:39,427
他发现什么了吗

499
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:45,064
是的
Yeah.

500
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:48,501
总有一天我会讨厌这该死的工作
Some days I hate this damn job.

501
00:25:57,377 --> 00:25:59,345
会花很长时间吗
This gonna take long?

502
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:02,548
我会尽快的 请坐
I'll make it as quick as I can. Have a seat.

503
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:06,852
你发现了一些空的漂白剂瓶子
So, you found some empty containers of bleach.

504
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:10,922
对 介意告诉我为何因此把我带到市区来吗
Yeah. Mind telling me why that gets me brought downtown?

505
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:14,525
这周有个无家可归的人在山谷被杀了
A homeless man was murdered in the valley this week.

506
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,062
有人用漂白剂清理了犯罪现场
Someone cleaned up the crime scene with bleach.

507
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:20,698
你发现了什么
What did you find?

508
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:25,536
一公升的瓶子 大概有五六个
Onelitre bottles, like 5 or 6 of 'em.

509
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:29,474
这么说 这些流浪汉是自相残杀 还是怎样
So, uh, these bums killing each other off, or what?

510
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:32,142
你在垃圾里发现其他东西了吗 比如衣物
Did you find anything else in the garbage? Clothes?

511
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,711
我真的没注意
I didn't really pay any attention.

512
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,848
我只是 警察问我有没有发现些异常的东西
I just... Cop asked me if I saw anything unusual.

513
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:40,017
我想不通 比如...
I figured, like...

514
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,688
谁会在该死的峡谷里
you know, who needs bleach 

515
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,154
用漂白剂呢
in the middle of a friggin' ravine?

516
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:46,256
你还记得牌子吗
Do you remember the brand?

517
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,492
是成批生产的 跟我们工作用的那种差不多
Institutional stuff. Similar to what we use on the job.

518
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,844
但不是一种吗
But not identical?

519
00:26:50,964 --> 00:26:53,796
不是 我们用的是蓝瓶的 而这些是白瓶的
No. We have blue bottles. These were white.

520
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,199
好吧 我想让你

526
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,528
布莱特克斯漂白剂是怎么回事 
Blytex. What's with the bleach? 

527
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,990
在距离现场大约四分之一英里的地方
Some empty containers were

528
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,483
发现了一些空瓶子

529
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:17,786
那是他们在医院用的牌子

什么
What?

531
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:22,223
爱丽丝凯利最近回去工作了
Alice Kelly recently went back to work

532
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,191
做西南总部的管理员

Less than 2 miles from the valley. She has means,

00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,230
有动机 看看他们有没有少漂白剂
she has motive. See if they're missing any bleach.

535
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:31,598
- 如果少了的话 - 那就申请搜查证
- And if they are? - File for a warrant.

536
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,687
你从厨房拿了所有刀具以后 
Once you get all the knives from the kitchen, 

537
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:44,978
就去检查一下池边小屋
check the pool house.

538
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:47,914
这太荒谬了 好了 在我和我的律师谈话之前
This is ridiculous. All right, I want you all to leave

539
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:50,682
- 我希望你们都离开 - 你就是律师
- until I speak to my lawyer. - You're a lawyer,

540
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:52,717
凯利先生 你知道搜查证的作用
Mr. Kelly. You know how a search warrant works.

541
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:54,820
- 你有这个的钥匙吗 - 我们知道
- Have you got a key for this? - We know

542
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,481
这对你来说有多难 
how difficult this is for you. 

543
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,257
你们 仅仅因为我妻子
Do you, eh? Just because my wife was

544
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,725
和我儿子有联系并不能说明她就是罪犯
in contact with my son does not make her a criminal.

545
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,395
凯利先生 警方必须要调查
The police have to investigate, Mr. Kelly.

546
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,284
调查毛线 她是一位伟大的母亲 
Investigate what? Mary Mother of God, 

547
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:06,397
你认为会是她杀的吗
do you think she killed him?

548
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,241
她是这世上
She's the only person in the world 

549
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:08,699
唯一没有放弃他的人
who didn't give up on him.

550
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,040
你们这群人是怎么了 都瞎眼了吗
What's wrong with you people Are you blind?!

551
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,247
警探 我发现了些东西 
Detective? I might have something here. 

552
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:16,774
这个纽扣的背面有血
There's blood on the back of this button.

553
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,876
你把大部分血迹洗掉了 但留下了
So, you washed most of the blood out, but left

554
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,542
足以让我们检测的痕迹 
just enough for us to test. 

555
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,032
我们会在这件衬衣上
Are we going to find your son's DNA 

556
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,347
发现你儿子的DNA吗 凯利夫人
on this shirt, Mrs. Kelly?

557
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:24,781
你不能这么对我妻子说话
You do not speak to my wife like that.

558
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:26,916
凯利先生 你不能干涉
Mr. Kelly, you can't interfere.

559
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:28,452
请你就待在这 
Stay right here, please. 

560
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,120
爱丽丝 请你过来
Alice, please come over here Alice.

561
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:33,090
- 先生 请退后 - 爱丽丝 到这边来
- Sir, back up, please. - Alice, come here.

562
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:33,889
先生
Sir.

563
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,393
那些你不能拿 那是我儿子的
You can't take those. Those belong to my son.

564
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:38,075
很抱歉 你刚刚证实了
I'm sorry. You just confirmed 

565
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:39,395
这是被害人的财产
this is property belonging to the victim.

566
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:40,403
它们是私人财产
They're private.

567
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:42,331
夫人 夫人 别紧张 你需要坐下
Ma'am, ma'am, relax. You need to go sit down.

568
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:44,092
- 它们归私人所有 - 夫人 你需要坐下
- They're private! - You need to sit down, ma'am!

569
00:28:44,212 --> 00:28:45,077
- 不 - 立刻
- No! - Now!

570
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:46,910
听着 别碰她 把书给我
Listen, you leave her alone. Give me the books.

571
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,253
先生 后退
Back up, sir!

572
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:52,941
- 我明白了 - 不 你不明白
- I got it. - No you don't.

573
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:55,276
罗伯特
Robert!

574
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,412
我的肩膀 啊
My shoulder. Ah!

575
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,447
它错位了
It's dislocated.

576
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,266
我不是有意伤害他的 
I didn't mean to injure him, 

577
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:18,198
但他一直挣扎...
but he just kept struggling...

578
00:29:18,233 --> 00:29:19,833
他袭警了
He assaulted a police officer.

579
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,139
西蒙被谋杀了 大家都认为
Simon was murdered, and everyone thinks

580
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:26,500
你跟这事有关 
you had something to do with it 

581
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,207
因为在这件事情上你
because you have been lying

582
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:31,977
一直都在对大家说谎
to everyone this entire time!

583
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:34,147
妈妈 你到底什么时候才承认
When are you gonna admit it, Mom?

584
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:37,316
他已经走了
He's gone!

585
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:39,519
他已经走了好几年了
He's been gone for years.

586
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:20,964
呃 凯利先生 我想跟你道歉
Um, Mr. Kelly, I wanted to apologize to you.

587
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:24,568
对于之前发生的事 我真是感觉糟透了
I feel really terrible about what happened earlier.

588
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:26,925
你们已经足够长时间地剥夺了我的权利 
You've denied me my rights long enough. 

589
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:27,571
我要打电话
I want my call.

590
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,622
或许你会愿意接受他的道歉 
You might want to accept his apology. 

591
00:30:29,623 --> 00:30:31,174
是他撤消了对你的指控
He's the one who got your charges dropped.

592
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,579
我想是我该道歉才对
I guess I'm the one who should apologize.

593
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:37,313
我不是有意伤害你的
I didn't mean to hurt you.

594
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:40,282
你当然不是有意的 如果你跟我一起的话
You didn't. If you'll come with me,

595
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:41,073
我会送你回家的 
I'll take you home. 

596
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:42,284
如果你愿意的话我可以送他回去
I can do that if you want.

597
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,687
我顺路 凯利先生 我们走吧
It's on my way. Mr. Kelly?

598
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,462
爱丽丝 爱丽丝 你在家吗 非常感谢
Alice? Alice, are you home? Thanks very much.

599
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:56,965
别动
Don't move.

600
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:05,974
外面到处都是搜查小队
Units are out everywhere.

601
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:08,776
- 没有她的踪迹 - 我们证实了凶器
- No sign of her. - We confirmed the weapon.

602
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,685
上面满是西蒙的血迹
It has Simon's blood 

603
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:11,879
和爱丽丝的指纹
and Alice Kelly's fingerprints all over it.

604
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,981
她把它放在了显眼的位置 这几乎相当于供认
She left it in plain view. It's as good as a confession.

605
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,683
那么为什么我不开心呢
So why am I not happy?

606
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:18,786
因为她没有供认 她逃走了
Because she didn't confess; she ran.

607
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,622
实际上 她供认了但同时逃走了
Actually, she confessed and she ran at the same time.

608
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:23,493
那是否跟因为杀了自己的孩子
Is that consistent with feeling guilty

609
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,624
而感到愧疚相符呢
over killing your own child?

610
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:26,626
老实说 我不知道那跟什么相符
Frankly, I don't know what it's consistent with.

611
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,495
她的行为说不太通
Her behaviour doesn't make a lot of sense.

612
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,997
罪犯很愚蠢 而悲痛让人更愚蠢
Criminals are stupid. Grief makes you stupider.

613
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:32,932
她杀了自己的儿子 有什么能说得通这一点呢
She killed her own son. What makes sense about that?

614
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:35,568
不 医生是对的 我是说 首先她回避我们
No, the doc is right. I mean, first she stonewalls us,

615
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,154
然后她自套绞索 
then she puts the noose around her own neck? 

616
00:31:37,155 --> 00:31:38,705
她到底想做什么呢
What's she trying to do?

617
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,540
听说我们锁定嫌犯了
I hear we have a suspect.

618
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,042
- 你们找到她了吗 - 没有
- You find her yet? - No.

619
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,481
搜查小队正在找 他们会找到的 
Units are looking. They'll find her. 

620
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,769
等找到她以后 她将面临二级谋杀罪指控
When they do, she's facing second degree. 

621
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,615
杀人案告一段落 干得漂亮
Homicide is signing off. Nice work.

622
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,884
我认为不是她干的
I don't think she did it.

623
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:54,219
哦 艾登 别这样对我
Oh, Aidan. Don't do this to me.

624
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:56,221
你总是这么对我 你想多了
You always do this to me. You're overthinking it.

625
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:58,656
- 这讲不通 - 什么讲不通
- It doesn't add up. - What doesn't?

626
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,825
- 指纹还是刀子 - 这位母亲
- The prints, or the knife? - The mother.

627
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:01,902
是的 她摸过凶器 
OK, she handled the weapon. 

628
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,294
但这并不意味着就是她杀的
Doesn't mean she killed him.

629
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,896
我觉得他说得对
I think he's right.

630
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,131
她的行为并不意味着有罪
Her behaviour doesn't indicate guilt.

631
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:09,133
她的做法似乎是在否认
She's acting like she's in denial.

632
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,370
我们不知道全部内情
We don't have the whole story.

633
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,050
这个交给律师处理吧 我们只需要逮捕案犯
Leave it to the lawyers. We just pick 'em up

634
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,838
并移交 你的预感不都是对的
and hand 'em over. Your hunches aren't always right.

635
00:32:14,872 --> 00:32:18,642
但也并不总是错的
They're not always wrong either.

636
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:21,645
请便吧 我们会标记成已经结案
All yours. We're marking it solved.

637
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,914
嘿
Hey,

638
00:32:23,948 --> 00:32:26,616
我得走了 有些家里的事要处理
I gotta go. Some family thing.

639
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,151
嗯 我会回来的 半个小时
Um, I'll be back. Half an hour.

640
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:43,566
抱歉 我耽搁了
Sorry, I got held up.

641
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,066
这个给你
If you want.

642
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,601
谢谢
Thanks.

643
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:51,673
事情怎么样了
So, what's happening?

644
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:54,075
我们在外面又增加了二十辆巡逻车
Well, we've got 20 extra patrol cars out there,

645
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,578
但至今还是一无所获
but so far nothing.

646
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:59,213
你这半个小时发生了什么
What happened to half an hour?

647
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,715
我姐姐觉得她中风了
My sister thought she was having a stroke.

648
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,717
虚惊一场
False alarm.

649
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,920
- 那是什么 - 更年期
- What was it? - Menopause.

650
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:10,223
她有点多疑 她是家里的长女
She's a bit of a hypochondriac. She's the oldest,

651
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:13,026
而我是最小的女儿 相差六岁
I'm the youngest. Six.

652
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,028
这么说你姐姐是位忧郁症患者
So, your sister's a hypochondriac

653
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,396
而你是位医生 你一直利用这一点
and you're a doctor. You ever take advantage of that,

654
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,898
被她搞得有点焦头烂额了吗
mess around with her a bit?

655
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:22,301
如果我是那种人的话 我可能会的
I might, if I were that kind of person.

656
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,303
哦 我觉得你是那种人
Oh, I think you're that kind of person.

657
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,305
你对我的了解还不足以做出判断
You don't know me well enough to judge.

658
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,774
我错了吗
Am I wrong?

659
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,811
你近乎痴迷了 或许更甚
You're borderline obsessive. Maybe more

660
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,045
也许比"近乎"更严重
Maybe more than borderline.

661
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,214
你对你姐姐也是这么说的吗
Is that what you say to your sister?

662
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,149
除非她让我这么做
Only if she asks for it.

663
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,120
你在日记中发现什么了吗
You find anything in the journals?

664
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,655
是
Yeah.

665
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:47,626
他经历了很多痛苦
It's a lot of suffering.

666
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,938
可怜的孩子被幻听折磨 
This poor kid was tormented by voices, 

667
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,595
尤其是最近三个月
especially the last 3 months.

668
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,431
- 自从他停止服药 - 是
- Since he went off his meds. - Right.

669
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,235
"它们对我耳语 但声音很大
"They whisper at me, but loud.

670
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,404
昨晚又将我吵醒"
They woke me up again last night."

671
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,939
接着
And then...

672
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,743
"它们藏在暗处 但我知道它们在那儿
"They hide, but I know they're there.

673
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:09,646
我想让它们走开 但当它们不在时
I want them to go away, but when they do,

674
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,082
我很孤单 然后我又怕它们回来"
I'm lonely, and then I'm afraid they'll come back."

675
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:16,586
我不禁在想
You know, I can't stop thinking...

676
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,821
什么
What?

677
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,823
也许西蒙不是被谋杀的 也许他是自杀
Maybe Simon wasn't murdered; Maybe he killed himself.

678
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:24,026
所有的证据都指向这一点
I mean, everything points to it.

679
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,506
他最后的几篇日记
These last few journal entries 

680
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,495
读起来像一篇长长的遗言
read like one long suicide note.

681
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,437
只是最后一篇日记
The only problem is 

682
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:31,106
和我的猜想相悖
my theory falls apart with the last entry.

683
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:32,000
他很快乐
He's happy.

684
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:33,969
怎么讲
Happy how?

685
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:35,971
他说 "我想通了
He says, "I figured it out.

686
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:38,039
都会好起来的"
Everything is gonna be better."

687
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:39,574
我看看
Let me see.

688
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:48,482
这是自杀愉悦症
It's called suicide euphoria.

689
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:51,552
他很快乐因为能不再遭受折磨
He's happy because he's not tormented anymore.

690
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:53,587
他做出了决定
He's made a decision.

691
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:58,224
西蒙凯利是自杀的
Simon Kelly committed suicide.

692
00:34:58,258 --> 00:35:00,560
我很确定
I'm pretty sure of it.

693
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:02,562
那为什么爱丽丝凯利
Then why is Alice Kelly

694
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,398
表现得像个谋杀嫌疑犯
behaving like a murder suspect?

695
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:08,834
她感到愧疚 不能挽救他
She feels guilty; she couldn't save him.

696
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:11,036
但证据却显示另有隐情
The evidence tells a different story.

697
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:16,942
也许不是
Maybe it doesn't.

698
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:27,218
多久能见到法医
How soon can we meet with the coroner?

699
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,553
刀锋的锯齿边缘
The knife's serrated edge 

700
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:29,854
与喉部伤口吻合
is consistent with the throat cut.

701
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,125
小伤口是被害人抵抗时
The smaller cuts are defensive wounds incurred 

702
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,691
招致的自卫伤口
while the victim struggled.

703
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:35,693
那不是自卫伤口
The small cuts aren't defensive wounds;

704
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:36,984
是犹豫伤 
They're hesitation wounds. 

705
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:39,497
一个自杀者抹脖子会犹豫吗
A suicide who slashes his own throat?

706
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:41,197
我从未见过
I've never seen it.

707
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:43,700
我见过 七年前的梅布伦特里案
I have. Maybrintly case, 7 years ago.

708
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,836
看看这个横向切口 
Take a look at the transverse throat cut. 

709
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:47,938
拜托 这是被害人自己造成的
Please. It's self-inflicted.

710
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:49,439
就算是自己造成的
If it was self-inflicted,

711
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:52,075
他为何放弃使用惯用手 所以不可能
he would have had to use his weaker hand. Not likely.

712
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,511
西蒙是左撇子
Simon was left-handed.

713
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,346
我不知情 你确定吗
I don't have that. Are you sure?

714
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,085
是的 这是他的照片 
Pretty sure, yeah. This is him. 

715
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,449
棒球手套戴在右手
Glove's on the right hand.

716
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:02,460
西蒙的日记显示
Simon's journals indicate that 

717
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,720
他的自杀意图始于
his suicidal ideation began

718
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,607
大约三个月前 
approximately 3 months ago, 

719
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:08,724
当他停用安定药时
when he stopped taking antipsychotics.

720
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,627
他表现为临床抑郁症 精神病症状加重
He's clinically depressed, increasingly psychotic.

721
00:36:11,662 --> 00:36:13,728
这是他的最后一篇日记
This one is from his final entry.

722
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:16,230
他在和折磨自己的声音对话
He's talking to the voices that tormented him:

723
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:18,831
"今晚我要开始一场旅行 
"I am going on a big trip tonight, 

724
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:19,901
不会再回来
and I'm not coming back.

725
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:22,403
这次 你不会跟来了"
And this time, you can't come with me."

726
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:24,906
这是自杀 莉莉
It was suicide, Lily.

727
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,908
是 那晚我要检查四具尸体
Yeah, I had 4 bodies that night,

728
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:29,007
家属前来认尸 
families coming in to identify, 

729
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:30,778
等着死因报告
waiting for the cause of death.

730
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,746
我会处理好的
I'll make it right.

731
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:44,991
曼迪 有你母亲的消息吗
Maddie. Have you heard from your mother?

732
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,027
- 我们上楼去 - 不 我没事
- Come on, we'll go upstairs. - No it's OK.

733
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:52,165
是我妈妈杀了西蒙吗
Did my Mom kill Simon?

734
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,201
不
We don't think so.

735
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:00,406
他 他是自杀的 对吗
He... he killed himself, didn't he?

736
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,312
你为什么来 曼迪
Why are you here, Maddie?

737
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,980
是... 是我妈妈
It's... it's my mom.

738
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:12,527
我担心她会伤害自己
I'm afraid she's gonna hurt herself.

739
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,018
你知道她在哪儿吗
Do you know where she is?

740
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:16,754
是的
I think so.

741
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:21,892
她在这儿 谢谢 我来处理
All right, she's here? Thanks, I got it.

742
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,102
爱丽丝
Alice.

743
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,924
爱丽丝
Alice.

744
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:12,831
我们搞清了西蒙的事
We know about Simon.

745
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:16,200
他做了什么 你做了什么
What he did, what you did.

746
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:21,606
很抱歉我们拿了他的日记
I'm sorry we had to take his journals,

747
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,309
但我不后悔读了它
but I'm not sorry that I read 'em.

748
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:28,079
我感到自己多了解了他一点
I felt like I got to know him a little bit.

749
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:30,981
真实的西蒙
The real Simon, you know?

750
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:34,417
为他的北上旅行做准备
Getting ready for his big trip up north,

751
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:36,086
试图独立起来
trying to be independent.

752
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,122
他不知道自己有多严重
He didn't know how bad he was getting.

753
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,294
但你知道
But you knew.

754
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:46,395
我无法想象看着他旧疾复发
And I can't imagine how hard it must have been

755
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,631
有多艰难
watching his illness come back.

756
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,471
那天晚上你找到他
And then that night when you found him...

757
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:02,376
有好多血
There was so much blood.

758
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:07,916
起初我以为是别人干的
At first I thought it was someone else.

759
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:12,320
我不能把他扔在那儿
I couldn't leave him like that.

760
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,691
我给他穿上他最爱的衬衫
I put on his favourite shirt.

761
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:20,460
让他看起来很好
To make him look nice, you know?

762
00:39:20,495 --> 00:39:22,663
很干净
Clean.

763
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:24,865
我擦掉了所有的血迹
I made everything clean.

764
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,067
我不想让罗伯特和曼迪知道
I didn't want Robert and Maddie

765
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:29,069
西蒙是自杀的
to know that Simon had killed himself.

766
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:31,105
他们会自责
They would have felt so bad.

767
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:37,309
这不是他们的错 是我的错
It wasn't their fault; It was my fault.

768
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,941
爱丽丝 听我说 这不是你的错 
Alice, listen to me. It wasn't your fault. 

769
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:40,980
你也无能为力
There's nothing you could have done.

770
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:44,316
为了救西蒙
I let everything fall apart

771
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:48,287
我的生活都完了 为了什么
to save Simon. And for what?

772
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,691
我明白你的感受
I know how you're feeling.

773
00:39:56,863 --> 00:40:00,265
你觉得悲痛永远不会消失
All right? You don't think it's ever gonna go away,

774
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,734
你知道自己像个胆小鬼 但你不在乎
and you know you're being a coward, but you don't care,

775
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,103
因为你只想结束这痛苦
because you just want this pain to stop.

776
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:11,042
你想结束一切 闭上眼睛
You want everything to stop so you can close your eyes

777
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,044
一了百了
and feel some peace.

778
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,046
相信我 爱丽丝
Trust me, Alice,

779
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,081
事情会变得…
things are going to be... Ah...

780
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,051
我抓住你了 抓住你了
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

781
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,251
没事
I got you.

782
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,920
我抓住你了
I got you, I got you.

783
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,524
从这种悲伤解脱出来 
Is a week long enough to recover

784
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:56,784
一周的时间够不够
 from this kind of depression?

785
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:58,786
不够
Mm, no.

786
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:01,022
但我想她不会自杀了
But I don't think she's suicidal anymore.

787
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:09,996
我不知道该说什么 当我想…
I don't know what to say. When I think...

788
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:13,366
- 你会没事的 爱丽丝 - 妈妈
- You're going to be OK, Alice. - Mom?

789
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,845
在车里 我…
In the car, I had the...

790
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:27,279
我和我妻子第一次真正交流
the first real conversation I've had with my wife

791
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:29,581
在... 天呐 这么多年来
in... God, years.

792
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:31,683
多沟通
Have more.

793
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,687
他们不会有事吧
You think they're gonna be OK?

794
00:41:35,722 --> 00:41:38,490
人们的恢复力总是很让我惊叹
It always amazes me what people can recover from.

795
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:42,127
他们为何不能
Why not them?

796
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:45,529
又有任务了 你还要来吗
Looks like we're on. You still want in on this?

797
00:41:45,564 --> 00:41:48,933
错过什么也不能错过这个
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

798
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,337
使劲点 抓住他
Harder than that! Come on, get him.

799
00:41:53,372 --> 00:41:55,506
使劲
Harder shots.

800
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,675
- 够了 - 嘿 伙计
- That's it. - Hey, dude.

801
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,677
- 终极对决 - 快来看
- Domination. - Come join the party.

802
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:03,147
揍他
- Oof! - Get him.

803
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:06,283
揍他 使劲 我来拿相机
Get him, come on! Hit! I'll take that camera.

804
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,585
- 去你的 快跑 - 拿下他们
- Screw you, dude. Go. - Take 'em!

805
00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:16,159
趴下
Stay down.

806
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,268
干得漂亮
Nice work.

807
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:26,735
谢谢
Thanks.

808

- Grant MacKenzie... - And Ian Sinclair.

809
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:36,077
你们因共谋袭击罪被捕
You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit assault,

810
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:38,146
- 还有教唆罪 - 以及妨碍司法公正
- aiding and abetting. - Obstruction of justice.

811
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,282
公共饮酒 行为不端
Open air drinking, disorderly conduct.

812
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:42,284
- 乱丢垃圾 - 决斗罪
- Littering. - And duelling.

813
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,286
- 决斗也算 - 决斗罪
- Duelling?! - Duelling?

814
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,287
写在法条里了 一人向另一人
