00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,400
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}周六\N下午5点\N　\N

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}婚礼前25小时

3
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,736
马修和马尔文坐着公交车
Marshall and marvin were taking the bus

4
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,339
正赶着和我们相见于长岛的旅社
On their way to long island to meet up with us.

5
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:07,740
好啦 好啦 马尔文
there, there, little marvin.

6
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,342
不要再哭啦
Let no more tears fall.

7
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:13,012
我们很快就能见到妈妈啦
We're gonna see mommy in no time at all.

8
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,248
大家好 很抱歉孩子的吵闹给你们添堵
Hello there. I'm sorry for all of the noise.

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,383
艾瑞克森家的男人们今天颇为辛苦
It's been a long day for the Eriksen boys.

10
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,552
这押韵是怎么回事
Uh... What's with the rhyming?

11
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:20,920
这问题真是问得好
I'm glad that you ask.

12
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:23,890
哄我儿子睡觉可不好搞
To get my son sleeping is no easy task.

13
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,259
几周前 我老婆担起了重任
A few weeks ago, the job fell to my wife.

14
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,928
我儿子哭得让人心疼得很
And as the poor baby cried out for dear life,

15
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,165
她把每本童话书都试了一遍
She read every book, but all were no use

16
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,335
最终找到一位鹅妈妈才结束灾难
Until she arrived at a mother named goose.

17
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,335
{\a6}鹅妈妈童谣是一本英国民间童谣集

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,137
-为什么呢 马尔文  -她发现
-Why, marvin... -She noted.

18
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:39,172
这些押韵让你恹恹欲睡
...These rhymes make you tired!

19
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:41,241
从此 小马尔文有了心水
And ever since then, all young marvin's required

20
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:43,509
只需这书有押韵 他便能安静熟睡
Is one book of rhymes, and to dream land he goes.

21
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,111
好啦 现在咱读什么呢
Now, what shall we read?

22
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,580
不好了 我把书落在那辆车上了
Oh, crap, I left his book in the car!

23
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:50,683
那可真衰
That blows.

这是什么狗屎运啊
What craptastic luck!

30
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,204
没了马尔文的押韵书 这趟旅程注定艰苦
Without marvin's rhyme book, this ride's gonna suck!

31
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,206
车上有谁带了本诗集吗
Does anyone here have some poetry maybe?

32
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,240
或者出个主意
Or any advice? 

33
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,942
有 别生娃就行了呀
Yeah! Don't have a baby!

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,812
要是不让小马尔文醒过来
I guess if I don't want young Marvin to wake up,

35
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,582
我只能自己把韵押起来
The rhymes will just have to be ones that I make up.

36
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,652
出口成章 七步成诗什么的都是我的菜
I'll whip up some poetry in seconds flat!

37
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,658
有了
Oh, I know!

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,193
这故事就叫莫斯比击球不长眼
This story's called Mosby at the bat!

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,135
泰德情路多料峭
The outlook wasn't brilliant for poor Ted's romantic life.

40
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:46,139
三十好几没人要
He was deep into his thirties, and yet, still he had no wife.

41
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:47,807
有天正把论文批
But then, one day whilst grading papers,

42
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,309
生活还让他不如意
Life sent him a whammy.

43
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,344
一个物理教授叫丽萨
A physics prof named Lisa

44
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,745
不久前刚到 来自迈阿密
Who'd just moved here from miami.

45
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,946
教授
Professor?

46
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,248
她面露羞涩之意
She asked timidly.

47
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,250
他答道 叫我泰德就行
He answered: Call me ted. Oh.

48
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,584
希望没有打扰到你
I don't want to bother you.

49
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,086
-没事 请坐吧  -他说道
-Please, have a seat. -He said.

50
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:03,623
我教书时间不太长 希望有经验能给分享
I'm fairly new to teaching, and I'm looking for advice.

51
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,826
我每晚练习做讲座 有时还要练两场
Every night I practice giving lectures, sometimes twice.

52
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:11,297
每当我讲到磁力 呆滞目光遍全场
But when I teach magnetic force, I just see eyeballs glazing.

53
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:16,703
我问了一圈啥情况 大家都说你教得最棒
I asked around, and people say your lectures are amazing.

54
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:18,104
超级无敌屌炸棒
Which is really saying something,

55
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,139
毕竟你教的是建筑学嘛 无聊
Because, architecture? Yawn.

56
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,108
泰德想着
And ted thought...

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,344
是啊 就跟物理有多好玩一样
Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting.

58
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,712
接着说
Go on.

59
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,280
就是说你这么会教书
It's just that you're so skilled,

60
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:29,115
我现在还羽翼未丰
And I'm a relative beginner.

61
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:33,119
如果不麻烦的话 咱能一起吃顿饭可成
If it isn't too much trouble, can I take you out to dinner?

62
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,723
我希望能收获些技巧 不会耽误你太晚的
I'd love to get some pointers, and I shouldn't keep you late.

63
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,324
你怎么看呀
What do you say?

64
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,726
我怎么看呀
What do I say?

65
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,461
西区泰迪有约会啦
Teddy Westside's got a date!

66
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,396
-好啊  -我们欢呼道
-Hooray! -We cheered.

67
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:44,464
泰德不坐冷板凳了
Ted's off the bench!

68
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:45,965
咱家小子重回情场
Our boy's back in the game!

69
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,500
感谢上帝 离上次泰德和女人有约
Thank god, it's been a hundred years

70
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,868
得有一百年过去了吧
Since mosby scored a dame.

71
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,737
上次泰德看到胸部的时候
The last time he saw boobies was

72
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,138
就是在«名扬四海»里的试镜那场戏里了
The screen-test scene in Fame.

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,406
泰德前任女朋友
The last girl he dated,

74
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,308
名字好像是右手
I think "Righty" Was her name.

75
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,143
淡定 咱别过分激动
Hold it. Let's not all go crazy

76
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,011
别跟狂暴化了似的
Like some wild berserkers.

77
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,848
如果这只是两个同事一起吃顿饭呢
What if this is just a business meal between co-workers?

78
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,883
泰德想起来以前几次失败的约会
Ted thought back on past failed dates.

79
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,018
天呐 他说得对
Oh, god, that could be true.

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,222
有多少次我带着失望的蛋蛋回家睡
How many times have I come home to find my balls are blue?

81
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:12,392
这全取决于泰德和他那位
It all depends where Ted and his new fetching young Floridian

82
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:15,261
佛州女士在那条线上的站位
Are standing in relation to that puzzling meridian

83
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,263
国际约会线
Called "The international date line."

84
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,765
你没听错 新学说
That's right, new theory.

85
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,833
-你们问 "那是什么"  -没人问
-"What's that," You ask? -Nobody did.

86
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,336
我就大发慈悲的告诉你们 约会线
I'll now address your query! The date line

87
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:26,506
也就是欢乐与悲伤的分界
Is the border betwixt happiness and sorrow.

88
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:28,775
要是在这里 你今晚就回家
On this side, you go home tonight.

89
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:31,778
要是这里 你就在外过夜
On this side, home tomorrow.

90
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,348
然后 巴尼做的手势太粗鲁
And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude,

91
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,284
泰德离去寻丽萨 心中疑惑止不住
Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood.

92
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,219
这算个约会吗
Was this a date?

93
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,088
他不知道自己将要面对什么考验
He simply couldn't tell how he was faring.

94
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,222
然后丽萨出现
Then Lisa showed up.

95
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,726
泰德很高兴看到她衣着惊艳
Ted rejoiced to see what she was wearing.

96
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,127
因为要是出席工作晚餐
For girls at business dinners

97
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,263
女人们不会把事业线开那么低
Don't have necklines that revealing!

98
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,570
但是一个友好的握手让泰德
But then a friendly handshake gave poor Ted

99
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,172
心情跌到谷底
A sinking feeling.

100
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,211
于是 晚餐开始了
And so, the night were on.

101
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:07,447
然后这个球就这么转啊转啊转
And back and forth, the globe rotated.

102
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,117
泰德的好奇心就这么晃啊晃啊晃
But still, Ted's curiosity was never fully sated.

103
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,585
什么时候是个头
How long could this continue?

104
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,454
他简直就是命运的棋子
He was truly fortune's pawn.

105
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,456
然后丽萨看到了电视
Then Lisa saw the tv.

106
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,090
嘿 洋基队的比赛开始
Hey, the yankees game is on!

107
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,792
-关于棒球  -泰德眼尖注意到
-Of baseball... -Ted observed...

108
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,728
美人似乎颇有料 一手资料皆通晓
...You seem to have some firsthand knowledge.

109
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,397
美女微笑耸肩道
To which the lady shrugged and said...

110
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,465
大学时光多荣耀 垒球娇娃姐之号
I played softball in college.

111
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,550
垒球不过陈腔调 不过如此无夸耀
Now the age-old softball stereotype's just that,

112
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,185
无夸耀
And nothing more.

113
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,686
-漂亮  -洋基跑垒草上飞
Yeah! But as the yankees got a run,

114
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,888
泰德心忧难上垒
Ted feared he wouldn't score.

115
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,657
一朝踏入分界线
For while the date side of the line's

116
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,892
插翅难飞泰德怨
The one we all might guess he's in,

117
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:42,528
美女投球好手段 小泰无力难称愿
There'll be no joy in tedville if our lisa is a...

118
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,163
漂亮 赢了耶
Yes! We win!

119
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,499
丽萨小酌 轻言道
Then lisa took a drink and said...

120
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:48,568
此事言及颇轻佻
This may sound kind of random,

121
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,237
小女恋球有蹊跷 若问奴家痴为何
But there actually is a reason for my rabid yankee fandom.

122
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,206
听我一片冰心玉壶道
I guess I'll just be honest here,

123
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,041
座上看官莫讥诮
Though crazy it may seem.

124
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:59,245
初到宝地事难料 队中一人共春宵
My first week in new york, I dated someone on the team.

125
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,480
队里的谁
Which player?

126
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,014
-人家才不说  -说嘛
-I'm not saying.  -Please?

127
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,483
干嘛八卦 你是记者啊
What are you, a reporter?

128
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,051
泰德心绪飘天边
Ted's mind began to race.

129
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,686
恰逢小二来拿单
The waiter came to take their order.

130
00:05:06,688 --> 00:05:08,087
丽萨朱唇轻启动
As lisa said...

131
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,056
大快朵颐奴不愿 只求意大利式海鲜面
I might like the spaghetti marinara.

132
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,591
可怜泰德心难平 此面莫非另有名
Poor ted just wondered silently...

133
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,193
洋基队版加藤鹰
Mariano rivera?

134
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,193
{\a6}马里安诺•李维拉 洋基队的王牌终结者 获奖无数
加藤鹰 最有名的岛国动作大片男星

135
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,194
美人此时话未终
And as she said...

136
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:17,363
此店美味有风评 意式炸鸡传美名
I read this place has great chicken milano.

137
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:19,599
言者此语无它意 听者闻言有别心 
All ted could bring himself to think was:

138
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,534
阿方索•索里阿诺
Alfonso soriano?

139
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,534
{\a6}阿方索•索里阿诺 洋基队左外野手

140
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,069
等闲小食难填我
I want something hearty.

141
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,371
碳烤味噌鳕鱼又如何
How about blackened miso cod?

142
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:26,606
是乔•吉拉迪吗
Is it joe girardi?

143
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:26,606
{\a6}乔·吉拉迪 扬基队主教练

144
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,075
我的神啊 是强棒罗德里格斯吗
Holy crap, is it a-rod?!

145
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,075
{\a6}罗德里格斯 全垒打王 曾因与麦当娜有染而天价离婚

146
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,676
好吧 泰德 冷静下来
Okay, ted, calm down.

147
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,211
打起精神来
You've got to get yourself together.

148
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,946
微笑 耍帅
Just smile, be charming,

149
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,115
教授气场 闲淡扯起来
Ooze charisma, talk about the weather.

150
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,583
这个可能是约会呦
For this might be a date,

151
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:39,852
所以还是有可能偷个情
Which means there might be hanky-panky.

152
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:43,189
所以老兄 千万一定 冷静 千万不要...
So, dude, be cool, relax, don't even...

153
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,924
快告诉我是哪个货
Just tell me which yankee!

154
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,528
我本来不想说起这个的
I'd rather not discuss this here.

155
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,363
不过既然这样 我也不希望会
But then again, I'd hate...

156
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:53,433
是这个傻傻的秘密毁了这个约会
To let a silly secret ruin such a lovely date.

157
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,102
既然没什么好回避的
If there's an elephant in the room

158
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,136
我干脆告诉你得了
Why don't we just remove it?

159
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,471
德瑞克•基特
I dated derek jeter.

160
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,471
{\a6}德瑞克•基特 纽约洋基队队长

161
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,072
有图可作证的
Here's a picture that'll prove it.

162
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:02,308
泰德小眼屏幕瞟 事出反常必有妖
As ted looked at that cell phone pic,

163
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,076
大石两块落心底
There were two things he reckoned.

164
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,078
确为约会能有炮
This definitely was a date,

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,648
此女却非常人消
But there wouldn't be a second.

166
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,950
睁眼看 效果显
See? It worked.

167
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,985
老爸押韵词款款 送我小宝梦甜甜
I said some rhymes, and out my boy did conk.

168
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,321
路漫漫 心安安
Now let's enjoy the ride.

169
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,124
会开车不 傻逼
Move, jackass!

170
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,432
可悲峰转又路回 重做新词再入睡
Okay, I need a brand-new tale to silence marvin's chatter.

171
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,435
才送清风歌一曲 轻渡舟楫君难为
I don't know, that last one had some sketchy subject matter.

172
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,572
言直情真君莫怪 吞云吐雾实不该
Forgive me, but before you got here, did you smoke a joint?

173
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,941
淼淼烟熏儿难耐
You don't tell kids a tale that crass!

174
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,776
老爸手指轻点赞
I guess he had a point.

175
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:37,011
老父此事也了然
I know, I said some things that were,

176
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,147
如君语 狭媚之事不宜言
As you say, kind of questionable.

177
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,215
肺腑之言 马文是小男
The truth is, children marvin's age

178
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:43,017
尚且年幼记忆浅
Aren't really that impressionable.

179
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,453
如你我 也枉然
Do you remember anything from when you were this small?

180
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:48,556
小时多健忘 唯不忘相思 恰如我小时 唯记南瓜拾
Pumpkin picking at age three is the first thing I recall.

181
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:49,891
嗯哼
Hmm. Huh.

182
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,192
此时确难记 我同意
He won't remember this. I guess it's true.

183
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:52,460
如我心意
It better be.

184
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,728
否则他日需求医 
Or else we'll end up paying

185
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,363
有道是 多花米
Through the nose for marvin's therapy.

186
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,232
你我二人多戏谑 在下周公尚有约
Okay, buddy, nice chat, but I think I need a break.

187
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,200
正解
Great idea.

188
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,335
此事尚未完
After this story!

189
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,037
罗宾蛋糕盘
Robin takes the cake.

190
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,378
吃相略难堪
Once in an east side bakery,

191
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,381
众人围观围一团
Your debonair aunt robin was making other customers think,

192
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:15,383
谁家有女难嫁汉
"Geez, who let this slob in?"

193
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,319
云淡风轻爱看看 罗宾猛塞才不管
She didn't care about their stares, or who was looking on.

194
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,754
落花流水谁无意
She'd just broke up with...

195
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,022
凯文
Kevin.

196
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,491
不对 是盖尔 还是史酷比
No, gael. Or scooby?

197
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,427
还是唐
Don?

198
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,229
若说罗宾吃相赞
Now, sometimes,

199
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,564
遥看瀑布挂前川
When it rains it pours,

200
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:30,898
已惊岩下雪如尘
And sometimes, it starts snowing,

201
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,401
大珠小珠落玉盘
For as cream filling hit her shirt...

202
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:34,836
好久不见
Hey, robin, how's it going?

203
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,771
罗宾抬头定睛看 正是西蒙混帐男
'twas simon, her ex-boyfriend

204
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,240
此君来自加拿大 青梅竹马有前缘
From her younger days in canada,

205
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,775
士别三日刮目看 此刻西蒙
But now, he looked quite different...

206
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:43,377
呃
Um...

207
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,612
押韵
Rhyme.

208
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,215
呃 我想想
Uh... Thinking. Uh...

209
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,617
刚刚我文思泉涌停不下来啊
I've just been handed a news flash.

210
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,219
"加拿大"这个词不押韵啊
The word "Canada" is unrhymeable.

211
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,854
随便说上一句话
It's easier to-- I don't know--

212
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,789
喝醉酒骑头牛都比押韵简单啊
get drunk and try to climb a bull.

213
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,258
但是加拿大 哎呀 芸芸众生你随便问吧
But canada, damn it, ask any man on the planet

214
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,593
你且看他结结巴巴
and watch their stammerin' stamina

215
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,295
想方设法把"加拿大"塞进他的话
as they clamor and cram it into the middle of a sentence.

216
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:02,797
但他就是不得其法
For a shot at repentance,

217
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,233
再悔恨也没办法 只能将此难题留给后人解答
pass the problem on to all their non-rhyming descendants.

218
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,535
我至今都没见过谁能把韵脚押上"加拿大"
I've never met anyone who could clean up after Canada,

219
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,370
但我那家住布朗克斯的叔叔托尼做到啦
except my uncle tony from the bronx.

220
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,371
他只是个门卫哪
He's a janitor.

221
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,278
臭显摆
Show-off.

222
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
西蒙 见到你真高兴
Simon. Nice to see you.

223
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:21,415
你来纽约干嘛啊
So, what brings you to New York?

224
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,817
-我搬到纽约来了  -是吗 真的啊
-I live here now. -What? Really?

225
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,285
-是呢  -真好
-Yeah. -That's great.

226
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,920
能给我把叉子吗
Can I get a fork?

227
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,421
尽管西蒙终日游手好闲
He'd always been a deadbeat

228
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,157
不修边幅 说话办事不着边
and your classic hoser phony.

229
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,126
可罗宾眼见今日的西蒙衣着光鲜不似从前 心中顿生许多愁念
But seeing simon all cleaned up hit robin like a zamboni.

230
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,295
她将他仔仔细细上下打量
And as she looked him up and down,

231
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,630
罗宾年轻的心不禁一阵悲伤
young robin felt a tingle.

232
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,465
西蒙是否终于脱胎换骨
Had simon blossomed finally?

233
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,400
若果真如此 我和他又能否将破镜修补
And if so, was he single?

234
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,002
真是太好了
So great.

235
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,271
她柔声细语身姿婀娜 媚眼狂送秋波
She purred, whilst batting her eyelashes like a flooze.

236
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,406
是很好 我跟露易丝•马什订婚了
Yup, I'm engaged to Louise Marsh,

237
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,275
我们家里有超豪华按摩浴缸呢
and our pad's got a jacuzz!

238
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,477
糕点店瞬间天旋地转 罗宾好似走在云端
The bakery spinned, the floor dropped out.

239
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,245
空气都被冻结 充满不安
The air was thick as syrup.

240
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,247
罗宾只觉头晕目眩 呼吸困难
Poor robin swooned, she couldn't breathe.

241
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,116
泪水即将决堤
Her eyes began to tear up.

242
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,118
正当她欲鼓起勇气逃离此地
And as she tried to stammer some excuse

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,853
西蒙一语 让她跌到谷底
to get away, simon said:

244
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,322
我们的结婚蛋糕是不是超级牛逼
Our wedding cake is pretty bitchin', eh?

245
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:04,759
此时 罗宾心中腾升起无限恨意
And so was born the worst idea poor robin's ever had.

246
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,295
门扉轻叩 泰德应门
And on ted's door there came a rapping.

247
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,363
我干了件非常不好的事
I did something bad.

248
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,965
罗宾将事件原委一一道来
As robin told her tale,

249
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,100
泰德便知 她犯了何等严重的错误
Ted knew she'd made a massive boo-boo,

250
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:17,305
因为偷拿别人的结婚蛋糕是多么地无可饶恕
for stealing someone's wedding cake is terribly bad juju.

251
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,807
罗宾 你变成现在这样 我真是看不下去
Robin, I'm beside myself to see what you've become!

252
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,676
你必须马上把蛋糕还回去
You must return this cake at once!

253
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:22,677
-我做不到  -怎么做不到
-I can't! -Why not?

254
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,045
因为...
'cause...

255
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,513
好吃
Yum.

256
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:29,650
泰德无语叹息 他从未见过比这更恶毒的行为
Ted gasped, for he had never seen a brazen act so vicious.

257
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,452
罗宾虽然懊悔 但是...
Robin felt remorse, and yet...

258
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,621
我的天 太好吃了我停不下嘴
Oh, god, this is delicious!

259
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,325
于是一生二 二生三 三生无穷 罗宾已经吃了17口蛋糕
So one piece led to two, then three, then five, then 17.

260
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:41,462
她就像只饥肠辘辘的狼人 蛋糕在她口里被瓦解掉
She savaged that poor cake like some rapacious wolverine.

261
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:44,465
她吃 她吞 她咬 她嚼 一个疯狂的晚上就此来到
Eating, gobbling, munching, so the frenzied night wore on.

262
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,367
妈妈尚未赶到
And by the time your mom arrived,

263
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,302
已经没了一半蛋糕
the cake was halfway gone.

264
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,004
我收到消息立刻就过来了
I came as soon as I got word.

265
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,806
情况有多糟糕
So how bad is the damage?

266
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:56,010
你自己看吧 她正在上演"疯狂的食道"
See for yourself the product of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

267
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,211
我已经吃了半个蛋糕了吗
Half a cake?

268
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,679
我都干了什么啊
What have I done?!

269
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,848
我的行为不会被世人原谅
The world shall not forgive it!

270
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,516
这罪恶的一天将永远留在耻辱柱上
This day will live in infamy.

271
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,752
我一生都不能摆脱这个罪状
I never shall outlive it!

272
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,254
我已堕落至此
For I have become

273
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:09,357
我化悲愤为食量 一口一口吃掉忧伤
the girl that eats her feelings, don't mistake it.

274
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,526
在我坐坏这把椅子之前 我最好还是立刻离场
I think I need to get out of this chair before I break it.

275
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,229
瞎说 瞎想 别乱讲
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

276
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,898
你妈妈的热心一如既往
Said mommy, with great fervor.

277
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,700
你不能现在停下 难道你不明白吗
You can't stop now, for don't you see?

278
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,537
对不知情的人来讲 你并非什么青春疼痛文学里
To the uninformed observer, you're not some sad cliche,

279
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,741
满心伤痛的怨女
some loser from a chick-lit story.

280
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:30,444
你是罗宾 吃完剩下的半个蛋糕 荣誉就属于你
You're robin, and you're half a wedding cake away from glory!

281
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,281
你要是现在停下 那西蒙就是赢家
If you quit now, then simon wins.

282
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,349
而故事的结局就是
The tale comes to a stop

283
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,885
罗宾偶遇旧爱 惊慌失措
at how you saw an ex, freaked out,

284
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,553
还偷了糕点 犯下过错
and robbed a pastry shop.

285
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,223
你要是狠狠心 亲爱的
If you have the guts, my dear,

286
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,358
现在就是时候火力全开
it's time to get empowered

287
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
把蛋糕吃光
and be remembered for this

288
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,397
让你的英名千古流芳
sweet behemoth you devoured.

289
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,464
多年以后
And years from now,

290
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:53,467
游吟诗人会为你作诗吟唱
the troubadour will raise his voice and sing

291
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:56,404
歌颂罗宾是如何偷拿蛋糕
of the time that robin took the cake.

292
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,272
并且把这东西
and ate the whole...

293
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,573
吃了个
damned...

294
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,242
精光
thing.

295
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,711
罗宾再一次深深深呼吸
Once more into the breach she surged,

296
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:05,313
泰德和妈妈给她加油打气
as ted and mommy cheered

297
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:09,250
一口又一口 那罪恶的蛋糕塔 高度越来越低
and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared.

298
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,985
有朋自远方来目睹这场战役
Some friends were called to come and watch.

299
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:12,486
无人需要多做努力
And no one had to beg,

300
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:13,821
吃蛋糕派对的声名便远播千里
it soon became a party.

301
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,890
巴尼甚至搬来了一桶酒 此乃助兴神器
Barney even got a keg.

302
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,993
左一叉右一勺 罗宾狂吃法式香草
Forkful after forkful, Robin guzzled french vanilla,

303
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,429
那动静简直就像是猩猩般狂躁
making noises not unlike those made by a gorilla.

304
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,297
加油啊 罗宾 吃了它
Come on, Robin, finish it.

305
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,967
你妈妈的谆谆教诲回荡在罗宾的耳旁
Mom's exhortations rang

306
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:29,503
就像阿波罗在洛基对战克鲁伯•朗时一直在旁指导一样
like Apollo coaching Rocky 'gainst a frosted clubber lang.

307
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,238
啊 «洛基4» 我的最爱
Oh, Rocky iv, my favorite.

308
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,807
不对 第四部是跟俄国人打的
No, no, iv is with the russians.

309
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,642
不对 第四部是洛基因为脑震荡
No, iv's the one where he talks weird

310
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,277
整个人说话都怪怪的
because of his concussions.

311
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,611
-他好像在每部电影里都那样  -打住
-I think that's all of them. -Hey now,

312
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,448
不要争了 就是第四部
no need to be discordant. It's rocky iv.

313
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,183
-不 是第三部  -错 是第二部
-No, iii. -No, ii.

314
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,151
管它哪部不哪部
It's really not important.

315
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:47,922
最后时分人共鉴 最后一块举嘴边
At last young Robin raised the final bite up to her lips.

316
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,323
人群顿时寂无言
The crowd grew still.

317
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,827
只闻巴尼吃薯片
The only sound was barney eating chips.

318
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,330
蛋糕剩最后一口
Just one bite left.

319
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,333
这一幕就如«铁窗喋血»中的硬汉老卢
Hey, this is like that scene from cool hand luke. 

320
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,369
五十鸡蛋轻轻松松吃下肚  
You know, "My boy can eat 50 eggs." Right?

321
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,204
分分钟都要吐
She's gonna puke.

322
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,506
但罗宾没有吐
But robin did not puke.

323
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,641
她吃完那口直立而起 面带骄傲
She ate that bite and stood up, proud.

324
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:13,314
等下 我还没完呢
Wait. I'm not done yet.

325
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,149
对着惊魂未定的人群 大声嘶喊道
She shouted, to the startled crowd.

326
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,951
我秒杀了这个婚礼蛋糕
I've bested this here wedding cake.

327
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,652
我非常乐意获此荣耀
I'll gladly wear that crown.

328
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,820
既然挑战已经做到
But now that I have done that task,

329
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,356
那也是时候将它冲刷掉
It's time to wash it down.

330
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,458
今晚实在太美好
For it's been such an awesome night,

331
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,028
只有一个办法画上句号
There's just one way to cap it.

332
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,296
我要把这桶酒全都喝掉
I'm going to drink this entire keg.

333
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,299
巴尼 把酒开好
Okay, barney, tap it.

334
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,467
哦 哇噢
Oh! Wow.

335
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,405
嘿咻 嘿咻
Hup. Ho-o, oh.

336
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,875
当晚大家记住的 不再是罗宾被抛弃
And now that night's remembered not for robin getting dumped

337
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:44,111
而是我们送她去洗胃的记忆
But as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.

338
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,313
快看啊
And look at that,

339
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,716
小天使睡过去了 大家
The little angel's sleeping soundly, gus.

340
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,251
看起来我们的问题像是...
Looks like our problems...

341
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:51,252
别一车占俩道
Pick a lane!

342
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,923
我恨这巴士恨到家
I hate this stupid bus.

343
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:01,996
马尔文 恐怕今晚要彻底沦陷
Marvin, I'm afraid this night is not much of a winner.

344
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:05,733
我们堵在半路 还得错过整个预演晚宴
Stuck in traffic, now we've missed the whole rehearsal dinner.

345
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,702
我希望我是对的 你对这段事情没有记忆
I pray that I was right and that you'll have no memory

346
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,939
{\a6}LIE即Long Island Expressway 

347
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,939
地狱般的长岛高速乘车记
Of this godforsaken ride down the congested LIE.

348
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,075
至少有一点我能肯定
At least we know one thing for sure:

349
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,776
今天也不可能更倒霉了吧 想必
Things can't get worse, I swear.

350
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,379
永别了 堵死马桶的卷饼 爽啊
Adios, truck stop burrito. Ooh!

351
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,014
洗手间别去
Do not go in there.

352
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:24,185
好吧 再给你说一个 我试着好好讲
Okay, one more story, and I'll try to tell it pretty.

353
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,220
巴尼•斯丁森的传说
The tale of barney stinson,

354
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,022
纽约城花花公子之大帝
Player king of new york city.

355
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,450
很久以前 我们去酒吧怡情小酌
Once upon a time, we all went out to get our drink on.

356
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,185
此时进来了一个女孩
When who should walk in but a girl

357
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,588
粉色毛衣紧身惹火
With sweater tight and pink on.

358
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,789
她点了一杯啤酒
She ordered up a beer.

359
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,591
想必你也已经知道结局
I think you see where this is going.

360
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,793
如同巴尼意味深长的一句
As barney put it, oh so eloquently:

361
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,628
遇玉欲御
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

362
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,065
他起身走向女孩准备下手
He rose to go approach this girl commanding such intrigue

363
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,566
你妈妈突然打断说
When mommy interrupted:

364
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,735
哥们 你完全不是她的对手
Dude, she's way out of your league.

365
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:58,639
{\a6}美国Hooters餐厅 小孩子去了一定把持不住

366
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:58,639
她没穿小热裤 也没套挤胸衣
She's not in daisy dukes, nor squeezed into a hooters tee.

367
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:02,143
而且她钥匙链上也没挂什么健身VIP
And I don't see a curves membership dangling from her key.

368
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,244
她不用古铜喷雾
She has no glaring spray tan,

369
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,614
也没纹独角兽
no unicorn tattoos.

370
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:10,818
她在品啜夏敦埃 没在猛灌樱桃味酒
She's sipping chardonnay, not pounding cherry-flavored booze.

371
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,821
她没花枝招展 也没在拨弄头发
Her makeup isn't running, she's not playing with her hair.

372
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:16,924
她几乎不可能让你把那家伙放进那
There's very little chance she'll let you put it anywhere.

373
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,993
我接受你的挑战 莉莉
Your challenge is accepted, lil.

374
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,995
不存在小妞太过漂亮
There is no girl too pretty,

375
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,964
因为我是巴尼•斯丁森
For I am barney stinson,

376
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,266
纽约城花花公子之大帝
Player king of new york city.

377
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:27,735
你不能自封为帝
You can't anoint yourself the king,

378
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:29,670
就像那个混蛋 勒布朗
Just like that jerk, lebron.

379
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,939
他都离开骑士队三年了
He left the cavs three years ago.

380
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:33,607
兄弟 放下吧 忘掉过往
Bro, give it up, move on.

381
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:36,243
所以 为什么我是大帝 问得好
So why am I king? Glad you asked.

382
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:37,111
-我们没有  -从没问过
-We didn't. -Never do.

383
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:39,246
我要讲述这一切的源头
It's origin story time.

384
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,949
相信我 字字是真不会错
And trust me, every word is true.

385
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,286
很早之前的清晨 我从一个猎物身边醒来
One morning long ago, I woke up next to a conquest.

386
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,521
如此多的闪光 她的咪咪
So many great things 'bout this girl: Her boobs,

387
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:50,191
她的胸部 她的大奶
Her rack, her chest.

388
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,993
她饥渴难耐
She had a thirst for action,

389
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,095
年轻的巴尼填满了她欲壑
And young Barney was a-quenchin' it.

390
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:55,296
这和剧情有关吗
Is this important to the story?

391
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:57,198
没啊 顺便一提图个乐
No, just thought I'd mention it.

392
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,534
当我甩掉大波辣妹 正要离开
As I departed, having bid this busty babe buh-bye,

393
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,503
我驻足观望 不禁疑惑起来
I stopped and looked around, and wondered:

394
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,100
妈现在在哪儿
Where the hell am I?

395
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,507
路牌写着22街 疑惑瞬间拜拜
The sign read 22nd street, and my concern decreased

396
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:11,012
直到阴风将树枝吹向一旁 露出"东"字牌
Until a cold wind blew a branch aside, Revealing: "East."

397
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:13,347
在东边 不要啊
The east side. No.

398
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:14,682
我都做了些什么
Wh-what have I done?

399
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,050
我结结巴巴的说着
I stammered with chagrin.

400
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,952
接下来一个黑色的轿车停在我面前 
Just then a black sedan pulled up...

401
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,520
-你是巴尼  -是
-You barney? -Yeah.

402
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:21,155
上车
Get in.

403
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:22,323
有一句真的吗
Is any of this true?

404
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:25,493
当然 现在 坐稳了朋友们
Of course. Now, hang on to your "Chayers."

405
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:28,029
那一天我被召至
For that day I was called before...

406
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,498
花花公子最高议会

407
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,035
先生们 十分感谢大家的出席
Gentlemen, for your attendance here, our deepest thanks.

408
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:38,072
我很遗憾地说 议会的队伍中混入了偷猎者的踪迹
I'm sad to say, this council has a poacher in its ranks.

409
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:39,673
这位巴尼
For barney here

410
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:41,909
泡了一个他领土之外的美女

411
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:42,910
东区
The east side

412
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,512
是燕尾服查理的领地
Is tuxedo charlie's turf.

413
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,679
他生气了呢
He's mad.

414
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,214
真实的故事
True story.

415
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,651
2004年的协议清楚地规定
The agreement of 2004 quite clearly did define

416
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,721
第五大道是我们猎场的分界线
Fifth avenue to be our hunting grounds' dividing line.

417
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:58,159
你西区里的学生妹我毫不染指
Your west side college girls are not the slip I park my boat in.

418
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,560
所以你应当知道
So you should know

419
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:03,497
我东区里初涉世事的少女对你严格禁止
My east side debutantes are quite verboten.

420
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,599
议会成员们
members of the council...

421
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,269
兄弟们... 谁都不希望硝烟四起
Bros... Nobody wants a war.

422
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,439
我当然没有忘记04年的协议
Of course I've not forgotten the agreement of '04.

423
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,207
但我能说什么呢 一次失足而已
What can I say? A bonehead move.

424
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,076
为此申辩吗 我无能为力
Defend it? I'm not able.

425
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:17,445
但是 兄弟们 我难道没有
But, bros, have I not been a bro

426
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:19,213
对在座的各位兄弟尽忠尽力
To each bro at this table?

427
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:21,215
我来自布鲁克林的小伙伴 泡菜坛•鲍勃
My friend from brooklyn, pickle jar bob,

428
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,184

429
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:24,251
记得那个年轻的游客吗
Remember that young tourist

430
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,921
寻找宾州车站的那一位
Who was looking for penn station?

431
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,690
她刚从波士顿前来 拥有魔鬼般的身材
She'd just come in from boston, had a wicked good-in-bed look.

432
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:33,694
{\a6}红钩 位于纽约布鲁克林 

433
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:33,694
我给她错误的指引 让她走向了红钩地带
I gave her bad directions and she ended up in Red Hook.

434
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,563
-闭嘴 巴尼  -悠着点 布朗克斯•多尼
-Shut up, barney. -Whoa, bronx donnie,

435
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,231
咱们不要激动着急
Let's not get excited.

436
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,601
燕尾服查理不是这里唯一一枚受害者
Tuxedo charlie's not the only one here who's been slighted.

437
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:44,071
你告诉她你是基特 好将她诱至你的床第
You told her you were Jeter in your quest to lie upon her.

438
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:44,071
{\a6}德瑞克•基特 美国职棒大联盟选手 纽约洋基队队长

439
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:46,607
假扮洋基队员是我的专利
Impersonating yankees is my thing.

440
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,242
你难道没有一点信誉
Have you no honor?

441
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,277
先生们 请安静 咱们不要把
Gentlemen, please, let's not blow

442
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,146
这缓和的关系弃之谷底

我穿着飞行员服 泡妞于行李提取处
I dress up like a pilot and meet girls in baggage claim.

450
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:06,994
在我那从61街和伍德赛德启程的漫长地铁里
And on my long-ass subway ride from 61st and Woodside,

451
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:10,131
我想到了让大家和睦相处的妙计
I came up with a plan to keep you on each other's good side.

452
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,466
巴尼 你委屈了这两位兄弟
Barney, you have wronged these two.

453
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:13,934
对于这个他们快输了的游戏
So, for the game they're losing,

454
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,070
你必须为其每人提供
you now must grant them each

455
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,572
一个他们喜欢的西区美女
A west side hottie of their choosing.

456
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:19,640
开什么玩笑你
You're kidding.

457
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,008
这就是最后决议
That's the settlement?

458
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,377
别这样 这也太过傻比
Come on, that's rather silly. 

459
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,145
先生们 你们怎么说
Gentlemen, what say you?

460
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,146

00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:28,015
搞笑呢 布朗克斯•多尼
Please. Bronx donnie?

463
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:30,417
想与我同床根本没戏
No chance he could get me in the sack.

464
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,287
告诉那个黑手党 有地儿让他抽人去
Tell that mafioso I know something he can whack.

465
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,855

你们的淑女之腿可放心紧闭

因为幸运的是 我的提案 他们最终满意

Well, gentlemen,

469
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:44,298
看样子我多说无益
It seems there's nothing I can say to sway you.

470
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,766
查理 多尼

471
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,535
废话少说 我会补偿于你

00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,870
卡洛塔 上香槟

好吧 挺好的

00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,217
你的小故事戳中了我们的笑点
Your little story tickled all our ribs.

485
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,152
但你犯了一个错误 先生
But one mistake you made, sir,

486
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,554
那就是忘了预定在先
Was forgetting to call dibs.

487
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,656
不 这不公平
No! Not fair.

488
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,391
我才是玩家大帝
But I'm the king.

489
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:47,027
-打扮也帅得多  -不好意思啊兄弟

491
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:51,232
丽萨教授事件的报复

492
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,034
再喝一轮吧
Let's have another round.

493
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:55,202
你妈妈说道
Your mommy said.

494
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,004
我们又喝了几许
And so we had one.

495
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,839
夜晚还在继续 我必须要说
The night wore on, and I must say,

496
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,874
这是个不错的经历
It wasn't a half bad one.

497
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:03,177
如此的回忆 我们年轻快乐的心

火焰般热情
Were hot as fire.

499
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,916
那些日子仿佛发生在上个世纪
Feels like a lifetime since those days.

500
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:12,720
抱歉同志们
Sorry, folks,

501
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:14,121
爆胎了
Flat tire.

502
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:15,689
哦 别这样啊
oh, come on.

503
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:18,058
这下我再也到不了南塔克特岛了
Now I'm never gonna make it to nantucket.

504
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:27,968
看 烟花在空中绽放
Oh, look a fireworks display.

505
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,403
小火箭发出耀眼红光
Some rockets red glare action.

506
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:30,771
谢天谢地
Thank god.

507
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:34,275
我还以为是我青光眼滴眼液的作用呢
Thought my glaucoma drops were causing a reaction.

508
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:38,379
马尔文 抱歉整个旅行像屎一样
Marvin, I'm so sorry this whole journey's been a bummer.

509
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:43,617
很快你就能回到妈咪的怀抱 温暖如夏日阳光
Soon you'll be right back in mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

510
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,087
不幸的是 当我们登记入住酒店的那刻开始
But sadly while your troubles stop once we get to the inn

511
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,457
你的烦恼烟消云散 而我的麻烦却刚刚开场
The moment we arrive is when my troubles will begin.

512
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,993
有时爸爸做事荒唐
Sometimes daddies screw up,

513
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,829
有时妈妈脾气暴涨
Sometimes mommies get upset.

514
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:59,266
但我真心希望这个周末的记忆 能让你快快遗忘
I really hope this weekend is a memory you'll forget.

515
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:02,970
快抬起头吧 看看烟花绽放 余烬飞扬
So look up at those fireworks, enjoy the falling embers...

516
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:09,710
孩子们 这就是你们马尔文哥哥记忆中的第一件事
And that, kids, is the very first thing your cousin marvin remembers.

517
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,983
女士们先生们 还有一个小时...
Gentlemen and ladies, it'll be an hour or so...

518
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:19,620
卡车就能来到这儿牵引大巴了
before the truck gets here to give our broken bus a tow.

519
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:23,190
与此同时呢 我们还是轻松惬意点吧
So in the meantime I suggest we all get nice and cozy.

520
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,759
我们还得在这待会儿
We're gonna be here for a while.

521
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,930
{\a6}英语儿歌 同时也是一种儿童玩的游戏

522
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,930
围着玫瑰绕圈圈吗
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

523
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,965
好啊
Yeah!

524
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,102
你觉得这儿离远汉普顿旅馆有多远呢
How far do you suppose it is to the farhampton inn?

525
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,104
我觉得还有五英里吧
I'd say about five miles away.

526
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,972
不要啊
Oh, no.

527
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:40,541
你奸笑是什么意思呢
What's with the grin?

528
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,509
然后马修仰望天空
Then Marshall looked up heavenward,

529
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,545
以夜空中第一颗星为名庄严发誓
And swore by night's first star

530
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,947
说出了他马上就会后悔的五个字
Five simple words he'd soon regret:

531
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,015
我能走到那
I can walk that far.

532
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,015
