73
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,030

81
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wouldn't be so sure.

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was an accident, I swear.

83
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Been there, done that. Several times.

84
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I guess he will be taking care of us now?

85
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll take frankly foster of five hundred please- outs.

86

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

87
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, I took care of my cat... until it ran away.

88
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin', I think he just wanted his space.

89
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I still see him around neighbourhood.

90
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, he like hisses and claws at me. but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

91
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously. 'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

92
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gone?

93
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not gone, not gone gone. He is not dead. He's very much alive.

94
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

95
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing. I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

96
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We supposed to know that you there, that's the whole idea.

97
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just... I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

98
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean that.

99
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, let's do this.

100
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, boy!

101

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

102
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The important thing is...we're all still alive.

103
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will help Dave to come faster.

104
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It needs just a touch more glitter.

105
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That should do it. Who's hungry?

106
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Uh, uh me, me! - Let's eat.

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,660

108
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

109
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, the cheese balls are in the heat house.

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, what are you doing in here?

112
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,950

113
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

114
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alvin, I really need to focus, right now because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

115
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can we play as well?

116
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but else you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

117
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We can play monopoly.

118
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

119
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That sounds funny. We should do that sometime right.

120
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, I got to back and floatin' like a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

121
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

122
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

123
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna puke.

124
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you know what Dave would say if he were here right now?

125
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I think it means to come more from the belly.

126
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get together. Be cool.

127
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Helllooooo? - Boys, it's me.

128
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dave? Dave?

129
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, I guess since you've answered the phone, you haven't burned down the house yet.

130
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Have a little faith, Dave. - Yes.

131
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mayday!

132
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What was that? - Don't stress him out.

133
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie. - Yeah, she's making us a tasty five- course meal.

134
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really? Can I talk to her?

135
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's practising her pole dancing.

136
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pole dancing? But, what happened with making dinner. Guys, what's going on?

137
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Gotta go, Dave. - Alvin, I'm not kidding!

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!! - Get better! - Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

139
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yep, nobody does that better than him.

140
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Toby, Toby wake up.

141
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sorry. - No, that's okay. What is it?

142
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I had a nightmare. - Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

143
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was it?

144
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

145
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Theodore, that couldn't happen. No, you guys are tight.

146
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nothing could ever separate you.

147
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw- caaaw!

148
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Which couldn't happen ever. Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

149
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

150
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweet dreams.

151
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Toby, make it stop. - What are you doing?

152
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There is something wrong with the clock. It won't shut up.

153
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't sleep.

154
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's the point. It's an alarm clock.

155
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It helps you wake up early in the morning.

156
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why anyone wanna wake up early?

157
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}For the school, you got to be there by eight.

158
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- In the morning? - Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

159
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But we are in this together, Alvin. Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

160
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school? - No, no, no.

161
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've done my time making very much.

162
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- But school is fun, right? - Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun- ish..

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We got it. This got to be a walk in the park.

169
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm frightening.

173
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,820

174
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You must be our new students. I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

175

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

177

179
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There was a minute left and we were down by two...

180
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken, put me in, I can win this...

181
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I never get tired of that story.

182
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

183
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did I mention my leg was broken?

188
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Enchantre... mademoiselle.

195
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

196
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That should be pretty easy, really. They are only eight inches tall.

197
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I had 15 cars. I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.

198
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I had seven maids. Courtside seats to the Lakers.

199
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

200
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, look at me.

201
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look at me. I lost everything.

202
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Except for my dignity, they can't take that away from me.

203
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And it's all because of them.

204
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, hey...crackers.

205
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now run around, hoping and praying that I could find other animals that can...

206
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}sing or dance.

207
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

208
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, hey that's my muffin. Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

209
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,610

210
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girls, we have to get out of here.

211
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't see.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Move your ass. - Ok. Stop pushing me.

214
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We made it. - Jets Records! - Phew!

215
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my gosh. It's him! Ian Hawke!

216
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mr Hawke?

217
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

218
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, Mr Hawke?

219
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That not in my head, that's really happening.

220
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What do you want? - We want to introduce ourselves.

221
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's right. I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

222
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

223
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I'm their sister Jeanette. Although I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes...

224
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

225
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We will be just so honored to have you to represent us.

226
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

227
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We wanna be stars too, yeah!

228
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

229
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly about this, just tell me one thing...

230
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can sing, right?

231
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hang on, not here.

232
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why not we take this meeting upstairs in my penthouse office?

233
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is so exciting.

234
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

235
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My first penthouse office!

236
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

237
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought you might like the view!

238
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

239
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We grew up in a small town, population 300 and...

240
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really? That's fascinating. Great!

241
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, impress me!

242
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One, two, three.

243
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Three little birds, sat on my window

244
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And they told me I don't need to worry.

245
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song

246
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You go ahead, let your hair down

247
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,

248
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just go ahead, let your hair down.

249
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girls, girls, girls.

250
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guess who just became the number one Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

251
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ian Hawke. Ian Hawke.

252
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

253
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's an excellent question and the excellent answer is...

254
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

255
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, no. Wha- what happened? - Oh, classic tale.

256
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sweet and innocent when I met them, they had nothing...and then I work my butt of

257
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to make them rock stars and...

258
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They changed. Turned out to be like bad cheese.

259
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No. - That's terrible.

260
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

261
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And he just goes and spits on me.

262
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Literally. He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva and just had at it.

263
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't even get me started about Simon. - But not Theodore, right?

264
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

265
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon? They are over, fired, nobledeute (noble death)...

266
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

267
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But...

268
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin'... Fasten your seat belts!

269
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said: Jay, where is Beyonce?

270
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And he says: She's holding a plate full of cheese balls, turn around...

271
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And guess what..

272
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- She was. - PS, Dave left me in charge.

273
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We stay up to ten every night.

274
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look what I can do.

275
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're Theadorable.

276
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I am so sorry. - That's cool. No harm done.

277
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not yet. Girls, please, private conference.

278
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

279
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen up, rock stars.

280
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you talk to those girls again you're dead.

281
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you look at those girls again you're dead.

282
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you even think about those girls...

283
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Are you thinking about them? - Well, I am now.

284
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's it. - You are dead!

285
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

286
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Scatter!

287
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That way. Over there! - I'm runin'.

288
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

289
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You are dead! - Not!

290
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's stretching time!

291
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, boy.

292
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Eagle.

293
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Eagle! Eagle! - Get him.

294
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Move! Move! - This way.

295
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Gotcha. - Wait, wait, come up...

296
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's swirley time. - C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

297
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please, please!

298
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's a good look for you! - Thank you.

299
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I can't swim. Help. - Grab on Simon!

300
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You okay?

301
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, uh, considering that you just saved me from drowning in a toilet...

302
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm, uh, pretty good.

303
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be right back.

304
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alvin, Alvin! Alvin, Alvin! We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

305
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's the fatty ratty. - Cut it out!

306
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- This rat has serious junk in the trunk. - Yeah, little fatty.

307
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

308
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Theodore, your butt looks fine. Those guys are just some jerks.

309
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You threatened to climb inside of him and build a nest.

310
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was out of line and not even sure that is physically impossible.

311
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I should suspend all three of you. - Please do.

312
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Instead I have the better idea.

313
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Due to budget cutbacks, we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

314
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's awful. - I know.

315
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But, there is one small ray of hope.

316
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

317
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

318
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If we win, we can save our program.

319
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And you want us to perform?

320
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I begin to think that you are a fan?

481
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,650

534
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let us vote.

535
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

536
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, here is what I'm going to do.

537
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This friday, each group will perform one song in front of the student body.

538
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whoever gets the most applause, well, will represent the school.

539
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

540
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you. We made it.

541
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

542
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The Meerkats huddle together, at the end of a dramatic day...

543
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:57,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}to reaffirm their family bond.

544
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The whiskers are going to have to rely on each other more than ever.

545
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, I'm so happy that Mrs Ortega can rehearsal with us every day after school.

546
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wow! Every day? - Stop right there, ok!

547
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We are the team, we need you.

548
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would you relax? We are not going to lose.

549
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll talk about this in the morning.

550
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not much to talk about. I will see you at the rehearsal.

551
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Stop huggin'. - I am not huggin'.

552
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You might as well be really obstacles in the face countryside because you are in fact huggin'.

553
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm not. - I saw, and saw...

554
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think I will sleep in my own bed tonight.

555
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know for me, I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat.

556
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, really? And why is that? - I would never hug with you!

557
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Toby, can I sleep with you?

558
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What? - Be kind to me.

559
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My brothers are fighting.

560
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? Geeeee... ok.

561
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Man, Dutch Oven!

562
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Anything but the Dutch Oven! I can breath! Not the Dutch Oven!

563
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's to late! It burns! It burns!

564
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

565
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How about a side order of friendly advice, courtesy of me?

566
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, thanks.

567
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Grapes, please.

568
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:22,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Heh, heh. Excuse me. Ahem. So, uh, well, I, I, I just wanted to warn you... about Ian.

569
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

570
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You should be grateful to him. He did everything for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

571
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hmm,really. How do I put this gently!

572
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's the devil, he doesn't have a heart,

573
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and one of the things he did for us was put us in a cage!

574
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Oh, Alvin, he would never do that. - Yeah, guess, you were there, I forgot...

575
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You, you'd better watch out. - I don't need any advice from you.

576
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- But... - But, nothing, Alvin! Ian's taking us straight to the tooooooopppp!

577
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right, straight to the top. I got it.

578
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

579
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hah, hah we are, so, going to destroy those Chipmunks!

580
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I don't want to destroy them. - Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

581
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right, look. If you feel that way...

582
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest. - What?!

583
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you back to whatever tree you came from.

584
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sounds good? Ok then. Take room from the top. Let's go!

585
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wow, wow stop. Short one in a green dress...

586
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Eleanor. - what's your name again? - Eleanor.

587
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, look. I'm losin' you there, you know. Have you always been that short?

588
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I guess. - You've got to work on that.

589
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

590
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Brittany, here. Come up here. No, you two stay back.

591
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A little further.

592
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, yeah! Now that I like!

593
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's not just because Brittany is more than mega- ultra superstar than you guys.

594
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good, good. Ok, you know what, let's get a little more separation. Brittany, stay there.

595
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get a little more separation from you guys. Give her some room! Give her some room, guys.

596

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}All right. Watch me now.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Toby? - Hello? - Toby?

599
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing in the house? Where is Aunt Jacky?

600
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:39,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dave, hey Dave, what's happenin'?

601
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,750

602
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I am a little worried. Who's watcin' the boys?

605
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Absolutely. They've been just pitchy.

606
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Toby, what's going on? - Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

607
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, I know that you're not suppose to be stress down.

608

743
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alvin! Don't worry, Simon, Alvin will walk through that door any minute now. Alvin!

744
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm back.

745
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Thank you so much. Thank you. - Well done, ladies.

746
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And now, let teared for the group that will rock you like a hurricane.

747
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}At least that is what many of you students have told me.

748
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Here they are...the Chipmunks.

749
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in the word "team", and they are right.

750
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But,you know where is "IN"? Alvin.

751
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Such to be you. Girls!

752
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sadly, he's correct.

753
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Did you find him? - Guys, sorry, I searched the whole perimeter.

754
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I don't know why, but the team is not back yet.

755
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What should we do?

756
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I would...

757
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I would ask someone...who's not me.

758
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know what we should do.

759
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, everyone.

760
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

761
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thing is, we never performed without Alvin..

762
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and we are not starting now.

763
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You can't have two little pigs, you can't have only two musketeers so...

764
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

765
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

766
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll take you home.

767
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You hear that, girls?

768
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That...is the sound of success.

769
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I relize how devastated you...

770
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Chipmunks' funs must be...

771
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

772
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

773
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, come on guys, let's go.

774
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Britt, we have to.

775
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's go.

776
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

777
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Life is good.

778
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Especially when you're not a loser.

779
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey guys? I'm here.

780
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys?

781
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, great.

782
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They are gone, Alvin.

783
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- They never gonna forgive me. - You know... Alvin...

784
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ian was right. You don't care about anyone except yourself.

785
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And oh, by the way, I never wanna to win this way.

786
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Simon, are you awake?

787
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

788
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I ran away from home?

789
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't look for me in the Zoo, because I'm not there.

790
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, no Theodore...

791
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello?

792
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Meerkat family?

793
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is anyone home?

794
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My name is Theodore, I like to be in your family.

795
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe they are hiding.

796
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't be afraid.

797
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are not a meerkat!

798
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Toby, you take the lions, the tigers and the bears...

799
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

800
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Nice Eagle.

801
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't move Theodore.

802
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No problem there.

803
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hang in there, hang little guy. We'll get you out from there.

804
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ok, we need a plan. And we need carefuly executed plan.

805
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

806
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Theo, watch out.

807
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, I'm Theodore...

808
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey birdy, look up in here, are you hungry? Catch this "A"?

809
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's for appetizer.

810
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's all just relax, and we talk this out, ok!

811
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

812
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

813
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's my brother.

814
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:14,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not let him know that, because I've been a such a big jerk lately.

815
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

816
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not really.

817
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got you, Alvin.

818
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Watch to the eagle.

819
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Their only mortal enemy is a piggy elephant. Luckily I speak a little habitat.

820
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think it's working.

821
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Guys, that was huge.

822
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's right.Now we are one for all and three for one?

823
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Simon, hug it out.

824
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know I'm sorry, Sy.

825
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because I'll do it.

826
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't care.

827
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Here come the lips! The makeout train leaving the station.

828
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think after all, I'll take that hug.

829
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Justine, call Ian Hawke.

830
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:41,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}310- 555- 5309. 310- 555- 5309.

831
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Morris, get me that Ian Hawke on the phone.

832
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There you are.

833
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My sweet little money makers.

834
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you remember when I told you that I would make you all big stars?

835
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:05,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears at Staples Center tonight?

836
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Am I dreamin'? oh, my gosh!

837
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, wait, we can't. We'll miss the school concert!

838
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's correct. You will miss the school contest.

839
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You are so smart, I can't never get anything being passed by you.

840
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It was never about that stupid school contest, it was always about making Brittany a star.

841
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's what you wanted, right?

842
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- well...yes. - Tonight is your big chance.

843
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's all about you, Brittany.

844
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

845
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They can sing backups, I got them some staff too.

846
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We are her sisters. - We either sing together or not at all!

847
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ok, fine. All I ever needed is the B- girl.

848
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ian, I won't do it without them.

849
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ok, fine, fine. Let's move on to Plan B.
