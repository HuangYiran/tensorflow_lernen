1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,840
我得说服你们做一件事
I have to talk all of you into doing something.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,200
我知道我们必须这样做
Something I know we need to do.

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,820
我不知道该如何开口
And I don't know how to talk about it.

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,670
你想让我们做什么
What do you want us to do?

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,780
我想让你们活下去
I want you to survive.

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,800
我们在这里撑不了多久
We're not gonna last here.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,690
行尸会成群结队地来袭
The biters, there'll be a herd of them.

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,460
它们会填满坑
They'll fill the pits,

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,140
一个叠一个
they'll crawl over one another.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,870
前赴后继  最后入侵我们的营地
There'll be enough to tear right through our camp.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,910
它们不来活人也会来
Or it'll be people.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,560
我们和外面的世界之间没有阻碍
There's nothing between us and the rest of the world.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,700
我们和他们之间毫无阻碍
Nothing between us and them.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,820
我们留在这里  就会死
We stay here, we'll die.

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,180
摧毁了我和马丁内斯所在的营地的那些人
The people who destroyed the camp I was in with Martinez...

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,950
他们住在一座监狱里
they live in a prison.

17
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,370
在34号高速公路以北
It's north off Highway 34.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,850
他们有围墙
They got walls...

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,190
栅栏
fences,

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,340
可供耕种的土地
plots of land for farming.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,300
我们可以住在那里
We could live there.

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,680
如果我们愿意从他们手上抢过来的话
If we're willing to take it from 'em.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,750
我有个计划  可以避免任何人受伤
I have a plan to do it without anyone getting hurt.

24
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,230
我抓获了他们的两个人
I captured two of them.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,280
什么
What?

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
我当时在侦查监狱
I was scouting the prison

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,830
碰上了他们  所以我把他们带回来了
and our paths crossed, so I took 'em.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,050
-你带回了他们  -他们是进监狱的钥匙
- You took them? - They're the key.

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,980
他们会帮我们不费一枪一弹夺取那座监狱
They're gonna help us take that prison without firing a shot.

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,560
我们能得到监狱  而且不必杀人
We can have it and we don't need to kill anyone.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,650
但是
But...

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,690
我们得做好杀人的准备
we need to be prepared to.

监狱里的那些人并非都是坏人
The people in this prison, not all of them are bad.

38
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,270
但大部分都是小偷
But most of them are thieves,

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,390
谋杀犯
murderers.

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,140
为什么那种人能逍遥自在
Now why should people like that have peace of mind

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,270
而我们却每天都在掩埋同伴
when we're burying our own just about every day?

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,370
那些人致我残疾
These people, they mutilated me...

43
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,260
烧了我的营地
burned my camp...

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
杀了我女儿
killed my daughter.

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,040
你看见了  我尝试过
Now you saw me-- I tried.

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,590
我尝试过去死
I tried to die.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,110
因为我不想接受  在这世界存活
'Cause I didn't want to accept that you couldn't live in this world

48
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,590
就必须杀人这一事实
without getting blood on your hands.

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,860
但我找到了你们  我不想死了
I found you people and I don't want to die.

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,190
我也不想让你们死
I don't want you to die.

51
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,420
我们得马上行动
Now we need to move-- now.

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,850
他们会发觉他们的人失踪了
They're gonna realize their people are gone

53
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,810
会为接下来的事做好准备
and they're gonna start getting ready for whatever's next.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,450
我们得攻其不备  吓到他们
We need to surprise them. Scare them.

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,850
我们会赢的
And we will win.

56
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,730
我加入
I'm in.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,310
-我加入  -我也是
- I'm in. - Me, too.

58
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,950
收拾东西  做好准备
Pack up and get ready.

59
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,740
半小时后我们定计划
We'll go over the plan in half an hour.

60
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,680
-走吧  -就这么做吧
- Come on. - Let's do it.

61
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,720
梅根在哪
Where's Megan?

62
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,790
她在拖车里看书
She's reading in the trailer.

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,810
你都听到了吗
You hear all that?

64
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,250
我说过我们不必抢另一个地方
I said we didn't have to fight for another place.

65
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,270
我知道
I know.

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,710
要杀人吗
Killing people?

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,390
不  杀谋杀犯
No. Killing killers.

68
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,550
你说过他们不全是坏人
You said they weren't all bad people.

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,090
他们和坏人在一起
Well, they're with bad people.

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,800
我也是吗
Am I?

71
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,360
我会让你活下去的
I'm gonna keep you alive.

72
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,880
我会让梅根活下去的
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,040
我唯一在乎的
The only judgment on me I care about

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,020
就是你俩是不是活着
is whether you two are still breathing.

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,130
你听到了很好
It's good that you heard,

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,960
你知道了很好
that you know.

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,440
莉莉  我爱你
Lily... I love you.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,230
我不知道你到底是谁
I don't know who you are.

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,420
你和我说过一定还有更好的地方
Hey, you told me there has to be someplace better

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,430
还叫我帮你找到它
and that I was gonna help you find it.

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,370
你了解我  莉莉
You knew me, Lily.

82
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,460
我是不会变的
It was always gonna be like this.

83
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,820
你也得收拾收拾了
You need to pack up, too.

84
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,440
-别碰我  -别动
- Don't touch me. - Stay still.

85
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,130
离我远点
Get off me.

86
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,450
你们应该吃点东西  今天将会是漫长的一天
You should eat. It's gonna be a long day.

87
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,850
没有人会伤害你们的
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

88
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,910
我可不信
I don't believe that.

89
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,450
我不在乎
Well, I don't care.

90
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,090
你就告诉我们这是怎么回事吧
Just tell us what this is.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,380
拜托了
Please.

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,050
这不是私人恩怨
It isn't personal.

93
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,170
那这是什么
Then what is it?

94
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,620
米琼恩  我想让你明白
Michonne, I want you to know...

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,230
佩妮  我的女儿
Penny, my daughter,

96
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,940
她死了  我如今意识到了这一点
she was dead. I know that now.

97
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,320
现在  我不想伤害你
Now, I don't want to hurt you.

98
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,730
我不想伤害任何人
I don't want to hurt anyone.

99
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,380
我只要监狱  就这么简单
I need the prison, that's it.

100
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,210
有一伙人的性命我得保住
There are people I need to keep alive.

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,100
你俩要帮我夺得监狱
You two are gonna help me take it.

102
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,420
不会有伤亡
No one needs to die.

103
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,650
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

104
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,170
不  你不会的
No, you won't.

105
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,810
-我会用我的...  -别说了
- I'm gonna take my-- - Stop it.

106
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,250
度假好去处

107
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,140
你想要监狱
You want the prison?

108
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,420
是的  而且我会尽可能和平地接管它
Yeah. And I'll take it as peacefully as I can.

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,920
-总督  -别那样叫我
- Governor-- - Don't call me that.

110
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,390
你的人  还有我们的人
Your people, our people,

111
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,210
我们能找到一个和平共处的办法
we can find a way to live together.

112
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,020
这些你要护着的人
These people you need to keep alive,

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,340
你爱他们吗
do you love them?

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,620
你是个好人  赫谢尔
You're a good man, Hershel.

115
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,230
比瑞克要好
A better man than Rick.

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,010
你说的每一句话  你说话的方式
Everything you've said, the way you've said it,

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,170
证明你变了  而瑞克也变了
you've changed. So has Rick.

118
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,980
我们俩永远也不可能生活在一起的
The two of us will never be able to live together.

119
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,510
米琼恩和我  我们也不可能生活在一起
Michonne and I, we'll never be able to live together.

120
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,440
-我们会找到办法的  -我已经找到了
- We'll find a way. - I found a way!

121
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,540
我很努力了
I'm trying hard.

122
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,970
我有各种各样的办法能达到目的
There's all kinds of ways I could do this.

123
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,480
而这个办法  你们能活下去  而我能...
This way, you get to live and I get to be...

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,200
你说你想尽可能和平地接管这个监狱
You say you want to take this prison as peacefully as possible.

125
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,490
那意味着为了夺得它你也不惜伤害一些人
That means you'd be willing to hurt people to get it.

126
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,050
我的女儿们在那儿
My daughters would be there.

127
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,400
你有可能伤害到她们
That's who you'd be hurting.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,090
假如你真理解有个女儿的感觉
If you understand what it's like to have a daughter,

129
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,190
那你怎么能威胁别人女儿的性命
then how can you threaten to kill someone else's?

130
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,590
因为她们不是我的女儿
Because they aren't mine.

131
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,460
我们回来前他们会安全地待在这儿
They'll be safe here until we get back.

132
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,320
行尸没办法过河
Biters can't make it across the water.

133
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,180
假如在水边很安全的话
If it's safe by the water,

134
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,820
那我们就直接找个靠水的地方啊
then let's just go someplace by the water.

135
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,890
-莉莉  -你没必要这么做
- Lily. - You don't have to do this.

136
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,360
任何安全的地方  真正安全的地方
Anyplace that's safe, really safe,

137
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,940
都已经被人占了
someone's already there.

138
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,090
为梅根想想  好吗
Think about Megan, huh?

139
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,250
我想过
I am.

140
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,440
她在这样的一个世界上会变成什么样
What's she gonna be in this world?

141
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,810
她会成为幸存者
She's gonna be alive.

142
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,930
在做泥巴馅饼呢
Making mud pies?

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,180
花生酱三明治
Peanut butter sandwiches.

144
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,470
在我走之前抱抱我怎样
How about a hug before I go?

145
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,320
我手上都是泥巴
My hands are muddy. See?

146
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,190
的确
Oh, yeah.

147
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,850
好吧  我可不想把我的外套弄脏
Well, I wouldn't want to get my coat dirty.

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,540
我把你弄得一团糟
I messed it all up.

149
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,020
没有  你让我更好了
No, you made it better.

150
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,200
我真想度个假
I could use a vacation.

151
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,470
出去散散心
Get away.

152
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,380
一个周末就好
Just for a weekend.

153
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,480
是啊
Yeah.

154
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,650
我们的周年纪念日快到了
You know, our anniversary is coming up.

155
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,530
是吗
It is?

156
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,950
就这几天
One of these days.

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,230
你去过阿米科罗拉瀑布吗
You ever been to Amicalola Falls?

158
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,220
乔治亚最高的瀑布
Tallest waterfall in Georgia.

159
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,930
小时候我爸爸带我去过
My dad took me there when I was little.

160
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,820
我们站在顶端的时候
When we were up there,

161
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,130
从上往下看
all the way at the top looking down,

162
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,200
我感觉像是在飞一样
I felt like I was flying.

163
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,400
我现在就去给旅行车装行李
I'll go load up the station wagon.

164
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,390
我去给你拿点水喝
I'm gonna get you some water.

165
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,170
-我能去拿  -我知道
- I can get it. - I know.

166
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,450
但是我要去
But I'm doing it.

167
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,820
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

168
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,080
你就不能等我们回来再处理这事吗
Man, you couldn't have waited till we got back?

169
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,050
等泰尔西回来吗
Until Tyreese got back?

170
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,590
我能应付他
I could've handled that.

171
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
她杀了两个自己人
She killed two of our own.

172
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,470
她不能待在这里
She couldn't be here.

173
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,840
她会没事的
She's gonna be all right.

174
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,330
她有一辆车  供给品还有武器
She has a car, supplies, weapons.

175
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,960
她...她能活下去
She's a survivor.

176
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,010
这话连你自己都不相信
Stop saying that like you don't believe it.

177
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,730
她杀了人  她说是为了我们大家
She did it. She said it was for us.

178
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,200
她就是那么想的
That's how it was in her head.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,940
她不觉得愧疚
She wasn't sorry.

180
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,060
她是这样  但这不是她的本性
Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

181
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,980
那两个小女孩怎么办
What are we supposed to do about those two girls?

182
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,750
我告诉她我们会照顾她们
I told her we'd look after them.

183
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,960
我还没有告诉泰尔西
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

184
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,220
我不知道他会有什么反应
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

185
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,740
我们去看看就得了
Let's go find out.

186
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,420
鲍勃
Bob.

187
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,930
你应该休息
You should be resting.

188
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,910
折腾了一晚上  你也应该休息了
After the night you had, so should you.

189
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,830
我要休息
I'm going to.

190
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,270
我正要去C区找一个空狱房
On my way to find an open cell in C block

191
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,800
直到D区被收拾干净了
until D gets cleaned up.

192
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,680
我只想说
I just wanted to say

193
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,590
谢谢
thank you.

194
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,680
如果不是赫谢尔跟你的话
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Hershel

195
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,340
我不会活着
and you.

196
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,560
多亏了赫谢尔  不是我
Hershel, not me.

197
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,290
-你也帮忙了  -别说了
- You helped save my life. - Stop.

198
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,300
-鲍勃  -别说了
- Bob. - Stop.

199
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,850
你把那些药放到了我的输液里
You put those meds in my IV bag.

200
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,750
现在  还有几分钟
And now, in a couple minutes,

201
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,180
我就能看到明天的太阳了
I'm gonna feel the sun on my skin.

202
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,740
所以你得让我谢谢你
So you are gonna let me thank you.

203
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,200
萨沙
Sasha.

204
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,440
你还没有完全恢复
You're not strong enough yet.

205
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,740
那就帮帮我
Then help me.

206
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,770
泰尔西  你在吗
Tyreese. You down here?

207
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,710
瑞克  是你吗
Rick, that you?

208
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,430
你们得来看看
You guys got to see this.

209
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,730
能一会儿再去吗  我们得先谈谈
Can we take a beat? There's something we need to talk about.

210
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,430
那个不着急  先过来
It can wait. Come on.

211
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,430
看
Look.

212
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,200
怎么回事
The hell?

213
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,440
我刚才在找
I was just looking for...

214
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,460
答案
answers...

215
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,080
然后我发现了这个
and I found this.

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,690
是杀掉凯伦和大卫的人干的
Same person that killed Karen and David did this.

217
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,020
还记得栅栏那里的老鼠吗
Remember the rats at the fence?

218
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,450
它们是在她被杀当天出现的
They showed up the same day she was killed.

219
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,630
我们队伍里有个变态
We got a psychopath living with us.

220
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,620
-泰尔西  -我们得找到他  瑞克
- Tyreese. - We got to find him, Rick.

221
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,000
不找到他我决不罢休
And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.

222
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,030
泰尔西
Tyreese...

223
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
干这事的
whoever did this,

224
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,730
恐怕不是杀死凯伦的凶手
I don't think that's who killed Karen.

225
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,110
为什么
Why?

226
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,950
快走
Come on.

227
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,850
退后
Get back!

228
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,660
瑞克
Rick!

229
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,020
过来吧
Come down here.

230
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,420
我们谈谈
We need to talk.

231
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,830
我做不了主
It's not up to me.

232
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,520
我们有委员会  由他们管理这里
There's a council now. They run this place.

233
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,610
委员会里有赫谢尔吗
Is Hershel on the council?

234
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,870
还有米琼恩呢
What about Michonne?

235
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,440
委员会也有她吗
She on the council, too?

236
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,370
这里不再由我做决定了
I don't make decisions anymore.

237
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,420
今天你得做  瑞克
You're making the decisions today, Rick.

238
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,110
过来  我们谈谈吧
Come down here. Let's have that talk.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
我们能行  好吗
We can do this. All right?

240
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,560
我们对付不了这么多人
We can't take 'em all on.

241
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,180
咱们按照之前计划的
We'll go through the admin building,

242
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,000
穿过管理楼进入林子
through the woods like we planned.

243
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,140
我们现在没有人数优势了
We ain't got the numbers no more.

244
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,110
上次查大巴上的补给是什么时候
When's the last time someone checked the stash on the bus?

245
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,760
我们去基地的前一天
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

246
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,360
那时我们的口粮不多  现在更少了
We were running low on rations then. We're lower now.

247
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,520
我们会想到办法的  如果情况不妙
Yeah, we'll manage. Things go south,

248
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,820
通知大家  都上大巴
everyone heads for that bus. Let everybody know.

249
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,310
如果情况不妙却没人知道呢
What if everybody doesn't know when things go bad?

250
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,890
我们要等多久
How long do we wait?

251
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,260
尽可能多等一会儿
As long as we can.

252
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,770
现在就放他们走
Let 'em go right now.

253
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,800
我留下
I'll stay down here.

254
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,420
你想谈多久就谈多久
Talk as long as you want.

255
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,310
但你得放他们走
But you let 'em go.

256
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,160
你有坦克  完全不需要人质
You got a tank. You don't need hostages.

257
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,110
我需要
I do.

258
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,890
这是为了告诉你我是认真的
This is just to show you I'm serious.

259
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,940
我才不会给新家轰个大洞呢
Not to blast a hole in our new home.

260
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,590
你和你的人  日落之前离开这里
You and your people, you have till sundown to get out of here

261
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,020
否则他们就得死
or they die.

262
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,840
没必要这样吧
Doesn't have to go down this way.

263
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,530
我的人马和武器都比你多
I got more people, more firepower.

264
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,280
我们需要这座监狱
We need this prison.

265
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,800
就是这样
There it is.

266
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,710
跟以前无关  一切只关乎现在
It's not about the past. It's about right now.

267
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,240
这里有孩子
There are children here.

268
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,160
有的病了  在外面他们活不下去
Some of them are sick. They won't survive.

269
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,290
我有辆坦克
I have a tank.

270
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,310
却让你们安全地离开这里
And I'm letting you walk away from here.

271
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,400
还有什么好废话的
What else is there to talk about?

272
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,230
你还好吗
You good?

273
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,790
还好
Yeah.

274
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,690
拿着
All right.

275
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,340
妈妈
Mommy,

276
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,570
你能帮我挖吗
can you please help me dig?

277
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,220
妈妈  能帮我吗
Mommy, can you please help me?

278
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,880
我马上过去  亲爱的
I'll be right there, honey.

279
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,730
妈妈  太沉了
Mommy, it's too heavy.

280
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,850
我听到了
I hear you.

281
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,940
我马上过去
I'll be there in a sec.

282
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,480
很抱歉  亲爱的  你刚说什么
I'm sorry, honey. What did you say?

283
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,090
没关系  我自己能行
It's okay. I can do it myself.

284
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,110
警告
山洪多发地段

285
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,600
梅根
Megan!

286
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,480
妈妈  妈妈
Mommy! Mommy!

287
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,800
妈妈
Mommy!

288
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,250
梅根
Megan!

289
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,650
梅根
Megan!

290
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
我可以向你们开火
I could shoot you all.

291
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,090
你们会反击  我知道
You'd all shoot back. I know that.

292
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,840
但最终我们会赢  你们会死的
But we'll win and you'll be dead.

293
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,020
全都会死
All of you.

294
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,750
没必要那样
Doesn't have to be like that.

295
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,910
如我先前说的  由你选择
Like I said, it's your choice.

296
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,860
动静太大只会吸引更多行尸
Noise will only draw more of them over.

297
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,470
你等得越久
The longer you wait,

298
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,540
你们就越难以离开这里
the harder it will be for you to get out of here.

299
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,920
我们得做点什么
We got to do something.

300
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,630
你爸爸能处理
Your dad's got it.

301
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,050
他们只顾着说话
They're talking.

302
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,700
我们现在就可以杀了总督
We could kill the Governor right now.

303
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,170
-隔着45米远吗  -我枪法很好
- From 50 yards? - I'm a good shot.

304
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,520
我现在就可以结束这一切
I could end this right now.

305
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,070
是啊  或者失手了挑起战斗
Yeah, or you could start something else.

306
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,280
你要信任他
You got to trust him.

307
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,870
你们要去哪
Where are you guys going?

308
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,540
-去大巴上  走吧  -不行
- To the bus. Come on. - No.

309
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,090
这是计划  我们应该去大巴上
You know the plan. That's where we're supposed to go.

310
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,130
卡萝尔告诉我们要坚强
Carol told us to be strong.

311
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,320
保护自己  他们有枪
To protect ourselves. They have guns.

312
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
我们也应该有枪
We should have guns, too.

313
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,620
我们应该去帮忙
We should help.

314
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,080
太阳下山前  你们大概还有一个小时
You got maybe about an hour of sunlight left.

315
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,880
我建议你们开始打包
I suggest you start packing.

316
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,210
拖得时间越久
The longer you wait,

317
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,940
越难从这里安全离开
the harder it's gonna be for you to get out of here.

318
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,890
我们可以
We can all--

319
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,520
我们可以一块住
we can all live together.

320
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,180
房间足够全部人住进去了
There's enough room for all of us.

321
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,100
地方是很充裕
More than enough.

322
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,520
但我的家人跟你们住在同一屋檐下
But I don't think my family would sleep well knowing

323
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,600
是睡不了安稳觉的
that you were under the same roof.

324
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,750
我们可以住在不同的牢房区
We'd live in different cell blocks.

325
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,110
在我们能接受对方之前
We'd never have to see each other

326
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,650
我们不用见面
till we're all ready.

327
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,710
这方法可行
It could work.

328
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,120
你知道的
You know it could.

329
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,750
是有可能
It could've.

330
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,180
但是不能这样
But it can't.

331
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,740
经历了伍德伯里
Not after Woodbury.

332
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,330
和安德莉亚的事情之后  不能这样
Not after Andrea.

333
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,940
我并没有说  这可以轻松实现
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

334
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,480
事实上  这比我们站在这里互相开枪
Fact is, it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder

335
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,560
要难上一万倍
than standing here shooting at each other.

336
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,340
但我们没有其它选择
But I don't think we have a choice.

337
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,770
我们没有  你们有
We don't. You do.

338
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,720
我们不会离开的
We're not leaving.

339
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,240
如果你想逼我们离开  我们会拼死抵抗
You try and force us, we'll fight back.

340
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,210
就像你刚才说过的
Like you said,

341
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
枪声会引来更多行尸
the gunshots will just bring more of them out.

342
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,690
它们会挤倒围栏
They'll take down the fences.

343
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,730
没有了围栏  这个地方就毫无价值了
Without the fences, this place is worthless.

344
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,480
我们要不然就一起住在监狱
Now, we can all live in the prison

345
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,230
要不然就谁都住不了
or none of us can.

346
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,790
我们会修好那个该死的围栏的
We'll fix the damn fences.

347
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,920
不要
No--!

348
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,880
你  梳马尾辫的那个姑娘
You. You in the ponytails.

349
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,290
这是你想要的吗  这是你们想要的吗
Is this what you want? Is this what any of you want?

350
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,640
我们想要的就是你们的监狱
What we want is what you got.

351
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,510
就是这样
Period.

352
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,410
你们该滚蛋了  混蛋
Time for you to leave, asshole.

353
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,580
听着  我以前和他打过
Look, I fought him before.

354
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,080
之后  我们收留了他以前的同伴
And after, we took in his old friends.

355
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,530
他们成了我们这里的领导者
They've become leaders in what we have here.

356
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,600
如果你们现在放下武器
Now you put down your weapons,

357
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,820
从那些门进来
walk through those gates...

358
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,420
你们就是我们的一员
you're one of us.

359
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,840
我们既往不咎
We let go of all of it,

360
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,730
没人会伤亡
and nobody dies.

361
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,140
所有现在活着的人
Everyone who's alive right now.

362
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,360
所有坚持到现在的人
Everyone who's made it this far.

363
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,290
为了活下去  我们都不择手段过
We've all done the worst kinds of things just to stay alive.

364
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,600
但是我们依旧可以回头
But we can still come back.

365
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,410
我们还没有走得太远
We're not too far gone.

366
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,930
我们还可以回头
We get to come back.

367
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,100
我知道
I know...

368
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,450
我们都是可以改变的
we all can change.

369
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,510
骗子
Liar.

370
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,940
不要
No!

371
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,650
爸
Dad!

372
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,140
爸爸
Daddy!

373
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,120
你
You!

374
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,410
举起枪  快战斗
Pick up your weapon! Fight, now!

375
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,930
这不对
This isn't right.

376
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,690
-我们不该这样做  -必须这么做
- We're not supposed to be doing this. - We are.

377
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,600
他竟然用刀砍下了那人的头
He chopped a guy's head off with a sword.

378
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,230
我们必须留下  已经太晚了
We have to stay here. It's too late.

379
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,760
你明白吗
You understand me?

380
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,220
跟在我后面  如果我们走散了
Stay behind me and if we get separated,

381
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,280
你就找一个安全的地方躲起来
you just go run somewhere safe and hide.

382
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,420
听见了吗  找个安全的地方躲起来
You hear me? You go someplace safe and hide

383
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,070
等这一切结束后  我会去找你
and I will find you when this is all over. I will find you.

384
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,560
开车进围栏
Go through the fence in your cars.

385
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,760
拿上枪  我们进去
Get your guns, we go in.

386
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,060
杀光他们
Kill them all.

387
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,270
遵命  前进
Roger that. Move in!

388
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,050
前进
Go ahead!

389
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,290
我没弹药了
I'm out of ammo.

390
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,320
跑去大巴那边  我掩护你
Run for the bus. I'll cover you.

391
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,040
上去
Move up!

392
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,280
快跑  离开这里
Go! Get out of here!

393
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,530
快跑  格伦还在里面  我得去接他
Go, go! Come on! Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

394
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,010
-我跟你一起  -不  你去让人们上大巴
- I'm going with you. - No, get these people on the bus.

395
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,270
-随时准备出发  我马上回来  -如果你回不来呢
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back. - What if you're not?

396
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,160
-那就丢下我先走  -我不能丢下你
- You have to go without us. - I won't go without you.

397
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,380
贝丝  让大家上大巴  好吗
Beth, get these people on the bus, okay?

398
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,820
这是你的职责  我们要各司其职
It's your job. We've all got jobs to do.

399
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,080
-格伦  -发生了什么
- Glenn! - What the hell's going on?

400
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,090
我们得带大家离开这里
We have to get everybody out of here.

401
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,270
贝丝  贝丝在哪
Beth! Where's Beth?

402
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,580
-她去找你了  -她去了哪里
- She went to find you. - Where?

403
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,590
我们会找到她的  她会没事的
We'll find her. She'll be okay.

404
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,920
-别来  -什么  不行  你不能自己去
- No. - What? No, you're not going by yourself.

405
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,530
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

406
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,150
玛姬
Maggie...

407
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,340
右边
On your right.

408
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,000
手榴弹
Grenade!

409
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,620
萨沙  萨沙  你看见贝丝了吗
Sasha! Sasha! Have you seen Beth?

410
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,750
-她在大巴上吗  -没有  她...
- Is she on the bus? - No. She's--

411
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,680
别起身
We gotta stay down.

412
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,020
掀开衣服  看看子弹有没有穿过
Look inside my shirt. Check my back for an exit wound.

413
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,440
穿过了
Yeah.

414
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,790
太好了  还能治疗
That's good. We can treat it.

415
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,830
-不能在这里治  -低头  我们找个安全的地方
- Not here. - Stay down. We'll find someplace safe.

416
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,590
我们想别的办法  快走
We'll figure it out. Come on.

417
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,700
我们必须离开这里
We got to get out of here.

418
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,350
等等  去那边
Hey! We go that way!

419
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,770
卡尔
Carl...?

420
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,640
卡尔在哪
Where's Carl?

421
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,830
我不知道
I don't know.

422
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,540
手榴弹
