1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,160
星际之门亚特兰蒂斯  前情回顾
Previously on  stargate atlantis ...

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,230
你身上有幽灵的基因
You have some wraith dna.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,700
我父亲和别人说这是天赋禀异
My father told people that it was a gift.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,830
他们已经追踪到我的行迹
Ah, they've picked up my signal.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,430
一种外太空跟踪器
A subspace tracking device.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,060
我已植入这个
I had it implanted.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,790
蜂巢战舰正在互相攻击
The hives are firing on each other.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,060
你确定吗
Are you sure?

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,090
100%确定
Definitely.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,630
他们还是以命相搏
They're not pulling any punches either.

11
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,830
直到我的飞船壮烈牺牲了
So all it took was the destruction of my ship

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,530
你才肯相信我啊
For you to finally trust me.

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,790
不  我仍然不相信你
Oh, not true, I still don't trust you.

14
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,760
我已改良了这种逆转录酶
I've refined the retrovirus

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,600
创造了完美的平衡
To create the perfect balance--

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,990
可以超越人类极限
Ability well beyond any normal human,

17
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,660
除了一个弱点外
But without the one weakness

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,330
幽灵组将永不衰败
That will be the downfall of the wraith...

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,500
那就是我们须要进食
The need to feed.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,300
我仍觉得我们要带点后援部队
I still say we should'v e brought backup.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,530
小飞船或者海军陆战队之类的
Another jumper, or a marine unit, Something.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,760
罗德尼  这是
This is intended to be

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,690
一次外交任务
A diplomatic mission, rodney.

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,890
你带这么多人想传达什么信息?
What kind of message would that send?

25
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,060
希望是强势信息
Well, a strong one, hopefully.

26
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,690
如果他们不惊慌
Everybody's going to be fine

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,890
那么我们就会没事
If they don't panic.

28
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,060
你说的容易
Easier said than done.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,600
我们到了
There they are.

30
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,030
天啊  这飞船好巨大啊
My god, how big is that thing?

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,160
从没在太空看过蜂巢战舰?
Never seen a hive in space, huh?

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,660
从没看到过
I've never seen one period.

33
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,790
我是说在影像记录中见过  但没亲眼看到
I mean, I've seen video logs, but never in person.

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,030
你一定会深刻记住这个第一次的
Well, you never forget your first.

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,060
他们知道我们来了
They know we're here.

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,090
明显是的
Apparently.

37
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,130
我们接受到一个信号
We're receiving a transmission.

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,560
靠边停船
Docking instructions.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,600
你以为是什么  "你好  客人辛苦了"
What, no, "hello. greetings, weary travelers?"

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,930
我猜也不是
Guess not.

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,760
看来不会有红地毯来迎接我们了
So much for the red carpet.

42
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,200
接下来怎么办
So, what happens now?

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,630
根据历史经验
Well, if history has taught us anything,

44
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,760
我们会被出卖
This is the part where we get double-crossed

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,030
并成为阶下囚
And taken prisoner.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,360
罗德尼  这次不会发生这样的事了
That will not happen this time, rodney.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
记得吗  我们是受邀请的
We were invited, remember?

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,690
这有区别吗
And that makes a difference?

49
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,830
按计划出发
Right on cue.

50
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,930
这倒是似曾相识
This looks a little familiar.

51
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,050
放下武器
Lower your weapons.

52
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,320
很抱歉
My apologies.

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,250
请你们谅解
You understand.

54
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,490
小心驶得万年船
You can't be too careful.

55
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,390
欢迎来到我的飞船
Welcome to my ship.

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,250
这位是我副官
This is my second-in-command.

57
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,120
我请他来一起参与这次商讨
I've asked him to be a part of these discussions.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,720
请坐
Please, sit.

59
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,790
有果盘  不错啊
Fruit bowl, nice touch.

60
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,090
我们在旅途中准备的
Well, we picked them up on our travels.

61
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,290
我想有水果相伴会令我们的商讨
I thought it would make our discussions

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,990
更加愉悦和谐
More comfortable.

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,490
希望这些水果和种它们的农民一样美味
I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,350
我们还是直奔主题吧
All right, let's just get this over with.

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,490
我获知你们有个建议
So, I understand you have a proposal,

66
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,990
说是重大突破之类的
A breakthrough of some kind?

67
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,820
这是凯勒医生
This is dr. keller.

68
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,420
他们我们的首席医疗官
She's our chief medical officer,

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,850
她将把一切解释给你听
And she's going to explain everything to you.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,420
正如你所知
Uh, as you may already know,

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,690
近期我们无意中发现了
We recently stumbled across a lab

72
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,420
迈克尔的实验室
Belonging to michael,

73
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,520
就是那个幽灵...
The wraith that we--

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
我知道他是谁
I know who he is.

75
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,790
当然
Of course you do.

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,220
你们成功战胜他的消息
Word of your success against him

77
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,890
已经在我们当中迅速传开了
Spread rapidly among my kind.

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,720
非常感激
We are very grateful.

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,350
相信我  我们可不是为你们而消灭他的
Trust me, we didn't do it for you.

80
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,390
不管怎样  我们恢复了他实验室的数据库
Anyway, we recovered a database from his lab

81
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,950
这让我们可以继续他的研究...
That allowed us to continue his research into--

82
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,420
你们有什么目的?
For what purpose?

83
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,220
我已经试验出一种基因疗法
We've come up with a gene therapy

84
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,550
可以改变幽灵的基因
That alters wraith dna

85
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,320
虽然只是一小部分  但意义非凡
In a small but significant way.

86
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,790
简而言之
In a nutshell--

87
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,320
我们能够成功治疗
We think we can make it so that you,

88
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,320
你以及任何一个幽灵
And any other wraith we treat,

89
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,290
你们从此不需要在以人类为食
Will never need to feed on humans again.

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,920
真是荒谬
This is absurd.

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,820
事实上  这不是什么大不了的
Well, actually, it's not as big of a change

92
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,190
你可以想的到
As you might think.

93
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,450
你们身体的各个器官已经具备
Your bodies already contain all the organs necessary

94
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,450
消化食物的能力
To digest food.

95
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,690
接着
Here.

96
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,020
试试这个
Try this.

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,590
如果我吃了这水果
If I consume this,

98
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,020
它能给我带来短暂的愉悦感
It may give me a moment's pleasure,

99
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,550
但不能长时间满足我的需求
But it will not sustain me.

100
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,750
但这是可以改变的
But that can change,

101
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
至少理论上行得通
At least in theory.

102
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,820
为什么我们要这样做
Why would we want this?

103
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,420
换句话说对我们有什么好处
Of what benefit is it?

104
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,590
考虑一下吧
Well, think about it.

105
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,890
如果你们以这些为食物
If you put yourself on regular food,

106
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,420
就能放弃无尽的抢劫和屠戮
You could give up all those tiresome cullings.

107
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,750
这样你们就会比其他的幽灵
It would give you a significant advantage

108
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,850
更具优势
Over other hives.

109
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,190
更不用说从理论上
Not to mention I could stop waiting

110
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,890
我们还想找机会杀光你们呢
for the chance to kill you, in theory.

111
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,550
我们进食能给予我们力量
Our current feeding process gives us strength,

112
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,550
自愈和长寿的能力
Our ability to heal, our longevity.

113
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,590
我们还不能完全肯定
Well, um, we're not entirely sure

114
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,620
这样的改变是否会影响你们的...  天赋
How this change would affect your, um... gifts.

115
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,190
这些能力可能会保留
They may continue,

116
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,890
但也有可能就此减弱
Although possibly in a diminished form.

117
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,050
有可能失去?
Possibly?

118
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,890
这些难以在实验室测试中取得答案
It's difficult to know from lab tests.

119
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,790
只有做过活体临床试验
We can't be sure

120
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,220
才能最终确定结果
Until we administer it to, um, live subjects.

121
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,950
别忘了迈克尔把改良过的赫方药物
Well, let's not forget that michael spread the modified

122
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,090
散播到几十个星球  可能还不止
hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more.

123
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,820
又有谁能清楚知道具体在哪呢
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?

124
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,790
这意味着你们每次进食
Which means that every time you feed,

125
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,820
都是冒着风险的
You're taking a risk.

126
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,650
目前最基本的是  周围已经没有足够的食物了
Bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around.

127
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,220
这就导致你们幽灵族互相残杀
That's why you wraith are at each other's throats.

128
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,750
所以说
So...

129
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,320
你们的机会来了
Here's your chance.

130
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,550
这样是不对的
This is wrong.

131
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,550
我们不应该来这的
We shouldn't be here.

132
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,220
不知道  不过好像
I don't know, from where I was sitting,

133
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,320
事情谈的还挺顺利
Things seemed to go pretty well.

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,350
是啊
Yeah.

135
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,820
你看起来对这事不太乐观
You don't seem too happy about it.

136
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,750
我本希望他们会有点抵制
I was just expecting a little more resistance.

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,890
他还没同意呢
Well, he hasn't said yes yet.

138
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,050
话是没错  但直觉告诉我他会同意的
Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.

139
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,990
为什么不同意呢  这是个很合理的建议
And why not? it is a reasonable offer.

140
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,620
我们为什么要选择治疗他们这条路呢
Why are we thinking of ways to fix them

141
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,020
还不如直接消灭他们
When we should be thinking of ways to kill them?

142
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,720
我们已经用了4年暴力手段
We've been trying to do that for four years.

143
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,150
他们依然健在
They're still here.

144
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,620
幽灵族不值得我们同情
The wraith may not deserve our consideration,

145
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,050
但正如约翰所说  我们这么做不是为了他们
But as john pointed out, we're not doing this for them.

146
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,190
这里总有点什么不对劲
There's something going on here,

147
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,390
他有事瞒着我们
Something he's not telling us.

148
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,620
真令人惊讶
What a surprise.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,990
抱歉
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,050
打扰到各位了?
Am I disturbing you?

151
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,850
欢迎
Come in.

152
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,750
我已考虑过你们的建议
I have... considered your offer.

153
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,050
还真是神速啊
That was fast.

154
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,690
我很赞同你们的想法
I believe your idea has merit,

155
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,350
如果你们的治疗能够成功
If you can make the treatment to work.

156
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,920
会成功的
It'll work.

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,350
当然
Of course,

158
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,690
仅仅改变一艘蜂巢战舰的幽灵意义不大
Converting a single hive would be pointless.

159
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,990
并不会给这星系的人类带来实质性的改变
It would make little difference to the humans of this galaxy

160
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,250
反而使我们成为幽灵中的异类
And would make us pariahs amongst are own kind.

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,720
等等
Wait a minute,

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,890
你不是和其他幽灵结成同盟了吗
I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.

163
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,450
是的  但我可能夸大了我在
I do, but I may have... exaggerated my position

164
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,790
同盟军中的地位
Within the alliance.

165
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,950
他是人微言轻啊
He doesn't have the clout.

166
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,120
那么他对我们就没用了
Then he's no good to us.

167
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,250
你们只需要说服一个人就可以
There's only one you need to convince.

168
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,690
在同盟军的所有女王中
Among all the queens in the alliance,

169
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,250
有一位最具权势的女王
One sits above the rest.

170
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,050
我们叫她第一女王
We call her the primary.

171
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,250
那个无敌女王?
The uber-queen?

172
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,120
只要说服她  天下幽灵都会服从
Convince her, and the rest will fall into line.

173
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,520
那就去说服她啊
Then convince her.

174
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,450
第一女王只和其他女王联系
She will only speak with another queen.

175
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,320
而你们女王去年在
And your queen was killed last year

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,550
亚特兰蒂斯上空被死了
In the skies above atlantis.

177
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,250
很遗憾  是的
Regrettably, yes,

178
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,150
但是第一女王不知道此事
But the primary does not know this.

179
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,750
你...
You...

180
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,020
你蒙混进同盟军
You bluffed your way into the alliance

181
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,920
然后骗他们说你们还有女王?
And convinced them you still have a queen?

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,490
否则他们是不会接纳我们的
They would not have accepted me otherwise.

183
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,020
直到现在
Up to now,

184
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,450
我还可以一直暗度陈仓
I've been able to maintain this subterfuge,

185
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:25,520
不过面对面的交流就比较棘手了
But a face-to-face meeting, that would be difficult.

186
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,820
事实上  只有一个人能帮助我
In fact, there is only one person who could help me.

187
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,290
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

188
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,290
相信我  我也是深思熟虑后做的决定
Believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.

189
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,550
你有意识到他叫你做的事有多危险吗
Do you realize what he's asking you to do?

190
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,650
凯勒医生向我保证
Well, dr. keller assures me

191
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,250
幽灵化是完全可以逆转的
That the procedure is completely reversible

192
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,520
而且没有持续的后遗症
And will have no lasting ill-effects.

193
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,320
我不是说幽灵化
I'm not talking about the procedure.

194
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,450
我知道
I know.

195
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,790
听我说  即使这能成功
Look, even if this works,

196
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,090
即使幽灵们能停止进食
Even if all the wraith stop feeding,

197
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,320
你认为他们能一夜之间就变成谦谦君子
You think they're going to become nice and friendly overnight?

198
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,850
不会
No.

199
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,850
他们会拥有强大的技术优势
They're going to have a massive technological advantage.

200
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,520
你言下之意是他们会奴役
You're suggesting they will enslave

201
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,620
这星系的人类取代以他们为食
the people of this galaxy rather than feed on them.

202
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,220
我们星系就曾经发生过这一切
We've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,550
你怎么不早点提出反对意见
You didn't voice this objection before.

204
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,550
那时没人让你去冒生命危险
Nobody was asking you to risk your life.

205
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,890
我的幽灵基因使我成为唯一合适的人
My wraith DNA makes me the only possible candidate.

206
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,520
换作别人的话会马上被女王发现
Anyone else would be detected by the queen.Immediately.

207
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,490
好吧  如果这样  我的问题是
Well, that's fine, by my question is,

208
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,950
为什么非得现在
Why now?

209
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,690
幽灵族正在互相残杀
The wraith are busy killing each other.

210
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,950
为什么我们不能坐享其成呢
Why don't we just sit back and watch?

211
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,790
最后肯定会有一方胜利
Eventually, one faction will emerge victorious,

212
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,650
然后一切又将恢复原样了
And then everything will go back to the way it was.

213
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,950
但不是这会儿
But maybe not for a while,

214
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,050
我们等的起啊
So we can afford to wait.

215
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,690
如果托德联盟被毁灭
And if todd's alliance is destroyed?

216
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,550
我们就再也没有
We may never have

217
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,220
如此好的机会了
Another opportunity like this again.

218
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,020
我也承认  用这个方法解决幽灵族的问题
I admit, this may not solve the wraith problem

219
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,390
并非一劳永逸
Once and for all,

220
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,090
但在不久的将来总会有活生生的人
But there are people alive today

221
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,690
被挑选出来干这个
Who will be culled in the coming weeks and months,

222
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,820
只要我能救他们  即使是少数
And if I can save even some of them,

223
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,750
我也得试试
I have to try.

224
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,150
即使不是为我自己  为我儿子也值得
If not for myself, then for my son.

225
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,020
谢帕德中校  请回话
Colonel sheppard, come in.

226
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,150
这是谢帕德  说吧
This is sheppard, go ahead.

227
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,990
伍尔希先生通知你
Mr. woolsey wanted me to inform you, sir,

228
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,290
他到了
He's here.

229
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,250
你确定你准备好了吗
You sure you're ready for this?

230
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,850
我已时刻准备着
As ready as I'll ever be.

231
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,720
抱歉  我...
I'm sorry. i...

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,890
我觉得你是因为我的研究
I feel like you're being pressured into this

233
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,850
才被迫参与进来的
Because of my research.

234
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,390
我没有被迫参与
I am not being pressured into anything,

235
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,690
你的研究拯救了千百人
And your research may save thousands,

236
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,990
甚至上万人的生命
Even millions of lives.

237
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,050
记住了
Remember that.

238
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,290
好吧
Right.

239
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,390
有什么需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

240
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,620
给我记住了
Just remember,

241
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,390
她要是出了什么事儿
If anything happens to her,

242
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,790
你就算逃到天涯海角
There won't be anywhere in the galaxy

243
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,890
我也把你抓出来
You can hide.

244
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,990
说完了吗
Is that all?

245
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,790
好吧
Right.

246
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,190
病人怎么样了
How is my patient?

247
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,790
状况良好
She's fine.

248
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,220
很好  那我们开始吧
Very well, let's get started.

249
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
别担心
Don't worry,

250
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,320
他只是技术顾问
He's just here as a technical advisor.

251
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,820
手术由我主刀
I'm going to be performing the surgery.

252
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,420
好了  我们开始吧
All right, we're ready.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,050
我们什么时候才能去看她
When are we going to get to see her?

254
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,690
总要花点时间的  放松一下
Give it some time, just relax.

255
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,920
我放松不了  我喝了差不多有三杯咖啡
I can't. I had, like, three cups of coffee.

256
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,220
我实在太亢奋了
I'm completely wired.

257
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,420
真的么  我怎么没注意到
Really? I hadn't noticed.

258
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,690
好了  现在你们可以见她了
All right, you can see her now.

259
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,740
我看起来怎样
How do I look?

260
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,740
你想让我们俩都死于非命吗
Are you trying to get us both killed?

261
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,910
我不懂
I do not understand.

262
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,940
只要稍稍露出破绽
At the first sign of deception,

263
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,240
女王就会毫不犹豫的撕破我们的喉咙
The primary will not hesitate to slit our throats!

264
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,210
你说过她能感觉到我的幽灵基因的
You said she would sense my wraith dna.

265
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,580
我担心的不是你的基因
It is not your dna that concerns me.

266
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,610
而是你的行为
It is your manner,

267
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,340
举止
Your bearing.

268
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,640
你表现出来的担忧
You project apprehension.

269
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,710
在这种情况下
Well, given the circumstances--

270
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,840
这也许是可以理解的
It may be understandable,

271
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,910
但绝对无法接受
But it is not acceptable!

272
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,780
总之
Above all,

273
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,480
你绝对不能表现得太软弱
You must never show weakness.

274
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,940
现在...
Now...

275
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,410
再来一次!
Again!

276
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,380
这得花多少时间
How long is this going to take, anyway?

277
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,440
直到她的女王
Until todd's satisfied

278
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,780
令托德满意为止
She can pass as a wraith queen.

279
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,080
就我个人而言
You know, personally,

280
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,180
我不太赞成莽撞行事
I'm not inclined to rush this thing.

281
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,410
我觉得她表现得很不错
She's already too convincing if you ask me.

282
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,580
已经有点吓到我了
Creeps me out.

283
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,040
她仍然是泰勒  即使现在面目狰狞
She's still teyla, underneath all that.

284
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,780
也许这就是问题所在
Maybe that's the problem.

285
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,740
听着  对这事儿我没你们那么紧张
Look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys,

286
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,880
事实上
But the fact is,

287
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,410
托德也是命悬一线
Todd's putting his life on the line, too.

288
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,880
如果他不认为她能蒙混过关
I don't think he'd go in there with her

289
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,340
肯定不会随同前往的
If he didn't think she could pull this off.

290
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,010
泰勒在哪儿
Where's teyla?

291
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,980
休息
Resting.

292
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,580
很高兴告诉你们
You'll be pleased to know

293
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,880
我们已经从蜂巢级母舰处得到回应
We've received word back from the primary's hive.

294
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,280
他们通知我们前往会面
We've been instructed to meet them at their current location.

295
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,380
那  有什么计划
So, what's the plan?

296
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,210
我们一抵达
Once we arrive,

297
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,780
就与舰队取得联系并直接前往
We make contact with the ship and make our way over.

298
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,240
然后泰勒提出我的建议
Then teyla will put forward my proposal.

299
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,510
你的建议?
Oh, your proposal?

300
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,040
相信我  我们最好不要让女王
Believe me, the less the primary knows

301
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,380
知道我们之间的交易
About my dealings with the humans of atlantis,

302
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,580
如果她不知道是我们提出来的
If she doesn't know it's coming from us,

303
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,440
她怎么和我们合作呢
What are the chances she's going to buy it?

304
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,780
我们联盟最近也
Our alliance has recently been dealt

305
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,810
倍受打击
A number of setbacks.

306
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,610
你们也会被人砍啊
You're getting your asses kicked.

307
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,480
的确
Indeed.

308
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,680
虽然女王永远不会承认
Although the primary would never admit it out loud,

309
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,640
但有一点可以肯定  她求生的本能
But the one thing stronger than her pride

310
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,980
比她的自尊
Is her instinct

311
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,240
更为强大
For survival.

312
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,210
别紧张
Don't be nervous.

313
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,280
我不紧张
I am not.

314
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,210
那么...
So...

315
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,140
我们终于见面了
At long last we meet.

316
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,280
的确
Indeed.

317
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,880
我的许多手下开始认为
Many among my crew were beginning to think

318
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,210
你并不存在
You didn't exist.

319
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,310
你应该让他们站出来与我对峙
You must point them out to me,

320
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,980
那样我好消除他们的疑虑
So that I may remove all doubt from their minds.

321
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,140
没必要了
That will no longer be necessary.

322
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,740
到我船上来
Make your way to my ship,

323
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,180
别再让我干等了
And do not keep me waiting again.

324
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,710
她欣赏你
She likes you.

325
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,840
你这么认为?
You think so?

326
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,280
态度温和的比想象中要好多了
It was as warm a reception as we could expect.

327
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,780
进展如何
How'd it go?

328
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,480
显然  十分顺利
Apparently, quite well.

329
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,680
他们预备了飞船
They're preparing a shuttle

330
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,140
准备带我过去见她
To take me over to the other hive.

331
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,980
你随时可以终止这一切的
You know we can pull the plug anytime you want,

332
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,110
只要你开口说
You just give us the word.

333
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,410
不
No.

334
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,680
已经走到这一步了
We've come this far.

335
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,780
我就要坚持到底
I intend to go through with this.

336
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,980
好吧  我们在这儿等着
Well, we'll be right here.

337
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,910
一旦出什么差错  就立刻把你弄出去
If anything goes wrong, we'll get you out.

338
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,380
不会出差错的
But nothing's going to.

339
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,480
是啊  当然不会了  我只是说  假如
Well, no, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does--

340
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,340
罗德尼...
Rodney...

341
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,880
当然不会出错
Which it won't.

342
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,110
在那儿千万小心
Just be careful over there.

343
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,180
欢迎来到我的飞船
Welcome to my ship.

344
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,280
你们的女王在哪儿
Where is your queen?

345
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,480
她马上就到
You will meet her in time.

346
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,980
通知舰桥他们上来了
Inform the bridge they're onboard.

347
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,210
进行超空间飞行
Take us to hyperspace.

348
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
这不在协议范畴之内
This was not part of the agreement.

349
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
也没有说在这里进行会面
You did not expect us to conduct this meeting here,

350
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,310
在你的舰队武器射程之内?
Within weapons range of your hive?

351
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,710
怎么说我们也是同一联盟的
We are part of the same alliance.

352
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,810
除非你不信任我们
Unless you do not trust us?

353
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,180
我从不相信陌生人
I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know.

354
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,780
正好女王也这么想
It is how the queen wishes it.

355
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,310
跟我来
Follow me.

356
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,380
这边请
Please.

357
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,710
发生什么事了
What's going on?

358
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,780
第一女王的蜂巢母舰飞入了超空间
The primary's hive just went into hyperspace.

359
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,880
什么
What?

360
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
这不属于协议的范畴啊
That wasn't part of the deal.

361
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,380
的确不是
No, it was not.

362
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,580
那他们去哪儿
Where'd they go?

363
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,640
我也不知道
I do not know.

364
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
压根儿没法追踪他们
There is no way to track them.

365
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,540
他在撒谎
he's lying.

366
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,140
若楠?
Uh, ronon?

367
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,210
我发誓  我对此一无所知
I assure you, I know nothing of this.

368
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,240
若楠...
Ronon...

369
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,710
看来我们除了相互信任别无他法
It appears we have no choice but to trust each other.

370
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,840
你马上就能见到女王
The queen shall see you shortly.

371
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,740
你搞什么鬼
What have you done?

372
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,940
我发誓我也没料到会这样
I swear I did not expect this to happen.

373
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,440
我们没有危险
We're in no danger.

374
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,010
如果女王不信任我们  我们已经挂了
If the queen did not believe us, we'd be dead already.

375
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,840
那如果她开始怀疑了呢
And if she begins to suspect?

376
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,880
我们被困在飞船上了
We are trapped on this ship.

377
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,710
没事的
Everything will be fine,

378
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,040
只要你好好演你的角色
Provided you continue to play your part.

379
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,110
我们得按计划行事
We must proceed as planned.

380
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
他在这干嘛
What is he doing here?

381
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,080
有他在场多少有点用
I thought his presence would be useful,

382
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,710
至少一直以来是他跟你打交道
As he is the one you've been dealing with up until now.

383
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,880
我讨厌意外
I do not like surprises.

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,940
我也是
Nor do i,

385
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,840
而我们一上船
And yet you are the one

386
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,140
你却突然将飞船
Who took your ship to hyperspace

387
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,810
开到超空间里去
The moment we stepped aboard.

388
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,810
你若是处在我的位置
If you were in my position,

389
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,880
就会知道安全第一的重要性
You might understand the need for such precautions.

390
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,480
很好
Very well.

391
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,010
跟我来
Come.

392
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,610
坐下谈
Let's sit.

393
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,540
你在干什么
What are you doing?

394
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,580
这是什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

395
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,610
原谅我
Forgive me,

396
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,680
但事情就得这样
But this is the way it must be.

397
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,950
你得说是你杀了她
You must say that you killed her.

398
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,620
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

399
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,520
这就是我们族的规矩
This is how it is done with our kind.

400
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
这就是我们族的权力传递法则
This is how power changes hands.

401
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
但我不想
But I do not want--

402
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,020
听我说!
Listen to me!

403
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,090
这些人肯定会有所不快
The crew will not be happy,

404
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,620
但他们更不愿意没有女王
But nor will they wish to be without a queen.

405
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,720
是你趁她不备
You caught her off-guard.

406
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,850
许多人会认为
Many will perceive that to mean

407
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,990
她正在变弱
That she was growing weak.

408
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,290
你只需要
All you need to do

409
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,620
说服他们你是个有能力的代替者
Is convince them that you are a capable replacement,

410
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,650
他们就会接受你的
And they will accept you.

411
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,650
要是我不行呢?
And if I can't?

412
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,020
那我俩都得挂掉
Then we're both dead.

413
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,250
这是怎么回事
What is this?

414
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,820
这是我应得的
I have taken what is rightfully mine.

415
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,020
你杀了她!
You killed her!

416
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,320
是的
Yes,

417
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,490
你最好接受这一点
And you are the better for it.

418
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,220
杀人就要偿命
You will die for this.

419
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,950
你怎么敢用抢指着你们的女王!
How dare you point a weapon at your queen!

420
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,090
她才是我们的女王
This was my queen!

421
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,790
已经不再是了
Not anymore.

422
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,820
她的力量日渐减弱
She was growing weak.

423
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,390
她再也不能完全掌控联盟
She no longer had full control over the alliance.

424
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,820
如果你还懵然不知
If you can't see that,

425
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,620
实属愚昧
You're a fool.

426
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,220
我允许你说话了吗
Did I ask you to speak for me?

427
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,520
回女王陛下  没有
No, my queen.

428
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,850
下次若再多口舌
Wag your tongue like that again,

429
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,950
你这条舌头就不用要了
And I will remove it.

430
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,020
清楚了吗
Is that understood?

431
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,220
清楚了  女王陛下
Yes, my queen!

432
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,390
马上离开超空间  全面检查飞船状态
Now, drop us out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic.

433
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,950
我要掌握我新旗舰的最新情况
I wish to know the state of my new flagship.

434
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,250
然后把这个...东西处理掉
And have this... thing removed from my sight.

435
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,650
是的  女王陛下
Yes, my queen.

436
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,590
我查问了这里的人员
I have surveyed the crew.

437
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,690
所幸的是  他们成功被我们骗了
You'll be pleased to know they were entirely fooled.

438
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,990
你葫芦里究竟卖什么药
What were you thinking?

439
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,390
你把你我两人的性命至于极度危险之中
You put both our lives at terrible risk.

440
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,490
我知道
I know.

441
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,690
请容我解释一下
If you'll allow me to explain--

442
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,790
你怎么可以这样做
How could you do this?

443
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,250
这是必须的
It was necessary.

444
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,120
前女王是不会同意你的提议的
The former queen was never going to accept your proposal.

445
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,790
所以你索性杀掉她  让我成为替罪羔羊?
And so you killed her and forced me to take the blame?

446
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,350
若是我来承担  我会被赐予死罪
If I had taken the blame, I would have been killed,

447
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,520
而你也会成为阶下囚
And you would have been held captive.

448
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,890
这恐怕与我们初衷不一致
That was not the desired outcome.

449
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,490
你要明白
You must understand,

450
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,850
我们的文化截然不同
Our culture is different from your own.

451
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,450
到什么山就要唱什么歌
We govern ourselves by different rules.

452
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,950
你声称自己干掉了女王
It was important for you to claim ownership

453
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,790
才是当务之急
Of the act of killing the queen.

454
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,320
你早该把这种谋朝夺位的做法
You should have informed me of your intention

455
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,420
跟我说清楚
To make me queen of this hive.

456
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,520
或许吧
Perhaps,

457
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,750
若你事先知晓  我恐怕你未必会
But I doubt you would have gone through with it

458
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,950
同意这样做
Had you known.

459
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,990
正是
You're right.

460
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,690
这是个荒唐轻率的计划
It was a foolish, reckless plan.

461
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,820
多数幽灵人渴望被统治
Most wraith seek to be ruled.

462
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,120
他们最害怕群龙无首
They fear being without a queen.

463
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,990
我深知  假若你可以证明自己
I knew that if you presented yourself

464
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,390
胜任女王之位
As a viable substitute,

465
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,490
他们多数也归顺于你的
Most of them would just fall in line.

466
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,990
多数人?
Most of them?

467
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,690
重点是  我们已经顺利完成计划
The point is, we have achieved what we set out to do.

468
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,990
你已经成功地
You are now effectively

469
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,390
取得联盟的控制权
In control of the alliance.

470
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,220
我们可以畅通无阻的执行
We may now implement dr. keller's plan

471
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,120
凯勒医生的计划
Without hindrance.

472
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,990
在这之后  我们就没必要继续表演了
Then there is no further need for us to continue this charade.

473
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,050
先带我回你的飞船去
Take me back to your ship.

474
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,790
马上  但首先
Soon, but first,

475
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,450
你要再稍等片刻
You must allow some time

476
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,250
树立起自己的威严
For order to be restored,

477
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,390
让所有事情重回正轨
For things to return to normal.

478
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,220
然后  你才能离开
Once they do, you may take your leave,

479
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,820
让他们自我良性循环
And no one on this crew will be the wiser.

480
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,450
我还是觉得这是个陷阱
I still say this was a setup.

481
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,890
我也不知道  肯尼看到飞船消失的时候
I don't know, kenny seemed pretty surprised

482
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,050
似乎也很吃惊
When that ship disappeared.

483
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,220
谁
Who?

484
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,620
肯尼  这里的副指挥官
Kenny, the second-in-command.

485
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,820
我们什么时候开始
Well, since when did we start

486
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,890
这样子称呼他的
Calling him that?

487
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,390
也许他也是被卖的
Maybe he wasn't in on it.

488
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,720
我也说不清  如果托德想劫走泰勒
I don't know, if todd wanted to kidnap teyla,

489
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,920
他早在我们到达的时候就可以下手
He would've done it the second we arrived.

490
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,990
这不合情理
It doesn't add up.

491
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,350
说真的
Seriously,

492
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,190
下次我们要给他们起名字的时候
The next time we have to name one of these guys,

493
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,890
至少也要投票决定吧
We should take a vote.

494
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,050
那我们该怎么做呢
So, what are we going to do?

495
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,690
当然不能坐以待毙
We can't stay here.

496
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,120
这里到处都是幽灵人的守卫
We're stuck on a hive surrounded by wraith.

497
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,820
这对我们很不利
Not exactly our strongest position.

498
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,090
我只有一艘飞船了  你说怎么办
All I've got is a jumper. where do you want to go?

499
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,420
我们找一个星门
Well, we get to a gate,

500
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,850
然后回到亚特兰蒂斯
We gate back to atlantis,

501
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,350
然后想办法救回泰勒
And then we figure out where they took teyla.

502
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,950
具体怎样操作
How, exactly?

503
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,720
我还没想好详细的计划
Okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet,

504
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,750
但...
But...

505
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,550
我们收到一些情报了
We have something.

506
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,190
第一女王的旗舰离开了超空间
The primary's hive has dropped out of hyperspace.

507
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,150
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

508
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,020
我们正在接收信号
We're receiving a signal.

509
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,420
这是托德的亚空间传送机
It's todd's subspace transmitter.

510
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,950
他们在真空区巨大星云的边界
They're in empty space, on the edge of a large nebula.

511
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,150
他们到那里去干什么
What are they doing out there?

512
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,250
管它的  这是我们的机会
Who cares? this is our chance.

513
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,490
去追踪他们
Let's go after them.

514
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,520
我已绘制出航线
I've already plotted the course,

515
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,150
但要知道  我们冒冒然前去
But you should know that it will arouse suspicion

516
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,950
会引起他们的怀疑
For us to arrive unannounced.

517
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,420
这个晚点再担心好了
Well, let's worry about that later.

518
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,820
现在  最重要的就是让他们收到
For now, this is the closest thing they've got

519
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,020
这个求救信号
To a distress signal.

520
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,690
女王陛下  抱歉打扰了
I'm sorry to disturb you, my queen.

521
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,790
我们收到紧急信号
We've received an urgent report.

522
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,290
你要她自己看吗
You intend to make her read it?

523
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,220
在离这不远处  我们的捕食场之一的
A hive belonging to another alliance

524
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,020
上方  发现了
Has been detected

525
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,850
来自另一个联盟的飞船
Above one of our feeding grounds not far from here.

526
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,190
有尝试过和他们取得联系吗
Have you tried to contact them?

527
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,720
他们并没有回应
They are not responding.

528
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,350
派遣最近的飞船去查明情况
Dispatch the closest hive to investigate.

529
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,190
我们已经是最近的了
We are the closest hive.

530
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,720
要截击只能亲自去了
It falls upon us to intercept.

531
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,090
我们必须留守此地
We must remain here.

532
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,990
陛下
My queen,

533
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,250
或许  我们该私下谈谈
Perhaps we should discuss this in private.

534
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,290
退下
Leave us.

535
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,650
我们必须出击
We must respond to this.

536
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,150
退缩只会被认为是懦弱之举
To do otherwise will read as weakness.

537
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,120
船员们会不理解的
The crew will not understand.

538
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,090
就让他们猜忌去
Then let them be confused.

539
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,890
说的话像个真正的女王
Spoken like a true queen,

540
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,020
做的事却让他们暗生怀疑
But you risk breeding suspicion.

541
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,550
当下  他们信奉你
For the moment, they believe you,

542
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,850
他们臣服于你
And are prepared to serve you,

543
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,520
若作出不合理的决定
But if you break that trust

544
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
就会失去威信
By making irrational decisions,

545
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,920
他们就会毫不犹豫地推翻你
They will quickly fall away from you.

546
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,990
你的飞船怎办
What about your ship?

547
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,750
也许他们正赶过来
It is probably already on its way.

548
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,890
只要他们到达  就会接收到
They will pick up on our new location

549
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,850
我们新所在地的信号
As soon as they arrive.

550
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,590
通知舰桥去策划航线
Inform the bridge to set a course.

551
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,350
有一点  肯尼是对的
Now, kenny's right about one thing--

552
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,050
倘若我们二次离开超空间
The second we drop out of hyperspace,

553
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,520
女王旗舰一定会
The primary's hive ship's

554
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
发觉形势不对
Going to know something's up.

555
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,150
我们提早离开
We drop out early,

556
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,420
剩下的路程就改用飞船
Go the rest of the way by jumper.

557
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,750
这样太费时了
That's going to take too long.

558
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,090
我们需要分散他们的注意
We need a diversion.

559
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,790
那么...该怎么分散他们的注意力呢
So, what... what kind of a diversion?

560
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,620
你想的和我想的一样吗
You thinking what I'm thinking?

561
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,990
是的
Yeah,

562
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,320
但我不认为我们可以依靠
But I don't think we can rely on kenny

563
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,420
肯尼来发号施令
To give the order, though.

564
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,250
我们没有给机会他发挥
We don't give him a choice.

565
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,320
你们说什么呢
What are you talking about?

566
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,750
什么发号施令
What order?

567
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,390
不  不  慢着
Oh, no, wait a minute.

568
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,020
你们不是想要攻击别的飞船吧
You're not thinking about attacking the other ship?

569
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,150
听着  这是唯一让他们分散注意的途径
Look, it's the only way to keep them occupied

570
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,450
给我们充裕的时间登上敌舰
Long enough to get on board,

571
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,750
救出泰勒  再返回
Get teyla, and get back.

572
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,150
但这十分冒险
But it's also incredibly risky.

573
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,250
敌我舰队都有被摧毁的危险
I mean, either of the ships could be destroyed.

574
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,390
我们只要保证
Well, we'll just make sure

575
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,990
在这发生之前把她救出
We get her out of there before that happens.

576
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,050
我知道成功的几率
Look, I realize the odds

577
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,820
实在不高  罗德尼
Aren't exactly in our favor, rodney,

578
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,520
但我们再不采取行动
But the longer we wait to get teyla,

579
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,150
就再也救不出她了
The more likely it is we never will.

580
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,220
我们只有冒险一搏了
We just have to keep all of our options open.

581
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,920
我们已到达捕食场了
We have reached the feeding ground.

582
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,320
他们会尝试提出要谈判
They will attempt to negotiate a concession,

583
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,550
但你必须坚定立场
But you must stand firm.

584
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,190
他们会威胁要攻击
They may even threaten to attack,

585
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,290
但他们也和我们一样
But they will not want to fight

586
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,120
不愿战斗
Any more than we do.

587
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,650
那艘飞船尝试和我们联系
The other hive is trying to contact us.

588
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,350
别管他们  准备攻击
Ignore them. charge weapons.

589
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,020
你要莫名地发动进攻吗
You wish to attack unprovoked?

590
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,650
这并非毫无理由
We were provoked.

591
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,020
他们入侵了我们的领地
They have encroached upon our territory.

592
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,990
我要消灭他们
I want them destroyed.

593
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,820
马上
Now!

594
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,050
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

595
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,120
你说呢
What does it look like?

596
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
我叫你和他们谈判
I told you to talk to them.

597
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
你也叫我不要暴露懦弱的一面
You also told me to show no weakness.

598
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,790
他们还击了
They're returning fire.

599
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,990
我们船体受伤了
We're taking hull damage.

600
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,220
派出小战机
Deploy the darts.

601
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,020
这种情况下
Under these conditions,

602
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,550
他们会损失惨重的
They will suffer heavy losses.

603
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,350
我很清楚这样做的代价
I'm fully aware of the costs,

604
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,050
面对这样的入侵  我们就要坚定立场
But we must take a firm stance against intrusions such as this.

605
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,350
你这样做是有目的的
You're doing this on purpose,

606
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,320
要屠杀幽灵人
To kill wraith.

607
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,950
为数过半的先头部队已被击下
Half the first wave has been destroyed.

608
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,420
幸存的部队已飞近船身
But the survivors are now too close

609
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,950
不再受到火力威胁
To be affected by the ship's weapons,

610
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,290
它们可以随意攻击了
And they can attack at will.

611
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,020
但敌军也会派出小战机
Until the enemy launches their own darts

612
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,090
进行拦截
To intercept.

613
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,250
那也要一段时间之后
That will take time.

614
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,690
幸运的是我们已经来了个攻其不备
With any luck, we've caught them off guard.

615
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,950
他们不在那里
They're not here.

616
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,120
他们究竟在哪里
Where the hell are they?

617
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,220
他们转移了
They've moved,

618
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,050
去了另一个人口更密集的捕食场
To one of our more populated feeding grounds.

619
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,120
为什么
What for?

620
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,620
我怎么知道  我又不在他们那边
I do not know. I'm not on the ship.

621
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,190
如果要我猜的话
But if I had to guess,

622
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,150
我想大概他们去了捕食
I would say they've gone to cull.

623
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,790
现在怎办
What now?

624
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,850
还有选择吗  当然是追击他们
What else can we do? we go after them.

625
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,720
如果他们转移到了超空间
If they jump into hyperspace,

626
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,050
我们不是要失去他们的行踪了吗
We're going to lose them again, right?

627
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,420
确实如此  托德的导航定位器
Pretty much. todd's locator beacon

628
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,650
在超空间会失效
Doesn't work in hyperspace.

629
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,790
我们该停止这你追我赶的游戏
We got to stop playing catch-up.

630
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,390
这星球有星门吗
Is there a stargate on that planet?

631
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,650
当然
Of course.

632
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,790
带我们去那里
Then drop us off.

633
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,650
在那里驾飞船去会快一点
We can get there faster in the jumper.

634
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,790
你打算怎么登上他们的飞船
How do you intend to get on board their ship?

635
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,220
这个不用你操心
Don't worry about it.

636
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,520
只管把我们带到最近的星门就好
Just get us to the nearest stargate.

637
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,590
女王陛下  现在我们的小战机在数量上是以一敌二
My queen, our darts are outnumbered two to one.

638
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,220
如果我们不把他们召回
If we do not recall them now,

639
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,490
他们会被全歼的
They will be wiped out.

640
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,090
当联盟统治银河系时
And their sacrifice will be remembered

641
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,920
他们就会永载史册
When this alliance rules the galaxy.

642
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,620
怎么回事
What was that?

643
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,120
我们失去了中央武器阵列
We just lost the medial weapons array.

644
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,020
继续用其它武器攻击
Keep firing all other batteries.

645
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,850
我们马上就可以看到他们了
All right, we should be coming up on them now.

646
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,990
等等  怎么会有两批人马
Wait a minute, there's two of them.

647
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,650
什么
What?

648
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,190
他们在互相攻击
And they're fighting.

649
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,350
还是以命相搏啊
They're not pulling any punches, either.

650
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,690
继续找信号
Still picking up that signal?

651
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,750
好的
Yeah.

652
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,020
没错  就是那个
All right, it's that one.

653
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,420
形势不妙啊
They're not doing so good.

654
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,850
你什么意思
What do you mean?

655
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,120
他们肯定是失去了大部分武器
They must've lost some of their weapons.

656
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,250
我是说  他们快要弹尽粮绝了
I mean, they're seriously outgunned.

657
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,450
我们是时候挺身而出了
We got to do something.

658
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,590
上周我和泽兰卡谈过
You know, just last week I was talking to zelenka

659
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,850
飞船用的代达罗斯号辐射系统
About trying to reverse-engineer

660
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,120
的能源回溯问题
A  daedalus  beaming system for the jumpers.

661
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,420
然后呢
And?

662
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,550
这个  我们还毫无结果
Oh, well, no, we're nowhere near close.

663
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,150
我想说的是这个阿斯加德技术
I mean, the asgard technology's

664
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,590
复杂到难以想象
Incredibly complicated--

665
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,620
你现在说这个有什么意义
What the hell are you bringing this up for now?

666
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,820
我是指这东西可能
I'm just saying that this would be

667
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,090
非常适合这种状况
The perfect situation for something like...

668
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,920
大家坚持下
all right, everybody hold on.

669
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,950
我们要进去了
We're going in.

670
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,950
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

671
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,050
我要力挽狂澜
Trying to tip the scales a little.

672
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,590
你疯啦  他们可以看见我们
Are you nuts? they can see us!

673
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
这样有用吗
Think that did it?

674
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,250
试过就知道了
We're about to find out.

675
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,490
这完全不可能
That's impossible.

676
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,220
敌舰刚刚爆炸了
The enemy hive just exploded.

677
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,520
干得好  我的女王
Well done, my queen.

678
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,920
也许下一次
Perhaps next time,

679
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
你就不应该这么早怀疑我的策略
You will not be so quick to question my tactics.

680
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,250
召回飞船
Recall the darts.

681
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,190
飞船正在返回中
Darts are heading back.

682
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,320
舱门已打开
Bay doors are open.

683
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,820
机会来了
All right, that's our cue.

684
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,720
我要进去
I'm going in.

685
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,250
我们要去哪里?
where do we go?

686
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,590
不知道
I don't know.

687
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,390
你这时什么意思
What do you mean, you don't know?

688
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,490
这个难以言传
It's hard to tell.

689
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,590
很像不在这一层
I think we're on the wrong level.

690
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,720
而且信号四处游荡
Plus, the signal keeps moving around.

691
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,950
至少托德还活着是件好事
That's a good sign todd's alive.

692
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,850
你还没说泰勒到底在哪呢
Still doesn't tell us anything about teyla.

693
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,050
好吧
All right.

694
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,820
我想可能是这
It's this way. I think.

695
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,190
我们要转移一下了
We're going to have to circle back.

696
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,920
太好了  此路又不通
Oh, great, I got to figure this out all over again?

697
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,990
有巡逻队来了
Another patrol coming this way.

698
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,150
现在该怎么办
So, what are we going to do?

699
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,420
只剩华山一条路了
We got no choice.

700
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,990
走吧
Let's move.

701
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,720
哪边
Which way?

702
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,850
我觉得答案在那里
I guess that answers that.

703
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,150
报告女王
Inform the queen.

704
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,890
有人入侵
We have intruders.

705
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,750
怎么办
Now what?

706
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,090
我猜得话
Well, if I had to guess,

707
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,090
我们会被抓到女王面前
I'd say we'll be taken in front of the queen,

708
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,220
严刑拷打获取信息
Who will demand answers

709
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,290
不然就拿我们下饭
And threaten to feed on us.

710
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,720
我只是希望到时
At which time,

711
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,250
可以有点锦囊妙计来金蝉脱壳
I hope to have plan to get us out of here.

712
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,490
你真会让人安心
Very reassuring.

713
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,590
是泰勒  她还活着
It's teyla. she's alive.

714
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,350
罗德尼  小声点
rodney, quiet.

715
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,390
你们先下去
Leave us.

716
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,150
约翰  若楠  罗德尼
John, ronon, rodney,

717
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,890
见到你们实在太好了
It is good to see you,

718
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,050
不过你们不应该来的
But you should not have come for me.

719
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,120
怎么了  发生什么事了
Why? what's going on?

720
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,420
我迟点再解释
I'll explain later,

721
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,420
不过现在千万不要想着逃跑
But you must not attempt to escape.

722
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,050
你们不会有危险的
You're in no danger.

723
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,750
我成了这艘舰的女王
I'm now queen of this hive.

724
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,220
你说什么
Wait, what?

725
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,420
说来话长
It is a long story.

726
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,920
不  我们有飞船在这  随时可以离开啊
No, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now.

727
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,050
不  我要把我的位置巩固下来
No, I must solidify my position first.

728
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,420
这时唯一的机会
It is the only chance we have

729
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,950
可以让联盟成功接受治疗
To ensure the alliance will accept the treatment.

730
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,350
否则所有努力都打水漂了
Otherwise, this will all have been for nothing.

731
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,050
好吧
All right.

732
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,550
咱们只能继续玩下去了
We'll let it play out.

733
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,100
我的女王
My queen...

734
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

735
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,470
谁允许你来我寝室的
Who authorized you to wait in my quarters?

736
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,200
我不请自到的
I let myself in.

737
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,500
有点事要跟你私下商量
I needed to see you in private.

738
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,530
我现在不想商量什么
I do not wish to speak right now.

739
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,570
晚点再来吧
Come back later.

740
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,730
恐怕我不能服从了
I'm afraid I can't do that.

741
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,470
我是你的女王  我命令你
I am your queen. I command you--

742
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,830
你不是女王
You are not my queen.

743
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,330
你居然敢这样跟我说话
How dare you speak to me like this.

744
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,830
还不赶快给我消失
Remove yourself from my sight immediately.

745
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,940
我看到你和亚特兰帝斯的囚犯在聊天
I saw you talking with the prisoners from atlantis.

746
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,570
那有如何
And?

747
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,470
我不可以审问我舰上的囚犯?
I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?

748
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,670
你当然可以
Oh, you may,

749
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,870
不过你叫他们囚犯也太奇怪了吧
Though it is odd that you refer to them

750
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,830
我可是凑巧听到了你们的谈话内容哦
I overheard what you said to them.

751
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,530
你们是互相认识的
You knew them, and they knew you,

752
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,170
我还扪心自问
And I asked myself,

753
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,940
这怎么可能呢
"how is such a thing possible?"

754
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:04,240
你一上战舰时我就怀疑你了
I suspected you right from the moment you set foot upon my ship,

755
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,330
但那仅仅只是怀疑
And against my better judgment,

756
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,530
我让你登上飞船
I allowed you to remain onboard

757
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,700
你却暗通外敌
While you committed treachery after treachery.

758
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,470
保卫战舰是我的职责
It was my duty to defend the ship,

759
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,370
但我失败了
And I failed.

760
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,600
恐怕你要倒台了  女王陛下
I'm afraid your reign is over, my queen.

761
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,730
他不会再打扰你了
He'll not be bothering you any further.

762
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,970
谢谢
Thank you.

763
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,300
我的母舰几分钟前到了
My hive arrived moments ago.

764
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,500
已经安排好谢帕德中校和
I've arranged for colonel sheppard,

765
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,600
若楠以及麦凯博士
Ronon, and dr. mckay

766
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,730
的快速转移了
To be transferred there immediately.

767
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,800
太好了
Good.

768
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,940
我什么时候可以离开啊
When do I join them?

769
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,570
等一切完结以后
As soon as this is all over.

770
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,870
另外  我也要离开一阵
...and thus, I will be taking my leave of you,

771
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,370
回到母舰上
And returning to my former hive.

772
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,630
我会留下我所信任的指挥官
I am leaving behind my trusted commander.

773
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,270
让我再说清楚点
Let me be clear,

774
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,970
你们仍将被列入保护对象
You will still fall under my protection,

775
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,330
不过当我不在时
But in my absence,

776
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,500
你们要像服从我一样服从他的命令
You will heed his every order as if it were my own.

777
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,670
他说的话
When he speaks,

778
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,940
就代表我说的话
It is as though I am speaking through him.

779
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,100
明白了吗
Is that understood?

780
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,870
尊命  女王
Yes, my queen.

781
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,230
好
Good.

782
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,300
是时候了
Then it is time.

783
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,600
护送我去运输船吧
Escort me to my transport.

784
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,570
女王起驾
The queen departs.

785
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,400
干得好
Well done.

786
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,830
我相信你已经排除一切怀疑了
I believe you've managed to allay

787
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,800
你要记住我们这么做的目的
Just remember why we did this,

788
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,470
是为了让尽可能多的幽灵
To disseminate dr. keller's treatment

789
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,430
愿意接受凯勒医生的治疗
To as many wraith as possible.

790
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,570
当然了
Of course.

791
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,670
但我觉得应该让事情
Although I think it might be wise

792
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,630
先冷静一下比较好
To let matters settle for a time first.

793
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,700
要多久
How much time?

794
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,970
很快
Not long.

795
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,370
你不会打算违背协议吧
You're not planning on going back on our agreement,

796
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,770
不  不会的
No, no.

797
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,870
我是说你新官上任就进行
I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda

798
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,800
这么激进的计划会不会....
So soon after the change in leadership...

799
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,000
没错  可能会有不和谐的声音
Well, it may invite unwelcome questions.

800
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,070
好的
Fine.

801
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,100
很好
Very well--

802
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,570
不过你要牢记
But bear in mind

803
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,770
在这艘船上
That as far as this crew is concerned,

804
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,330
我还是女王
I am still their queen.

805
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,670
当然
Oh, yes.

806
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,000
我会一直关注你的表现
I will be watching you,

807
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,070
一旦发现你有什么越轨行为
And should you step out of line,

808
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,200
我会毫不犹豫的把你革除
I will not hesitate to make a reappearance

809
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,170
很好
Very well.

810
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,400
永久性除掉
Permanently.

811
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,430
你怎么把她变成这样了  医生
What have you done to her, doc?

812
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,940
很搞笑
Very funny.

813
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,800
你感觉怎样
How you feeling?

814
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,170
好多了
Better.

815
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,600
还有点酸痛
Still some soreness,

816
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,270
不过大体已经没事了
But for the most part, it's gone.

817
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,600
很好
Good.

818
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
好的  我四处走走
Well, I have rounds,

819
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,800
晚点再回来看你
But I'll come and check on you later.

820
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,770
别让他太为难你噢
Make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.

821
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,370
你确定你没事吧
Sure you're feeling okay?

822
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,300
是的
Yes.

823
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,370
谢谢
Thank you.

824
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,130
没有什么残留的本能吧
No lingering desires to feed on anything?

825
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,300
只想吃固体食物
Only on solid food.

826
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,600
凯勒医生配的混合剂
The blended concoctions given to me by dr. keller

827
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,300
好像效果一般
Are not very satisfying.

828
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,470
才有2周而已
Well, it's only been two weeks.

829
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,730
再耐心等等吧
Give it some time.

830
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,130
听着
Look, um...

831
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,500
我还没有机会告诉你
I haven't had the chance to tell you

832
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,270
你所做的一切....
That what you did, uh, took...

833
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,570
这个  需要一点勇气
You know, a lot of guts.

834
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,170
我很高兴最终有个完美的结局
I'm just glad it worked out for the best.

835
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,000
托德那儿还有什么新消息吗
Has there been any further word from todd?

836
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,100
还没
Not really.

837
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,370
过几周我们还会有一次会面
We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks

838
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,170
讨论基因治疗计划
About this whole gene therapy thing.

839
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,200
听说他完全巩固了
Word has it

840
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,830
自己在联盟的领导地位
He's solidified his position as, uh,"leader" of the alliance.

841
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,000
什么
What?

842
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,800
你对托德成功控制整个联盟
Do you not find it strange.That as a result of all of this,

843
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,100
感到很意外吧
Todd now personally has control of that entire alliance?

844
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,730
你觉得这是他一直预谋的
You think that was his plan all along, huh?

845
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,870
这个我考虑过
The thought had crossed my mind.

846
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,270
是啊
Yeah.

847
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,670
不管怎样
Regardless,

848
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,100
形势总算有点好转吧
I think we're better off than we were before.

849
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,230
是的
Yes.

850
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,630
我很赞同你
I suppose you're right.

851
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,630
休息下吧
Get some rest.

852
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,800
我等会回来看你
I'll come back and check on you.
