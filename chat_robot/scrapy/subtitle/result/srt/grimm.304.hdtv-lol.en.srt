***

2
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:21,110
 Ice-cold beer
everybody's here tonight 

3
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:22,878
 ice-cold beer 

4
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:26,013
 everybody's here tonight 

5
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:29,848
Wow, that was so bad, you guys.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,523
I think I threw up
in my mouth a little.

7
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,384
We probably scared
all of the fish away.

8
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:36,819
I never catch anything anyway.

9
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:38,654
What, two beautiful women
don't rate?

10
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,024
You kidding me?
Pretty thing like you,

11
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,158
you're not even a keeper.

12
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:43,393
I should toss you in right now.

13
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:50,365
So I'm gonna get
some more beer.

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,333
Okay.

15
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,601
That's good.

16
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:04,072
Oh. Ooh, boy.

17
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,842
Oh, what do you want?

18
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:09,544
No, no, no, no.

19
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:13,181
Ahh.

20
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,191
You little pervert!

21
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,926
What do you think you're doing?

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,431
You were not
just walking around.

23
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:34,201
I saw you spying on us.
I'm gonna tell dad.

23
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:35,701
no

23
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:36,736
you can't

24
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,372
If you don't want me
to tell him,

25
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,541
you need to get
your butt outta here.

25
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:42,991
not him

25
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,391
anybody***

26
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,218
What do you care about Jake?

27
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,254
I mean, he doesn't even know
that you exist.

27
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,354
i love him

28
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:01,093
Look, you're never going to be
the same as them, you know,

29
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:02,795
so you need to stop
trying to become

30
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,131
something that you're not.
Now, go.

31
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:26,484
What, no beer?

32
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:29,019
Changed my mind.

33
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,835
What's the matter?
You scared of me?

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,162
That was incredible.

35
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,038
You're incredible.

36
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:02,743
You're not so bad yourself.

37
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,482
No!

38
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,954
No! Help! Help!

39
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,056
- Get out of the water!
- What's going on?

40
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,057
Get out!

41
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,425
Help!

42
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,099
Dan! Dan!

44
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,522
Dan.

45
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,527
Dan!

46
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,397
Dan! Dan!

47
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,701
Well, this is
the last of your stuff.

48
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,436
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

49
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:02,305
Whoa, wait, what?

50
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,475
Of course this is a good idea.
This is a great idea,

51
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,344
- 'cause you and I...
- No, no.

52
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,679
- What?
- Not that.

53
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:13,382
I'm just... I'm saying
I-I have so much stuff,

54
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:16,385
and your house suddenly seems
a lot smaller.

55
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,921
No, there's plenty of room.
Plus, look.

56
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:22,025
It's a golden opportunity for me
to get rid of some stuff.

57
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,159
What are you going to
get rid of?

58
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:28,798
Oh, you kidding?
Any number of... like...

59
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:30,533
or...

60
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,569
you know, like this,
for example.

61
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,837
Well, that's a start.

62
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,573
This was presented personally
to my great, great Uncle Bernard

63
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,142
by Sigmund Riefler himself
when Bernard retired

64
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,545
from the clemens Riefler
clock works in Munich.

65
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,614
Sigmund was the son
of the founder clemens Riefler,

66
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,183
but it was actually Sigmund who
invented the Riefler escapement,

67
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:51,185
which is a mechanical device
for precision pendulum clocks.

68
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,122
And I actually have one
right over there.

69
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,424
So...

70
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,361
I think everything should stay
right where it is.

71
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,533
Even me.

72
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

73
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,946
I cut up some fruit.
You want some?

74
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,448
Yeah, please,
and a lot of coffee.

75
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:21,484
Got you covered.

76
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,359
What?

77
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:32,428
Nothing.

78
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,398
That's what makes this
so great.

79
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:38,501
Yeah, I really missed
all this, like, everyday stuff.

80
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:40,536
Mmm.

81
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:43,472
I missed that too.

82
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,574
See you after work.

83
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,943
Hey, hey, what about
the doctor's reports?

84
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,146
Oh, he was supposed to send me
the email yesterday.

85
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,481
Just check my email,
see if it came in.

86
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:56,085
Tell me if I'm still alive.

87
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,320
Gillnetter
out on government island

88
00:07:57,354 --> 00:07:58,955
fished him out of the river
this morning.

89
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:01,157
I cross-checked
with missing persons.

90
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,227
A report was filed yesterday
matching his description,

91
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,130
name listed as Daniel Hopkins.

92
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,598
Same as we got.

93
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,834
Report also lists
as a possible assault.

94
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,802
Looks pretty beat up.

95
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:15,538
Probably from river debris.

96
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,540
I don't know about these marks
on his ankles.

97
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,943
Yeah, same here too,
like scratches.

98
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,444
Yeah, scratches or claws.

99
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,846
Maybe something
pulled him under.

100
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,316
What are we talking,
a loch ness monster?

101
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,486
- Who filed the report?
- Uh, Jake Barnes.

102
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,387
Filed last night
at 9:15.

103
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:34,491
Let's talk to him.

104
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,461
One second.

105
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:43,166
- Jake Barnes?
- Yeah.

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,902
I'm Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

107
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,371
You filed a missing persons
report for Daniel Hopkins.

108
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:49,445
Oh, God, did you find him?

109
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:52,142
Mind if we talk inside?

110
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,745
Yeah, sure.

111
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:02,319
So did he make it out?

112
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:05,356
Afraid not, they discovered
Dan's body this morning.

113
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,358
Oh, man.

114
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:12,329
Oh, man, I was afraid of this.

115
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:16,467
You know, he was...
he was pulled underwater.

116
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,035
By what?

117
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,370
I don't know, I just saw
something, it got me too.

118
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,605
All right, we're gonna
need you to go over

119
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,340
everything that happened
yesterday...

120
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:26,076
where you were, who was there,
anything you can remember.

121
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,278
Oh, jeez.

122
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,213
He's really dead,
I can't believe this.

123
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:32,015
All right, was anyone else
there with you?

124
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,151
No, not at first.

125
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:37,321
We were fishing
up near steelhead,

126
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,891
and... and then these two girls
showed up.

127
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,325
- You get their names?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,994
Sarah and Anna.

129
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:44,395
They were sisters, I didn't...

130
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,063
I'm sorry,
I didn't get their last name.

131
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:47,698
You must have got a number,
right?

132
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,833
I never had a chance.

133
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,368
I mean, one thing
led to another.

134
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:52,336
Did things get sexual?

135
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,337
Yeah.

136
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:55,073
Who were you with?

137
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,874
Sarah.
Dan was with Anna.

138
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:00,544
We were all in the river.
Sarah and I...

139
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:06,217
Anyway, afterwards,
we were swimming, and...

140
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:09,120
that's when I heard Dan.

141
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:12,023
He was screaming,
and Anna looked really scared,

142
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:13,691
and she was yelling for us
to get out of the river,

143
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:16,994
and... And then something...

144
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:19,063
something pulled him under.

145
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,364
Did you try to get to him?

146
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:22,633
Of course, but...

147
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,036
I mean, and then something
pulled me under too.

148
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:30,207
And then that's the last thing
I remember.

149
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:34,044
Look, I told all this
to the police last night.

150
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,079
I don't think they believed me.

151
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:40,917
How'd you manage to get out?

152
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,786
I'm not sure.

153
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,589
I mean, all I know is
there was this...

154
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,090
This what?

155
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,394
Girl, I think, but you know,

156
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:53,062
I mean, I'm not even sure
she was real, man.

157
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,630
I mean, I was still
just trying to breathe.

158
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:55,798
It wasn't Sarah or Anna?

159
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,333
No, this one was younger,

160
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:01,103
but I don't know, man,
I don't know what I saw.

161
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:05,674
How'd you get those scratches?

162
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,843
I'm telling you,
I mean, it felt like something,

163
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,511
like, grabbed me.

164
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,246
Okay, what kind of something?

165
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,715
I mean, it's a little hard
to focus when you're drowning.

166
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:14,716
Why don't you take us
to the place

167
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,350
where this all happened?

168
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,852
My car was parked
behind these trees.

169
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,587
We came down here
and made a campfire.

170
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:21,790
My clothes were right here,
Dan's too.

171
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,825
I mean, I looked all up
and down the river for him.

172
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,294
I should have gone in after him,
but after what happened...

173
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,595
Is this where you went
into the river?

174
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,763
Yes.

175
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,365
And where'd you get pulled out?

176
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,200
Down there, I guess.

177
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,336
What happened to the girls
you were with?

178
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,004
I don't know, I...

179
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,739
I mean, I thought maybe
they got grabbed too,

180
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:40,808
but then their clothes
were gone when I came to.

181
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:42,643
You said there was another
girl that pulled you out.

182
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,678
What happened to her?

183
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,514
Uh, I think she ran off

184
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:47,815
as soon as I was
out of the river.

185
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:49,484
Now, when'd you call 911?

186
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:50,851
Soon as I got back up here.

187
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:53,154
I couldn't find my phone,
so I used Dan's.

188
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:54,755
How'd the girls get here?

189
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,391
Uh, just from back there.

190
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,860
- You didn't see a car?
- No.

191
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,797
Hank!

192
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:06,233
Police!

193
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,402
Stop!

194
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,872
I'm not gonna hurt you!

195
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:40,506
What happened?

196
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,108
She dove in.

197
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:45,244
- You see her come up?
- Yeah, about 50 yards out.

198
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,513
She swam all that way
underwater?

199
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,115
What are we dealing with?

200
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,218
Hey, hey, I think that's
the girl I saw when I came up.

201
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:55,254
- Where'd she go?
- I'm not sure.

202
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,125
River patrol
didn't find any bodies

203
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,327
matching Jake's description
of Sarah, Anna,

204
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,362
or the girl Nick saw
jump into the river.

205
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:04,964
They're probably still alive.
Somebody went back

206
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:07,166
to the campsite and took
the sisters' clothes.

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,601
Jake said they were scared.

208
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,069
They probably
got out of the river,

209
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,103
grabbed their stuff, and ran.

210
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,504
The girl I saw
go into the river

211
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,374
was a lot more than a girl
when she got under the water.

212
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,976
- You know what she was?
- Not yet.

213
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:20,279
Let's round up
the unusual suspects.

214
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,050
Oui?

215
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,121

In the river?

233
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:51,772
You know, I'm not really
that much of a water person.

234
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:55,609
I'm really more of a Mountain
and land kind of lubber.

235
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,245
There was this girl I knew
in Seattle, she was a naiad,

236
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,913
lived out on Bainbridge island.

237
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,349
She's was kind of weird,

238
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,451
nice, though.

239
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,554
But she could swim, man,
like a fish.

240
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,823
Uh, naiad?

241
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:11,726
Oh, naiads.
Yeah, no, I've heard of naiads.

242
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,328
I've never seen one, though.

243
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,830
What are they, like,
a water nymph or something?

244
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,166
Sort of.
Very close-knit families.

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,734
They never stray
far from the water.

246
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,969
That's probably why Jake
can't describe who saved him.

247
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,039
I bet you'd have something
about them in your trailer.

248
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:26,608
Well, at least we have an idea
of what we're dealing with now.

249
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,644
Yeah.

250
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,815
Right, we should be going.

251
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,252
Looks like you guys
have a lot left to do.

252
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:38,087
Yeah, we do.
We sure do.

253
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:40,023
Hey, you know,
but if you guys need any help,

254
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,525
you know, in the trailer...

255
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,963
I mean, I probably shouldn't
leave with so much left to do.

256
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,932
- Go ahead.
- Are you sure?

257
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,400
I mean, it's not gonna take
that long.

258
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,670
Please, take him.

259
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,705
Thanks.

260
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:07,150
Oh, listen to this,
it's dated 1755.

261
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,319
Looks like a Grimm working
for the East India company.

262
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:14,489
"A strange event aboard
the merchant vessel Doddington.

263
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:18,293
"Jory, our third mate,
disappeared overnight.

264
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:22,765
"The rest of the crew
grows superstitious.

265
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,835
"Recently,
Jory had taken to raving

266
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,703
"about a beautiful woman

267
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:31,340
"swimming alongside our ship
like a fish.

268
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,509
"I have decided to stand
the man's watch

269
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,878
"as we round the cape

270
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:41,484
"to see if there is
any truth to these rumors.

271
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,153
"It turns out Jory
was no lunatic.

272
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:48,391
"I saw the creature
known to my kin as the naiad.

273
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,359
"After capturing it in a net,

274
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,695
"I was able
to haul the creature aboard,

275
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:55,798
"where she donned
her human shape.

276
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:58,100
"I find her mesmerizing

277
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:01,503
"and have kept her hidden
from the Captain and crew.

278
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:04,607
"After some hours on board,

279
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:09,211
"the woman's skin
began to dry and peel.

280
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,379
"She begs me to return her
to the sea,

281
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:14,816
"but I am determined
to prove Jory true.

282
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,654
"I have questioned her
regarding his disappearance,

283
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:22,157
"but she refuses to betray
any secrets of her kind

284
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,027
and only pleads to be

285
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,829
Oh, wow.

286
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:30,399
"At sunrise this morning,
the creature died

287
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:33,735
"from what I assume
was severe dehydration.

288
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,438
"I'm afraid whatever secrets
the naiad was keeping

289
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,906
have died with her."

290
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:40,876
It's wu.

291
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,345
Got something for us?

292
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,512
We ran the number

293
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:45,514
from Jake Barnes'
missing cell phone.

294
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,917
GPS puts it
at the andersen marina.

295
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:49,072
That's not far up the river

296
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,052
from where they went swimming.

297
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,086
How you want to handle this?

298
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,521
Meet us at the marina.

299
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:53,677
We should bring Jake along

300
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,925
in case he can I.D.
whoever took the phone.

301
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,569
- You ever been here?
- No.

302
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:09,104
You know anybody
who lives here?

303
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,839
Not that I know of.

304
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,875
- Stay in the car.
- See if you recognize anybody.

305
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:23,652
The phone's still on...
In one of these houseboats.

306
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:39,802
Looks like this one here.

307
00:18:41,404 --> 00:18:45,875
Sir, I'm Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

308
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,077
We're following up an
investigation about a drowning.

309
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:51,146
Need to ask you a few questions.
Who drowned?

310
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,781
Can I have your name, sir?

311
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,583
Abel Mahario.

312
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,284
I don't know anybody
who drowned.

313
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,686
We're tracking
a stolen cell phone.

314
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,988
It was taken from where
the victim went into the river.

315
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:02,825
The signal led us here.
Mind if we take a look inside?

316
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,261
I haven't done anything wrong,
and I told you

317
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,462
I don't know anybody
who drowned,

318
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:07,763
so this must be a mistake.

319
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:10,399
Should be easy enough
to find out.

320
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,602
Calling the stolen
cell phone now.

321
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:17,606
That sounds like
probable cause to me.

322
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,875
We're going inside, sir.

323
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,913
Sir, will you stay right here?

324
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,795
So how'd Jake's phone
get in here?

325
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,939
Girl on the left looks like
the one I chased into the river.

326
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,975
- The naiad?
- Let's find out.

327
00:19:58,348 --> 00:19:59,514
Sir, do you want
to take a crack

328
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,450
at how this cell phone got
in your house?

329
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,318
I have no idea
how it got there.

330
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:05,954
This girl,
is she your daughter?

331
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:08,357
Why?
Elly didn't do anything.

332
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,292
She may have been in the area
at the time of the drowning.

333
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,461
We need talk to her,
see if she saw anything.

334
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,662
Well, you can't talk to her.

335
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:15,331
Sir, this is
a police investigation.

336
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:19,068
She's deaf, so unless
one of you can sign...

337
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:35,551
Hey, Sarah. Sarah.

338
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:38,754
Sarah, hey.
Yeah, it's me, Jake.

339
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,723
Sarah, hey.

340
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,026
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, guys.

341
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,195
Guys, guys, wait.
Whoa, hold on.

342
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,997
Look, they found Dan's body.

343
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,098
I don't know
what you're talking about.

344
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,901
Dan, he drowned.
The police are here.

345
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,770
- We have to go.
- Wait, I'm sorry,

346
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:57,174
did you hear what I just said?
Dan's dead!

347
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,643
Why don't you just
leave us alone?

348
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,945
Guys, these are the girls
I was telling you about.

349
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,047
Sarah and Anna.
Sarah, Anna, get in the house.

350
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:05,148
Everyone's gonna stay
right here

351
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,350
until we're done
questioning them.

352
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:07,351
- Who was with Dan?
- Anna.

353
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:08,518
I was swimming with Sarah.

354
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:09,553
I don't know
what he's talking about.

355
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:10,988
What, are you crazy?

356
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,489
Look, we were together
yesterday.

357
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:13,824
All right, we're gonna need
to see some identification.

358
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,058
My girls didn't do
anything wrong.

359
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:17,961
I.Ds.
Now, you wanna tell us

360
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,963
where you were
yesterday afternoon and evening?

361
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,566
- We were here with our dad.
- They were with me and Dan.

362
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,968
Anna?

363
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,269
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

364
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:26,403
It's a police investigation,
sir.

365
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:27,705
I need you to stop right there.

366
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:28,973
Investigation of what?

367
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,908
- Who are you?
- We live over there.

368
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,822
Then I suggest you go home
and stay out of it,

369
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:34,879
unless you want my sergeant to
put you in the back of his car.

370
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:37,581
I already told you,
my girls were home last night.

371
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,583
You recognize this girl?

372
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:42,086
Yeah, I mean, that looks like
the girl who saved me.

373
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,288
You want to explain how this
cell phone got in your house?

374
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:45,683
That's my phone.
They had my phone?

375
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,992
Fine, you don't want
to explain here, I get it.

376
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:50,061
Sarah, Anna, you go
back to the precinct with us.

377
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:53,098
Let's go.
This way, please.

378
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:58,203
Anyone else want to go?

379
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:06,878
Let's get back in the car.

380
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:09,014
Listen, you can't do this.

381
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:12,083
Sir, we can make
the same arrangements for you,

382
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:13,518
unless you want to clear
this up right now.

383
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:14,986
You don't understand.

384
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,594
Well, I guess we have more
to talk about than I thought.

385
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:25,830
But I'm going to talk
to your daughters first,

386
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:28,866
give you some time
to think about it.

387
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,539
Damn it.

388
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:38,097
I told you I didn't want
this kind of trouble.

389
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,110
Why did you do it?

390
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:41,546
Because you forgot
where you come from. We haven't.

391
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,848
I haven't forgotten anything.

392
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:46,117
I know what it takes
for us to survive.

393
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:48,219
Your world died 200 years ago,

394
00:22:48,253 --> 00:22:50,187
and now you've jeopardized
all of us

395
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:51,588
with this fundamental crap!

396
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,491
It was Elly, your daughter.

397
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:55,692
She pulled him out.

398
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,461
Which is how that phone
got in your house.

399
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:58,962
She has to be cut.

400
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:02,733
Are you crazy?
Nobody does that anymore.

401
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,901
Where we're from, they do,

402
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,802
and we don't have
these kinds of troubles.

403
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,871
And this is your fault,
old man.

404
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:11,041
This is what happens when you
don't raise your women right.

405
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:12,843
No, no, wait.

406
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:15,980
Please, she's just a girl.

407
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:18,216
I'm not gonna let you
touch her.

408
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:22,720
Who's gonna stop us?

409
00:23:24,623 --> 00:23:28,592
Jake says this is the girl
that pulled him out.

410
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:31,796
You want to tell us
what happened?

411
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,904
We're the only two here

412
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:43,040
who know what you
and your sister are.

413
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:44,541
I don't know
what you're talking about.

414
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:48,345
You're naiads.

415
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,314
You really want to spend
the next 24 hours

416
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:52,268
drying out in a holding cell?
'Cause that's where

417
00:23:52,283 --> 00:23:55,819
you're going
if you don't start talking.

418
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,687
I have nothing to say.

419
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:00,257
Well, let's hope
your sister does.

420
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,935
Jake saw Dan pulled under.

421
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,408
Jake is only alive
because Elly saved him.

422
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:19,410
That means you either
saw what happened

423
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:22,780
or were involved
with what happened.

424
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:26,284
You need to tell us, Anna.

425
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:32,256
Because I know naiads can only
be out of the water for so long.

426
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:40,564
And you will die in here
if you don't start talking.

427
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,601
Who pulled Jake
under the water?

428
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:48,439
Who killed Dan?

429
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:55,813
Knowing what they are
and what will happen to them,

430
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:57,015
we don't want to keep them
locked up.

431
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:58,449
But they're not giving us
much choice.

432
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:00,284
At the very least,
they know what happened

433
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,053
and didn't report it.
So they might know who did it.

434
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:05,924
That's the problem, we think
they're protecting somebody.

435
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,358
How much time
do you think they have?

436
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:09,560
I doubt they'll survive
the night.

437
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,563
And what about the girl
who saved your victim

438
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,098
from the river?
Can't find her.

439
00:25:13,132 --> 00:25:16,234
So how do we explain two
dead women in our holding cells?

440
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:18,103
We can't very well say
they're naiads.

441
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:19,904
We'll get blamed for something
we had no control over.

442
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:21,873
And they're playing
a very serious game.

443
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:25,243
If they're involved,
what do we do, just let 'em go?

444
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:28,413
No.
This is their problem, not ours.

445
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:31,617
If they choose to die,
we let the M.E. explain it.

446
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:33,385
Just 'cause they're wesen,
it doesn't entitle them

447
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,387
to special treatment.

448
00:25:36,722 --> 00:25:39,490
Yeah?

449
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:41,760
Girls' father, Abel Mahario,
is here.

450
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:44,095
Apparently, he wants to talk.

451
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,933
I killed that boy.
I did it.

452
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,568
You need to arrest me
and let my daughters go.

453
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:53,171
- How'd you kill him?
- I drowned him.

454
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:54,506
Why?

455
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,842
I have my reasons.

456
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,677
I know you didn't do it
for a cell phone.

457
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:00,312
We know you want
to save your girls,

458
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:03,149
but we'd rather leave here with
whoever's really responsible.

459
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:05,885
I am!
I told you I did it!

460
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,821
I-I pulled him underwater!

461
00:26:07,855 --> 00:26:09,689
- Were your daughters there too?
- No.

462
00:26:09,723 --> 00:26:12,158
- Jake Barnes says they were.
- Well, he's lying.

463
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:14,827
Why would he lie?

464
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:17,964
He just saw them.

465
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:19,132
Then they were there?

466
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,868
I saw those two boys
attacking my daughters,

467
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:23,469
and I did what I had to.

468
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:25,771
So you're telling us
you were saving your daughters?

469
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,741
They were being raped.

470
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,242
Then why did
your other daughter

471
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,644
pull Jake out of the water?

472
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:32,878
Who gave you the black eye?

473
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:34,280
Did you know she was there too?

474
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,847
What time did you get there?

475
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:38,449
- How did you get there?
- You walk? Take a car?

476
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:40,851
What did the other guy
look like, the one you killed?

477
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,020
Was he tall, short,
fat, black, white?

478
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:45,388
We need some details here.

479
00:26:45,422 --> 00:26:47,189
Why don't you take us
to the place where it happened?

480
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,690
You see how difficult this gets

481
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,192
when you're not telling
the truth?

482
00:26:50,226 --> 00:26:51,726
Why does it matter?

483
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,062
I'm offering my life
for my daughters'.

484
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:02,934
Not easy being a parent.

485
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,369
Yeah, but it could be
what we need.

486
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:07,071
Those girls may be ready
to throw their own lives away,

487
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,539
but they might not be so willing
when it's their dad's life

488
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:10,540
they're dealing with.

489
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:11,774
Use his confession as leverage?

490
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:14,309
Might be just as tough
being a daughter.

491
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:17,778
I guess we'll find out
if it's a loving family.

492
00:27:57,507 --> 00:28:00,242
You're the one
who saved my life.

493
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,910
What's your name?

494
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,878
Elly.

495
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:07,613
Elly?

496
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:10,783
Okay.

497
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:13,118
What are you doing here, Elly?

498
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:18,455
Oh, you're deaf?

499
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:25,193
But you can read my lips?

500
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:28,829
Okay.

501
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:31,932
Wow.

502
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:36,034
You know, I almost thought
I imagined you.

503
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:43,907
Um, the police need
to talk to you.

504
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:48,043
The police,
they're looking for you.

505
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:54,114
What are you doing?

506
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,949
You want to show me something?

507
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:58,884
Something about you?
Okay.

508
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:04,688
What are you doing?

509
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,124
You want to go swimming?

510
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:10,159
Huh? Now?

511
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:26,770
Whoa.

512
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,472
Elly.

513
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,644
Oh, my God.

514
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,682
You... you're what I saw.

515
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:45,985
My God, you're real?

516
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,086
No!

517
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:51,790
No! No!

518
00:29:57,894 --> 00:30:00,362
Hey!
What's going on down there?

519
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:01,596
- Mm!
- We gotta go.

520
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,701
The last in a long line of boxes.

521
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,803
What have we here?

522
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,271
- Oh, I'm not sure.
- Whoa.

523
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,745
That was
in my brother's apartment.

524
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:28,576
This is really...

525
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,846
It-it's interesting.
Oh, wow!

526
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,549
I have not seen that
since I was a kid.

527
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,184
Belonged to my grandparents.

528
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:39,420
They brought it
with them from Holland.

529
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,322
Wow.

530
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:46,460
Well, in that case, it should
sit in a place of honor.

531
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:54,601
Hey.
Don't try so hard.

532
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:56,236
I know this is a big deal
for you and me,

533
00:30:56,237 --> 00:31:00,607
moving in together,
but we have to be honest.

534
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,442
That is butt ugly.

535
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:04,911
- I know, but...
- But what?

536
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,281
I mean, maybe there's things
of mine that you don't like.

537
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:11,618
What are you afraid of?

538
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:13,019
Me.

539
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,354
Why?

540
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:17,757
There have been other...
you know,

541
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,960
but no one I ever even
considered moving in with.

542
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:22,294
Are you getting cold feet?

543
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:25,264
No. God, no.
I knew it would sound like that.

544
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:27,033
Stop.

545
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,435
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.

546
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:30,669
I just didn't want you
to think...

547
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,871
- stop thinking.
- Mm.

548
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:36,074
I love you, you love me,

549
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:40,278
and we both hate this.

550
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:42,780
And if you can't build
a relationship on hate...

551
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:45,783
Right, then...
I mean, what do you have?

552
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:47,418
Us.

553
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,963
Your father confessed
to everything.

554
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:00,566
You are free to go.
What?

555
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,002
What did...
what did he confess to?

556
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,503
The murder of Dan Hopkins

557
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,038
and the attempted murder
of Jake Barnes.

558
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,573
- That's a lie.
- You think we'd be

559
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,241
letting you go
if we didn't have a confession?

560
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:12,578
No. This isn't right.

561
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:14,079
Sarah, they're letting us go.

562
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,283
And arresting dad?
He'll die here.

563
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:18,951
We can talk about this at home.

564
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,853
It's dad, Anna.

565
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:23,890
Sarah, don't.

566
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,264
Dominic did it.

567
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,766
- Dominic?
- And Jesse too.

568
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,802
It's those two guys
from the marina.

569
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:39,806
They'll kill us, Sarah.

570
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:51,083
You don't have much time left.
We need to get you out of here.

571
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:58,757
Sarah, he's a Grimm.
You can't trust him.

572
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,727
I have no choice.

573
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:04,764
Let's go.

574
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:09,468
Anna, come on.

575
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:11,870
We didn't even know
they were there.

576
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:13,639
Dominic and Jesse?

577
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:17,342
They must have been
waiting for us in the river.

578
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:21,714
Dominic pulled Dan under,
and Jesse pulled Jake.

579
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:23,048
Why?

580
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,184
It was time
to start our families.

581
00:33:25,218 --> 00:33:27,499
You start your families
by killing two innocent victims?

582
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,355
That wasn't supposed to happen.

583
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:33,258
In the old days, maybe,
but we don't do that anymore.

584
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:36,395
At least we didn't...

585
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,365
Till Dominic and Jesse showed up
about six months ago.

586
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,901
- From where?
- Alaska.

587
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,302
Did you know them
prior to that?

588
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:48,039
No.
Our relationships are arranged.

589
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:51,176
Dominic and Jesse come
from a family that believe

590
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,713
in all of these...
Old traditions.

591
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:57,115
We didn't think that they would
actually do anything,

592
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,752
we just... we just thought
they were talking.

593
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:03,521
This is some kind of ritual?

594
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:07,292
I think that's what
they want us to think,

595
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,428
but it's more about revenge.

596
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:17,402
We can only conceive
and give birth in the water.

597
00:34:17,436 --> 00:34:20,405
Naiad men are born sterile.

598
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:22,741
They know we have to mate
with other men.

599
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,776
Otherwise, we'll die out.

600
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,913
I mean, they're not very happy
about it, but neither are we.

601
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:31,283
Well, I can see where that may
cause a little bit of tension.

602
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:35,487
Our men have to raise
the children of other men.

603
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:38,690
I mean, some of them
are okay with it, but...

604
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:42,260
Others aren't so...
Accepting.

605
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,268
It's Jake.
Hello?

606
00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:51,136
Detective Burkhardt?
It's Jake.

607
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,439
She was just here,
the girl who saved me.

608
00:34:54,474 --> 00:34:56,008
- Where are you?
- At my apartment.

609
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,743
She was in the pool.

610
00:34:57,777 --> 00:35:01,079
Those two guys from the marina,
they jumped me and took her.

611
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,314
Stay where you are.

612
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,549
We're gonna send some uniforms
your way.

613
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,085
Jesse and Dominic beat up Jake.

614
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,787
Elly was there,
and they took her.

615
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:10,689
Oh, my God,
they're gonna cut her.

616
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:12,757
- What?
- They'll cut the telae

617
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,225
between her fingers and toes.

618
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,328
It's how they used to banish
those that broke our laws.

619
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:17,629
Where would they take her?

620
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:22,000
- Where they can make an example
Home.

621
00:35:26,806 --> 00:35:28,540
You left us no other choice.

622
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:30,609
I know you can understand me.

623
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:32,544
This is for the good
of all of us.

624
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,279
Ugh!
Shouldn't have done that!

625
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:35,447
Now you're gonna get it!

626
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,822
Tie her legs.

627
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:46,325
You like their kind so much?
Now you can be just like them.

628
00:35:48,862 --> 00:35:49,895
Oh!

629
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,197
Ow, damn it!
She won't stop kicking.

630
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:56,869
I'll make her stop kicking.

631
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:04,845
Come on, Elly,
you gotta breathe sometime.

632
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,881
Breathe.

633
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:16,814
Stubborn little bitch.

634
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,751
Not for much longer.
Breathe or drown, Elly!

635
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,958
She's breathing.

636
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:30,028
- That's a good girl, Elly.
- Cut her quick!

637
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,168
Damn it! We're gonna have
to hold her under again.

638
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,874
- Push her in.
- Oh.

639
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,850
Police!

640
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:35,392
No, no, you don't!

641
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,294
Come on.

642
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,132
You're staying right here.

643
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,178
Nick!

644
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:40,291
Nick! Nick!

645
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:48,165
Here.

646
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:05,616
You all right?

647
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,985
I think so.

648
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,722
Are you okay?

649
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:16,126
I got Dominic and Jesse
handcuffed.

650
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,361
How do you want
to deal with them?

651
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:19,129
Lock 'em up.

652
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:20,897
They won't last long.

653
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:22,966
They should've thought
about that before.

654
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,801
You know how long
you were under that water?

655
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:26,136
Thought you were dead.

656
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,139
You sure look like it.

657
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:32,109
- Oh, my God! Elly?
- Elly!

658
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:34,711
- Elly!
- Elly!

659
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:38,115
- Oh, thank God she's okay.
- Oh, baby, come here.

660
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:41,151
You're okay.

661
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:44,822
I'm so sorry.

662
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:47,892
Oh, my girls.

663
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,196
"I can't find anything
medically wrong with you,

664
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,132
"except you appear to have
a metabolic rate

665
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,699
"half a normal person's.

666
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:57,435
"I can't explain this,
but it doesn't seem

667
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,136
"to be interfering
with your life.

668
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:02,206
You seem healthy, with
tremendous physical endurance."

669
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:07,478
"Bheadr."

670
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:10,081
"Haven't been able
to spend the money.

671
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:14,852
"Royal assassination causing
much turmoil.

672
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:19,256
"No longer safe.
Must leave now.

673
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,259
Love you, M."

674
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,397
"Love you, M"?

675
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:32,736
Who the hell is M, Nick?

676
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,374
Europe and the world
have gathered today

677
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:39,477
in Vienna, Austria,
to mourn the passing

678
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:42,280
of crown prince Eric Renard,
second in line

679
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,915
to the Cronenberg throne
and empire.

680
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:48,018
British media report allegations
by an unnamed source

681
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,554
that an underground movement
may have been responsible

682
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:52,723
for the crown prince's
assassination.

683
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:56,326
Austrian police are working with
French and British intelligence

684
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:57,594
to find those responsible.

685
00:40:57,628 --> 00:41:00,564
The question
on everyone's mind is

686
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:05,969
who will be given the reins
of this royal family?

687
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,804
Number three.

688
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,441
- You sure?
- Yeah.

689
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:26,756
Look, can I...
can I ask you guys something?

690
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:28,491
Sure.

691
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:34,698
I-I'm not so sure
how to say this, but...

692
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:37,668
You know that girl that pulled
me out of the water, Elly?

693
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:39,102
What about her?

694
00:41:39,137 --> 00:41:40,137
Well, I don't know,

695
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:44,975
but I saw something
really strange.

696
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:48,545
- Like what?
- Like, I...

697
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,448
Think she's, like,
a mutant or something,

698
00:41:51,483 --> 00:41:54,284
some kind of, like,
mermaid thing... I...

699
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,952
ugh.

700
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:59,356
Okay, I know how that sounds,
believe me.

701
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,893
I just...
She came over when

702
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:08,431
and she just wasn't...
Normal.

703
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:10,833
Nobody is, Jake.

704
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:12,868
It's Portland.

705
00:42:15,614 --> 00:42:17,625
