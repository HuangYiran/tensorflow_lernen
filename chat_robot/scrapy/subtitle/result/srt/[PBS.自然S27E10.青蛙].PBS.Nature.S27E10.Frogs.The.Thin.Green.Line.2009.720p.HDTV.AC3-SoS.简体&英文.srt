00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:21,020
青蛙在地球上  生存了超过2亿5千万年
Narrator: frogs have managed to navigate life on earth for more than 250 million years.

3
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,036
青蛙是从水域走向陆地的首个动物祖先
They were the first of our ancestors to venture from the water to the world beyond.

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,937
[蛙叫声]
[ croaks ]

5
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:52,217
青蛙前期象鱼类的身躯 并不会阻止他们向陆地前进
But their fish-like beginnings haven't hindered their progress on earth.

6
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:57,156
青蛙演变出多种多样的品种
They've evolved into an explosion of species,

7
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,792
每一种都独一无二
Each one unique.

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:05,364
这些微小的“时间旅行者” 经历了恐龙、小行星和冰河时代
These diminutive time travelers survived the dinosaurs, asteroids, and ice ages,

9
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,401
适应能力令人难以想象
Adapting in ways that boggle the mind.

10
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,805
有些青蛙是伪装之王
Some are masters of camouflage,

11
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,641
有些青蛙皮肤上带有毒物 以避开掠食者
While others avoid predators by carrying poisons in their skin.

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,782
青蛙的生存技能 使其演变出数以千计的品种
Their survival tactics have splintered them into thousands of species,

13
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,888
青蛙遍布地球的每一个角落
Scattered on almost every corner of the earth.

14
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:35,027
无论是蜥蜴、青蛙 还是蟾蜍
Whether salamander... Frog... Or toad...

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:40,599
两栖动物是地球上 品种最多、分布最广的动物
Amphibians are some of the most diverse and far-flung animals on the planet...

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:48,974
但是青蛙的数量正在下降 专家很担心
But they're disappearing, and experts are worried.

17
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,977
青蛙被认为是 环境的预警
Frogs are considered bellwethers for the environment.

18
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,382
青蛙的水陆生活是独一无二的
Their double life makes them unique.

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,717
青蛙用皮肤来呼吸、饮水
It's through their skin that they breathe and drink.

20
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,787
青蛙皮肤的渗透能力非常强
Because their skin is so permeable,

21
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,492
因此青蛙对环境的变化十分敏感
They're especially sensitive to changes in the environment.

22
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:12,498
目前 超过三分之一的两栖动物的数量在下降
Today, more than a third of amphibians are in decline.

23
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:18,270
澳洲、美洲的青蛙都在减少
From australia to south america, frogs are disappearing.

24
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:25,511
生存了无数年代的青蛙 为什么突然垮下了?
Why are species that have survived for eons suddenly collapsing?

25
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:31,016
为了避免其它物种 遭遇同样的命运 科学家正在寻找原因
Scientists are searching for clues, before the next species slips away.

26
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,353
[蛙叫声]
[ frogs croaking ]

27
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,088
青蛙是隐秘的
Frogs can be secretive.

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,160
要找出答案 你必须到那些阴暗的地方
To find answers, one must probe the shadows.

29
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,462
[蛙叫声]
[ frogs croaking ]

30
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,328
这只玻璃蛙的皮肤是透明的 可以看到她的卵
This glass frog's translucent skin reveals her eggs.

31
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:34,513
交配是危险的事情
Coupling can be a dangerous proposition.

32
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:40,619
青蛙及其后代在食物链中 扮演着重要的角色
Frogs -- and their offspring -- are key players in the food chain.

33
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:57,770
父母会分别离开 留下蛙卵自力更生
The parents will go their separate ways, leaving their eggs to fate.

34
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,173
附近叶子上的另一只青蛙 看上去有点相似
On a nearby leaf, another frog looks similar,

35
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,678
但他有不同的繁殖策略
But his species has a different tactic.

36
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:24,263
老爸会守护孩子直到卵孵化 他会日夜守护孩子
This father will stand watch over his young he'll guard them night and day.

37
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,546
两栖动物非凡的生存历史
The extraordinary life history of amphibians

38
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,415
就像这个老爸与孩子一样 经历了几百万年
Has played out like this for millions of years,

39
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,018
但是环境变化很快
But conditions are rapidly changing --

40
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:53,425
无论是在雨林深处 还是在海边的沙质岩石
Whether deep in the rain forest, or on a sandy outcrop at the ocean's edge.

41
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:01,767
在美国科德角最高处 生物遭遇第一场春雨
On the tip of cape cod, life is stirring with the first spring rain.

42
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,751
锄足蟾像野花一样 从沙地冒出来
Spadefoot toads sprout like strange flowers from the sand.

43
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:24,123
他们要到清新的水池产卵
They'll make their way to vernal pools, to lay their eggs.

44
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,194
如果蟾蜍无法来到 供繁殖的水池 数量就会逐渐减少
If toads can't get to their breeding ponds, the population will gradually vanish.

45
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:34,733
在东北部 人类几乎令锄足蟾完全灭绝
In the northeast, spadefoot toads are being edged out by humans.

46
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,840
这是是国家海滨科德角
Here at the cape cod national seashore,

47
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:47,646
虽然土地受到保护 蟾蜍依然受伤害
The land is protected, but the roads can still take a toll.

48
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,750
当两栖动物在全球的栖息地被瓜分
Amphibians all over the world face a deadly collision course

49
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,952
它们正面临致命的冲突
When their habitat is carved up.

50
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:03,195
如果雌性两栖动物正在排卵期 下一代也同样被毁掉了
If a female is full of eggs, the next generation is lost, as well.

51
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,799
科德角国家海滨已经采取预防措施
Cape cod national seashore has begun to take precautions

52
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:11,603
在温暖、多雨的的夜晚 每一次努力都会带来很大的改观
On warm, rainy nights. Every little effort makes a big difference.

53
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:17,643
当两栖动物与人类发生冲突时 每年数以百万的两栖动物都死亡了
Millions of amphibians are lost each year when they collide with humans.

54
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,247
地球上有多少条公路?
How many millions of roads crisscross the globe?

55
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,618
过去50年 人口增加了一倍
Human population has doubled in the last 50 years.

56
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,456
两栖动物几乎在各个地方都受到打击
Amphibians are getting hit from almost every front.

57
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:38,063
这些超级生存家的进化速度 赶不上环境的变化
These super-survivors can't evolve quickly enough to keep up with the changes.

58
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:42,434
我们已经给青蛙造成了完美的风暴
We've stirred up the perfect storm for frogs.

59
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,670
[雷鸣]
[ thunder crashes ]

60
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,873
在这种混乱上 再添加一种神秘的疾病
Add a mysterious disease to the mix,

61
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,976
情况会变得生死攸关
And the situation becomes critical.

62
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:56,882
青蛙的数量在下降 即使是在地球上最原始的地方
We're now losing frogs even in the most pristine corners of the earth.

63
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,652
在约塞米蒂国家公园
In yosemite national park,

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,391
黄腿山蛙在这里生存了几百万年
The mountain yellow-legged frog has maintained a foothold for millions of years.

65
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,864
它们经历了冰河期
They've survived ice ages and glaciers.

66
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,366
连蝌蚪的生命力都非常强
Even their tadpoles are tough enough

67
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,802
蝌蚪可以经历几个冬天 直到变态为成体蛙
To weather multiple winters until metamorphosis.

68
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,138
但是现在 他们的麻烦来了
But today, they're in trouble --

69
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,941
专家试图找出原因
And experts have been struggling to figure out why.

70
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:28,814
Roland Knapp博士首次确认 一个原因
Dr.Roland Knapp was one of the first to identify one of the causes.

71
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,619
过去这里有很多青蛙
Knapp: historically, there were lots of frogs here.

72
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,688
有记录表明 经过湖边
Records suggest that walking along the lakeshore

73
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,190
你会看到一个接一个的青蛙跳入湖中
You would just see frog after frog plopping into the water.

74
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,192
现在 走遍整个湖
And now you can walk the entire lakeshore

75
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,427
一个青蛙也没看到
And not see a single frog.

76
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,230
20世纪初 为了建立悠闲的钓鱼场所
In the beginning of the 1900s, to create recreational fisheries,

77
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,466
大家把外地的鲑鱼
People began moving non-native trout

78
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,069
放入本来无鱼的湖中
Into many of these naturally fishless lakes.

79
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,806
鲑鱼以青蛙为食 大部分的湖里
Trout prey on the frogs, and in most of these places,

80
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,175
青蛙已经毫无踪影了
The frogs are now gone.

81
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:01,780
Knapp博士小组努力清除 约塞米蒂国家公园的湖中的鲑鱼
Argo: Knapp has been part of an intensive effort to remove fish from yosemite's lakes.

82
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,217
好像青蛙又回到湖中了
It looked like the frogs were making a comeback...

83
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,887
但是青蛙又成为 更凶狠的真菌的猎物
Until they fell prey to something even more insidious.

84
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,558
杀鱼行动之后不久 我们发现
Knapp: it wasn't long after we began the fish eradications that we realized

85
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,228
除了鲑鱼以外 还有其它威胁
That there was something else going on besides just fish.

86
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,697
即两栖壶菌
And that something is the amphibian chytrid fungus.

87
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,201
12年前
Argo: twelve years ago,

88
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,238
Knapp博士发现 死蛙出现在研究地点
Knapp started finding dead frogs at his study sites.

89
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,941
开始死因是个谜
At first the deaths were a mystery...

90
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,011
直到他确认了一种奇怪的真菌
Until a strange fungus was identified.

91
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:36,648
壶菌攻击青蛙的皮肤 造成缺氧
It seems to attack the skin of a frog, depriving it of oxygen.

92
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,485
你看到这种情况会很难过
Knapp: it's really hard to see

93
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,188
你给青蛙加了标签 后来又抓了几次
An animal that you've tagged, you've recaptured several times,

94
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,457
有时候你几个小时都在观察它
You've watched them for hours sometimes...

95
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,860
最后你发现它死在湖中
And then you find that same animal dead in a pool.

96
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,131
这种病杀死了青蛙
This disease is taking the species out.

97
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,335
仅仅几十年 壶菌病
Argo: in a matter of decades, chytridiomycosis, or "chytrid,"

98
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,171
就发展成 全球的流行病
Has become a global epidemic.

99
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,775
这就像青蛙的黄热病
Woman: it's almost like we're seeing the yellow fever of frogs

100
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,245
或者1918年的流感病
Or the flu of 1918.

101
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,614
我们还不清楚这种病的发病机理
We haven't figured out how this disease even works,

102
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,450
为何传染如此之快
How it spreads so quickly.

103
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,054
在加州大学伯克利分校 Mary stice正在试图
Argo: at u.c. Berkeley, mary stice is trying to uncover

104
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,490
找出壶菌病的更多发病机理
More clues about chytrid.

105
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,429
这些小圈是游动孢子
Stice: these little circles are zoospores,

106
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,430
处于真菌感染阶段
And that's the infectious stage of the fungus.

107
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,398
孢子在水中游动
It swims through the water,

108
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:30,936
寻找下一个受害者 即蝌蚪或成体蛙
Looking for its next victim -- a tadpole or an adult frog.

109
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,238
壶菌病的最大谜团是
The most puzzling thing about this disease

110
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,474
我们不知道壶菌来自哪里
Is that we have no idea where it's from.

111
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,376
有人在保存的标本中找到壶菌
It's found in preserved specimens

112
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,545
包括19世纪40年代的非洲标本
From the 1930s, in africa,

113
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,514
70年代的加利福尼亚的标本
From the '70s here in california,

114
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,751
在我工作的约塞米蒂国家公园
But it looks like it's a new disease moving into populations.

115
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,521
壶菌病看上去是 一种新引入的疾病
Up in yosemite, where I do my fieldwork,

116
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,223
情况很糟糕
It's looking pretty bleak.

117
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,359
我真的很担心
I am really worried.

118
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,031
我们知道 真菌靠水生存
Argo: we know that the fungus needs water to survive.

119
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,000
真菌也需要宿主
It also needs a host.

120
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,535
但是我们不知道 真菌是怎样蔓延的
But we don't know how it moves,

121
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,072
以及在真菌到来时 怎样阻止它
Or how to contain it once it arrives.

122
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,958
真菌不像鱼类
Knapp: Unlike the fish,

123
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,676
我们可以控制鱼的数量
Where we actually had some control over those fish populations,

124
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,845
我们可以清除某个湖的鱼
And we could remove them from selected lakes,

125
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,981
但我们不能控制 两栖壶菌的数量
We don't have that ability with the amphibian chytrid fungus.

126
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,052
很大程度上 我们只能做的是 坐视不管
All we can do right now, for the most part, is watch it do its thing.

127
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,723
青蛙有不可思议的生存能力
This is a frog that has incredible staying power.

128
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,026
青蛙能很神奇地适应恶劣的环境
They're incredibly well adapted to this harsh environment.

129
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,895
现在 我们只能眼睁睁地看着青蛙死掉
And now, on our watch, they're disappearing.

130
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,098
小组忙着收集尽可能多的数据
Argo: the team is rushing to collect as much data as they can,

131
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,635
但是壶菌是令人迷惑的敌人
But chytrid is a puzzling enemy.

132
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,539
虽然有些物种对壶菌有抵抗力
While some species appear to be resistant,

133
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,441
其他物种却被毁灭
Others are being devastated.

134
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,277
黄腿山蛙的死亡速度很快
The mountain yellow-legged frog is losing ground fast.

135
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,147
好的 57.
All right, 57.

136
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:53,619
引起壶菌病的真菌 简称BD
The fungus that causes chytrid, known as "BD,"

137
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,122
几个月内就可以感染 并致死所有的青蛙
Can extinguish a population in a matter of months.

138
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,359
壶菌好像在高海拔的地区繁殖
It seems to thrive at high altitudes,

139
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,561
这些地区阴凉潮湿
Where it's cool and moist,

140
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,765
但是没人知道壶菌怎样蔓延 怎样才能阻止它
But no one knows how it travels, or how to stop it.

141
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,335
壶菌病正在山脉地区蔓延
The disease is sweeping through the sierras,

142
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,837
在墨西哥 壶菌病被确认
It's well established in mexico,

143
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,840
壶菌病蔓延至中美洲和南美洲
And it's been moving through central and south america,

144
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,676
毁灭沿途的两栖动物
Devastating amphibians.

145
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,311
中美洲和南美洲
Woman: central and south america

146
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,248
生活了全球50%的两栖物种
Harbored 50% of the world's amphibian species.

147
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,784
这些地区拥有最多的两栖物种
This was the place with the greatest amount,

148
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,787
现在可能大部分都灭绝了
And now we've potentially lost a huge portion of that.

149
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,459
在哥斯达黎加 Karen Lips博士
Argo: in costa rica, Dr.Karen Lips

150
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,996
首次亲眼看到 青蛙的神秘死亡
Was one of the first to witness a mysterious die-off of frogs.

151
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,700
有一天 我走过小溪 发现一只死蛙
Lips: one day I was walking down the stream, and I found a dead frog,

152
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,902
我有点担心
And, you know, I was a little concerned,

153
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,372
但是在接下来几个星期 我又发现了几只死蛙
But...over the next couple of weeks I found a couple more.

154
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,141
我下一年回来时 青蛙都不见了
I went back the next year, and they were gone.

155
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,510
青蛙不见了
The frogs had disappeared.

156
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,345
其实 同样的事情
Essentially the same story played out

157
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,814
也发生在几年后的巴拿马边境
A couple of years later across the border in panama.

158
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,755
Lips博士在中美洲看到死蛙的时候
Argo: while Lips was witnessing die-offs in central america,

159
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,424
同样的一幕也在澳大利亚上演
A similar story played out in australia.

160
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,193
直到确认了壶菌病
By the time chytrid was identified,

161
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,965
全世界的两栖动物已经崩溃了
Amphibian populations had already crashed throughout the world.

162
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,536
壶菌已经偷偷地进入
The fungus has been stealthy,

163
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:22,908
那些没开发 但又拥有地球上最珍稀物种的区域
Reaching into untouched areas that hold some of earth's greatest treasures.

164
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,946
青蛙可能是渺小的
Frogs might be diminutive,

165
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,684
后果却是严重的
But the stakes are enormous.

166
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:38,090
医学已经证实 青蛙是小金矿
Medical science has begun to realize that frogs are little gold mines.

167
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:44,063
为了应对感染 很多青蛙的皮肤能够分泌化学物
To ward off infection, most frogs secrete chemicals from their skin.

168
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,931
有时青蛙甚至是有毒的
They can actually be poisonous.

169
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,001
这些明亮的颜色警告掠食者
These bright colors are a frog's warning to predators

170
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,203
青蛙是危险的食物
That they could be a dangerous meal.

171
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:57,176
青蛙皮肤上的化合物 已经使医学重现生机
The compounds on frog skin have turned medical science around.

172
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,412
从小青蛙皮肤提取的化合物
An extract from the skin of this little frog blocks pain

173
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,618
止痛的效果比吗啡好 而且不会令人上瘾
More effectively than morphine -- and it's not addictive.

174
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,389
青蛙皮肤的性质 可应用到各个领域
The properties of frog skin are being explored for everything

175
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,392
例如治疗感染和防止艾滋病
From treating infections to preventing HIV.

176
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,930
我们才刚开始挖掘这个小宝藏
We've just begun to mine these little treasures,

177
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,834
现在青蛙却衰减了 速度比我们的研究速度快得多
And now they're slipping away faster than we can study them.

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,908
但是这对全球生态系统的影响更大
But the impact on earth's ecosystems is even more troubling.

179
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,212
Karen Lips博士回到位于巴拿马中部的 前研究基地
Karen Lips has returned to her former study site

180
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,081
她要测量这些地区的变化
In central panama to measure the changes.

181
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,586
没有青蛙 这里静得可怕
Without the frogs, there's an eerie silence.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,255
在El Cope保护区
In El Cope reserve,

183
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,159
只剩下一座水泥青蛙雕塑
A concrete statue may be all that remains

184
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,662
记录了巴拿马引人入胜的金蛙
Of panama's spectacular golden frog.

185
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,799
青蛙大灭绝之前 这里是个好地方
Lips: before the big crash, this was a great place.

186
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:58,404
我估计这里大概有 64种两栖动物
I think our total list here was something like 64 species of amphibians.

187
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,806
无论你走到森林的哪个地方
It didn't matter really where you went in the forest,

188
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,075
你都能找到青蛙 地面上、叶子上
You would find them on the ground, on the leaves,

189
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,710
你能听见青蛙在树冠上
You'd hear them up in the canopy.

190
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,213
无论你走过哪条小径和溪流
You could walk any trail, any stream,

191
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,382
你都能听到青蛙日夜叫个不停
And you would hear frogs calling day and night.

192
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,422
现在 这里一个青蛙也没有了
And now, you know, there's just nothing here anymore.

193
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,657
壶菌病具有多米诺效应
Argo: chytrid is having a domino effect.

194
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,293
青蛙位于食物链的中部
Frogs sit right in the middle of the food chain.

195
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:26,832
没有青蛙 其它物种也会灭绝
Without them, other creatures are disappearing, too.

196
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,070
我们才刚开始了解 没有青蛙
Lips: we're just beginning to understand what a forest is like

197
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,706
森林会如何运作、变成啥样
And how it functions without frogs.

198
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,241
现在所有的蝌蚪都死掉了
Ever since all the tadpoles disappeared,

199
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,777
这些小溪真的很滑
These streams have been really slippery.

200
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,081
地面长满了绿藻
There's green algae growing all over the place.

201
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,883
这是青蛙和蝌蚪灭绝后
It's just another example of the big changes that we see

202
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,152
发生的巨大变化的一个例子
After all the frogs and tadpoles disappear.

203
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,556
蝌蚪不仅吃绿藻
The tadpoles not only eat the algae,

204
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,624
蝌蚪还会扰动沙泥
But they also disturb all the sand and the mud,

205
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,860
因此沙泥附着物被水流带走
And so all that gets flushed out with the current --

206
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,829
现在这里没有蝌蚪了
And now there's no tadpoles,

207
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,398
我们看到昆虫也有变化
We see changes in some of the insects, as well.

208
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,201
这里的生态系统变化很大
We're seeing lots of big changes in these ecosystems.

209
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:08,474
青蛙灭绝影响到鱼类、水质 蛇类、鸟类........ 你来想吧
It's affecting fish, and water quality, snakes, birds -- you name it.

210
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,211
基本上 我们观测到的一切都改变了
Basically everything we've measured has changed.

211
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,049
壶菌病正在蔓延
Argo: chytrid is on the move.

212
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,319
壶菌病从中美洲向北蔓延
While it's sweeping down through central america,

213
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,389
壶菌病也从南美洲向北蔓延
It's also traveling north from south america.

214
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,225
只有巴拿马的一个小地方
There's only a small area left in panama

215
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,827
至今没有受到壶菌感染
That still seems to be chytrid-free.

216
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,767
巴拿马运河以北 两小时的路程
Two hours south of the panama canal,

217
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,337
有一叫做Burbayar的小森林
There's a small patch of forest called Burbayar.

218
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:46,278
这里的青蛙 依然按照几百万年以来 形成的方式生活
For the frogs here, life plays out as it has for millions of years.

219
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:51,583
壶菌逐渐逼近 奇迹有待出现
While chytrid draws closer, miracles are still unfolding.

220
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:58,824
老爸已经守卫孩子两个多星期了
This father has been guarding his young for two weeks now.

221
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:03,796
附近叶子上的蝌蚪却没有护卫
The tadpoles on a nearby leaf don't have a guardian.

222
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:08,534
这些蝌蚪较成熟 但仍然需要几天时间才能孵化
They're more mature, but still days from hatching.

223
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:14,340
健康的栖息地 有许多掠食者和食物
A healthy habitat is full of predators -- and prey.

224
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:20,112
无论大小 每种生物都扮演着自己的角色
No matter how big or small, every creature plays a role.

225
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,821
森林拥有数以千计的昆虫种类
The forest holds thousands of insect species.

226
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,291
有些昆虫几个小时就毁掉一窝蛙卵
Some can destroy an egg clutch in a matter of hours...

227
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,305
即使入侵者还没触及卵窝
Even if an intruder doesn't have a taste for eggs,

228
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,874
这个老爸依然奋勇保护
This father is fiercely protective.

229
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,686
虽然有些物种不保护孩子
Though the other species doesn't guard its young,

230
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,788
孩子已经具备另一种防卫术
It's developed another defense --

231
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,791
面对攻击 蝌蚪会努力挣扎开来
When attacked, the tadpoles will break free,

232
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,895
使蝌蚪至少有斗争的机会
Giving them at least a fighting chance.

233
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,079
在这里的溪流
Here in the stream,

234
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:32,618
蝌蚪花很多时间 吃绿藻和小植物
The tadpoles will spend most of their time feeding on algae and small plants.

235
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:40,359
一系列迷人的生存技能 使青蛙勇敢生存了几百万年
A fantastic array of survival tactics has allowed frogs to brave the millennia.

236
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,862
但是 壶菌与其它任何掠食者都不同
But chytrid is a predator like none other --

237
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,799
壶菌蔓延很快
And it's moving in fast.

238
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,467
时间紧迫
Lips: the clock is ticking --

239
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,637
自从92年这里第一只青蛙死掉后
And that's really what it's felt like more than anything

240
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,206
我们真正需要的是速度
Since that first frog in '92, is the rush --

241
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:59,712
在壶菌感染之前 尽快地救出尽可能多的青蛙
The rush to get out, to do as much as you can before another site goes.

242
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,680
Lips和她的学生们
Argo: Lips and her students

243
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,782
在Burbayar森林建立了 一个新的研究基地
Have established a new study site here at Burbayar.

244
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:10,456
他们希望 壶菌病还没有蔓延到这里
They're hoping that chytrid, and the BD that causes it, haven't arrived yet.

245
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,858
我们在这里试图获取更多的数据
Lips: we're here to try and get more data to figure out

246
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,160
以确认发生了什么事 壶菌病是怎样来到的?
What is happening -- how does this thing get around?

247
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,931
我们可以阻止壶菌病吗?
Can we stop it?

248
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:27,339
森林里有青蛙、昆虫和蛇 看上去很健康
Argo: the forest appears to be healthy, with frogs, and insects, and snakes...

249
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,943
但这种情形还能维持多久呢?
But for how much longer will it remain intact?

250
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,648
使青蛙健康生活的栖息地 远远不够了
Lips: we're running out of places where frogs are healthy.

251
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,685
我们估计 十年后巴拿马所有的青蛙都会灭绝
We estimate, within ten years all of panama will be gone.

252
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,354
我指的是高海拔地区
We're talking upland areas,

253
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,392
但是就算你走得快 壶菌病也持续蔓延
But as fast as you move, it's continuing its passage.

254
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,060
我抓到一个青蛙
Woman: I got a frog.

255
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,500
一旦我们抓到青蛙 我们就测量青蛙的体温
As soon as we catch a frog, we take its body temperature,

256
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,904
因为在气候变化及其对青蛙的影响方面 存在争议
Because there's a debate about climate change and how it's affecting frogs.

257
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,040
33.5℃.
33.5度

258
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,442
接着我们用棉签檫拭青蛙
Next we're going to swab it,

259
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,744
并把棉签样品送回实验室 检测可以告诉我们
And we'll send this sample off to a lab, and they'll tell us

260
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,247
这个青蛙是否感染了壶菌
Whether or not this frog is infected with BD.

261
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,916
好的 现在我们抓住小腿
All right, so we're just going to take this little q-tip

262
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,317
檫拭青蛙皮肤
And swab the frog.

263
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,221
我们檫拭青蛙的腹部和腿
We do his belly, we do his feet.

264
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,125
如果上面有壶菌 棉签会沾上它 我们带回实验室
If there's any BD, it'll pick it up, and we send this off to the lab,

265
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:23,829
检测结果会表明 这是青蛙是否感染了壶菌
And the lab will tell us if BD is on this frog.

266
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,497
好的 你走吧 伙计
All right, i'm gonna let you go, buddy.

267
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:29,702
我们认为这个地方还算健康
Lips: we think this site is still clean.

268
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,103
快看
Look at that --

269
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,539
这是Rhinobothryum Bovallii蛇
That's Rhinobothryum Bovallii.

270
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,274
非常罕见
They're really rare.

271
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,475
这条好大
That's a big one.

272
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,077
它以青蛙为食
They're a frog-eater.

273
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,945
它正出来找吃的 你看它舌头轻吐
He's out foraging, you can see him tongue-flicking.

274
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:48,354
一旦壶菌驾到 此蛇也可能和青蛙一样灭绝
Argo: once chytrid arrives, this snake may well disappear along with the frogs.

275
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:53,692
基于Lips博士的研究结果 他们要采取紧急措施
Based on what Lips finds here, they might take emergency measures.

276
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,662
如果有必要 我们会把青蛙放到
Lips: if we have to, we will put some frogs

277
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,466
囚禁地加以保护 以应对壶菌的最终到来
Into captivity as a safeguard against the eventual arrival of the fungus.

278
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:07,272
三年前 生物学家在中美洲就是这样做的
Argo: this is exactly what took place in central panama, three years ago.

279
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,743
壶菌病逐渐逼近
With chytrid fast approaching,

280
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,146
生物学家从周围的森林中收集青蛙
Biologists evacuated frogs from the surrounding forest.

281
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,949
这些“难民"离雾林是如此的近
These refugees are so close...

282
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,786
却又是如此的远
And yet so far from their cloud forest.

283
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:26,825
山脚有一栋简陋的建筑 作为庇护所
At the foot of the mountains sits a humble building that's serving as an ark.

284
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,095
El Valle两栖动物保护中心（EVACC）
The El Valle amphibian conservation center

285
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:34,299
是休斯顿动物园发起的国际计划
Is an international project launched by the houston zoo.

286
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,436
EVACC保护了58种青蛙
"EVACC" shelters 58 species of frogs --

287
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,706
有些是地球上的稀有种类
Some of the rarest on earth.

288
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:44,276
这个美丽的金蛙是 巴拿马的独有品种
This beautiful golden frog is unique to panama.

289
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:48,013
金蛙没有耳膜 通过摆臂交流
It lacks eardrums, and communicates by waving its arms.

290
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:52,284
巴拿马人认为金蛙是好运
They're considered good luck by panamanians,

291
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:58,957
但是 金蛙可能会因为壶菌而灭绝
But because of chytrid, they may be gone from the wild.

292
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:05,364
Edgardo Griffith和他的妻子Heidi Rs共同管理这个中心
Edgardo Griffith runs the center with his wife, Heidi Rs.

293
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,600
他们要模拟雾林
They have to try to replicate the cloud forest --

294
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,237
光线、温度、湿度 所有条件都有适当
Light, temperature, humidity -- everything has to be right.

295
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,942
要喂食很多个月 这是没完没了的挑战
And feeding so many mouths is a never-ending challenge.

296
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:29,621
我刚刚漂洗了蚯蚓 因为它们身上可能有壶菌
We just rinse them off, just because the worms might have chytrid on them.

297
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:34,660
不经过消毒 我们不会把任何东西 如灰尘
We try not to put anything, like dirt, without disinfecting it

298
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,696
放进这间屋子
Before putting it inside the building.

299
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,133
进入EVACC的所有东西都要 保证无壶菌
Argo: everything entering EVACC has to be chytrid-free --

300
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:47,006
每个人 每条虫 每块石头 每种植物
Every person, every worm, every rock and plant.

301
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:05,391
这些角形树蛙 与森林的树叶相似
These horned tree frogs mimic leaves in the forest.

302
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,128
即使小蛙也伪装得很好
Even the froglets are brilliantly disguised.

303
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:14,500
但是最好的伪装 也挡不住壶菌
But the best of camouflage can't protect a frog from chytrid.

304
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,503
在隔离区
In the quarantine room,

305
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,539
新来的青蛙 都要经过严格的消毒程序
New arrivals are put through a grueling process.

306
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,575
我们现在还不知道 怎样清除栖息地的壶菌
We don't yet know how to rid a habitat of chytrid,

307
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,878
但是我们能应对青蛙个体
But individual frogs can be treated.

308
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,714
没事 朋友 没事
It's okay, my friend, it's okay.

309
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:31,984
没事
It's okay.

310
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,552
看看你
Look at you.

311
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,823
我们从2006年开始收集青蛙
When we started collecting the animals in 2006,

312
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,858
50%的都死掉了
We lost like 50% of them.

313
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,760
这些青蛙能活很多年
These frogs can live for years --

314
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:45,564
可能有20或25年
Probably 20, 25 years.

315
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:50,502
就像接受化学治疗的人类一样
The treatment equivalent would be for a person going under chemotherapy.

316
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,672
我让它在那里呆10分钟
I'll leave it there for 10 minutes.

317
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,174
这是侵略性的治疗
It's a very invasive process,

318
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,310
因为我们必须使青蛙和溶液接触
Because we have to keep the frogs in contact

319
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,014
溶液真的很强烈
With this solution, which is a really strong solution,

320
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:04,016
每天治疗10分钟 总共要10天
For ten minutes for ten days.

321
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,784
我确信它不想呆在杯子
I'm pretty sure that she doesn't like to be

322
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,987
它要和令人厌恶的溶液接触
In that little cup with that nasty solution,

323
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,824
但是 事实表明
But there's something that tells me

324
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,795
它知道我们在帮助它
That she knows somehow that we are trying to help her.

325
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:20,099
很多人认为这不重要
For most people, they wouldn't think that this is important,

326
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:25,771
因为它只是一个棕色、凹凸不平的小丑蛙
Because it's a brown, bumpy, little ugly frog,

327
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,707
但是它正在告诉我们 人类正在做错事
But this animal here is telling us that we are doing something wrong.

328
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:34,646
在EVACC 能看到产卵和蝌蚪就算成功了
Argo: at EVACC, success is measured by egg clutches and tadpoles.

329
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:41,153
最近 小组庆祝了 一只小金蛙首次变态成成体蛙
They recently celebrated the first golden froglet to metamorphose.

330
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,288
但也有不可避免的失败
But there are also the inevitable setbacks.

331
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,191
在这里
It's over here.

332
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,029
这是中心最早拯救的青蛙之一
This was one of the center's first rescues.

333
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:54,166
总有一些寄生虫之类的出现
There's always parasites and such lined up,

334
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,035
等等 这是第一次出错
Just waiting -- so the first mistake,

335
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,905
这表明我们做得不对
It will show us that we're not doing things right.

336
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:04,309
一旦寄生虫出现症状 通常是时间 太晚了
Once they present the symptoms, it's oftentimes too late.

337
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,278
看到了吗?
See this?

338
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:09,281
噢 我的天
Oh, my gosh!

339
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:14,086
有一大片寄生虫 寄生虫在内部
There's a gigantic parasite that was internal.

340
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:17,523
当宿主死掉后 寄生虫就来了
When the host died, i'm sure the parasite came over.

341
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,993
青蛙 我们知之甚少
So many things that we don't know about these animals,

342
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:23,362
有许多新寄生虫
So many new species of parasites.

343
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,933
发生这样的事 我们很不适应
We can never get used to things like this happening.

344
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:39,812
最终目标是 某天把青蛙放回野外
Argo: the ultimate goal is to return these frogs to the wild someday.

345
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:46,518
科学家正在寻找控制壶菌的方法
Scientists are working to find ways to control chytrid in the environment.

346
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:49,321
迄今 控制方法还是一个遥遥无期的梦想
But for now, it's still a distant dream.

347
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:52,424
El Valle变化很快
And things in El Valle are changing quickly.

348
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:58,764
房地产开发可能会重新改写 巴拿马青蛙的未来
Housing developments might be re-writing the future for panama's frogs.

349
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,300
他们正在开发这个地区
Griffith: they're developing this area.

350
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,403
去年我在这里迷路了
Last year I came this way, and I got lost.

351
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:09,908
这里有很多新公路 所以我不知道该往哪里走
There are so many new roads here that I didn't even know where I was going anymore.

352
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:16,015
至少一年前 只有这样的一条公路
Less than a year ago, there was only one road.

353
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,589
两年前 当我们开始EVACC项目的时候
Two years ago, when we started the EVACC project,

354
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:28,260
我们来到这里收集青蛙 就是在这个地方
We came here and we collected some frogs from this particular place,

355
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:32,364
不到1年 开发商就完全占领了这里
And in less than a year, they cleared the whole thing.

356
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:35,868
这可能是某人的房子
This is going to be somebody's house.

357
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,636
我非常震惊
I feel just panic,

358
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,606
因为我以前看到那里有很多森林
Because when I look up that way, there's a lot of forest,

359
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:45,110
这里发生的事情 不到1年 也会发生在那些森林
But the same thing that happened here can happen to that forest in less than a year.

360
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:50,282
中心里很多的安全、健康的青蛙都不重要了
It doesn't matter now many safe, healthy frogs we have at the center --

361
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,651
如果栖息地继续丧失
If habitat loss continues,

362
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,621
将来我们要把青蛙放回哪里呢
Where are we going to put the frogs in the future,

363
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:59,958
如果我们找出挽救青蛙的方法 使青蛙在野外对抗真菌
If we figure out how to help them so they can fight the fungus in the wild?

364
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:03,429
再也没有青蛙的栖息地了
There's not going to be a place for the frogs anymore.

365
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:13,172
还有一线希望 有些青蛙可以抵抗壶菌
Argo: there is hope that a few individual frogs might be resistant to chytrid,

366
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:20,245
但是房地产开发产生的废物 使溪流不适合青蛙生存了
But runoff from the development is making the stream unhealthy for frogs.

367
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,081
我永不放弃
Griffith: I will never give up.

368
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:25,484
我一有机会就会过来
I will still come every time when I have the opportunity,

369
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:29,922
因为我们总有可能找到青蛙
Because there is always the possibility for us to find frogs.

370
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,423
这些事情
That's one of the things that,

371
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,059
你每天早上都会想
You know, every morning you think about.

372
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,167
壶菌的破坏能力强
Argo: chytrid has been devastating,

373
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:45,904
但壶菌病并不是两栖动物的 唯一威胁
But it's by no means the only threat to amphibians.

374
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:50,476
在美国一些没被壶菌感染的地区
In parts of the u.s. Where frogs haven't been lost to the fungus,

375
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:53,112
青蛙受到其它力量的冲击
They're being hit by other forces,

376
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,214
这就发生在我们的后院
Right here in our own backyards.

377
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,216
13年前 在明尼苏达州
In minnesota, 13 years ago,

378
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:02,287
一群学生边旅行边寻找青蛙
A group of school kids took a field trip to look for frogs.

379
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:05,624
学生找到很多可怕的青蛙
What they found was the stuff of nightmares...

380
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:09,661
这些青蛙要么多长了一条腿 要么缺了一条腿
They found frogs with extra limbs, missing limbs,

381
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:13,565
这些畸形青蛙就是大自然的反面教材
Deformities at seemed to defy nature.

382
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,969
美国其它地方也有相似的报道
Similar reports began to surface from around the country,

383
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:20,906
这敲响了警钟
Sounding an alarm.

384
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,608
在耶鲁大学
At yale university,

385
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,544
David Skelly博士及其学生
Dr.David Skelly and his students

386
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:30,482
8年来都在收集畸形的青蛙
Have been collecting deformed frogs for the past eight years.

387
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,185
他们的研究结果有非凡的意义
Their findings have disturbing implications --

388
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:36,455
无论是对青蛙 还是对人类而言
For frogs and humans alike.

389
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:41,660
科学家发现 有一种寄生虫会导致多腿
Scientists have discovered that a kind of parasite can cause multiple limbs --

390
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:46,899
但Skelly博士关心其他的青蛙畸形 这些畸形还无法解析
But Skelly is concerned about other deformities that have yet to be explained.

391
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,068
这是豹蛙
Skelly: this is a leopard frog,

392
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:53,539
它感染了Ribeiroia吸虫就变成这样子
And this is what happens when they're infected with a parasite called Ribeiroia.

393
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:58,143
这是导致自然界肢体畸形的一个原因
This is one of the causes for limb deformities in the natural world.

394
00:27:58,211 --> 00:28:01,814
虽然多腿动物受到很大的关注
While the animals with the extra legs get a lot of attention,

395
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,882
这才是我真正关心的
This is the animal that really concerns me --

396
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,484
这是一只变态前的豹蛙
This is a leopard frog metamorph,

397
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:09,121
只有一条隐形腿
As well, and it's got only one hind limb.

398
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,190
这是蛙尾
This is the animal's tail here.

399
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:14,126
这些动物至关重要
What makes these animals so significant is

400
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,362
因为我们不知道造成畸形的原因
We really don't know what causes these kinds of deformities.

401
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:20,866
在收集青蛙的地方 没发现寄生虫
The parasite is not found where this frog was collected.

402
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,936
所以畸形与寄生虫无关
So that can't be what's going on here.

403
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:27,339
是其它原因造成的 我们还不清楚
It's got to be something else, and we don't know what it is.

404
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:36,949
Skelly博士希望在其它地方找到答案
Argo: Skelly has been looking for answers in some unlikely places.

405
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,984
这里是康涅狄格的郊区
Here in suburban connecticut,

406
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:43,255
Skelly博士发现这里的动物生活 并不像大家想的那样隐蔽
He's finding that life might not be as sheltered as folks once thought.

407
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:47,159
普通居民都可能加速青蛙的灭亡
The average resident might be hastening the demise of frogs,

408
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,828
就像居民危害自己的健康一样
While they undermine their own health.

409
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:56,368
我们几年前就来这个池塘取样本
Skelly: we started sampling this pond a few years ago,

410
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:59,138
发现有一些畸形青蛙繁殖
And we're finding reproductive deformities in the frogs.

411
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:01,340
那里有一只
There's another one.

412
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,877
像这样的郊区池塘
In suburban ponds like this,

413
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:10,249
我们发现21%的青蛙都是畸形的
We're finding that about 21% of all the frogs have deformities -- that is,

414
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,085
例如雄蛙会产卵
Male frogs are growing eggs inside their testes.

415
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,721
十分不正常
And that is not normal at all.

416
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,757
布满池塘的浮萍
Argo: the duckweed that's choking this pond

417
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:22,528
可能是化学品造成的 例如肥料
Is probably caused by chemicals like fertilizers.

418
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,598
但Skelly博士也关心 其它一些不明显的化合物
But Skelly is also concerned about compounds that are less conspicuous.

419
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,667
我们很多人没有认识到
Skelly: I think a lot of people don't realize

420
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:29,968
使用化学品时
That when they use chemicals,

421
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:32,137
或者把药丸冲下马桶
Or if they flush medications down their toilet,

422
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:34,740
这些物质会流出房子
That it could end up passing right out of the house,

423
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,176
经过特殊的管道 流入池塘
Right through a septic field, and right into a pond.

424
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,812
很多人都没注意到这些
It's just not something people have thought about --

425
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,949
同样 科学家、监督人和决策人
And to be fair, it's not something that scientists and regulators and policy makers

426
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:45,918
也很少注意到这些
Have thought about very much, either.

427
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:51,290
流进池塘的水 含有像药丸这样的东西
All of that water collects in these basins. Things like medications.

428
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:53,892
大家吃很多各种各样的药丸
There are a huge range of drugs that people take,

429
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,161
很多药丸对人体无害
And many of them leave our bodies intact.

430
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:01,233
举个例子 最明显的药丸 避孕药
We're starting with the most obvious candidate -- birth control pills.

431
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,103
实验发现 合成的雌激素
We know in the laboratory that synthetic estrogen

432
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,238
会导致这种后果
Can cause these kinds of problems.

433
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,606
现在我们要知道
Now we just need to figure out

434
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,775
这个地方是否也在发生同样的事情
If that is what's going on in places like this.

435
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:17,516
和Skelly博士一样 在加州大学伯克利分校的Tyrone Hayes博士也认同这样的警告
Argo: Skelly's alarm is shared by Dr.Tyrone Hayes at u.c. Berkeley.

436
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:18,917
如果整个种族的青蛙
Hayes: if an entire class of animals

437
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,853
已经在生存了几百万年
That's been around for millions and millions of years

438
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,956
如果青蛙数量正在下降 并面临灭绝的潜在危险
Is rapidly declining and potentially going extinct,

439
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:26,825
我们真的需要想想 我们做过的事情
We really need to think about what we've done,

440
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:31,030
我们的行为最终会危害自己
And if our advances will eventually harm us all.

441
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,498
我非常热爱科学
I really like the science.

442
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:38,771
我喜欢解决问题 我喜欢看”犯罪现场“
I like solving the puzzle, I like the CSI.

443
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,606
我也喜欢青蛙
I also like frogs,

444
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:43,342
所以我有兴趣搞研究 帮助大家了解
And so I also feel a real drive to help understand

445
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:48,414
杀虫剂及其它的化学品 是如何影响两栖动物的
How pesticides and other chemicals are affecting amphibian populations.

446
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:50,282
Hayes博士和他的学生
Argo: Hayes and his students

447
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,652
在沙林纳斯谷寻找线索
Have been looking for clues in the salinas valley.

448
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,790
50%的美国农产品 来自加利福尼亚州
Hayes: 50% of the u.s.'s agricultural products come out of california.

449
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:02,494
大约85%的生菜 来自于沙林纳斯谷
And something like 85% of the country's lettuce comes out of salinas.

450
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,096
这里还生产90%的杏仁
90% of the almonds.

451
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:07,232
沙林纳斯谷是美国人的色拉盘
It's called the salad bowl of america.

452
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,803
加利福尼亚州使用的杀虫剂比其他州多
California uses more pesticides than any other state.

453
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,772
排名第二的是佛罗里达州
The second biggest is florida.

454
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,444
像三氯硝基甲之类的杀虫剂 被用在这里的草莓地
Things like chloropicrin is used out here on the strawberries --

455
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,346
三氯硝基甲是一种神经气体
Chloropicrin is a nerve gas.

456
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:24,083
这里的人正在使用它 青蛙在外面会吸收它
These are the guys who are applying it, they're out there picking it.

457
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,984
溴化甲烷是一种薰剂
Methyl bromide is a fumigant,

458
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,454
人们把薰剂泵入土壤
Something they pump into the soil.

459
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,456
伙计 这个大家伙是什么?
What are some of the other big ones, you guys?

460
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,624
二嗪农 还有阿特拉津（除草剂）
Diazinol... Some atrazine...

461
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:37,763
所有这些化合物都会流进河里 就像这条河
This will all end up in the river that we're working in here.

462
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,272
就像我们来到某处灌木
It might look like we're out in the bush somewhere,

463
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,275
但是两边15尺开外就是农田
But 15 feet on either side, we're surrounded by agriculture,

464
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,579
废物都跑进河里了
And the runoff ends up in this river.

465
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,015
藻类就是养分充沛的结果
All the algae is the result of all the nutrients,

466
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,317
因为农田需要很多肥料
Because a lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture,

467
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:03,022
一旦肥料进入水里面 藻类就繁荣生长了
And once those fertilizers get into the water, you get these blooms of algae.

468
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,190
我认为 藻类不是河水清洁的证明
I wouldn't say it's the sign of a healthy river.

469
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:08,894
这种地方 我们通常能找到有害的免疫系统
This is a site where we typically find compromised immune systems --

470
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:11,463
蝌蚪无法应对疾病
Tadpoles that aren't able to fight off disease.

471
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,623
我们的研究表明
Our data so far suggests that

472
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:21,340
杀虫剂导致压力荷尔蒙的增加
The mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones,

473
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,742
这些压力荷尔蒙引起抑制免疫反应
And those stress hormones cause immunosuppression,

474
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,146
最终导致生物无法应对任何一种的病原体
Which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.

475
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:34,586
在研究化学废水的同时 Hayes也盯上了另外一个元凶
Argo: while investigating chemical runoff, Hayes stumbled on another culprit.

476
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:37,356
我们来到萨利纳斯河
Hayes: we started going to the salinas river

477
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:39,458
寻找红腿的本地蛙
Looking for the native red-legged frog,

478
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:43,929
我们发现红腿蛙完全被牛蛙取代
And it turns out that it has been completely replaced on the river by bullfrogs.

479
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,465
这种具有侵略性的牛蛙
This invasive bullfrog itself

480
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:49,168
其数量也在减少 当地人是其中一个原因
Is one of the causes for decline in man of these areas.

481
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:50,436
所以我们研究牛蛙
And so we're studying them

482
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:52,571
牛蛙在这里过得并不好
In areas where they're not doing well

483
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:56,608
我们试图了解 造成本地红腿蛙灭绝的原因
To try to understand what may be driving some of the native species to extinction.

484
00:32:56,676 --> 00:33:02,114
企业家从东海岸把牛蛙运来这里
Argo: entrepreneurs transported bullfrogs from the east coast,

485
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:05,317
希望养殖牛蛙 作为人类的食物
Hoping to farm them for food.

486
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,986
然而 企业家却放出了这种肉食动物
Instead, they unleashed a carnivore

487
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:11,290
牛蛙已经毁掉了加利福尼亚的本地蛙
That has decimated california's native frogs.

488
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:18,764
即使强壮的牛蛙 也不能适应河水里的毒物
It seems that even the tough bullfrog isn't doing so well with the toxins in this water.

489
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:23,602
回到实验室 Hayes研究另外一种非本地蛙
Back at berkeley, Hayes is studying another non-native.

490
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,940
非洲爪蛙一度用于人类的妊娠试验
African clawed frogs were once used in human pregnancy tests.

491
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,510
当瓜蛙变得无用时 就被抛弃了
But when they became obsolete, many were discarded.

492
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:35,147
这些瓜蛙来自加利福尼亚附近的水流
These were collected from streams around california.

493
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,615
我们切开一只瓜蛙
Hayes: we're removing an invasive frog,

494
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:40,352
通过研究瓜蛙 来了解两栖动物数量下降的原因
And we're studying them to try to understand declining amphibians.

495
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,155
Hayes研究化学品的影响
Hayes is testing the effects of chemicals

496
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:45,891
阿特拉津 一种普通的除草剂
Like atrazine, a common herbicide.

497
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:50,829
这些动物 我们都切除了雌性染色体
Hayes: we have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.

498
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,498
01号标本
Woman: specimen zero-one.

499
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:55,334
这些在基因上 都是雄性动物
Hayes: these animals that we know are genetic males

500
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:58,237
我们把这些动物 一直和阿特拉津接触
Have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life,

501
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,205
很多这些基因上的雄性动物
And many of these genetic males

502
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,341
现在都变成雌性动物了
Now are turning into females.

503
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:03,742
你可以看到 他会产卵
You can see he's got eggs

504
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,644
看上去好像是液囊
That kind of look like they're in a sac.

505
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,347
其实是黄色的卵 而且快要产下来了
These are actually yolked eggs, ready to be laid.

506
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:11,183
我们可以改变性别比例
What's happening is you're skewing sex ratios,

507
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:13,452
你可以打破基因瓶颈
You can get genetic bottlenecking,

508
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,121
这会造成毁坏 坦白说
Which can cause crashes, and quite frankly,

509
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:17,456
如果你在基因上是男的
If you're a genetic male,

510
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:20,125
长大后变成男人 这非常好
It would be nice if you developed as a genetic male,

511
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,995
现在我们有一种存在环境中的 很普通的化学品
And now we have a chemical very common in the environment,

512
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,064
可以有效地改变动物的性别
That's effectively sex-reversing animals.

513
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,066
我要向你展示 令人惊奇的情景
I'm going to show you something pretty amazing,

514
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,468
科学而言
Scientifically speaking.

515
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:38,510
值得注意的是这一对
The one that's sort of remarkable is this pair.

516
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,846
它们都是雄性动物
These are both males.

517
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,449
底部的那个变成雌性动物
The one on the bottom acting as the female

518
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,951
我们动情地叫它"Darnell."
We affectionately refer to as "Darnell."

519
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:49,788
他的基因是雄性的 却不仅在行动上像雌性
He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female,

520
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:52,091
他还会像雌性那样产卵
He lays eggs like a female.

521
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:57,229
他/她一生都暴露于阿特拉津杀虫剂
He/she has been exposed to atrazine all of her -- his/her life --

522
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,931
我不知道怎样称呼它
I don't even really know how to reference it.

523
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:01,000
这是“Darnell”第三次产卵
This is Darnell's third clutch.

524
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,303
所以Darnell有男女后代 我们已经把这些后代养大
So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.

525
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,271
你可以看看底部的卵
You can see eggs in the bottom.

526
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,607
其实这是他今天的第二次卵了
This is actually her second clutch for today.

527
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:13,779
他/她交配已经超过24小时
He/she has been copulating for getting close to 24 hours now.

528
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:17,516
这可能是我研究中 看到的最引入注目的事情
This is probably one of the most remarkable things i've seen in my work,

529
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:19,418
但我的心情很复杂
But I personally have mixed emotions.

530
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,434
我对科学着迷
I'm very excited about the science

531
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:25,024
我试图了解变性机理 但另一方面
And trying to understand the mechanism, but on the other hand,

532
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:27,626
我又非常担心 这种污染物非常普遍
I am worried -- this is the most common contaminant

533
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:29,228
地下水、地面水和饮用水中都有
In ground and surface water, and drinking water,

534
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:33,932
使动物变性的阿特拉津的 浓度水平
And the level of atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female

535
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,236
只有我们饮用水的 规定值的三分之一
Is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.

536
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,539
我认为全球两栖动物数量下降
I really think that the global amphibian decline

537
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:43,575
正在暗示人类的健康问题
Is telling us something about human health.

538
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:47,713
人类用水中的毒物水平远远高于青蛙
Argo: the toxins in our waters are reaching well beyond frogs.

539
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:51,950
畸形繁殖的报道常常见于
Reproductive abnormalities have been reported in everything from

540
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:55,621
鳄鱼、北极熊 以及人类
Alligators to polar bears... To humans.

541
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,122
这并不只是青蛙的事情
Hayes: it's not just a problem with frogs

542
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,557
我们也应该关注
We should be concerned about.

543
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,925
造成青蛙畸形的水
The water that's causing their problems

544
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,226
人类也在饮用同样的水
Is the same water that we're drinking

545
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:03,162
并用同样的水来灌溉农作物
And using to water our crops.

546
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:07,333
无论是青蛙还是人类
Argo: frog or human,

547
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,236
我们都呼吸同样的空气 饮用同样的水
We all breathe the same air and drink the same water.

548
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:14,673
为了青蛙和人类的利益 专家一致认为
For their sake and ours, experts agree --

549
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:18,610
我们必须行动起来 没有时间了
We have to take action, and there's no time to lose.

550
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:24,016
澳大利亚受致命的壶菌的打击最大
Australia has been hard hit by the deadly fungus, chytrid.

551
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:26,251
7种两栖动物灭绝了
Seven species have been lost,

552
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,688
更多的物种正在面临相同的命运
And more are on a fast track to extinction.

553
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:33,459
现在 气候变化 火上加油
Now, add climate change to the mix.

554
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:37,162
澳大利亚受干旱影响 史无前例
Australia is experiencing its worst drought on record --

555
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,332
两栖动物也受到打击
And amphibians are feeling it.

556
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,835
南部的布罗雨滨蛙
In the south, a population of booroolong frogs

557
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:45,070
在河干时全部死掉了
Was evacuated when their river dried up.

558
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:50,376
Gerry Marantelli一直养殖青蛙来应对气候变化
Gerry Marantelli has been breeding the frogs to hedge against climate change.

559
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:52,578
这里有些不错的卵 Erika.
Marantelli: we have some good eggs here, Erika.

560
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,546
很新鲜 不错
These are fresh, but they're good.

561
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:57,282
一些新卵
Some new ones.

562
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,720
在墨尔本市的郊区 Marantelli和他的爱妻Erika,
Argo: just outside of melbourne, Marantelli and his wife, Erika,

563
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,789
建立了一个不寻常的庇护所
Have created an unusual ark.

564
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:06,058
开始时我们买不起房子
Marantelli: we couldn't afford buildings when we started.

565
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,326
怎么办呢？
We thought, "what do we do?"

566
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,329
我们买来轮船的集装箱
We bought shipping containers.

567
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:14,566
像这样的集装箱 可防水、隔热
Shipping containers like this are waterproof and insulated,

568
00:37:14,634 --> 00:37:17,870
把集装箱改装成完美的青蛙实验室
And we can convert them into a perfectly useful lab for these frogs,

569
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:19,672
安装灌溉系统
Installing irrigation systems --

570
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,440
所有青蛙需要的东东
All the things that the frogs need --

571
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:23,442
价钱不多
But they're a fraction of the price.

572
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,244
集装箱是便携式的 可以拆开
And to top it off, they're portable,

573
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,147
所以青蛙需要帮助时 我们可以把它们运到世界的任何地方
So we can ship them anywhere in the world where frogs need help.

574
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:32,785
庇护所里面有澳大利亚 频临灭绝的青蛙
Argo: here at the ark are australia's most endangered frogs --

575
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:34,319
布罗雨滨蛙
The booroolong frog,

576
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,922
斑纹树蛙
The spotted tree frog,

577
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,124
还有引入注目的澳洲夜宴蛙
And the extraordinary corroboree.

578
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,793
名字来自土著语
Its name is an aboriginal word

579
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,795
意思是"庆祝"或"聚会"
For "celebration" or "gathering,"

580
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:45,397
庆祝时 老者常常涂上黑黄相间的颜料
Where the elders often wear black and yellow paint.

581
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:48,367
澳洲夜宴蛙 一度繁荣昌盛
Corroborees used to be plentiful,

582
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:53,505
但是壶菌把它们 逼到生存的边缘
But chytrid has pushed them to the edge.

583
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:57,810
谈到把青蛙放回野外 Marantelli夫妇异常激动
The Marantellis are vehement about returning frogs to the wild.

584
00:37:57,877 --> 00:38:02,314
尽快搞清楚这个难题 解决它
Marantelli: the quicker we can understand the problems they face, fix the problems,

585
00:38:02,382 --> 00:38:04,516
把青蛙放回野外 越快越好
And get these frogs back into the wild, the better.

586
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:07,186
青蛙不能100年都生活在鱼柜里
They can't live in a fish tank for 100 years --

587
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,620
我们毁掉了吃青蛙的动物
We disrupt the things that eat the frogs,

588
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:09,855
以及青蛙吃的动物
The things that the frogs eat.

589
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:12,458
它们都是生态系统的一部分
They are part of an ecosystem,

590
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:16,328
这个集装箱不是生态系统
And this tank is not an ecosystem.

591
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:18,697
这些小青蛙奔向溪流
Argo: these little frogs are headed back to their stream.

592
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,766
干旱终于过去了
The drought has finally broken...

593
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,435
至少现在过去了
At least for now.

594
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:27,072
这是澳洲夜宴蛙 来自Boorooree河
Marantelli: these are booroolong frogs from Boorooree creek.

595
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,741
随着气候的变化
With climate change,

596
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:31,010
在上次干旱季节 Boorooree的河流变干了
Boorooree creek dried up in the last drought,

597
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:33,645
所以我们必须囚禁并养育它们
So we had to bring them into captivity and breed them,

598
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,114
这些比较年轻
And these are all the young ones

599
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:37,116
我们把它们放回Boorooree河
That we're taking back to Boorooree creek.

600
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:41,720
我们大概放回500个青蛙
We've got a little bit over 500 frogs to go back.

601
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:44,356
明天你们会回到Boorooree河
You'll be back to Boorooree creek tomorrow.

602
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:47,359
兴奋吗? 快看!
Are you excited? Look at that!

603
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:50,763
看上去很兴奋!
You look excited!

604
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,464
澳洲夜宴蛙还遭遇
With the booroolong frog,

605
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:56,702
气候变暖 和更长久的干旱
Climate change -- warming conditions and the prolonged drought,

606
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,239
所有这些都汇合在一起 使溪流停止流动
All of that sort of came together and made the stream stop flowing.

607
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:03,809
栖息地正在改变 这意味着环境有些不对劲
The fact that those habitats are changing right now means something is going wrong,

608
00:39:03,877 --> 00:39:07,012
也意味着我们要行动起来 来帮助这些小伙计
And that means we've got to do something about helping the little guys.

609
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,387
快看!
Look at that!

610
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:18,424
你想看澳洲夜宴蛙吗?
You want to see some booroolong frogs?

611
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:20,259
看吧
Have a look.

612
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:22,861
你知道他们是谁? 你们的新朋友
You know what they are? There's your new friends.

613
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:28,033
今晚好好聆听
You listen to them tonight.

614
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:32,905
Marantelli留了些青蛙在实验中心
Argo: Marantelli has kept some frogs back at the center as a safeguard.

615
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,075
作为气候变化的保护者 它们还需要帮助
With climate change, they might need help again.

616
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:37,509
快看 欢迎回家!
Look at that -- welcome home!

617
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:40,779
他们下午放了一些小蛙
They release some of the froglets in the afternoon light;

618
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,681
小蛙会和其它动物分享这条河
They'll share the rest with the locals.

619
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,483
不要上那里 鸟会吃了你
Not up there -- a bird will eat you.

620
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,819
走吧 找个小裂缝 回家吧
Go and find a little crevice. Go home.

621
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:57,696
噢 快看 肥仔 快走啊!
Oh, look at this fat one, harry!

622
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,331
孩子们看青蛙时 我很开心
Marantelli: I love it when kids are looking at frogs.

623
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,499
那里有一只大肥蛙
There, that's a huge fat one.

624
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,268
我们要做的是 喂它们
That's what we do, we feed them

625
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:04,803
好多、好多的蟋蟀
Lots and lots and lots of crickets --

626
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:07,606
你一生中都没有看过这么多的蟋蟀
More crickets than you've ever seen in your life.

627
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:09,608
如果孩子们不感兴趣
If they're not interested,

628
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:12,044
50年后这个计划就会破产
Then the project falls apart in 50 years.

629
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,983
确信社区的人都行动起来 这非常重要
It's really important to make sure the community's on board,

630
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:21,553
特别是周围有青蛙的社区
Particularly where the community lives amongst the frogs.

631
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:25,891
调动大家 带大家到野外
Tip everything up and tip them out.

632
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,527
让他们看看青蛙的栖息地
They're out there watching the habitat,

633
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:29,628
他们会照顾这些溪流
And they'll look after those creeks

634
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,563
现在澳洲夜宴蛙回来了
Now that the booroolong frogs are back.

635
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:43,275
我们就像桥梁 帮助这些青蛙度过难关
We're just a bridge across a bump -- for all of these frogs --

636
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,178
为了帮助青蛙 不管需要1年 还是10年
Whether it takes us a year to help them out, or ten years,

637
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:50,149
还是20年 我们都会一如既往 把青蛙救回来
Or twenty years, we should always be trying to put them back.

638
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:55,154
即使最艰难的情况 也不会影响Marantelli
Argo: even the most dire situation won't deter Marantelli.

639
00:40:55,221 --> 00:41:00,392
这些斑纹树蛙 受水中的壶菌影响很大
These spotted tree frogs have been struck hard by chytrid.

640
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,531
树蛙曾经生活在水中 真菌杀死所有的树蛙
On the stream where they once lived, the fungus wiped out an entire population.

641
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:08,133
只有一只雄性蛙幸免遇难
Only one male was spared.

642
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:10,336
这是在雌性蛙的帮助下实现的
With the help of captive females,

643
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:13,105
Marantelli把灭绝后的树蛙 又救了回来
Marantelli bred them back from extinction --

644
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,506
三年前
And three years ago,

645
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:19,378
Marantelli就开始放回青蛙 即使河水中有壶菌
They began returning frogs, despite the presence of chytrid.

646
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:25,050
小组每个春天都回来 寻找生还者
Each spring, the team comes back to look for survivors.

647
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:30,756
我们没其它办法 只好帮助这些青蛙产生抗菌能力
Marantelli: we have no other choice but to help these frogs develop resistance.

648
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,758
虽然我们要养殖很多青蛙
Even if we have to breed so many frogs

649
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,727
并把它们放回野外 95%的青蛙都死掉了
And put them out there where 95% of them die.

650
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:35,961
哪些还活着?
Who doesn't die?

651
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:37,730
产生抵抗能力的青蛙
The resistant ones.

652
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:41,266
我们要做的是 引导青蛙进化
What we're trying to do is drive evolution,

653
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:44,036
使青蛙和壶菌一起生活
So these frogs will be able to live with chytrid.

654
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,204
不要动 小蛙蛙!
Don't you move, little froggie!

655
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:46,438
[ 笑 ]
[ laughs ]

656
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:53,345
抓到了! 你抓到它了吗？
Got him! Did you catch him?

657
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:54,847
抓到了 看！
Yeah, look at that.

658
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:57,683
这是我们养的小蛙
That's one of our babies.

659
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:03,055
就在这里 壶菌令青蛙灭绝
This is where they were wiped out by the chytrid fungus.

660
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:05,124
我们挽救了青蛙 使它幸免于灭绝
We've just brought a frog back from extinction.

661
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,658
这样做再好不过了
You can't do much better than that.

662
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:11,030
青蛙在实验室中长大 我们把它们放回水中
They grew up in our lab, we put them back, and we've been able to find them

663
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,931
放回两三年后 我们依然能够找到它们
Even two and three years after we've let them go.

664
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,200
发现它们在壶菌中生存下来了
To find them surviving with the chytrid fungus

665
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:17,069
这表明我们可以把青蛙放回野外
Shows us that we can put frogs back,

666
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:23,776
青蛙能够和壶菌一起生存 这带给我们希望
They can live here with the fungus, and it gives us some real hope.

667
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:28,180
看上去 青蛙胜了这个回合
Argo: it looks like the frog might be winning this round.

668
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:31,216
但是面临着各个方面的压力
But with pressures coming from so many directions,

669
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:34,153
应对危机意味着 在各个前线发动攻击
Stemming the crisis means attacking it on every front --

670
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,490
无论是壶菌 还是栖息地丧失
Whether it's chytrid, or habitat loss.

671
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:40,859
在乔治亚州的中部
Here in the heart of georgia,

672
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:45,564
亚特兰大植物公园一直专注于植物
The atlanta botanical gardens used to focus only on plants.

673
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:50,969
12年前 公园决定为两栖动物 提供一些必需的帮助
Twelve years ago, they decided to give amphibians some much-needed help.

674
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:53,906
现在 公园养殖了超过30种的青蛙
Today they house over 30 species,

675
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:57,343
很多都是从壶菌蔓延的巴拿马救回来的
Many of them rescued from panama when chytrid swept through.

676
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,915
但是这些天来 乔治亚州的本地青蛙也有麻烦了
But these days, some of georgia's very own frogs are in trouble.

677
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:07,353
穴蛙几乎丧失了所有的栖息地
The gopher frog has lost almost all of its habitat.

678
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,321
为了把穴蛙从死亡边沿救回来
To bring it back from the edge,

679
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:12,191
公园是重生计划中的一员
The gardens is part of a head start program.

680
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,926
公园在养殖小蛙
They're raising froglets.

681
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:18,032
现在公园度过了青蛙 最艰难、脆弱的阶段
Now that they're past their most vulnerable stage,

682
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,332
这些小家伙快能回到野外野外
These little guys are about to hit the road.

683
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,715
Robert Hill从蛙卵开始养殖
They were raised from eggs by Robert Hill,

684
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:25,971
现在小蛙快要回到野外了
And now they're going back to the wild.

685
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,040
穴蛙就在我们的后院
Hill: the gopher frog is right here in our own backyard.

686
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,943
挽救穴蛙不需要很多钱
And it doesn't take millions and millions of dollars.

687
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,811
我们只需要出手相助
They just need a helping hand.

688
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:36,815
John Jensen工作于自然资源部
Argo: John Jensen, with the department of natural resources,

689
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:39,485
他知道把青蛙放回野外 并不是想象的那么简单
Knows that returning these frogs is not as simple as it might sound.

690
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:46,692
穴蛙丧失了97%的栖息地
The gopher frog has lost 97% of its habitat.

691
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,396
只剩下3%的栖息地
Jensen: when you have 3% of this habitat remaining,

692
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:53,432
所有的穴蛙都依靠这些栖息地
And all these animals that depend on it,

693
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,335
穴蛙消失的原因显而易见
It's obvious why they're disappearing.

694
00:43:56,403 --> 00:44:02,007
地鼠龟也在这里生活
Argo: the gopher tortoise also lives here.

695
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:04,777
值得注意的是 穴蛙与地鼠龟共享洞穴
Remarkably, the frogs share the tortoises' burrows,

696
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:08,180
洞穴大概有10尺深
Which can reach ten feet deep.

697
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:11,183
穴蛙不仅依靠湿地
Gopher frogs depend not only on the wetland,

698
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,985
还依靠周围的森林
But the surrounding forest.

699
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:15,354
在自然保护计划的帮助下
Thanks to the nature conservancy,

700
00:44:15,422 --> 00:44:19,758
现在穴蛙的栖息地大约有2000亩
They now have nearly 2,000 acres of protected habitat.

701
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:24,630
接下来就看穴蛙的表现了
Now, it's up to the frogs.

702
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:29,301
当你花了大量的时间 来养大这些小蛙
Hill: when you've spent a lot of time raising these little guys up

703
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,770
它们都是来自果冻状的小黑点
From little tiny black dots in a jelly,

704
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,606
心情就像第一天送孩子去上学
It's kind of like sending your kid off to school for the first day.

705
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,343
这就是保护工作
This is what conservation is all about --

706
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,813
不要把保护动物关在动物园里
It's not just keeping it alive in a zoo,

707
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,482
应该养大它 并把它放回属于它的地方
It's breeding it and being able to put it back where it belongs.

708
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,694
如果我们可以减轻一点 青蛙受到的压力
Argo: if we can ease at least some of the pressures on frogs,

709
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:58,764
我们就能帮助青蛙 不管狂风暴雨
We might be able to help them weather the storm.

710
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:04,770
在约塞米蒂国家公园 Knapp博士已经决定
Back in yosemite, Knapp has decided

711
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,807
是给这些黄腿山蛙 一些机会了
It's time to take some chances with the mountain yellow-legged frog.

712
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:13,412
有些山蛙 看上去能够与壶菌共存
A few populations seem to be holding their ground with the fungus.

713
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,913
它们产生抵抗力了吗?
Could they be resistant?

714
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:18,250
如果产生了抵抗力 它们会重新占领这些湖吗？
And if so, could they re-colonize some of the ponds

715
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:20,419
青蛙曾经丧失了这些湖
Where the frogs have been lost?

716
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,455
Knapp博士认为值得尝试
Knapp feels it's worth taking the risk.

717
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:28,460
小组收集了一些健康的青蛙 重新转移它们
The team is collecting frogs from a healthy population to relocate them.

718
00:45:28,528 --> 00:45:33,098
我们要运送这些青蛙 到五六里外的新地方
Knapp: we're going to be moving these frogs five or six miles to some new sites,

719
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,101
然后把青蛙放回湖中 整个夏天
And then we'll return to those lakes throughout the summer,

720
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:38,771
重新抓回青蛙 用棉签檫拭青蛙
Recapturing those frogs and then swabbing each frog,

721
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:43,075
以了解青蛙在新环境中 的生存状况
Trying to get a sense of how well they're surviving in that new environment.

722
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:48,414
每个青蛙都测试真菌 并做好记号
Argo: each one is swabbed for the fungus and given an id.

723
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,582
我们植入标签
Knapp: we insert this little tag,

724
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,886
就像植入宠物的那些标签
That's the same tag that some people put in their pets.

725
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:58,023
这给予每个青蛙 一个独特的身份区别
It essentially gives each frog a unique identification number,

726
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:02,528
使我们区分不同时间的 不同青蛙
And that allows us to identify individuals through time.

727
00:46:02,595 --> 00:46:07,099
转移青蛙有点令人难以忍受
It is a little nerve-racking to move these frogs,

728
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,703
因为青蛙转移到新湖
Because chances are good in the next two or three years

729
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,207
经过了两三年 青蛙可能全部都死掉
Following their move to a new lake, they're all going to disappear.

730
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,542
这是最坏的情况
In the worst-case scenario,

731
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:18,377
你牺牲了那些青蛙
You're sacrificing those individuals

732
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:21,613
来了解青蛙死亡的原因 这可能有利于整个物种
To learn something that might benefit the species as a whole,

733
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,083
也有利于全世界的两栖动物
And amphibians around the world as a whole.

734
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,185
但是要牺牲那些青蛙 令人非常难过
But it's pretty hard to sacrifice those individuals.

735
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:30,856
它们并不只是数字
They're not just a number.

736
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:33,692
青蛙会被空运到新地点
Argo: the frogs will be airlifted to the relocation site,

737
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,598
这是为了避免五个小时背包搬运 造成的压力
To avoid the stress of a five-hour hike in a backpack.

738
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:22,241
在澳大利亚 救助在继续
Back in australia, the race continues.

739
00:47:22,308 --> 00:47:26,412
壶菌蔓延到山脉
Chytrid has swept through these mountains.

740
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:28,047
在澳大利亚的阿尔卑斯山
Here in the australian alps,

741
00:47:28,114 --> 00:47:30,049
Kosciuszko国家公园
Kosciuszko national park

742
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:34,119
养殖了澳大利亚最后几个澳洲夜宴蛙
Shelters the last of australia's corroboree frogs.

743
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:38,624
公园和新南威尔士的野生动物部门 正在接受一个任务
Parks and wildlife of new south wales is on a mission.

744
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,659
在Gerry Marantelli的帮助下
With the help of Gerry Marantelli,

745
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:45,597
他们希望挽救这个引人注目的蛙类
They hope to save this remarkable species.

746
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:48,634
这些青蛙生存了许多年代
These little guys have survived the eons --

747
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,636
青蛙比恐龙还长命
They outlived the dinosaurs.

748
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,672
但现在青蛙濒临灭绝
But now they're blinking out.

749
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,210
野外的种类少于200种
Fewer than 200 remain in the wild.

750
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,245
紧急措施启动了
As an emergency measure,

751
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:07,252
去年秋天 1000个澳洲夜宴蛙蝌蚪 被放回无壶菌的水域
Last fall, 1,000 corroboree tadpoles were released into tubs of chytrid-free water.

752
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,954
就在这些受保护的育种区
In these protected nurseries,

753
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:11,990
大家希望这些小家伙
It's hoped that the youngsters will make it through

754
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,659
能够度过最脆弱的时期
Their most vulnerable stage, and develop

755
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,995
并发展出应对野外壶菌的抗体
A resistance to the fungus in the wild.

756
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,766
公园和野生动物组织的Marantelli和dave hunter
Marantelli and dave hunter from parks and wildlife

757
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:23,602
回来了解 青蛙能否度过冰冷的冬天
Are back to see if any survived the icy winter.

758
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,838
噢 那里有一只!
Marantelli: oh, there's one!

759
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,406
这里也有蝌蚪
Tadpoles here, too.

760
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,408
如释重负
Hunter: that's a huge relief.

761
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,412
我们的小蝌蚪怎么样了?
Marantelli: how are our little taddies?

762
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,448
噢 那里有两只
Oh, there's two in there.

763
00:48:36,516 --> 00:48:37,716
这儿有一些
There's some in this one.

764
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:39,451
这里有很多蝌蚪
And lots of taddies in this one.

765
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,587
这里也有蝌蚪 真奇妙
Tadpoles here, too. Fantastic.

766
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:43,222
这里也有蝌蚪
And taddies in this one.

767
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,224
我们会拯救青蛙
Marantelli: we're going to save

768
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:49,128
救得越多越好
Some of them, and we're going to save as many as we can.

769
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:53,298
我希望在这些青蛙灭绝前 做一些恰当的事情
I hope that we get it right before these guys go extinct.

770
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:04,643
我们必须行动起来 解决这个难题
We have to do something about fixing this problem.

771
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,045
如果我们什么都不做
If we don't do that,

772
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,914
我们就大错特错了
As humans, then there's something wrong with all of us.

773
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:15,287
人人都应该行动起来 保护当地的青蛙
Everybody has to act locally to do something about it.

774
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:16,588
如果我们现在还不行动
If we don't act now,

775
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:19,458
就再也没有时间 来改变青蛙的命运了
There might not be time to turn it around.

776
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:31,070
走过青蛙的栖息地 我非常难受
It's incredibly sad to wander through a habitat

777
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:33,272
看到青蛙一度繁荣昌盛的地方
And see where a frog once lived.

778
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,341
我站在溪流旁 却悄然无声
I've stood in streams that were silent,

779
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:39,645
我听见全球许多地方 青蛙在灭绝
And i've listened all over the world to places where frogs have vanished,

780
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:42,047
鬼魂在这些地方
And the ghosts are there.

781
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,350
我感觉到 那是灭绝生物的鬼魂
You know, I feel the ghosts of those creatures.

782
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:48,854
我们再也不能 令同样的事情发生了
We just can't keep letting that happen.

783
00:49:58,098 --> 00:50:00,299
令人惊奇的是
It's amazing -- there used to be

784
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:04,303
过去这里每平方米都有几百只青蛙
As many as a hundred of these to every square meter.

785
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,405
我希望某一天
I really hope one day

786
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,807
我带着孩子回到这里
I can bring my kids back here

787
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,011
发现这里每平方米 都有几百个青蛙了
And find a hundred to a square meter once again.

788
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:15,414
但是现在青蛙的情况不太好
But it's not looking too good for this guy at the moment.

789
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:23,022
祝你好运 小伙计
Good luck, little fellow.
