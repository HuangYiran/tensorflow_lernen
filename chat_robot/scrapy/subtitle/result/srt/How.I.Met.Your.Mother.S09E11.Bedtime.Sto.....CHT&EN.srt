老爸老媽浪漫史
第九季  第十一集

5
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,250
星期六  下午5點

6
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,670
<i>馬修和馬文正坐著長途車</i>
<i>Marshall and Marvin were taking the bus</i>

7
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,250
離婚禮還有25小時

8
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>趕來長島和我們見面</i>
<i>on their way to Long Island to meet up with us.</i>

9
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,450
馬文乖乖
There, there, little Marvin.

10
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,370
眼淚拜拜
Let no more tears fall.

11
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,170
很快就要  見到媽媽
We're gonna see mommy in no time at all.

12
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,930
你好  很抱歉吵到你了
Hello there. I'm sorry for all of the noise.

13
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,620
今天把我們都折騰壞了
It's been a long day for the Eriksen boys.

14
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,660
-你說話為啥要押韻  -很高興你注意到了
- Uh... What's with the rhyming? - I'm glad that you ask.

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,860
哄我兒子睡覺  是一件苦差事
To get my son sleeping is no easy task.

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,380
幾周前  這是我妻子的事
A few weeks ago, the job fell to my wife.

17
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,990
當我兒子哭個不停時
And as the poor baby cried out for dear life,

18
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,680
她就一直讀書  但是全不管用
she read every book, but all were no use

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,860
直到讀到《鵝媽媽》  于是突然起作用
until she arrived at a mother named Goose.

20
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,840
-馬文你為什么  -她注意到了
- Why, Marvin... - She noted.

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,850
原來押韻的故事書會讓你想睡覺
...these rhymes make you tired!

22
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,980
從那開始  馬文睡覺
And ever since then, all young marvin's required

23
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,500
只需一本押韻故事書  便能片刻乖乖進夢鄉
is one book of rhymes, and to dream land he goes.

24
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,050
我現在讀點啥呢
Now, what shall we read?

25
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,180
糟了  我的書忘在車里了
Oh, crap, I left his book in the car!

26
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,140
完蛋了
That blows.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,880
不是吧  真是太倒霉
Oh, no, what a bummer!

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,630
運氣真太背
What craptastic luck!

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,970
押韻書一沒  旅途注定累
Without marvin's rhyme book, this ride's gonna suck!

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,880
請問在座哪位有詩集
Does anyone here have some poetry maybe?

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,800
或者給點建議也可以
Or any advice?

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,010
我的建議就是別生孩
Yeah! Don't have a baby!

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,890
如果不想讓小馬文醒過來
I guess if I don't want young Marvin to wake up,

34
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,210
唯有自己編個押韻故事來
the rhymes will just have to be ones that I make up.

35
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,160
我要秒速內編起小詩歌來
I'll whip up some poetry in seconds flat!

36
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,310
《體育報》  
紐約大都會球隊慘敗

37
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,240
我知道了
Oh, I know!

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,860
這個故事叫《莫斯比出擊》
This story's called Mosby at the bat!

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,800
莫斯比出擊

40
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,360
泰德愛情不順  前情十分堪憂
The outlook wasn't brilliant for poor Ted's romantic life.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,050
即使年近四十  依舊沒有老婆
He was deep into his thirties, and yet, still he had no wife.

42
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,910
突然就在某天  他在學校改卷
But then, one day whilst grading papers,

43
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,510
命運將他作弄
life sent him a whammy.

44
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,160
物理教授名麗薩
A physics prof named Lisa

45
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,130
家鄉乃是邁阿密
who'd just moved here from miami.

46
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,860
教授
Professor?

47
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,650
她靦腆地叫聲他  他回答
She asked timidly. He answered:

48
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,010
叫我泰德
Call me Ted.

49
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,320
我無意打擾你
I don't want to bother you.

50
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,410
-請坐  -他說道
- Please, have a seat. - He said.

51
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,750
我是新來教師  想來尋求建議
I'm fairly new to teaching, and I'm looking for advice.

52
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,150
每晚我都試講  偶爾試講兩回
Every night I practice giving lectures, sometimes twice.

53
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,720
但每當教磁力
But when I teach Magnetic force,

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,890
學生迷茫眼放空
I just see eyeballs glazing.

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,770
于是我到處打聽  你的教學人人夸
I asked around, and people say your lectures are amazing.

56
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,860
聲名遠揚口碑佳
Which is really saying something,

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,280
畢竟建筑學  乏味又無趣
Because, architecture? Yawn.

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,370
泰德想的是
And Ted thought...

59
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,330
聽你在胡扯  物理就"有趣"
Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting.

60
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,280
繼續
Go on.

61
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,340
你的經驗豐富
It's just that you're so skilled,

62
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,070
而我剛剛起步
And I'm a relative beginner.

63
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,380
如果不嫌棄  請你吃頓飯
If it isn't too much trouble, can I take you out to dinner?

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,420
只求能給些建議  絕不耽誤你時間
I'd love to get some pointers, and I shouldn't keep you late.

65
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,040
不知你意下如何
What do you say?

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,680
你問我意下如何
What do I say?

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,380
西區泰德有妞啦
Teddy westside's got a date!

68
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,370
-萬歲  -我們歡呼
- Hooray! - We cheered.

69
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,320
泰德離開冷板凳
Ted's off the bench!

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,650
小子重回泡妞場
Our boy's back in the game!

71
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,250
謝天又謝地  可憐小泰德
Thank God, it's been a hundred years

72
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,830
寂寞了百年
since Mosby scored a dame.

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,200
上回見咪咪
The last time he saw boobies was

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,130
是在數年前
the screen-test scene in Fame.

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,190
他的前女友
The last girl he dated,

76
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,290
就是"右手黨"
I think "Righty" was her name.

77
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,200
打住  不要太興奮 
Hold it. Let's not all go crazy

78
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,730
雞血打太早
like some wild Berzerkers.

79
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,820
今夜的約會  或許純屬同事情
What if this is just a business meal between co-workers?

80
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,900
泰德細思量  往日失敗約會情
Ted thought back on past failed dates.

81
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,870
哎喲我的媽  這話有道理
Oh, God, that could be true.

82
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,080
多少回我自作多情一人歸
How many times have I come home to find my balls are blue?

83
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,300
若要有戲唱  全都取決你們倆人
It all depends where Ted and his new fetching young floridian

84
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,110
處于子午線的何處
are standing in relation to that puzzling meridian

85
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,190
這條國際"日"界線
called "The international date line."

86
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,610
沒錯  我的新理論
That's right, new theory.

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,490
-你們問這是什么  -沒人問
- "What's that," You ask? - Nobody did.

88
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,820
讓我細細道來  約會子午線
I'll now address your query! The date line

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,500
約會  不是約會

90
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,760
幸福傷心分界線
is the border betwixt happiness and sorrow.

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,990
這邊  今夜孤獨回家
On this side, you go home tonight.

92
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,620
那邊  你明天性福歸來
On this side, home tomorrow.

93
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,180
就在此時此刻  巴尼說盡下流話
And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude,

94
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,800
泰德心中忐忑  出發去見麗薩
Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood.

95
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,940
這算是個約會嗎
Was this a date?

96
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,540
他的心中無定數
He simply couldn't tell how he was faring.

97
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,760
麗薩來了
Then lisa showed up.

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,400
泰德見她衣著便覺有戲唱
Ted rejoiced to see what she was wearing.

99
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,850
若是同事情
For girls at business dinners

100
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,920
領子絕對高
don't have necklines that revealing!

101
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,350
約會

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,550
但只跟他握手
But then a friendly handshake gave poor Ted

103
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,170
泰德深覺不妙
a sinking feeling.

104
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,360
不是約會

105
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,830
然后開始吃飯
And so, the night wore on.

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,190
性福之球旋轉
And back and forth, the globe rotated.

107
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,630
泰德心癢難耐
But still, Ted's curiosity was never fully sated.

108
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,370
到底結局是何
How long could this continue?

109
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,510
一切聽天由命
He was truly fortune's pawn.

110
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,240
直到麗薩看電視
Then Lisa saw the TV.

111
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,980
是洋基隊的比賽
Hey, the Yankees game is on!

112
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,010
-棒球...  -泰德觀察到
- Of baseball... - Ted observed...

113
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,020
你好像挺懂
...You seem to have some firsthand knowledge.

114
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,180
她聳肩說道
To which the lady shrugged and said...

115
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,150
曾打過壘球
I played softball in college.

116
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,920
標準女人裝懂球
Now the age-old softball stereotype's just that,

117
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,050
我就不再多說明
and nothing more.

118
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,070
-好樣的  -洋基隊得分后
- Yeah! - But as the Yankees got a run,

119
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,990
泰德自己難"得分"
Ted feared he wouldn't score.

120
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,630
我們一度以為泰德
For while the date side of the line's

121
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,580
今夜能抱得美人歸
the one we all might guess he's in,

122
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,550
但怕麗薩喜歡錯隊
there'll be no joy in tedville if our Lisa is a...

123
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,620
泰德是克利夫蘭印第安人隊的粉絲

124
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,000
贊  我們贏了
Yes! We win!

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,750
麗薩喝一口酒后說
Then Lisa took a drink and said...

126
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,490
這話可能有點荒謬
This may sound kind of random,

127
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,580
但喜歡洋基有原因
but there actually is a reason for my rabid Yankee fandom.

128
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,400
今天就跟你說實話
I guess I'll just be honest here,

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,440
雖然這話聽來瘋狂
though crazy it may seem.

130
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,270
剛來紐約時  曾與隊員"玩"
My first week in New York, I dated someone on the team.

131
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,360
誰
Which player?

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,690
-我不會說的  -拜托
- I'm not saying. - Please?

133
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,310
你是八卦記者嗎
What are you, a reporter?

134
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,760
泰德開始胡思亂想
Ted's mind began to race.

135
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,730
服務生走近要點菜
The waiter came to take their order.

136
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,780
當麗薩說
As Lisa said...

137
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,910
我要意大利沙司
I might like the spaghetti marinara.

138
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,090
泰德心里想的是
Poor ted just wondered silently...

139
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,760
馬里亞諾· 李維拉[洋基隊員]
Mariano Rivera?

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,040
當她說
And as she said...

141
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,360
聽說這里雞肉面條沙拉好
I read this place has great chicken milano.

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,620
泰德想的是
All Ted could bring himself to think was:

143
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,390
阿方索·索利安拉[洋基隊員]
Alfonso Soriano?

144
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,500
我想吃點有營養的
I want something hearty.

145
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,360
來份味噌鱈魚吧
How about blackened miso cod?

146
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,600
喬·吉拉迪[洋基教練]
Is it Joe Girardi?

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
我了個去  是羅德里格斯嗎[洋基巨星球員]
Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!

148
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,490
行了  泰德  冷靜
Okay, ted, calm down.

149
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,230
給自己打打氣
You've got to get yourself together.

150
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,670
微笑  帥氣
Just smile, be charming,

151
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,340
表現出超凡的魅力  聊聊天氣
ooze charisma, talk about the weather.

152
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,850
這次可能是個約會
For this might be a date,

153
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,040
也就是說可能會有愚蠢的言行
which means there might be hanky-panky.

154
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,130
冷靜  鎮靜  別...
So, dude, be cool, relax, don't even...

155
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,980
快點告訴我是誰
Just tell me which Yankee!

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,310
我不想在這里說
I'd rather not discuss this here.

157
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,180
不過  我也不想
But then again, I'd hate...

158
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,700
讓秘密破壞約會
to let a silly secret ruin such a lovely date.

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,430
約會

160
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,780
既然問題明擺著
If there's an elephant in the room,

161
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,390
我們解決掉便可
why don't we just remove it?

162
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,690
是德瑞克·吉特[洋基隊長]
I dated Derek Jeter.

163
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,430
我有照片能證明
Here's a picture that'll prove it.

164
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,190
泰德看向那照片
As Ted looked at that cell phone pic,

165
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,100
心中有了兩答案
there were two things he reckoned.

166
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,180
這次肯定是約會
This definitely was a date,

167
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,370
吉特

168
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,030
但絕不會有下次
but there wouldn't be a second.

169
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,560
看  有用
See? It worked.

170
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,390
我就說幾句押韻  乖乖兒子就睡著
I said some rhymes, and out my boy did conk.

171
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,320
終于能享受旅程
Now let's enjoy the ride.

172
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,720
讓開  混蛋
Move, jackass!

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,620
我需要一個新故事來哄馬文睡覺
Okay, I need a brand-new tale to silence Marvin's chatter.

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,690
上一個故事的內容不太適合小孩啊
I don't know, that last one had some sketchy subject matter.

175
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,390
抱歉  你坐車之前
Forgive me, but before you got here,

176
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,770
抽了大麻是不是 
did you smoke a joint?

177
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,040
你怎么能給孩子講這么蠢的故事
You don't tell kids a tale that crass!

178
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,620
<i>我覺得他說得對</i>
<i>I guess he had a point.</i>

179
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,790
我知道  我講的東西
I know, I said some things that were,

180
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,050
的確是有點問題
As you say, kind of questionable.

181
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,930
其實像馬文這么大的孩子
The truth is, children Marvin's age

182
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,030
不太容易被影響
Aren't really that impressionable.

183
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,240
那你可否會記得  在這個年齡發生的事情
Do you remember anything from when you were this small?

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,290
三歲的時候摘南瓜  是我記得的第一件事情
Pumpkin picking at age three is the first thing I recall.

185
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,840
他不會記得這個故事  沒錯
He won't remember this. I guess it's true.

186
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,820
最好別記得
It better be.

187
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,870
如果送馬文看心理醫生
Or else we'll end up paying

188
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,130
可得花掉我一大筆錢
through the nose for Marvin's therapy.

189
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,820
兄弟  聊得愉快  但我要去睡了
Okay, buddy, nice chat, but I think I need a break.

190
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,890
兄臺請便
Great idea.

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,850
接下來的故事是
After this story!

192
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,510
羅賓搶了大蛋糕
Robin takes the cake.

193
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,820
羅賓搶了大蛋糕

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,910
東區有家蛋糕店
Once in an east side bakery,

195
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,120
羅賓阿姨進店里  客人紛紛注目禮
Your debonair aunt Robin was making other customers think,

196
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,180
哪里來的女漢子
"Geez, who let this slob in?"

197
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,330
羅賓絲毫不在意  
She didn't care about their stares, or who was looking on.

198
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,520
她與某男剛分離
She'd just broke up with...

199
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,300
凱文
Kevin.

200
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
不對  是蓋爾  還是史酷比
No, Gael. Or Scooby?

201
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,120
或者是唐
Don?

202
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,690
好事不成雙
Now, sometimes, when it rains it pours,

203
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,580
壞事不單行
and sometimes, it starts snowing,

204
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,660
正當奶油滿衣裳
For as cream filling hit her shirt...

205
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,730
羅賓  最近過得怎么樣
Hey, Robin, how's it going?

206
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,790
從前男友又現身
'twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend

207
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,780
卻是加拿大西蒙君
from her younger days in Canada,

208
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,940
西蒙翻身大變樣
But now, he looked quite different...

209
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,120
押韻
Rhyme.

210
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,190
開動腦筋
Uh... Thinking. Uh...

211
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,320
哥們剛收到新消息
I've just been handed a news flash.

212
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,550
加拿大這詞難押韻
The word "Canada" is unrhymeable.

213
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,040
寧可爛醉爬公牛
It's easier to-- I don't know--

214
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,470
勝過為此想破頭
get drunk and try to climb a bull.

215
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,690
問世間多少好漢
But Canada, damn it, ask any man on the planet

216
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,150
被加國無情摧殘
And watch their stammerin' stamina

217
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,900
笨嘴拙舌胡亂編
as they clamor and cram it into the middle of a sentence

218
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,950
唾沫橫飛編不圓
for a shot at repentance,

219
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,780
一心只恨語文差  無奈留待后人搞
Pass the problem on to all their non-rhyming descendants.

220
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,310
嗚呼  加拿大之難  難于上青天
I've never met anyone who could clean up after Canada.

221
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,990
唯我唐尼掃地叔
Except my uncle Tony from the Bronx.

222
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,130
有志掃出一片天
He's a janitor.

223
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,370
臭顯擺啥啊
Show-off.

224
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,130
西蒙  見到你真高興
Simon. Nice to see you.

225
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,970
你怎么來紐約了
So, what brings you to New York?

226
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,570
-我住在紐約了  -真的嗎
- I live here now. - What? Really?

227
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,790
-真的  -真是好哇
- Yeah. - That's great.

228
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,140
給我個叉
Can I get a fork?

229
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,840
西蒙向來沒前途
He'd always been a deadbeat

230
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,730
標準加國裝逼男
and your classic hoser phony,

231
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,390
看到西蒙新氣象  羅賓不由心慌慌
But seeing Simon all cleaned up hit Robin like a zamboni.

232
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,830
羅賓朝他細打量
And as she looked him up and down,

233
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,630
心里又起小波浪
Young Robin felt a tingle.

234
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,330
莫非西蒙終奮起
Had Simon blossomed finally?

235
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,410
不知現在獨身否
And if so, was he single?

236
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,150
太好了
So great.

237
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,540
語氣立刻變柔弱  眼眸閃動送秋波
She purred, whilst batting her eyelashes like a flooze.

238
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,590
我和瑪莎訂終身
Yup, I'm engaged to Louise Marsh,

239
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
按摩浴缸裝家里
And our pad's got a jacuzz!

240
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,350
面包店里  黯然無光  地板塌方
The bakery spinned, the floor dropped out.

241
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,070
空氣沉重  猶如糖漿
The air was thick as syrup.

242
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,950
可憐羅賓  兩眼發暈  呼吸困難
Poor Robin swooned, she couldn't breathe,

243
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,750
眼眶泛紅  淚光閃閃
her eyes began to tear up.

244
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,890
欲尋借口趕緊溜
And as she tried to stammer some excuse

245
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,680
西蒙開口把話提
to get away, Simon said:

246
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
看我的婚禮蛋糕多牛逼
Our wedding cake is pretty bitchin', eh?

247
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,870
羅賓傷心又失意  最蠢主意心頭起
And so was born the worst idea poor Robin's ever had.

248
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
泰德家中房門響
And on Ted's door there came a rapping.

249
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,810
我干了一件壞事
I did something bad.

250
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,440
羅賓坐下說經過
As Robin told her tale,

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,720
泰德得知她犯錯
Ted knew she'd made a massive boo-boo.

252
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,500
羅賓偷婚禮蛋糕  這錯實在太離譜
For stealing someone's wedding cake is terribly bad juju.

253
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,610
羅賓  你居然墮落至此  氣死我了
Robin, I'm beside myself to see what you've become!

254
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,290
趕緊把蛋糕給我還回去
You must return this cake at once!

255
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,450
-我辦不到  -為什么
- I can't! - Why not?

256
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,440
因為
'cause...

257
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,680
太好吃
Yum.

258
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,430
泰德看到此惡行  嚇得倒吸一口氣
Ted gasped, for he had never seen a brazen act so vicious.

259
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,270
羅賓心中很自責  同時
Robin felt remorse, and yet...

260
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,430
蛋糕美味難舍棄
Oh, God, this is delicious!

261
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,230
一口兩口三四口  五口六口十七口
So one piece led to two, then three, then five, then 17.

262
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,920
金剛狼殘暴附體  大蛋糕慘遭蹂躪
She savaged that poor cake like some rapacious Wolverine.

263
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,450
又啃又咬大口嚼  狂亂之夜燈搖搖
Eating, gobbling, munching, so the frenzied night wore on.

264
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,060
等至你媽把門進
And by the time your mom arrived,

265
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,920
半只蛋糕已殆盡
The cake was halfway gone.

266
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,880
我一接到消息馬上就來了
I came as soon as I got word.

267
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,510
事情到底有多糟糕
So how bad is the damage?

268
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,450
你自己看吧  蛋糕被她摧殘成這樣了
See for yourself the product of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

269
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,660
只剩一半了
Half a cake?

270
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,420
我都做了什么呀
What have I done?!

271
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,540
全世界皆不原諒
The world shall not forgive it!

272
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,320
一失足成千古恨
This day will live in infamy.

273
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
恥辱永遠跟隨我
I never shall outlive it!

274
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,940
我是傳說中那個
For I have become

275
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,320
靠暴食掩飾情感  你可千萬別搞錯
the girl that eats her feelings, don't mistake it.

276
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,310
我得迅速站起身  免得等會椅子壞
I think I need to get out of this chair before I break it.

277
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,890
你這只超級蠢豬  說的哪門子瘋話 
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

278
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,600
你媽心懷好意把話說
Said mommy, with great fervor.

279
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,500
革命尚未成功  同志必須再戰
You can't stop now, for don't you see?

280
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,810
對于不知情的旁人  這并不算是放不下
To the uninformed observer, you're not some sad cliche,

281
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,880
由女性撰寫并面向二、三十歲的單身女性的文學作品

282
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,880
更不是雞仔文學中的悲慘剩女
some loser from a chick-lit story.

283
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,670
只要吃完這半個  恢復榮光分分鐘
You're Robin, and you're half a wedding cake away from glory!

284
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,560
如果此刻就放棄  西蒙贏得了勝利
If you quit now, then Simon wins,

285
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,470
傳奇只能終於此
The tale comes to a stop

286
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,710
因為偶遇前男友  你的腦子不利索
at how you saw an ex, freaked out,

287
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,600
搶走蛋糕回家吃
and robbed a pastry shop.

288
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,130
但是我的好閨蜜  如果你還有勇氣
If you have the guts, my dear,

289
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,270
此時不戰待何時
it's time to get empowered

290
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,250
竭盡全力戰蛋糕
and be remembered for this

291
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,000
傳奇便流芳百世
sweet behemoth you devoured.

292
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,370
多年以后的今天
And years from now,

293
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,360
行吟詩人高聲唱
the troubadour will raise his voice and sing

294
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,200
戰蛋糕記美名揚
of the time that Robin took the cake.

295
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,650
美
And ate the whole...

296
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,600
名
Damned...

297
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,820
揚
Thing.

298
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,530
羅賓再次沖上戰場
Once more into the breach she surged,

299
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,120
泰德和你媽加油打氣
as Ted and mommy cheered

300
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,760
蛋糕高如山  慢慢消滅完
and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared.

301
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,650
朋友得消息  紛紛來圍觀
Some friends were called to come and watch.

302
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,200
人人都愛看
And no one had to beg.

303
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,790
圍觀變派對
It soon became a party.

304
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,620
巴尼還帶酒
Barney even got a keg.

305
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,890
一勺接一勺  羅賓戰香草
Forkful after forkful, Robin guzzled french vanilla,

306
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,780
吃聲驚天地  比猩猩還吵
making noises not unlike those made by a gorilla.

307
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,170
加把勁  羅賓  吃完它
Come on, Robin, finish it.

308
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,610
你媽在一旁鼓勵
Mom's exhortations rang

309
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,470
此景就像阿波羅
like Apollo coaching Rocky

310
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,360
教洛基打大棒槌
'gainst a frosted clubber lang.

311
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,780
《洛基四》  我的最愛
Oh, Rocky IV, my favorite.

312
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,600
不對  《洛基四》是對陣俄國人
No, no, IV is with the Russians.

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,570
不對  《洛基四》是他因腦震蕩
No, IV's the one where he talks weird

314
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,890
說話怪腔怪調
because of his concussions.

315
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,650
-洛基說話一直這樣  -好了
- I think that's all of them. - Hey now,

316
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,230
-不要吵架好吧  -就是《洛基四》
- no need to be discordant. - It's Rocky IV.

317
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,690
-是《三》  -是《二》
- No, III. - No, II.

318
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,720
真沒必要為這個吵
It's really not important.

319
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,720
其實就是《洛基三》

320
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,720
決勝時刻終于到來  羅賓還剩最后一口
At last young Robin raised the final bite up to her lips

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,970
人群紛紛靜默無言  
The crowd grew still.

322
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,180
只聞巴尼大嚼薯片
The only sound was Barney eating chips.

323
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,110
只剩下最后一口
Just one bite left.

324
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,160
這場景簡直就是《鐵窗喋血》
Hey, this is like that scene from Cool Hand Luke. You know,

325
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,010
“這孩子能吃下五十個雞蛋”  對不對
"My boy can eat 50 eggs." Right?

326
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,310
她馬上要吐了
She's gonna puke.

327
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,360
但羅賓沒有吐
But Robin did not puke.

328
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,930
她咽下了蛋糕  驕傲地站起來
She ate that bite and stood up, proud.

329
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,570
等等  還沒有結束
Wait. I'm not done yet.

330
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,780
她對震驚觀眾說
She shouted, to the startled crowd.

331
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,770
我雖消滅了蛋糕
I've bested this here wedding cake.

332
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,540
我既驕傲又自豪
I'll gladly wear that crown.

333
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,150
但我要有始有終
But now that I have done that task

334
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,120
讓蛋糕沖下食道
it's time to wash it down.

335
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,730
今夜已如此美妙
For it's been such an awesome night,

336
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,640
讓我來錦上添花
there's just one way to cap it.

337
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,600
喝下這整桶啤酒
I'm going to drink this entire keg.

338
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,430
巴尼  開閘
Okay, Barney, tap it.

339
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,650
如今沒人會記得  羅賓那晚被人甩
And now that night's remembered not for Robin getting dumped

340
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,610
人們記得的只是  最后送她去洗胃
But as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.

341
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,140
快看
And look at that,

342
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,840
這小天使終于睡著了
The little angel's sleeping soundly, Gus.

343
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,130
令人頭痛的問題終于
Looks like our problems...

344
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,560
你到底要開哪條道
Pick a lane!

345
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,720
我恨這臺蠢巴士
I hate this stupid bus.

346
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,760
馬文啊  今夜漫漫苦煎熬
Marvin, I'm afraid this night is not much of a winner.

347
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,570
交通堵塞不流暢
Stuck in traffic, now we've missed

348
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,250
彩排晚餐趕不上
the whole rehearsal dinner.

349
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,400
希望你不要記得
I pray that I was right and that you'll have no memory

350
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,680
這趟旅途超傻逼
of this godforsaken ride down the congested LIE.

351
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,710
不過我可以保證
At least we know one thing for sure:

352
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,600
事情不會更糟了
Things can't get worse, I swear.

353
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,030
永別了  休息站的煎餅包
Adios, truck stop burrito. Ooh!

354
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,430
后面廁所一團糟
Do not go in there.

355
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,940
算了  再講一個故事  
Okay, one more story,

356
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,800
我盡量把它講好
and I'll try to tell it pretty.

357
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,740
巴尼·斯丁森
The tale of Barney Stinson,

358
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,030
紐約泡妞王傳奇
Player king of New York City.

359
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,990
巴尼·斯丁森  紐約泡妞王傳奇

360
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,370
某日麥氏酒吧里  眾友齊聚于一堂
Once upon a time, we all went out to get our drink on.

361
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,030
恰逢一女走進來
When who should walk in but a girl

362
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,270
身著粉色毛衣裝
with sweater tight and pink on.

363
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,440
佳人坐下喝啤酒
She ordered up a beer.

364
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,520
故事發展不難猜
I think you see where this is going.

365
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,810
巴尼表達最直白
As Barney put it, oh so eloquently:

366
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,380
奶妹胸前抖啊抖
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

367
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,160
他對此妞感興趣  起身就要往前走
He rose to go approach this girl commanding such intrigue

368
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
可你老媽叫住他
When mommy interrupted:

369
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,890
老兄  你肯定泡不到她
Dude, she's way out of your league.

370
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,530
她一沒穿超短裙  二沒穿爆乳服裝
She's not in daisy dukes, nor squeezed into a hooters tee.

371
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,390
三無塑體會員卡
And I don't see a Curves membership

372
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,030
掛在鑰匙上?當
dangling from her key.

373
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,510
四沒做噴霧曬黑
She has no glaring spray tan,

374
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,700
五沒獨角獸紋身
no unicorn tattoos.

375
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,310
她在淺嘗霞多麗  
She's sipping chardonnay,

376
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,010
而非豪飲櫻桃酒
not pounding cherry-flavored booze.

377
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,500
臉上妝沒有哭花
Her makeup isn't running,

378
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
更沒有搔首弄姿
she's not playing with her hair.

379
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,790
"進"身機會實在小
There's very little chance she'll let you put it anywhere.

380
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,190
我接受你的挑戰  莉莉
Your challenge is accepted, Lil.

381
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,010
對巴尼·斯丁森來說
There is no girl too pretty,

382
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,870
這世上哪有無塵女神
for I am Barney Stinson,

383
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,290
我可是紐約泡妞之王
Player king of New York city.

384
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,630
你不能給自己扣上王的高帽子
You can't anoint yourself the king,

385
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,630
就像那個混蛋勒布朗一樣
just like that jerk, Lebron.

386
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,850
他三年前就離開騎士隊了
He left the Cavs three years ago.

387
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,760
兄弟  別想了  往前看吧
Bro, give it up, move on.

388
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,750
我為什么是泡妞之王  很高興你們問了
So why am I king? Glad you asked.

389
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,030
-我們沒問  -從未問過
- We didn't. - Never do.

390
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,920
原創故事時間到
It's origin story time.

391
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,660
相信我  字字千真萬確
And trust me, every word is true.

392
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,280
很久以前的某個早上  我在臣服者身邊醒來
One morning long ago, I woke up next to a conquest.

393
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,210
這女孩妙處著實不少  她的咪咪
So many great things 'bout this girl: Her boobs,

394
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,030
她的乳房  她的胸部
her rack, her chest.

395
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,790
她乃久旱渴甘霖
She had a thirst for action,

396
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,890
巴尼奮身撲欲火
and young Barney was a-quenchin' it.

397
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,440
這是故事的重要部分嗎
Is this important to the story?

398
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,050
不  只是覺得應該提一下
No, just thought I'd mention it.

399
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,630
接著我離開房間  與豐滿女說拜拜
As I departed, having bid this busty babe buh-bye,

400
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,400
我停下來四處看  忍不住停下發呆
I stopped and looked around, and wondered:

401
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,820
我究竟身在何處
Where the hell am I?

402
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,410
路標上寫著22街  我的擔心漸退
The sign read 22nd street, and my concern decreased

403
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,830
直到冷風吹樹枝
until a cold wind blew a branch aside,

404
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,430
赫然露出"東"這字
revealing: "East."

405
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,190
東區  不
The east side. No.

406
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,610
我做了什么啊
Wh-what have I done?

407
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,300
我懊惱支吾著
I stammered with chagrin.

408
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,300
一輛黑色轎車停在面前
Just then a black sedan pulled up...

409
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,410
-你是巴尼嗎  -是的
- You Barney? - Yeah.

410
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,180
上車
Get in.

411
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,380
有一句話是真嗎
Is any of this true?

412
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,320
當然是真的  現在  下巴別掉下來
Of course. Now, hang on to your "chayers."

413
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,900
那日之會  我以前也曾參加過
For that day I was called before...

414
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,450
泡妞好手的最高議會
The high council of players.

415
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,240
非常感謝各位  親自出席會議 
Gentlemen, for your attendance here, our deepest thanks.

416
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,320
我遺憾地宣布  議會有人偷獵
I'm sad to say, this council has a poacher in its ranks.

417
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,800
斯塔頓島羅

418
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:37,920
燕尾服查理  布朗克斯區唐尼

419
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,670
機長比爾

420
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,840
泡菜罐鮑勃

421
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,510
這位巴尼
For Barney here

422
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,050
在他的領域外泡了妞
picked up a girl outside his territory.

423
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,120
東區
The east side

424
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,770
是燕尾服查理的地盤
is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.

425
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,630
他很生氣
He's mad.

426
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,060
千真萬確
True story.

427
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,570
2004年的協議中  曾很明確地規定
The agreement of 2004 quite clearly did define

428
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,890
我們獵艷分界線  就定于第五大道
Fifth avenue to be our hunting grounds' dividing line.

429
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,270
我絕不會"停船"到  西區的大學女生
Your west side college girls are not the slip I park my boat in.

430
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,460
你也應該明白
So you should know

431
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,070
東區的懵懂少女  你也絕不能染指
my east side debutantes are quite verboten.

432
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,520
議會成員
Members of the council...

433
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,050
兄弟們  沒人想要開戰
Bros... nobody wants a war.

434
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,850
我當然沒有忘記2004年的協議
Of course I've not forgotten the agreement of '04.

435
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,060
我能說什么  一次愚蠢之舉
What can I say? A bonehead move.

436
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,790
為自己辯護  我無話可說
Defend it? I'm not able.

437
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,570
但是兄弟們  難道對在座的
But, bros, have I not been a bro

438
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,350
兄弟們來說  我不夠兄弟嗎
to each bro at this table?

439
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,850
布魯克林的朋友  泡菜罐鮑勃
My friend from Brooklyn, pickle jar Bob,

440
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,300
可以為我作證
will give some validation.

441
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,920
記得想找賓州車站
Remember that young tourist

442
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,730
那位年輕女游客嗎
who was looking for Penn Station?

443
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,980
她剛從波士頓過來 
She'd just come in from Boston,

444
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,890
一臉床技好的模樣
had a wicked good-in-bed look.

445
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,090
我給她指錯了方向  她去了紅鉤區[布魯克林]  
I gave her bad directions and she ended up in red hook.

446
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
-閉嘴  巴尼  -布朗克斯區唐尼
- Shut up, Barney. - Whoa, Bronx Donnie,

447
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
別這么激動
Let's not get excited.

448
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,620
這里被踩到頭上的  不止燕尾服查理一人
Tuxedo Charlie's not the only one here who's been slighted.

449
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,100
你為了上她  就告訴她你是基特[洋基隊隊長]
You told her you were Jeter in your quest to lie upon her.

450
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,580
冒充洋基隊是我的專長
Impersonating Yankees is my thing.

451
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,880
你還要不要臉啊
Have you no honor?

452
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,240
先生們  請不要破壞
Gentlemen, please, let's not blow

453
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,220
現在和諧的氣氛
this detente to smithereens.

454
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,510
議會允許機長比爾發言
Council recognizes Captain Bill,

455
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,030
來自皇后區的兄弟
our bro from Queens.

456
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,270
謝謝
Thank you.

457
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,550
你們都認識我
You all know me,

458
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,400
尊重我的伎倆
and you all respect my game.

459
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,860
我扮成飛行員  在行李處泡妞  
I dress up like a pilot and meet girls in baggage claim.

460
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,370
我從61街伍德賽德  坐地鐵大老遠而來
And on my long-ass subway ride from 61st and Woodside,

461
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,300
在路上我想到辦法  為讓你們不傷和氣
I came up with a plan to keep you on each other's good side.

462
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,750
巴尼  你對不起他們兩位
Barney, you have wronged these two.

463
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,640
為了彌補他們的損失
So, for the game they're losing,

464
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,210
現在你必須允許他們
you now must grant them each

465
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,370
各選一位西區的美女
a west side hottie of their choosing.

466
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,240
開玩笑吧
You're kidding.

467
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,770
這是和解辦法嗎
That's the settlement?

468
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,350
拜托  這樣夠傻的
Come on, that's rather silly.

469
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,020
先生們  請表態
Gentlemen, what say you?

470
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,950
我要羅賓
I want Robin.

471
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,980
我要莉莉
I want Lily.

472
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,080
得了吧  布朗克斯區唐尼
Please. Bronx Donnie?

473
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,330
他決不可能泡到我
No chance he could get me in the sack.

474
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,460
麻煩轉告下黑手黨  我認識有妞他能搞
Tell that mafioso I know something he can whack.

475
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,590
女士們  不用擔心
Ladies, don't you worry,

476
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,850
你們倆的玉腿  依舊可以緊閉
your fair legs can all stay closed.

477
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,330
因為幸好他們
'cause luckily they took

478
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,130
接受我的還價
the counteroffer I proposed.

479
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,300
先生們
Well, gentlemen,

480
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,750
看來我說什么都不能動搖你們了
it seems there's nothing I can say to sway you.

481
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,620
查理  唐尼
Charlie, Donnie,

482
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,900
別再說了  我很樂意補償你們
Say no more, I gladly will repay you.

483
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,980
卡洛塔  上香檳
Carlotta, some champagne.

484
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,130
我們休會前  先來干杯吧
Let's toast before we all adjourn.

485
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,660
敬咪咪
To boobies.

486
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,310
順便說下
Oh, and b-t-dub,

487
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,610
酒里有毒
y'all just drank poison.

488
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,000
玩死你們
Ha-burn.

489
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,160
于是  我的朋友們  我
And thus, my friends, I have become,

490
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,290
以血腥手段成為
through methods somewhat gory

491
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,320
紐約市泡妞之王
The player king of New York city.

492
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,110
贊
Boom.

493
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,350
故事講完了
The end.

494
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,500
真實故事
True story.

495
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,340
太精彩了
Well, that was great.

496
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,250
你的傳奇小故事  讓我們哄堂大笑
Your little story tickled all our ribs.

497
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,130
但你犯了個錯誤  先生
But one mistake you made, sir,

498
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,710
忘了先喊妞歸你
was forgetting to call dibs.

499
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,920
不  這不公平
No! Not fair.

500
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,210
我才是泡妞之王
But I'm the King.

501
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,020
-穿衣品味比他好  -對不起  哥們
- And such a better dresser. - Sorry, dude,

502
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,630
這是為了報復你
But that's revenge

503
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,920
先上了教授麗莎
for Lisa the professor.

504
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,970
咱們再喝一輪吧
Let's have another round.

505
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,100
你媽咪說
Your mommy said.

506
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,550
于是我們又喝了一輪
And so we had one.

507
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,110
夜漸漸深了  我得說
The night wore on, and I must say,

508
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,920
那晚還不錯
it wasn't a half bad one.

509
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,710
多美好的記憶  我們年輕快樂的心
What memories. Our young and happy hearts

510
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,210
熱情似火一般
were hot as fire.

511
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,810
那些日子似乎  已經恍若隔世
Feels like a lifetime since those days.

512
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,130
對不起  各位
Sorry, folks,

513
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,100
爆胎了
Flat tire.

514
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,520
不是吧
Oh, come on.

515
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,100
我永遠到不了南塔克特島了
Now I'm never gonna make it to Nantucket.

516
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,760
煙花表演
Oh, look a fireworks display.

517
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,360
火箭之光煙花
Some rockets red glare action.

518
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,720
謝天謝地
Thank God.

519
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,110
我以為眼中景象  全怪青光眼藥水
Thought my glaucoma drops were causing a reaction.

520
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,300
馬文  對不起這次旅途超級波折
Marvin, I'm so sorry this whole journey's been a bummer.

521
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,910
很快你會回到媽媽的懷抱  溫暖如夏
Soon you'll be right back in mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

522
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,160
可悲的是  我們到達旅館的那刻
But sadly while your troubles stop once we get to the inn

523
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,520
就是你的麻煩結束  我的麻煩開始的那刻
the moment we arrive is when my troubles will begin.

524
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,350
有時候爸爸們做錯事
Sometimes daddies screw up,

525
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,710
有時候媽媽們會生氣 
sometimes mommies get upset.

526
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,430
這個周末的記憶  我真心希望你會忘記
I really hope this weekend is a memory you'll forget.

527
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,200
快看天上的煙花  享受墜落的火光
So look up at those fireworks, enjoy the falling embers...

528
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,840
<i>孩子們  這是你們的馬文哥哥</i>
<i>And that, kids, is the very first thing</i>

529
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,810
<i>記得的第一件事</i>
<i>your cousin Marvin remembers.</i>

530
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,850
女士們先生們  還要等一小時
Gentlemen and ladies, it'll be an hour or so...

531
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,220
拖車才能到達
before the truck gets here to give our

532
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,540
把壞巴士拖走
broken bus a tow.

533
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,950
我建議大家都把自己弄得舒舒服服的
So in the meantime I suggest we all get nice and cozy.

534
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,730
我們得待上一段時間
We're gonna be here for a while.

535
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,580
做個玫瑰花環游戲如何
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

536
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,580
轉圈游戲  唱到"蹲"時  最后蹲的出局

537
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,790
好的
Yeah!

538
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,210
這里離法漢普頓旅館有多遠
How far do you suppose it is to the Farhampton Inn?

539
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,230
我想五英里外吧
I'd say about five miles away.

540
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,940
不是吧
Oh, no.

541
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,530
你笑什么
What's with the grin?

542
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,480
<i>于是馬修抬起頭望向天空</i>
<i>Then Marshall looked up heavenward,</i>

543
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,590
<i>對著天上第一顆星星發誓</i>
<i>and swore by night's first star</i>

544
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,170
<i>說了他很快后悔的五個字</i>
<i>five simple words he'd soon regret:</i>

545
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,340
我能走著去
I can walk that far.
