MurielOlala

24
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,041
Welcome to my ultimate cookery course

25
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,205
I have cooking tips and information

26

and 100 recipes to stake your life on

27
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,549
The frying-pan is one of your best friends.

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,347
It's so versatile in the kitchen.

29
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,846
Learning to use it with these is a must.

30
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,126
And I'm gonna show you how.

31
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:22,866
First up, my delicious pan fried pork chops with sweet sour peppers.

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,543
Whether it's in a restaurant or you at home,

33
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:29,073
one of my golden rules of producing fantastic food

34
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:31,297
is learning to cook with confidence.

35
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:32,892
This recipe is so straightforward,

36
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,076
but taste absolutely amazing.

37
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,864
Cook With Confidence

38
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,501
Pan on. Get it nice and hot.

39
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,656
You think of the sort of density of a pork chop

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,142
Sweet sour peppers, grow brilliantly well

41
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:47,440
how we need is a little bit of help

42
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,438
First, slice the peppers.

43
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,297
That's the flat side of pepper.

44
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,099
So stand it up.

45
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,334
Try to slide the pepper

46
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,904
on the side is a nightmare.

47
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:00,388
There's the center

48
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,261
Start off

49
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,527
It's almost like sort of peeling an orange

50
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,955
Go a way round, and down

51
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:08,850
And look, this one

52
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:11,776
Now place the pepper down

53
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:12,974
Three finger rule:

54
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:14,894
One finger front, two behind

55
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:16,479
Pinky hold it down,

56
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,206
Thumb hold it nice and flat

57
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,171
The flatter the vegetables,

58
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,005
the more confident you are When you slice

59
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:24,423
So, don't worry about the speed.

60
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,333
Just let the knife do the work.

61
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,619
And take your time

62
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,844
Speed comes

63
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:34,059
Most important thing is to get your technique right

64
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,675
Red onion

65
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,845
Now, sweet sour peppers,

66
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,390
Olive oil in,

67
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,266
I'm going to saute them

68
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,328
which is just for chef terms for shallow frying

69
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,075
on a high heat for maximum taste

70
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,285
Some salt and pepper

71
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,114
Add a table spoon of sugar

72
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,451
Sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker

73
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:59,365
and caramelize the onions

74
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,990
Five minutes on frying-pan

75
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,033
Perfect.  This one is one of the basic central tools of many kitchens

76
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,496
because it  is so multi-purpose

77
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:09,046
great for sauteing, tossing

78
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,383
great for cooking fish and meat

79
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:14,999
Push away and pull back push away and pull back

80
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,894
That hissing is something you need to hear constantly because

81
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:23,004
The minute that's gone, your peppers and your onions start to boil

82
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,376
You really really want to saute them

83
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,174
And now you start to see

84
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,748
and listening to the way it sound

85
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,247
caramelized, sugar is working beautifully

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,244
That's ready, for red wine vinegar

87
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:38,060
in, smells incredible

88
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,274
It helps to sustain the peppers as well

89
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,859
look at the glaze now,

90
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:43,850
and you see the sugar

91
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,227
it's work is magic

92
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:51,479
Turn down the gas, and add a couple table spoon of fresh extra virgin olive oil

93
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,700
Then let them stew for two to three minutes

94
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,486
Now one might be peppers nice and light and sweet by a magic

95
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:02,969
Just roll the basil

96
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,940
almost like a big cigar

97
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,707
Slice

98
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,420
Basil in

99
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,752
And then later you cook it out for 30 seconds

100
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,529
And then off

101
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:16,272
beautiful!

102
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,934
OK, pan back on

103
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,636
And add the pork chops

104
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,476
You want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan

105
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,807
They start curling up in a pan

106
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,138
when they are cooked unevenly

107
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,037
A few simple cut through the rind

108
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,567
makes the chop stay flat and cooked evenly

109
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,832
Point the knife down

110
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,189
Slit through

111
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,368
And then season it beautifully

112
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,476
Nice large shards of pepper

113
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,132
Punch that through lightly

114
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:44,595
down till that seasoning

115
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:46,674
It's gonna stay there

116
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:49,854
Hot pan, a touch of garlic and a touch of thyme

117
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:53,206
The garlic, take a couple of cloves

118
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,462
don't peel it, don't chop it

119
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,926
Just knife on, crush it

120
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,811
Olive oil in

121
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,538
Just start to smoke

122
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,423
Top of the chop, in

123
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,947
Lay away from you

124
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,330
nice

125
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,544
You get that heat of the pan,

126
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:15,515
the garlic in there early

127
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,587
a nice fragrant bunch of thyme

128
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:21,184
See how the pork has stayed nice and flat

129
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,286
Turn that over, over there. Beautiful

130
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:26,263
I want a little bit of thyme underneath there

131
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:30,083
Start squeezing that garlic, I want all the flavor coming out

132
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,344
Butter in

133
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,030
Thin slices of butter

134
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,651
ladle the pan and baste

135
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:40,567
So I'm sort of speeding up the cooking process

136
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:44,132
at the same time, I'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist

137
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:46,520
And another look at the butter

138
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,480
Looks almost like, sort of, a light brown

139
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,914
Turn that color on another side, beautiful

140
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:56,353
When that fake, 3.5-4 minutes on each side

141
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,802
Let me take this from now and immediately

142
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:00,823
So I'm gonna take them out, and let them rest

143
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,784
The secret of properly moist pork chops

144
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:06,217
is let them rest almost as long as they are cooked in the pan

145
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:10,261
A nice spoon of these peppers

146
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:13,136
basil smells incredible

147
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,015
Put the garlic on there

148
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,158
Be generous with that vinegary peppers

149
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:19,017
because it really is incredible

150
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,741
Do two things simple

151
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,641
like that, pork and peppers

152
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,038
And your confidence is gonna shoot for the roof

153
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,308
A stunning pork chop

154
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,974
With sweet sour peppers

155
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,957
The frying-pan is so simple

156
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:36,389
but incredibly useful

157
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,437
With this one pan, you can make a million different dishes

158
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,763
The more you cook with the frying-pan,

159
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:43,398
the more your confidence will grow

160
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:46,812
Here are three of my favorite easy pan-fried dishes

161
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,543
First up "pan fried scallops with crunchy apple salad"

162
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,754
Get a frying-pan smoking hot

163
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,857
It's essential, to get quick pan frying

164
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:04,031
Add olive oil

165
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,166
Then season scallops with salt and pepper

166
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,289
Starting up from the top

167
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,650
put clockwise into the pan

168
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,479

00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:44,200
fry the fillets of sea bream skin side down, in hot olive oil

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,115
If it buckle up, press gently down

209
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:48,791
For perfect even cooking

210
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,356
Then season

211
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:55,547
Sea bream has firm white flesh, perfect for pan fry

212
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:58,107
Next the salsa,

214
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:05,106
Add half cherry tomatoes, pitted black olives

215

Coming up on my ultimate cookery course

227
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,617
along with 100 recipes to stake your life on

228
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,974
I would give you 100 quick cooking tips

229
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,300
to make your life in the kitchen easier

230
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,760
First up, how to keep your knife sharp

231
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,472
It's far harder working in the kitchen

232
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,240
with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife

233
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,109
The secret behind keeping a sharp knife:

234
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,537
Sharpen it before every time you use it

235
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:17,112
First grip the steel

236
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:18,828
If you are really uncomfortable about holding a steel

237
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,352
imagine you are holding a tennis racket

238
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:21,866
or you are playing squash,

239
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,227
God, you are really comfortable with this

240
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:25,513
Now, 45 degrees, confident grip

241
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:26,905
confident grip of knife

242
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:28,936
This is the butt of the steel

243
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,887
really important to keep your fingers behind that

244
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:33,183
you never grip a steel with your fingers over that

245
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:36,108
'Cause when your knife comes back in you just lost a finger

246
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:38,120
always grip behind

247
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,510
Nice long strokes, so we got whole of the blade over steel

248
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,086
stroke, and we start from the bottom to the top

249
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:54,089
So there, across, stroke, stroke

250
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:55,298
over the top of the steel

251
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,355
Then come back underneath

252
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:02,764
It's so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife

253
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,065
can cause so much damage

254
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:07,183
Working with a sharp knife is ten times quicker, more efficient

255
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:10,627
now, that's ready to start chopping

256
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,696
To stop your chopping board rocking or slipping,

257
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:19,079
a great tip is simplyto wet a kitchen cloth, kitchen paper

258
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,237
or tea towel

259
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:21,629
and place it underneath

260
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:24,616
now you can chop with confidence

261
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,212
My next top tip is

262
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,660
Get the most out of your humble vege paner

263
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,911
It's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons of edge,

264
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,709
perfect for asian dishes

265
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,594
Great for making long delicate pumps and shavings

266
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,545
to top soups and salad

267
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:43,745
It also makes wonderful chocolate curls

268
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:49,378
Your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think

269
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:52,131
tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper

270
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:53,787
ideal for soups and sauces

271
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:57,729
for general seasoning, you'd want it medium ground

272
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,486
So set the screw in the middle

273
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,595
And loosen it right off for coarse pepper

274
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,444
perfect for steaks and fish

275
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,249
Peeling Garlic

276
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,900
One clove, simply bash it with the back of the knife

277
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,902
and the skin comes off easily

278
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:17,762
For a whole head, crush separate into a bowl

279
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,100
cover and shake hard for about ten seconds

280
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,858
and simply pick out the peeled cloves

281
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,787

I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for

294
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,810
Hold the drum, to slice straight through

295
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,563
But first, like any good chef,

296
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,337
I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price

297
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,765
my shopping mentor is simple

298
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:19,380
First, is relying on your senses

299
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,936
make sure whatever you buy, it looks smells, and really feels good

300
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:25,567
If you get the chance, taste it before you buy it

301
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,899
Second is to recognise that knowledge is crucial

302
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,601
The more you know about where your ingredients come from

303
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,988
and how they are produced, the better

304
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,944
So, ask a lot of questions and learn

305
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,284
You are never too old to learn from an expert

306
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:44,950
and when it comes to buy a great bird,

307
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,748
one person knows what to look for,

308
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:50,903
is award-winning, fifth generation master butcher Danny Lidgate

309
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,046
Poultry is a great meat

310
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,880
because there's many different types of birds that is worth tasting

311
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,625
Their variation of flavors between  the two different birds is massive

312
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,666
Turkey is a great lean meat

313
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,804
because it's available all year round

314
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:04,566
not just for christmas

315
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,821
and anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats

316
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:09,615
it's a really healthy, flavorsome meal

317
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,119
Gamebirds

318
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,581
People never try them well enough

319
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,080
Once they are shot, they'll hang up for a little while

320
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,401
a few days at least

321
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,392
and these meat is gonna be more tender

322
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,343
all add flavors to the birds

323
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,273
I've got a woodpigeon

324
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:23,919
and a red-legged partridge

325
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,027
both really good, and cooked really quickly

326
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,242
When you're buying a chicken,

327
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,684
some of things to look careful

328
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:31,893
is always the smell

329
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,169
And when you're smelling a good quality chicken,

330
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,408
you can tell the difference

331
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,399
It's skin is in nice white color

332
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,533
And it smells like a fresh chickeny smell

333
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,519
When you buy it from a good bird shop

334
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,480
you'll find that you can get the giblets as well

335
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,152
which is basically the neck and other organs

336
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:48,564
this is great for making gravy

337
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,973
once your are to cook you can use all you've got and other things

338
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,512
stir fries, curries, pasta dishes

339
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:58,692
save the bones, use the bones for stocks and soups

340
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,510
it really pack full of the flavor

341
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,604
And remember, there are lots of different breeds of chicken

342
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,591
All have varied characteristics and flavors

343
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,436
So, shop around and find the one that you love

344
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,620
Here are three of my all-time favorites

345
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,825
These come from an old British breed

346
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,457
They've got smaller breast, but the meat is delicious

347
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,150
a fantastich French variety

348
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,867
suck in with bags of flavor

349
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,665
and really meaty thighs

350
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,647
this is the rolls royce of the chicken

351
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,862
rich, gamy and delicious

352
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,782
One for special occasions

353
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,282
I think people should maybe try and buy

354
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,131
less meat but aim for the best quality

355
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,990
You'll only get out when you put in

356
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,083
When you put the best quality into the dish,

357
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,647
you're gonna get best results

358
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,889
No matter how season a chef you are

359
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,292
There are always new ingredients and recipes to get find up about

360
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,006
So if you are tired of all recipes getting you down

361
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:03,769
Spice it up, with fresh ideas and flavors

362
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,417
My next recipe is an old classic roast chicken,

363
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,916
but with a simple twist, it tastes on a new life

364
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,806
and it's guaranteed to imipress

365
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,213
One of the things I love about cooking

366
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:18,322
and keep me excited up to 25 years behind the stove

367
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:21,360
is that there's always something new to learn everyday

368
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,549
new ingredients, new techniques and new cuisines

369
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,632
Get Excited

370
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,826
Start off with the stuffing

371
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:34,058
It's amazing how exciting a stuffed  roast chicken can be

372
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,988
because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist

373
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,666
and gives a delicious texture inside the bird

374
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,774
we start off with cured chorizo

375
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,450
this is a traditional Spanish sausage

376
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,195
and it's garlicy, spicy and incredibly meaty

377
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:52,557
that gives a little bit the sort of richness to the stuffing

378
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,493
get the chorizo in

379
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,998
start cooking that down and you get all those oils out

380
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:02,655
a touch of olive oil in there to get it gooey

381
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:04,473
right, onions

382
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,633
chops

383
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,993
add the onions to the chorizo

384
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,469
and at the matter of seconds,

385
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,395
they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor

386
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:18,611
That lovely spicinesses being stolen from that sausage

387
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:20,866
now the onions smell incredible

388
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,685
Garlic

389
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,210
Garlic in

390
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,530
Fresh thyme

391
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,887
and just hold it down and the fingers on there

392
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:32,209
it's a really nice way of taking off all those fragrant little thyme flowers

393
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,729
you hear the cracking in the background

394
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,482
These are cannellini beans

395
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:40,804
they're waxy, very soft

396
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,618
they're so delicious but very dense

397
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,731
but so for stuffing, they're so robust

398
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,051
nothing breaks down

399
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,199
drain them off

400
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:51,338
in

401
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,752
they're gonna take all out the juice as well from the chorizo

402
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:56,123
it needs season now

403
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:58,358
because it's very dense so it needs a litle bit help

404
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,556
now it looks like it's a dish on its own

405
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:03,948
and good enough to eat now

406
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,122
I want to sweet things up a little bit

407
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,266
tomatoes, half dried, in

408
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,207
let the sweetness up

409
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:14,767
the stuffing...

410
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,494
beautiful

411
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,038
The stuff is ready

412
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,420
look at the color and every thing

413
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,325
The spanish, it looks delicious

414
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,875
now, stuff it in the chicken

415
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,628
I like taking off these, the knuckles

416
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:29,802
As the chicken cooks

417
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,500
the skin stretches over the bone and you get a really nice drum

418
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,837
And take off these little wing tips as well

419
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:37,534
Salt and pepper

420
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:39,850
So important

421
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:45,559
now, your stuffing i'll go right inside of the chicken

422
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,591
push it down

423
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,369
this really helps to cook the bird evenly

424
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,036
Because you are pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass

425
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:56,927
and take a nice large lemon

426
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:58,441
push the lemon in

427
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,777
pick up the parson's nose

428
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:03,205
pull the skin over

429
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:04,312
Olive oil on top

430
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:10,103
salt and pepper

431
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,638
a teaspoon of paprika

432
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,632
sprinkle it on

433
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:17,649
and then your hands sort of rub that in

434
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,697
and you see what paprika's doing to the chicken

435
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:23,582
it's like sweet, spicy marinade

436
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:26,396
as though you've roasted it, but it looks delicious

437
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,272
400ml of white wine, same quantity of water

438
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,252
That helps the chicken to steam

439
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,711
chicken in

440
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,260
be generous with the thymes sprigs

441
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:45,245
make sure the foil is foiled tightly around the roasting tray

442
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:49,241
so the chicken steams in the oven keep it moist and juicy

443
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,623
into the oven

444
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:56,657
cook it for an hour at 180 degrees with the foil on

445
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:59,806
take it out and remove the foil lid

446
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:02,935
and give it another 30 minutes to crispen that skin

447
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:10,869
so important to make sure you take that tin foil off

448
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,302
with half an hour to go

449
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:14,516
beautiful

450
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:15,516
Pierce that open

451
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:18,730
squeeze it in that delicious gravy

452
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,478
mix that into the tray

453
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,659
and sieve that

454
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:32,481
that's really nice, fragrant, lemony, spiced roasting juices to finish

455
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:34,198
Before you cut up the chicken

456
00:21:34,198 --> 00:21:35,955
take out the amazing stuffing

457
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:41,004
incredible

458
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:44,006
I would have that with chicken and potatoes anyday

459
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:48,161
and then just get your ckicken roasting juices

460
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,645
now, to cut the chicken up

461
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,136
hold the drum, and slice straight through

462
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:00,961
There's that, a wonderful drum and thigh

463
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:05,410
through the wishbone, off

464
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,062
slice with the point and an angle

465
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:11,110
so you see the texture of that amzing roast chicken

466
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,883
let's take the cooking juices

467
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:20,988
work carefully with that sort of lemony flavor over my chicken

468
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:22,508
and there you go

469
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:29,070
