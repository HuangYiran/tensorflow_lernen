九点了 你答应我你会回家的
It's nine o'clock, you promised you'd be home.

28
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,240
我知道 我还在市中心 对不起
I know I'm still downtown, I'm sorry.

29
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,930
我们能回家再谈这个吗
Can we talk about this when I get home...

30
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,930
- 求你了  - 你没事吧?

31
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,020
- 救命啊 - 约翰

卧底游戏 第一季 第七集

35
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,720
你知道 吃饱了再溜出去更容易一点
You know, it's a lot easier to sneak out on a full stomach.

36
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,040
早上好
Good morning.

37
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,910
你不需要每次我们滚床单之后就走的
You don't have to disappear every time we hook up.

38
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,470
吃点早餐也没什么大不了的
A little breakfast never hurt anyone.

39
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,320
除非你是个胆小鬼
Unless you're a chicken.

40
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,240
只是 我习惯早起
It's just that, I have an early morning.

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,720
我马上要开会
I got a meeting in a few minutes.

42
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,020
你看 如果我在吃早餐 
Look, if I stay for breakfast,

43
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,620
那我就会留下来吃晚餐
then I'll be here for dinner,

44
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,970
也许我们会看场电影 打打台球
and maybe, we'll catch a movie, a ball game.

45
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,610
一个多月之后 
A month or so

46
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,710
也许要和你的父母吃晚餐了
and it'll be dinner with your parents...

47
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,810
他们住在亚利桑那
They live in Arizona.

48
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,380
好吧 好吧 也许是和你的老板或者朋友
Okay, fine, then it'll be your boss or a friend.

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,140
但是 问题是 我不会去
But, here's the thing, I just won't be there.

50
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,900
- 我做不到 - 玛利亚
- I won't make it. - Maria.

51
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,950
你会假装没事的 
And you'll pretend that it's fine

52
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,990
但是你不会相信我
 but you won't trust me,

53
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,910
你会开始嫉妒
 you'll be jealous.

54
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,700
嘿 嘿 等一下
Hey, hey, come on.

55
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,050
你这是要跟我分手
You're about to break us up

56
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,180
而我们连第一次约会都还没有呢
 and we haven't even had our first date yet.

57
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,780
那才是最美妙的
That's the best part.

58
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,210
我是说 我都不知道你是做什么的
I mean, I don't even know what you do for a living.

59
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,490
我喜欢这样
I like this.

60
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,370
伊森 我们俩没事 
Ethan, this isn't broken.

61
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,430
你为什么想要修补呢?
 Why do you want to fix it?

62
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,960
因为不论你害怕的是什么
Because whatever it is you're scared of,

63
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,030
不要怕我
it's not me.

64
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,500
我们之间 不论是什么
This, whatever this is,

65
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,300
是真的
it's real.

66
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,240
对不起
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,730
我们跟这个案子已经两周了
We've been on this case two weeks

68
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,300
还有五起劫车案

72
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,980
从最新款的奥迪车上被拖了下来
and relieved of his late model Audi.

73
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,920
我们知道这些案子是有关联的 
We know these attacks are related.

74
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,690
他们作案已经有一年的时间了
They go back almost a year.

75
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,640
全城好几个武装的犯罪团伙
Multiple armed crews all over the city.

76
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,830
盗窃汽车案值上千万
Millions of dollars in car thefts.

77
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,630
我们不清楚的是背后的老大是谁
What we don't know is who's calling the shots.

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,650
无论是谁在操控这个团伙 运输汽车
Whoever's running the crews and moving the cars,

79
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,520
他们很严谨 是职业的 对吧?
they're serious, they're pros, alright?

80
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,730
袭击无辜平民 极端暴力
Innocent targets, brutal violence.

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,520
我们必须马上抓住她们 一定要快
We need to shut these guys down, fast.

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
你们又进展了?
You've made some progress?

83
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,560
好吧 我一直在接近这两个人
OK, so I've been making friends with these two.

84
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,360
瑞恩和艾利克斯 我在赛车是认识的
Ryan and Alex. I met them at a street race.

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,340
- 你赛车? - 你开玩笑呢?
- You were driving? - Are you kidding me?

86
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,390
玛利亚是这个警局最棒的车手
Maria's the best driver in this whole division.

87
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,620
真的?
Seriously?

88
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,370
是的 我爸认为父女的美好时光
Yeah, my dad's idea of quality time

89
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,610
就是让我拿着扭力扳手
 was me holding a torque wrench

90
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,450
而他在那换垫圈
while he swapped out a gasket.

91
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,910
那么这些人 他们是搭档吗? 
So these guys, are they partners?

92
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,070
是一个两人团伙?
One of the two-men crews?

93
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,780
他们很符合打手的特征
They fit the profile to a T.

94
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,460
是的 艾利克斯是个打手 
Yep. Alex has a thug.

95
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,000
他的犯罪记录有一里地长
He's got a rap sheet a mile long.

96
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,160
多次劫车 极端暴力
Plenty of carjacking, brutal violence.

97
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,520
但是瑞恩不一样 他是我要的人
But Ryan's different, he's my guy...

98
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,890
我开车赢过他 聊过两回
I scored points with him driving, talking shop.

99
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,290
他开始信任我 
He's starting to trust me and

100
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,490
我可以看出他不喜欢暴力
I can tell he's not into the violence.

101
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,010
他说今天晚点会有活儿
He says he's got a job coming in later today.

102
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,630
有活儿 什么意思?
"Coming in"... What does that mean?

103
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,630
我们不知道 他没有告诉她细节
We don't know. He won't give her the details yet.

104
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,540
但是他答应介绍他们的老大给我认识 
But he's agreed to intro me to his boss.

105
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,250
好极了
That's good.

106
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,650
好的 我们给玛利亚做准备吧
A'ight. Let's get Maria prepped.

107
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,670
现在她是我们的首要任务
She's gonna be our primary,

108
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,480
满足她一切的要求
whatever she needs.

109
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,580
这可能是他唯一一次接触到上面的机会
This might be her only chance to move up the chain,

110
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,850
我们不能错过
 we can't miss it.

111
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,990
丹尼尔 我希望你能近距离监视
Daniel, I want you close cover.

112
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,680
杰西和我会跟在后面如有必要随时跟进
Jesse and I will hang back and be ready to move where the play takes us.

113
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,690
无论我们要对付的是什么人 
Whoever we're dealing with,

114
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,300
他们都是些不择手段的人
has no problem breaking what gets in their way.

115
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,350
所以他们犯罪升级只是个时间问题 
So it's only a matter of time until escalates

116
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,140
我们很快要面对的就是凶杀案了
 and we end up with a homicide.

117
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,490
从帕萨迪纳的一个家伙
Scooped the cold air intake

118
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,060
手里拿到的冷空气进入口

专门定制打磨

能让你怎么样? 二十马力 最高了?
And it gets you what? 20 horses, tops?

121
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,400
加入液氮 你可以达到两百
Drop nitrous in and you're talking 200.

122
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,340

For 20 seconds. Then you shred your engine.

123
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,660
让这个巨兽爬到山顶就需要一整箱油
Probably take you a whole tank just to get this beast up a hill.

124
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,110
你需要点新东西 
You need something new,

125
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,640
碳纤维 CPU控制的液压系统
carbon fiber, CPU-controlled hydraulics...

126
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,380
当我和别人的车就差一点点时
When I'm red lining into a hairpin,

127
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,250
我相信的是我的车 不是电脑
 I trust my car, not a computer.

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,530
小心
Watch out.

129
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,260
- 麻烦来了 - 看见了

130

哥们 你在这干嘛呢?
Watcha doin' here, man?

131
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,420
你知道 我一直搞不懂
You know, I still can't figure out

132
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,880
你这么一个大个子怎么这么怕女生
why a big guy like you is so afraid of girls.

133
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,100
淡定 她没事的
Ease up. She's cool.

134
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,270
瑞恩 我们还有会呢

我希望她能见见我们的人
 I want her to meet our guy.

137
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,370
那有怎样 
So what,

138
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,710
你以为你就可以让她进来
you think you just gonna cut her in,

139
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,570
是这意思吗?

140
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,530
弄的好像这里说的算?
Is that coming out of your cake?

141
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,580
你有问过我吗?
Were you even ask me about that?

142

154

155
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,100
明白了吗 好的?
Got it, right?

156
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,270
他刚刚给瑞恩一些钱 
He just gave Ryan some money.

157
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,820
是的 应该是干这票活儿需要的钱

158
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,050

他说现在 就是现在 我们今晚行动
He says now, he means now, we do it tonight.

161
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,950
什么活儿?
So what's the gig?

162
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,290
不是吧 你们说过算我一个的
Well, come on. You said you'd cut me in.

163
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,990
- 我还说过让你走的 妞 - 是吗?
- And I told you to disappear, little girl. - Did you?

164
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,990
你知道的 有点怪
You know, it's weird.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,370
你一张嘴我就脑袋就大
I just zone out whenever you open your mouth.

166
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,740
婊子 我让你开开眼怎么样?
How about I make you pay attention, bitch.

167
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,880
嘿 嘿 淡定 
Hey, hey, back off.

168
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,360
都冷静点免得有人受伤
Calm down before someone gets hurt.

169
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
哦 是吗? 你觉得你能伤到我?
Oh, really? You think you're gonna hurt me?

170
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,640
你是这么想的?
Is that watcha think?

171
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,850
动动我试试
Give me a reason.

172
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,190
啊 哥们 看着她 
Arrrgh, get her under control, man.

173

是的 别激动
Yeah, well, calm down.

174
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,940
你说你需要个开车的 不是吗? 
You said you need a driver, right?

175
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,330
宝贝 这不是开礼仪车
This ain't chauffeuring, sweetheart.

176
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,210
我们比一下 你和我 四分之一英里 就现在
Let's go, you, me quarter mile, right now.

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,060
我赢了怎么办?
What do I get when I win?

178
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,260
我的车 输了的把车交出来
My ride. We race for pink slips.

179
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,410
玛利亚 你到底在干吗呢?
What the hell are you doing, Maria?

180
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,120
等我把你的车拆了卖了的时候你要在旁边看着
I want you to watch when I sell your car for parts.

181
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,900
你听到了
You heard it.

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,290
怎么了? 亲爱的 你需要我让你?
What's wrong? You need a handicap, sweetheart?

183
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,920
我让你两个车身 
I'll give you two car length,

184
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,510
但是如果你没种 我的意思是
but if you don't have the balls, I mean...

185
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,350
上车 我不需要你让
Get in your car. I don't need no handicap.

186
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,440
我们把目标人物和
We checked the target's photo

187
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,810
数据库的照片做了比对 没有收获
 against the database, nothing.

188
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,660
你查他的车牌了吗? 
Did you run his plates?

189
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,510
也没有 你现在在哪?
Also nothing. Where are you right now?

190
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,100
我们跟他到一家店 沃恩赛车

191
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,950
- 他还在里面 - 卡莉

Owned by Ellen and Davin Vaughn.

194

看起来完全合法
Looks completely legit.

195
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,490
我猜我们必须进店 看一下
I guess we're gonna have to go inside then. Take a look.

196
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,970
你儿子需要辆新车 是这样吗?
Your son needs a new car. Stuff like that?

197
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,730
也许我比较喜欢非正规渠道的东西 
Maybe I'm into some kind of sketchy business,

198
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,490
看他们上不上钩
see if they bite.

199
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,720
正合我意
Read my mind.

200

嘿 如果你能帮我拿到车子
Hey, if you can get me photos of

VIN号码的照片的话
 VIN numbers on the cars,

202
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,070
我可以查一下 看是不是偷来的
I can run them, see if they're stolen.

203
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,380
我们就需要一辆就可以申请搜查令 
We just need one for a search warrant.

204
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,640
好的 就这么定了
Alright, done.

205
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,730
我们也许该换下衣服 
We should probably get changed.

206
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,450
让我们做个有钱人
Let's go get rich.

207
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,730
四分之一英里到达那个水泥路障

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,110
这里的车太炫了
These cars are sick.

215
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,650
他特别迷恋这种东西

216
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,450

This is very last minute, I forgot my son's birthday.

217
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,010
所以我就这么来这讨人嫌了
So I'm in the doghouse here.

218
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,050
你们有什么特别喜欢的吗?
Are you interested in anything in particular?

219
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,350
一个开心儿子
A happy son.

220
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,530
我答应过他想要什么都行
I promised him anything he wanted.

221
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,030
我不知道 他说能吸引靓妞的
I don't know, he said 'chick-magnet'.

222
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,200
我猜是跑车了
I guessing that's a sports car.

哦 我是认真的

228
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,920
我猜付现金是没问题的
I assume paying cash won't be a problem?

229
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,910
罗斯先生 您是做什么生意的?
What line of work are you in, Mr. Ross?

我查了每台车的VIN

没有一辆车是偷来的
Not one of the cars is stolen.

236
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,500
你认为他们还有个改车的地方?
You think they have a chop shop?

237
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,240
应该不是 因为号码印在
No, cause the numbers are stamped

238
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,130
车身的每一个地方 对吧?
 all over the parts, right?

239
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,600
所以至少应该有一个会有问题
So one of them would have flagged by now.

240
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,950
他们一定有份参与

我不知道 是工作吗?

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,550
我以为我们抢的是车 不是房子
I thought we were breaking into a car, not a house.

251
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,570

 You ever boosted a Lamborghini?

252

引擎锁定 GPS定位

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,860
是吗? 听起来不错
Yeah? That sounds good.

299
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,740
但是 我可不是告密者
Except, I ain't no rat.

300
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,100
我能熬过去 狗娘养的 
I can stand my time, bitch.

301
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,620
所以去你的吧
So screw you.

302
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,390
那我就放心了
Well, I have to say that's a relief.

303
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,510
菲尔・布伦特 房子里那男的
Phil Bronte, the man at the house.

304
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,110
你把个老人家打伤了 艾利克斯
You put a grandfather in the hospital, Alex.

305
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
你失控了 你是个懦夫
You're out of control, and you're a coward.

306
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,640
我之前还担心你会达成交易呢
I was worried you might cut a deal.

307
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,840
你玩儿我呢吧?
You tryin' to play me?

308
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,280
没有
No games.

309
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,690
实际上
Truth is,

310
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,180
我想让你坐很长
I want you to go to jail for a long,

311
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,130
很长时间的牢
 long time.

312
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,500
而你刚才的不合作
And this non-compliance you're showing,

313
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,630
意味着我可以给你加到最长刑期
that means I can push for maximum sentence.

314
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,000
真是美好的一天
It's a good day.

315
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,130
最大量刑 你说真的?
Maximum sentence, are you serious in there?

316
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,400
没开玩笑
It was no play.

317
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,570
重案组可以起诉他 让他们好好考虑
Major crime can charge him. Make sure they take their time.

318
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,020
- 好 - 那现在呢? 
- OK. - So what now?

319
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,100
我们继续跟着瑞恩?
We stick with Ryan?

320
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,880
让他成为线人 
Make him an agent,

321
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,530
看看他会不会跟我们合作 是吗?
see if he'll work with us, maybe?

322
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,100
玛利亚?
Maria?

323
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,480
我们需要瑞恩的帮助 
We're going to need Ryan's help,

324
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,950
他可以让我们接触到齐克
 he can get us to Zeke.

325
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,160
你觉得他能行吗?
 Think he can handle it?

326
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,090
我不知道
I don't know.

327
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,550
你不觉得他会跟我们吗? 
You don't think he'll flip?

328
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,250
差不多
In a heart beat.

329
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,450
这次真的吓到他了 他不想干了
This just got real for him. He needs an out.

330
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,150
但和我们共事压力很大 
But working with us is a lot of pressure.

331
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,670
我不确定能不能信任他
I'm not sure I can trust him.

332
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,210
好吧 那么你何不进去 
OK, so why don't you go in there,

333
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,300
和他聊聊 感觉一下
 talk to him, see how it feels.

334
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,160
好吧 我试一下
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

335
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,500
他状态不太好
He's in rough shape.

336
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,450
- 能让我们单独谈谈吗? - 行
- Can you give us the room? - Yeah.

337
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,950
好的
All right.

338
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,700
嘿瑞恩
Hey, Ryan.

339
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,190
你是警察? 逗我呢吧?
You're a cop? Are you kidding me?

340
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,090
你真行 我一点儿都没看出来
You're good, I had no idea.

341
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,770
特傻的是我居然很高兴见到你
You know what's stupid? I'm still happy to see you.

342
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,080
见到朋友总是好的 
It's always good to see a friend.

343
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,550
可你是警察
You're a cop.

344
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,190
也是你现在最好的朋友
Best friend to have right now.

345
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,210
那又如何...?
So what...?

346
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,360
你打算 比如 审问我吗?
Are you going to, like, question me?

347
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
打个报告? 送我坐牢? 
Make a report? Take me to jail?

348
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,500
我有得选吗?
Do I have a choice?

349
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,000
每个人都会犯错 你就是我犯的错
Everybody makes mistakes, you're mine.

350
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,080
我妈老跟我这么说
My mom always said that to me.

351
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,710
这对孩子来说真是句恶毒无比的话
That's a hell of a thing to say to her kid.

352
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,400
是啊 但我又做了些什么 
Yeah, but what I'm doing,

353
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,080
偷车还有所有那些...?
stealing cars and all that...?

354
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,820
她恨我这样
She hates it.

355
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,430
我不怪她
I don't blame her.

356
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,230
看看我这幅样子 
Look at me.

357
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,920
坐在这儿满脑子都是我妈会怎么想
I'm sitting here worrying what my mom's gonna think.

358
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,040
昨晚
Last night,

359
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,140
你试着阻止艾利克斯
you tried to stop Alex.

360
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,370
- 他在打那个人... - 所以呢?
- He was beating that man... - So?

361
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,080
所以你知道我怎么想的吗?
So you know what I think?

362
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,380
我觉得你不是那种人
I think you're better than that.

363
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,650
你比他好
Than him.

364
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,080
我可以帮你
I can help you.

365
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,420
我可以撤销对你的指控 但你必须先帮我
I can drop these charges but you have to help me first.

366
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,920
你想让我怎么帮你?
What kind of help are we talkin'?

367
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,970
让我加入组织
I need a way in.

368
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,080
要从昨天那家伙开始 那是你的老板吧?
We'll start with the guy from yesterday, your boss?

369
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,720
然后顺线上去...
Work our way up...

370
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,260
嘿 如果你做不来 你要告诉我
Hey, if you aren't up for this, you need to let me know.

371
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,840
我要确定能否
I need to be able to trust you.

372
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,540
完全信任你
Completely.

373
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,910
我能信任你吗?
Can I trust you?

374
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,180
先告诉我你头儿的名字
Let's start with the name of your boss.

375
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,080
开悍马的那家伙 他给了你工作
The guy in the Hummer who gave you the job.

376
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,550
告诉我你在为谁干活?
Why don't you tell me who you work for?

377
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,950
他叫齐克・温斯顿
His name is Zeke Weston.

378
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,190
他非常暴躁
He's crazy violent.

379
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,980
尤其当你犯错的时候
Especially if you make a mistake.

380
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,830
雇佣着大概十帮人来偷车
Runs, like, ten crews of guys who jack cars.

381
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,000
他给我们姓名和地址
He gives us a name, an address,

382
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,400
我们负责送车
we deliver the cars,

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,170
而齐克则负责把车弄干净并合法化
and Zeke makes them squeaky clean and legal.

384
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,930
之后呢? 怎么卖掉?
What happens to them then? How do they get sold?

385
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,760
客户知道这些车是偷来的吗? 
Do the clients know they're stolen?

386
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,350
我发誓我不知道
I swear, I have no idea.

387
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,740
我只是个助手 好吧? 
I'm just the help, right?

388
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,470
而且齐克口风很紧
And Zeke isn't much of a talker.

389
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,660
你能让我作为你的新搭档入伙吗 
Can you bring me in as your new partner?

390
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,060
他会同意吗?
 You think he'd go for that?

391
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,290
可以
Yeah.

392
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,330
我是说
I mean,

393
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
我可以试试
I can try.

394
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,510
好 那我们这就进入齐克的车库
OK, so we're going right into Zeke's garage,

395
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,870
鉴于你昨晚被抓了 
with you getting busted last night,

396
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,380
他现在估计正急的要死
he's gonna be tense as hell.

397
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,930
所以你要让他冷静下来 
So you got to keep him calm,

398
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,410
让他觉得局面还在他掌控之中 知道吗?
he needs to feel like he's in control, alright?

399
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,700
我兄弟们就在外面 
Now my guys will be outside,

400
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,080
他们会听到我们的对话
they'll be listening.

401
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,570
所以如果我们遇到麻烦 
So if we get into any kind of trouble,

402
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,150
他们会来救我们
they'll be right there to back us up.

403
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,340
那么你准备好了吗?
Okay, you ready?

404
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,730
深呼吸 记住"我不是警察"
Take a deep breath. And remember, "I'm not a cop."

405
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,180
走吧
Come on.

406
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,070
她来这儿干嘛?
What the hell is she doing here?

407
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,610
啊?
Huh?

408
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,330
问你话呢 她在这儿干嘛?
I asked you a question. What is she doing here?

409
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,600
加油瑞恩 走近些 你能行
Come on, Ryan. Step up. You got this.

410
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,560
你昨晚给我们派的任务
That job you gave us last night.

411
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,640
把我们坑惨了齐克 
That was junk, Zeke.

412
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,820
那家伙在家呢好吗? 
The guy was home, alright?

413
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,640
艾利克斯完蛋了
 Alex is done.

414
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,930
是啊 艾利克斯给我打电话了 
Yeah, Alex called me.

415
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,460
从监狱里 他说你被抓了
From jail. He said you got busted.

416
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,330
没错 我保释了自己 老兄
That's right, I had to bail myself out, man.

417
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,600
艾利克斯重打了那家伙所以他还在牢里
Alex beat the hell out of the guy which is why he's still in.

418
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,240
无论如何 关键是我现在需要个新搭档
Anyway, the point is, now I need a new partner.

419
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,080
行吗?
Alright?

420
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,920
这就是为什么带她来
That's what she's doing here.

421
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,370
我只是想和你交代清楚 
I just wanted to clear it with you,

422
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,110
表示我对你的尊敬
 out of respect.

423
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,250
瑞恩有时候会犯糊涂
Ryan gets very confused sometimes.

424
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,410
说些不该说的话
He says things he shouldn't.

425
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,110
你们在哪儿认识的? 
Where'd you meet her?

426
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,060
我叫玛利亚
It's Maria.

427
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,090
在谢丽海滩赛车的时候 
Racing pink slips out at Cherry Beach.

428
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,180
她会开车?
She can drive?

429
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,340
让他六个车身 依然超不了我
Gave him a spot, six car lengths. Still smoked him.

430
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,910
她给谁干活?
Who does she work for?

431
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,850
你 从现在开始
You. Starting now.

432
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,620
加油 加油...
Come on. Come on...

433
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,260
没你事儿了 招人我说了算
We're done here. I do the recruiting.

434
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,820
走吧
Take a walk.

435
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,100
没成
No sale.

436
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,740
没事
It's alright.

437
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,580
也算是迈出了第一步 我们先盯着齐克
Could be a first step, we'll stay on Zeke.

438
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,110
看看他去哪儿
See what he gets into.

439
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,340
不得不说这真个惊喜
I have to say I'm impressed.

440
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,980
这个车型只有五百辆
Only five hundred production models built,

441
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,850
而上次我来的时候还没有呢
and last time I checked there weren't any left.

442
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,790
你在哪儿找到的? 
Where did you find it?

443
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,550
从一些供应商那里
I have a number of suppliers.

444
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,900
我能拍张照片吗?
You mind if I take a photograph?

445
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,700
给我儿子看看
For my son.

446
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,930
现在要是没有照片为证
These days if it doesn't happen in a photograph,

447
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,290
就等同于不存在
it never happened.

448
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,610
当然可以
Of course.

449
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,170
好的 收到照片 
Ok, got the photo.

450
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,310
你觉得你儿子会喜欢它吗?
Do you think your son will like it?

451
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,260
希望喽 这可是他最喜欢的颜色
I hope so. It's his favorite color.

452
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,690
不是 车子没问题
Nothing. It's clean.

453
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,160
我有个海外的朋友 他对这类东西很感兴趣
I have friends overseas who'd be interested in this sort of thing.

454
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,910
- 是吗? - 当然 但必须得是批量的 
- Is that right? - Of course, it would have to be volume.

455
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,210
可如果你能搞来这样的车 
But if you could move cars like this,

456
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,740
两万一辆怎么样?
20 grand a unit?

457
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,360
两万英镑一辆? 
20 thousands each?

458
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,180
能卖出这价格那只能是偷来的车
At that price they would have to be stolen.

459
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,460
你能搞来这样的货?
You have the capacity for this sort of operation?

460
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,880
我从海外用集装箱运来
I ship things overseas, in containers.

461
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,750
大型机械 纺织品之类的
Heavy machinery, textiles, that sort of thing.

462
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,030
也包括车
Including cars.

463
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,850
当然有可能 为什么不呢?
Certainly possible, why not?

464
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,900
你找错人了 罗斯先生
You're talking to the wrong people, Mr. Ross.

465
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,610
那太遗憾了 
That's too bad.

466
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,750
很抱歉我们没法儿帮您
I'm sorry we can't help you.

467
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,650
但如果你想通了
Well, if you change your mind.

468
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,090
我会给我儿子看这照片
I'm going to show this to my son.

469
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,020
随时可以联系我
I'll be in touch.

470
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,290
祝福你儿子
Give our best to your boy.

471
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,540
又查了一遍 VIN码是合法的 
Once again, VIN was clean.

472
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,930
但他们肯定在做假
Nah, they've gotta be fake.

473
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,450
卡丽查了那编号 文件是合法的
Khali ran the numbers. Paperwork's legit.

474
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,780
我要的是一辆不可能买到的车
I ask for a car that's impossible to buy,

475
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,020
他们却一夜之间给搞来了
and they come up with one literally overnight.

476
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,620
那我们也无法证明它是偷来的
We have no way to prove that it's stolen.

477
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,850
是啊 但他的妻子艾伦 
Yeah, but the wife, Ellen,

478
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,860
她对这笔买卖感兴趣
 she was into the deal.

479
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,720
她已经在盘算如何花赚来的钱了
She was already spending the money in her head.

480
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,050
就是说她丈夫反倒退缩了?
It was the husband that backed away?

481
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,840
这里面肯定有问题 气氛异常紧张
There was something going on there, plenty of tension.

482
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,930
那些人很谨慎 从齐克那儿就能看出来
These people are careful, we've seen that with Zeke.

483
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,420
他们很聪明 所以我们只能更聪明
They're smart, so we just have to be smarter.

484
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,510
- 是啊 - 是丹尼尔
- Yeah - It's Daniel.

485
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,310
- 嘿 -齐克这边有动静了
- Hey. - We've got action with Zeke.

486
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,110
我们跟着他来到一个公园 他下车了
We followed him to a park. He's out of his car.

487
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,410
他在干嘛?
What's he doing?

488
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,140
像是来见那个妻子 艾伦・沃恩
Looks like he's meeting up with the wife, Ellen Vaughn.

489
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,270
只有她吗? 丈夫没来? 
Just her? No husband?

490
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,340
看样子是的
Yeah, looks that way.

491
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,780
哇哦 你看到那幕了吗? 
Whoa, are you seeing this?

492
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,160
看到了 继续拍照
Yeah, keep shooting.

493
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,680
- 看到什么? -艾伦和齐克
- What is it? - Ellen and Zeke.

494
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,750
我想我们找到打入的办法了
I think we just found a way in.

495
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,080
就是说她嫁给了有钱人 
So she's married to the money,

496
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,650
却在和他的打手偷腥
but she's sleeping with the muscle.

497
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,360
是啊 这可绝非一夜情那么简单
Yeah, this is more than a one night stand.

498
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,170
- 你确定? - 确定 看他的手
- You're sure? - Yeah, look at his hand.

499
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,960
在她背上 他们之间很亲密 不是一时的
On her back, there's a closeness between them, not an urgency.

500
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,790
她看他的眼神里体现了信任
She's looking into his eyes. There's trust there.

501
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,680
她动情了 
This is real for her.

502
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,400
那我们能如何利用这件事?
So how do we use it?

503
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,180
我去和艾伦谈谈
I'll reach out to Ellen.

504
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,210
如果她想和她男朋友远走高飞
If she's looking for an exit ramp for her and her boyfriend,

505
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,730
我很乐意提供帮助
I'll be happy to provide.

506
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,430
同时让瑞恩把照片寄给她丈夫
Meanwhile, Ryan delivers the photos to the husband.

507
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,570
他想证明自己的忠诚 
He wants to prove his loyalty,

508
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,630
并且觉得大卫应该知道他妻子干了些什么
 and thought Davin should know what his wife is doing.

509
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,680
他会利用这个机会往上爬 
He uses it as a chance to step up.

510
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,200
瑞恩压力很大
That's a lot of pressure on Ryan.

511
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,990
他能对付
He can handle it.

512
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,120
和艾伦约见 看看她买不买账
Set up a meeting with Ellen, see if she bites.

513
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,560
好的
All right.

514
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,430
- 嘿 那孩子的事儿干得漂亮 -瑞恩吗?
- Hey. Nice job with this kid. - Ryan?

515
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,200
任何人都能说服他 
Anyone could've flipped him.

516
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,210
不是那样的
That's not true.

517
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,400
你真的打动他了
You made a genuine connection.

518
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,930
他信任你玛利亚 
 He trusts you, Maria,

519
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,120
他对你坚信不疑
 he believes in you.

520
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,570
他看我的时候 只是看到不用坐牢的机会
He looks at me, all he sees is a get out of jail free card.

521
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,370
别这么武断
Don't be so sure.

522
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,110
我们等你的信号 
We're just waiting on a signal.

523
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,110
你还记得该怎么说吗?
You remember what to say?

524
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,300
我是你的新搭档 对吗... ?  
I'm your new partner, right... ?

525
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,320
没错 我知道了
Yeah. I'm good.

526
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,720
我会和你保持距离 交给你了
I'm gonna keep my distance, you got this.

527
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,360
在没会开车就已经偷了第一辆车
I jacked my first car before I could drive.

528
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,450
我跟一个兄弟 我们偷了这辆面包车
Me and a buddy, we swiped this minivan,

529
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,980
开着它绕过街区
drove it around the block.

530
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,130
一定很爽了
I bet it was a rush.

531
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,420
虽然听起来很傻
It sounds stupid

532
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,760
但我总觉得我做不好那件事
but I always thought I wouldn't be able to do it.

533
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,410
就像它绝不会那么容易或者之类的
Like it wouldn't be that easy or something.

534
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,850
然后我开始研究安保系统
Then I started learning security systems,

535
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,350
点火倍率
ignition overrides.

536
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,550
只要有发动机的东西我都能弄来
I could boost anything with an engine.

537
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,930
我们通常从机场停车场偷车
We used to swipe cars from the airport lot.

538
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,840
没有人受伤 
No one got hurt.

539
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,860
仿佛一切都不是真的
It's like it wasn't even real.

540
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,230
但是这些家伙...
But these guys...

541
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,470
每个人都受伤了
Everyone gets hurt.

542
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,870
我们会阻止这种事发生
We'll shut them down.

543
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,710
我经常觉得警察都是没用的东西
I always thought cops were kind of lame.

544
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,210
但是现在呢?
But all this?

545
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,930
可比驾着面包车兜风刺激多了
Way bigger rush than joyriding that minivan.

546
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,560
我猜你差不多已经习惯了  
I guess you're probably used to it.

547
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,890
从不会厌倦
It never gets old.

548
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,050
但也不容易
It's gotta be tough, though.

549
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,830
总是假装成其他人
Always pretending to be someone you're not.

550
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,140
你有怀念过做自己的时候吗?
You ever just miss just being yourself?

551
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,900
- 喂 - 你该出发了
- Yeah. - You're good to go.

552
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,440
好的 马上出发
Okay. Headed in.

553
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,210
准备好了吗?
You ready?

554
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,540
嗯
Yeah...

555
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,020
真是散步的好日子
It's a nice day for a walk.

556
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,640
我很高兴你能给我打电话
I'm glad you called.

557
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,010
我想替我丈夫向你道歉
I wanted to apologize for my husband.

558
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,480
你不必道歉 我理解
You don't have to apologize, I understand.

559
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,500
他太霸道了 控制欲极强
He's the overbearing, controlling type.

560
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,630
你这么觉得吗?
Is that what you think?

561
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,770
我来告诉你我都知道些什么
I'll tell you what's clear to me.

562
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,240
你们根本不合拍 如果我是你
Your partnership isn't working and if I were you,

563
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,510
我会甩了他
I'd ditch him.

564
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,340
我能帮你运车艾伦
I can move your cars, Ellen.

565
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,510
这是一个错误
This was a mistake.

566
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,130
艾伦 你是这里最聪明的人 
Ellen, you're the smartest person in the room

567
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,920
他却不相信你的判断
and he won't even trust your judgment.

568
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,850
我来这儿 并不是要听人评说我的婚姻的
I didn't come here for an appraisal of my marriage.

569
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,430
你已经取得完全自治权了  你会得到产品
You'll have complete autonomy, you'll obtain the product,

570
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,160
我会移民国外 然后卖掉它
I'll move it overseas, where I will sell it.

571
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,830
你真的知道我在做什么生意吗?
What kind of business do you think I'm running, exactly?

572
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,570
你难道以为我是无缘无故碰巧出现吗?
Look, do you think I just happened to come out of nowhere?

573
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,820
我关注你的生意已经有段日子了
I've had my eyes on your operation for some time now.

574
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,250
只要你需要 
I can help you

575
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,700
我能帮你把它上升到一个新的水平
take it to another level if you want me to.

576
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,340
这由你决定
It's up to you.

577
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,090
- 沃恩先生 - 你是瑞恩 对吗?
- Mr. Vaughn. - Ryan, isn't it?

578
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,430
齐克不在这里
Zeke's not here.

579
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,470
其实 先生 我想跟你谈谈
Actually, sir, I wanted to talk to you.

580
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,880
我想见你 是因为
The reason I wanted to see you...

581
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,540
瑞恩 不管是什么事 你可以跟齐克说
Ryan, whatever it is, you can take it up with Zeke.

582
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,720
你得离开这儿
You need to leave now.

583
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,220
- 这对他来说太难了 - 再给他点时间
- This is too much for him. - Give him a second.

584
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,070
他把照片拿出来了
Photos just went down.

585
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,010
没人知道 我发誓
No one knows. I swear.

586
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,450
为什么给我这些?
Why bring this to me?

587
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,750
齐克已经难以控制了 他很危险
Zeke is out of control, he's dangerous.

588
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,580
整个运作应该是干净利索 低调行事
This operation should be clean, low profile.

589
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,350
但是齐克的手下总是下重手
But Zeke's got crews putting people in hospitals.

590
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,360
如果我搭档和我能回去 我们不会这样的
Me and my partner back there, we'll do things differently.

591
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:30,100
所以你想要这份工作 你是个投机主义者
So you want his job. You're an opportunist.

592
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,780
如果我是 我会敲诈你太太
If I was, I'd be blackmailing your wife.

593
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,040
他做得很好
He's doing good.

594
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,770
听好 我明白 我对你来说一文不值 
Look, I get it. I'm nobody to you, I'm nothing.

595
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,970
但是现在 我是唯一不会对你说谎的人
But right now, I'm the one person who isn't lying to you.

596
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,650
等等
Wait.

597
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,690
今晚再来 我要跟你谈谈
Come back tonight, we'll talk.

598
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,270
我还以为他不会去拿呢
I thought for sure he wasn't gonna go for it.

599
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,990
- 你做的很棒 - 我们下一步要干嘛?
- You did great in there. - So what's our next move?

600
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,610
我们刚刚摧毁了他们整个的合作基础
We just blew up their entire foundation.

601
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,230
现在 我们要让大卫看到
Now, we show Davin that

602
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,860
我们能帮他重建这一切
we can help put it back together.

603
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,890
貌似瑞恩干得很不错啊
Looks like Ryan made quite the impression.

604
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,040
车行已经关门了 
The dealership was shut up tight.

605
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,000
没看见大卫也没看见那对爱情鸟
No sign of Davin or the lovers.

606
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,630
大卫现在一定吓坏了
I'm sure Davin is freaking out right now.

607
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,800
他说会保持联系
He said he'd be in touch.

608
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,540
嘿 看 我弄了些东西
Hey, look at this, I got something.

609
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,770
我替约翰的进出口公司做了个假冒的网站
I set up a fake website for John's import-export firm.

610
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,590
艾伦・沃恩刚刚查看了这个网站 
Ellen Vaughn just paid it a visit.

611
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,550
你确信是艾伦?
You sure it's Ellen?

612
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,780
没错 我追踪了那个IP地址 就是她 
Yeah, I tracked the IP address, it's her,

613
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,640
她正在调查他
 she's checking him out.

614
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,040
这表示她很感兴趣  
That means she's interested.

615
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,970
她要有所行动了
She's making a move.

616
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,930
她跟齐克 很好 他们斗成一团
Her and Zeke, that's good. They're scrambling.

617
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,600
如果我们能够成交一次 就能停止这一切
If we could set up a buy we could shut this whole thing down.

618
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,620
哦不 是瑞恩 出了点事 他很惊慌
Oh no, it's Ryan. Something's wrong, he's panicking.

619
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,820
我得走了
I gotta go.

620
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,630
我收到短信了 出什么事了? 
I got your text, what's wrong?

621
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,750
我们搞砸了
We messed up.

622
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,880
齐克给我打了电话 他听上去很奇怪
Zeke called me. He sounds really weird.

623
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,260
大卫一定告诉他我出卖了他
Davin must have told him that I ratted him out.

624
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,080
好的 慢慢讲 告诉我到底发生了什么
OK, slow down. Tell me what happened.

625
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,880
齐克想让我从接头点接手一辆车
Zeke wants me to pick up a car from the drop spot,

626
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,780
把一切都弄好
 get it taken care of.

627
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,160
- 什么意思? - 我为他做过一次
- What does that mean? - I did this once for him.

628
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,650
如果我们弄到一辆特别扎手的车
If we get a car that's too hot,

629
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,360
齐克就会把它留在接头点 等我去拿
Zeke leaves it in the drop spot for me.

630
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,080
我去接车 送去报废
I have to pick it up, take it to the crushers.

631
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,250
所以一旦你被抓住 都是你自己的责任
So if you get busted with the car, it's on you,

632
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,400
齐克就躲得远远的
 and Zeke just walks away.

633
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,580
通常这没什么  但这次 事情不一样
It's usually no big deal. But this time, something's different.

634
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,500
从他的声音里我能听出来  冷冰冰的
I could hear it in his voice. He was ice-cold.

635
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,410
你觉得他给你下套了?
You think he's setting you up?

636
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,160
那个接头点很偏僻 没有安装摄像头
The drop spot is isolated, there's no cameras.

637
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,070
如果我去了那里 什么事都可能发生
If I go there, anything could happen.

638
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,500
但我们别无选择
But we don't have a choice.

639
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,690
如果我们不按照齐克说的去做 
Zeke will get suspicious

640
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,820
他就会起疑的 是吗?
if we don't do what he says, right?

641
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,150
"我们?"
"We?"

642
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,750
你不用一个人做这事 接头点在哪?
You're not alone in this. Where's the pickup spot?

643
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,290
- 在那条路 - 走吧
- It's back that way. - Let's go.

644
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,630
我的伙计们会来 我们会检查那辆车 
Here come my guys. We're gonna check out the car,

645
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,530
确保是安全的
make sure it's safe.

646
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,400
嘿 就呆在那儿
Hey, stay back.

647
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,400
我们绕着这里转了两遍 没问题 只有我们
We circled the perimeter twice, it's clear. We're alone.

648
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,600
好的 那辆车?
Alright, which one?

649
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,520
就在那儿 那辆红色轿车 
Right there, red sedan.

650
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,810
钥匙在保险杠下面
Keys are under the bumper.

651
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,680
我觉得不对劲
It doesn't look right to me.

652
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,270
后轮压得很低 后备箱一定有重物
The back wheels are low. There's something heavy in the trunk.

653
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,870
丽贝卡 我们看到了那辆车
Rebecca, we got eyes on the car,

654
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,480
可能安装了爆炸物
could be rigged with explosives.

655
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,720
让所有人离开现场 我立刻让防爆小组过去
Get everyone out of there, I'm calling the bomb squad.

656
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,800
哦不 等等 虽然齐克很鲁莽 
Oh, no, wait a second, we know Zeke is reckless

657
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,690
做事不计后果
 and impulsive.

658
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,850
但是...炸弹? 这说不通
But... a bomb? It doesn't make sense.

659
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,280
尤其 如果这是私人恩怨
Especially if it's personal.

660
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,580
如果要报复 
If anything,

661
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,820
他想的也是用撬棍砸烂瑞恩的脑袋
he's going to want to cave Ryan's head in with a tire iron himself.

662
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,420
我要到近处去看看
I'm going to take a closer look.

663
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,220
约翰 你在听我说吗? 不要靠近那里
John, are you listening to me? Keep your distance.

664
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,560
丽贝卡 我听不清你说话 信号不好
Rebecca, I'm losing you, you're starting to break up.

665
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,920
马上派紧急行动组去那里 除爆小组
Roll ETF to their location now. Bomb disposal unit.

666
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,230
- 你要干嘛? - 我要去看看
- What are you doing? - I'm gonna go take a look.

667
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,720
我跟你一起  
I'm right with you.

668
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,670
不不不 你们俩都别动
No, no, no. Both of you stay put.

669
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,850
我们之间只要有一个傻大胆就够了
Only need one of us to be stupid.

670
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,730
约翰!
John!

671
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,650
凶杀组正在申请搜查令 
Homicide's working on search warrants.

672
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,420
太慢了
Too slow.

673
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,950
这会儿功夫 那对爱情鸟已经飞走了
In the meantime, our happy couple disappears.

674
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,650
我们没时间了 我们需要拿到供认书
We're running out of time, we need to get a confession.

675
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,910
好消息是 艾伦・沃恩已经出手了
The good news is Ellen Vaughn has reached out.

676
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,260
她想要跟出口商约翰・罗斯 见面
She wants a meeting with John Ross, the exporter.

677
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,090
所以我们两头出击
So we do a double play.

678
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,360
我和妻子谈的时候 
While I'm working on the wife,

679
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,330
玛利亚也在努力拿下男朋友齐克
Maria could be working on the boyfriend, Zeke.

680
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,100
我们得弄一辆和发现尸体的那辆
We gotta get a matching car, same make, model

681
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,950
款式相同 型号相同
 as the one we found the body in.

682
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,840
- 为什么? - 这样瑞恩就能把它开回去
- Why? - So that Ryan can drive it back.

683
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,440
他太紧张了 看了一眼后备箱
He got nervous, he looked in the trunk,

684
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,170
发现了尸体
 found the body.

685
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,980
现在他去见齐克 害怕的要命
Now he's gonna confront Zeke, all freaked out.

686
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,770
看到那辆车 受到如此惊吓...
Seeing that car, the shock of it...

687
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,190
他们就会分崩离析 
They might just fall apart.

688
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,480
是啊 这计划不错
Yeah, that's a good plan.

689
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
但这样他们就会坦白吗? 
But does it get us a confession?

690
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,430
这时候 也是我们最好的机会了
At this point, it's our best shot.

691
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,110
好 我们已经就位了
Okay, we're in position.

692
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,740
- 太好了玛利亚? -准备好了
- Good. Maria? - Good to go.

693
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,780
随时候命 我们要等约翰的指令
Stand by, we're waiting on John's signal.

694
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,280
好的 随时候命
Okay, standing by.

695
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,780
随时行动
Any minute now.

696
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,370
我不知道齐克看到这辆车会作何反应
Look, we don't know how Zeke's gonna react when he sees this car.

697
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,700
我知道
I do.

698
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,940
我来做 我知道该怎么跟他说
I got this, I know how to talk to him.

699
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,710
如果事情变糟 你就听我指令
If things go South, you follow my lead.

700
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,990
好
Yeah.

701
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,240
等这一切都过去了 你觉得你会做什么?
When this is all over with, you ever thought about what you might do?

702
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,000
除了偷车 我什么也不会
I've never been good at anything besides stealing cars.

703
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,870
你这件事就做的很棒
You're pretty good at this.

704
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,290
我不是警察
I'm no cop.

705
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,860
不 但是我们可以给你开工资 你可以帮我们
No. But we could put you on the payroll, and you could help us out.

706
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,180
把这当一份工作吗? 
As a job?

707
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,890
是的 你很擅长
Yeah, you're pretty good at this.

708
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,530
可能会很值得 
Might be worth it,

709
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,180
想象我妈脸上骄傲的表情就知道了
just to see the look on my mom's face.

710
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,300
我们必须马上运走这些车子 要快
We want to move the cars, right now, fast.

711
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,940
都准备好了 明细单就放在我办公室
They're all ready to go, the detailed list is in my office.

712
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,020
我不需要明细单 
I don't need a list.

713
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,640
我只需要知道每辆车的来历
 What I need is the history of each vehicle.

714
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,210
以免任何问题发生
In case any issues should arise.

715
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,790
不会有任何问题 我亲自检查过
They're untraceable. I do the work myself.

716
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,080
这可不能保证 
That's not much of an assurance.

717
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,300
我的顾客需要的可不是这个
My clients need more than that.

718
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,930
我们记下了那些废车的车辆识别代码
We take the VIN numbers from wrecked cars,

719
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,000
然后拷贝了一份 放在我们的车上
we copy them, and we put them on ours.

720
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,820
但是那就没有书面记录了 
But then there's no paper trail.

721
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,860
我们做了一份
We make one.

722
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,370
你可以尽管调查 
You can look as deep as you want,

723
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,650
但你只会发现这些车没问题
 all you find is a clean car.

724
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,710
我们可以在办公室谈价钱
We can discuss money in my office.

725
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,470
那是当然 但我想先给我儿子挑份礼物
Of course. But first I want to pick up that present for my son.

726
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,880
- 信号来了  -玛利亚 该你上了
- There's the cue.  - Maria, you're on.

727
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,320
我们拿到他们偷车的证据了 
We've got them on the cars,

728
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,640
现在该找他们谋杀的证据了
now let's get them for murder.

729
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,210
好的 现在就去
OK, going in.

730
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,950
没事吧?
Is everything okay?

731
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,420
没事
Fine.

732
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,960
我们去办公室吧
Let's step into my office.

733
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,970
给我把它弄走  
Get that out of here.

734
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,820
车 还是后备箱的尸体?
The car, or the body in the  trunk?

735
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,500
你丈夫会跟我们一起吗?  
Will your husband be joining us?

736
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,620
不 这事我来处理
No I'll be handling this.

737
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,520
我只想知道他是否会带来麻烦
All I need to know is if he's gonna be a problem.

738
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,530
我们能给他打电话吗?  
Can we get him on the phone?

739
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,660
不行 他没空
I can't, he's unavailable.

740
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,610
你怎么打算的? 
What was the plan?

741
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,290
我扔车时被抓 然后被判谋杀?
I get caught dumping the car, go down for murder?

742
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,720
是这样吗? 你真的觉得你能跑得掉?
Was that it? Did you really think you could get away with it?

743
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,330
你根本不知道自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

744
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,710
是吗? 那告诉我吧
Yeah...? So tell me.

745
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,640
你马上给我闭嘴 然后滚出去
You need to shut up, right now. Move. Outside.

746
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,910
来吧瑞恩 我们出去吧
Come on, Ryan, let's go outside.

747
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,570
你会像杀了大卫一样杀掉我吗? 
So you gonna kill me like you killed Davin, huh?

748
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,460
你这个懦夫
 You coward?

749
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,990
瑞恩 够了 
Ryan, that's enough.

750
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,290
丹尼尔, 杰西, 你们上

755

756
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,210

763
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,800

765
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
瑞恩 听我说

I want you to picture your mom's face

你妈妈的表情
when you tell her you work for the cops.

771

她不会相信的
She'd never believe me.

772

我是个警察
I'm a cop.

818
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,950
你曾经好奇过我的职业

我很害怕你

823

824
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,560
嘿...
Hey...

825
