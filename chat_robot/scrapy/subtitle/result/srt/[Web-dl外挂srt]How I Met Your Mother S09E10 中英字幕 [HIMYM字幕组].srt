00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,580
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}婚礼前27小时

3
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:03,536
距离巴尼和罗宾的婚礼还剩两天的时候
Two days before Barney and Robin's wedding,

4
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,103
他们的牧师挂了
their reverend passed away,

5
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,139
他们启动了寻找牧师大行动
and the search was on for a replacement.

6
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,308
哦天啊 又是那个
Oh, boy, it's the creepy,

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,943
黑暗教堂的肿泡眼牧师
bug-eyed minister from that culty church

8
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,413
老在追问我们是不是"至死纯洁"
who kept asking us if we're "Pure enough to die."

9
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,215
目前就数他最好了 我还是接了吧
He's our best lead. I should get this.

10
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,834
詹姆斯 除非你能找到个牧师
James, unless you have a minister,

11
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,619
不然我现在没空听你瞎扯
I don't want to hear it.

12
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,387
你说的牧师是 这种的吗
You mean, like this one?

13
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,139
几年前
A few years back,

14
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:28,060
巴尼他哥詹姆斯终于见到了他失散多年的父亲 山姆
Barney's brother James finally met his long-lost father, Sam,

15
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,062
他竟然还是一位牧师
who turned out to be a reverend.

16
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:33,298
现在我宣布 你们的小命有救了
I now pronounce your asses saved.

17
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:38,420
吉布斯牧师还不是唯一一个在那天出场的重量级人物
Reverend Gibbs wouldn't be the only VIP arrival that day.

18
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:39,905
爸爸
Dad!

19
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,825
巴尼 哦 真不敢相信你都要结婚了
Barney. Oh, I can't believe you're getting married.

20
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:45,077
你都长这么大了
You've grown up so fast.

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,314
不过话说回来 是我错过了你人生中的30年来着
Then again, I did miss about 30 years of your life.

22
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,750
我在登记处还给你们留了两份礼物哦
Did I mention we got you two things from your registry?

23
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,419
对了 一会儿能请你俩喝一杯吗
Hey, can we buy you guys a drink in a bit?

24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,754
好啊 一会儿吧台见
Sure. We'll meet you at the bar.

25
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,443
哦 哇 快看
Oh. Whoa. Look.

26
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,045
我爸妈很多年没见过面了
My dad hasn't seen my mom in years,

27
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,263
自从我爸抛弃了我妈就再也没见过面了
not since he bailed on her.

28
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,465
哦天 资深离异家庭的小孩告诉你
Oh, man, take it from a fellow child of divorce,

29
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,217
这下可要乱套了
this could get real messy.

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,519
洛蕾塔 很高兴见到你
Loretta, good to see you.

31
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,721
我也是 杰瑞
You, too, Jerry.

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,858
喔
Wow.

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,943
谢天谢地 没什么狗血剧情上演
Yeah. Thank God, no drama.

34
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,945
他们深爱着彼此啊
They're in love!

35
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,649
我爸爸妈妈要复合啦
My mom and dad are getting back together again!

36
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,184

我准备把这个给罗宾来着
I want to give this to Robin.

43
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:43,947
她是格雷茨基的脑残粉
Gretzky's her hero.

44
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,949
有时候她会在床上喊他的名字 我已经习惯了
She says his name sometimes in bed. I've accepted it.

45
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,234
在晚餐排练之前 你能不能 呃 帮我藏一下这个 
Can you, uh, hide it for me till the rehearsal dinner?

46
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:49,836
伴郎出马你放心
The best man is on it.

47
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:52,071
太好了 现在要去让爸爸和妈妈复合啦
Great. Now I'm gonna go get my mom and dad back together.

48
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,457
他们完全坠入爱河了 是吧 超赞是不是
They're totally in love. I know. It's amazing.

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,574
今夜做梦都会笑
I'm walking on air.

50
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,793
我的家终于重新完整啦
My family's gonna be whole again!

51
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,796
我们要不要阻止他一下呢
Should we stop him or something?

52
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:01,932
伴郎我还是藏好格雷茨基吧
The best man is staying on the Gretzky thing.

53
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:07,137
* 我要大步前行五百里 *
 Well, I would walk 500 miles and 

54
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:10,390
* 还要继续跋涉五百多 *
I would walk 500 more

55
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:15,612
* 只为成就一次千里行 *
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles 

56
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:19,599
* 最后倒在你家门口 *
Then falls down at your door.

57
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,951
哈
Ha!

58
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:22,152
你说对了
You're right.

59
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:23,570
这破玩意还真心是洗脑神曲啊
That crap grows on you.

60
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:24,871
再来一遍不
Again?

61
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:25,906
来吧
Proclaim it!

62
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:25,906
{\a6}这首歌的原唱是Proclaimers乐队

63
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:30,043
嘿 我刚才正躺在
Hey. So there I am,

64
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,078
天井下面那些脏兮兮湿乎乎的沙子上
lying in the wet, filthy sand under the patio,

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,165
思考人生的时候 我爸就撞见我妈了
just minding my own business, when my dad bumps into my mom,

66
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:36,917
然后他说 听着哦
and he says-- get this--

67
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,753
他跟她说"天气转好了 是吧"
he says to her, "Weather's improving, huh?"

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,058
简直了 他俩直接开干好了 对吧
It's like, why don't you just do it already? Huh?

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,727
巴尼 我知道你一直梦想有个完整的家
Barney, I know you've always dreamed of a reunited family,

70
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,846
但是... 杰瑞已经结婚了啊
but... Jerry's married.

71
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:52,315
那又怎样 婚姻不就是张纸吗 屁用都没有
So what? Marriage is just a meaningless piece of paper.

72
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:53,466
艾玛我真是个幸运的女孩
I'm a lucky gal.

73

亲爱的 这事儿没戏的
Sweetie, this just isn't gonna happen.

74
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,970
现在 我要你跟我保证
Now, please promise me

75
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:59,138
你没有在实施任何疯狂的计划
you haven't already put some crazy scheme in motion.

76
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,477
我没有在实施 任何 疯狂的计划
I haven't put some crazy scheme in motion.

77
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,813

Why did you pause?

78
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,117
我没停啊
I didn't pause.

79
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,669
你停一会儿是啥意思
Why did you pause?!

80
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,598

巴尼发短信让我火速去找他
Barney texted me to meet him ASAP,

84
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,167
可是楼梯湿滑

87
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,640
他也给我发了一样的短信

巴尼 杰瑞已经有老婆了
Barney, Jerry has a wife.

89
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,198

偷偷跑去玩滑伞 然后现在让我去会合
snuck off to go parasailing, and he wants me to join him?

92
00:03:45,954 --> 00:03:47,704
是的
Yes.

93
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:52,576
准备好享受这个
Who is ready to rock it

94
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:56,129
苏格兰二重唱模式

95
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:56,129

* 我一定将在你身边醒过来 *
I'm gonna be the man who ends up next to you...

99
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,723
才发现啊 但愿他们不是对同一个妞唱的吧
Oh, man, I hope they're not singing to the same girl.

100
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,675
或者是对彼此唱的
Or to each other.

你能让我和你妈妈复合

我就是想以一场
I'm just trying to keep you refreshed

123
00:04:56,692 --> 00:05:00,193

through this unexpected and flukish elevator malfunction!

124
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:03,596

脱光光 然后把湿衣服送上来
Just disrobe and send up those wet clothes.

我是说 格雷茨基的照片
I mean, the Gretzky photo!

133
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,586
有个混蛋溜进我的房间
Some bastard snuck into my room

134
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:28,505
把我的墨水全洒在巴尼让我保管的
and spilled ink all over the Gretzky photo

135
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:29,889
格雷茨基的照片上了
I was holding for Barney.

136
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,558
大侦探莫斯比 重出江湖
Detective Mosby is on the case.

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,977
-哦 天啊 太可怕了  -我知道
-Oh, God, that's horrible. -I know.

138
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,128
那是给罗宾的礼物
It was a gift for Robin.

139
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,763
我是说
No, I mean,

140
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:39,649
哦天啊 太可怕了 大侦探莫斯比又来祸害人了
"Oh, God, that's horrible. Detective Mosby's the worst."

141
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,134
嗯 大侦探莫斯比
Mm, Detective Mosby is

142
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,852
破案时狂拽酷炫吊炸天
the case-crackingest private dick on the scene.

143
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,355
真的吗 比如那个都折腾八年了
Really? Like that case from eight years ago

144
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,073
都始终没破的案子 你怎么说
you still haven't cracked?

145
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,775
{\a6}就在上周

146
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,775
还是到此为止吧
I'm callin' it.

147
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,480
妈的
Damn it!

148
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,365
我最伟大的失败啊
My greatest failure.

149
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,000
真相只有一个
I will solve this case.

150
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,501
把你给我那张大头照的时候
Now, there were three people nearby

151
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:00,170
只有三个人在附近
when Barney gave me that head shot:

152
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:03,590
功夫坏小子的比利•扎布卡
Karate Kid bad boy Billy Zabka,

153
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,993
贼眉鼠眼的服务员
a shifty-eyed bellhop,

154
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,328
还有罗宾的表兄 来自魁北克的
and Robin's cousin Claude from Quebec

155
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,297
颈椎犯病的克劳德
with the neck trouble.

156
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,667
对啊 毕竟你觉得这些鬼扯的阴谋论比
Right, 'cause an elaborate conspiracy is much more likely

157
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,021
你把照片放在没盖盖子的墨水瓶旁边更有可能了
than you leaving the photo next to an open ink bottle.

158
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:21,174
-多谢总结  -你连挖苦都侦测不到
-Thank you! -You can't even detect sarcasm!

159
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,443
你干嘛不试着弄好照片啊
Why don't you just try to fix the photo?

160
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:24,694
你就没有消字灵吗
Don't you have ink remover?

161
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:25,979
我当然有消字灵了
Of course I have ink remover.

162
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,847
我又不是那种邋遢朋克书法家
I'm not one of those sloppy, punk calligraphers

163
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,366
光说不练假把式的那种
who's in it for glory over craft.

164
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,284
我们得解决掉
No, we got to solve this!

165
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:32,819
现在问题就是
Now, the question is,

166
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:35,872
这三个犯罪嫌疑人中 谁最有理由陷害我
which of those three suspects had the most cause to frame me?

167
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:40,193
是被我替掉的那个前任伴郎吗
The one that I replaced as Barney's best man?

168
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:42,879
你给我等着 莫斯比
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

169
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:44,914
比利•扎布卡
Billy Zabka!

170
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,970
十万火急 我需要现采的英国薰衣草
Okay, real quick, I need fresh-cut English lavender,

171
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,220
一份莎士比亚的十四行诗第十八首
a copy of Shakespeare's 18th sonnet,

172
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,806
还有足够抹遍一个60岁女人全身的巧克力榛子酱
and enough Nutella to cover a 60-year-old woman.

173
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,009
好吧 你们居然逃跑了
Oh, great. You guys escaped.

174
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:57,343
营救成功哈
Got rescued!

175
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:58,678
你们还好吗
Are you okay?

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,013
受了点惊吓
A bit shaken up.

177
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,881
被困电梯很恐怖的
Being trapped in an elevator is scary.

178
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,817
不 是巴尼放下来一台电视
No, Barney lowered in a TV

179
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:07,237
播的声情并茂的70年代黄片太吓人了
showing some pretty graphic 1970s pornography.

180
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,439
还是有很多熟脸的哈
Still, a lot of familiar faces in there.

181
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,907
好吧 不只是脸
Well, not just faces.

182
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,109
我得找我老婆去
I'm gonna go find my wife.

183
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,230
看你干的好事
Nice job, bro.

184
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,899
自打妈妈怀上我以来
Mom was just about to get some action

185
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,534
这是她头一回准备采取点行动
for the first time since she conceived me.

186
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:22,902
巴尼 你得停手了
Barney, this has to stop.

187
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,087
你妄想症又发作了吧
You're being delusional.

188
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,305
妈妈才不会和杰瑞复合
Mom is not getting back together with Jerry.

189
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,908
因为她要和我爸爸复合啦
Because she's getting back together with my daddy!

190
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,493
我看出来你的猫腻了
I see what you're doing.

191
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,644
你把你爸带来不是为了给我俩证婚
You didn't bring your dad here to marry us.

192
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,696
而是想让他跟妈妈复合啊
You want him to get back together with Mom!

193
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:43,099
这太没天理了好吗
Which is completely insane, by the way.

194
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,568
呃 我爸爸单身 妈妈也是单身
Um, my dad's single, Mom's single.

195
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,536
而你爸婚姻幸福 儿女绕膝
Your dad's happily married with two kids.

196
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,871
哪个更能说得通
Which one makes more sense?

197
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:50,439
好吧 我同意 算平手
I agree. It's a tie.

198
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,624
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

199
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,758
你闪边
You back down

200
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,343
让我爸爸和妈妈重归于好
and let me get my mom and dad back together?

201
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,845
呃 不如你闪边
Um, how about you back down

202
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,964
让我爸爸和妈妈重归于好
and let me get my mom and dad back together?

203
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:00,099
我已经脑补出画面了
I can already picture it.

204
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,855
* 我们复合了呀 幸福欢乐多呀 *
We're reunited and we're going so strong

205

And Barney makes three

213
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,494
* 我们爱你 小家伙 *
We love you, champ!

214
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,195

00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:33,549
* 我一点意见也没有呀 *
And I'm totally cool with it!

216
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,552
你精神病忘吃药了吧
That's completely insane.

217
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,504
事情会是这样的
This is how it's gonna be.

218
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:42,458
* 我们复合了呀 我好欢乐多呀 *
We're reunited and I'm feeling so glad

219
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,177
* 我比巴尼爸爸性感好多呀 *
I'm so much sexier than Barney's dad

220
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:50,016
* 破镜又重圆呀 生活回正轨呀 *
Back together, now our life's right on track

221
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:53,436
* 但她背着你爸 偷偷上我爸呀 *
But she's banging my dad behind your dad's back

222
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:57,723
* 你去上班时 我就在她身后呀 *
When you're at work, I'm all over her rack

223
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,675
* 他乱说 *
That's not true

224
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,675
* 才没有 *
Yes, it is

225
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:00,860
* 不好笑 *
That's not funny

226
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:02,345
* 妈妈 插播一下 *
Mom, break the news

227
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,914
* 好呀 我们像小兔 尽情啪啪啪 *
Okay, we're screwin' like bunnies

228

232
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:15,925

234
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:21,580

No, my dad would win in a fight! Nuh-uh!

235
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:23,749
别打啦
Don't fight!

236
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,584
我要嫁进这家门啊
I'm marrying into this family. 

237
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,436
-你个傻蛋  -我才不停
-You stupid! -I won't stop.

238
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,557
滑伞的地方到底在哪啊
Where the heck is this parasailing place?

239
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,775
你等一下
You know what?

240
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,443
我得 我得给杰瑞打个电话
I'm gonna... I'm gonna call Jerry.

241
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,946
奇了怪了
Oh, that's weird.

242
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,781
我一点信号都收不到了
I just lost cell reception.

243
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,616
是吗
Yes.

244
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,202
真是奇怪呢
Weird.

245
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:47,907
这个旅馆里美画连连啊
Lot of pretty paintings in this hotel.

246
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,042
而且一个个裱得也好看
I like how they've been... framed.

247
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,042
{\a6}frame双关裱和陷害

248
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:52,661
我也注意到了那些古色古香的
I've noticed the vintage, antique,

249
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:54,213
镀金维多利亚风格的画框
gilded Victorian frames, too.

250
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:57,299
我又不瞎 你想说什么
I'm not blind... but what are you getting at?

251
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,934
你跟我装什么二愣子呢
You know damn well what I'm getting at!

252
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,803
你嫉妒我又做回了伴郎
You're jealous I got the Best Mansmanship back,

253
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:03,122
所以你想出毒计 毁了那签名照片
so you destroyed that photo as part of some diabolical scheme

254
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,007
就是为了让我难堪
to make me look bad.

255
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,926
你肯定还准备了另一张韦恩•格雷茨基的照片
I bet you even found some other photo of Wayne Gretzky

256
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,094
就是为了关键时刻出来力挽狂澜对不对
so you could swoop in and save the day.

257
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:09,428
-你有病吧你  -有吗
-You're insane. -Am I?

258
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,563
-你就是  -是吗  -绝对是
-Yeah. -Am I? - Yeah.

259
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:13,315
下午三点十五的时候你在哪
Where were you today at 3:15 p.M.?

260
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:15,484
就在这里享受了
Right here getting a massage.

261
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,770
六十分钟的深层组织按摩
Rocked a 60-minute deep tish.

262
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,688
现在要是没什么事 大侦探
Now if you'll excuse me, Detective,

263
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,807
我就吃菠萝去了
I think I'll go have some pineapple.

264
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,326
你怎么知道菠萝那事的
How do you know about that?

265
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,612
地球人都知道啊
Everybody knows about that!

266
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:29,749
-打扰一下  -什么事
-Excuse me? -Mm?

267
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:31,500
是你毁了那张照片 对不对
You destroyed that photo, didn't you?

268
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:32,651
不是我干的
No, I didn't.

269
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:33,986
别装了 我向领班投诉你了
Admit it! I complained about you

270
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:36,455
你就想报复我
to the bell captain, so you got your revenge.

271
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,124
你向领班投诉我了吗
You complained about me?

272
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:41,627
没有
No.

273
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:45,681
慢点走 克劳德
So, Claude...

274
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,967
我听说你是蒙特利尔加拿大人队的球迷
I see that you're a Montreal Canadiens fan.

275
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:50,970
也就是说你讨厌埃德蒙顿油工队
Which means you hate the Edmonton Oilers,

276
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:53,139
这也解释了你为什么会毁了韦恩•格雷茨基的大头照
which is why you destroyed the Wayne Gretzky head shot!

277
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:54,223
我指控你
J'accuse!

278
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:56,008
你这叫毫无根据
C'est ridicule!

279
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,560
要是毫无根据的话
If it's so ridicule,

280
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,563
那你怎么解释你的手
how do you explain this?

281
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:05,017
看起来我抓到了... 你沾满墨水的双手
Ah, seems like I've caught you...midnight blue-handed.

282
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,535
你说这个啊
Oh, these. Yeah.

283
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:09,155
当时我在海边
I-I was out by the water when...

284
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:12,792
一个老年塔法里人驾驶着滑翔机
an elderly R-Rastafarian hang glider...

285
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,244
掉到了沙滩上的一只乌贼上
he-he crash onto a beached squid,

286
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:19,331
我过去救人的时候被墨汁溅上了
which squirted ink when I ran in to help.

287
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,366
就这个破理由你还指望我信你吗
You really expect me to believe that?

288
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:24,370
证据确凿
Story checks out.

289
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,305
错怪你了 克劳德
Sorry, Claude.

290
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,841
没关系
De rien.

291
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,593
我没搞明白
I don't get it.

292
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:31,560
本来好好的
We were bonding.

293
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:36,015
我什么都没做错好吗
I can't think of anything I did wrong!

294
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,883
好吧 做了那么几件错事
Okay, I did a few things wrong.

295
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:39,268
我最后一次重申
For the last time,

296
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,388
我没把你买的那些橙子放在车顶
I did not leave the bag of oranges you bought on the roof!

297
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,360
别再超速了啊
No more breaking the speed limit. And, uh,

298
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:51,947
多谢提醒我她跑到了67英里
thanks for flagging me down and telling me she was going 67.

299
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:51,947
{\a6}美国高速限速65英里

300
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,782
只是做个守法公民罢了 警官
Just following the rules, Officer.

301
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,069
对了 她还没系安全带
Oh. She's also not wearing her seat belt.

302
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,590
那个词不是你能用的
You are not allowed to use that word!

303
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:03,843
只有我们才能用
Only we're allowed to use that word!

304
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:06,212
对不起
I am so sorry.

305
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,715
我以后再也不敢叫你或别人
I will never call you or anyone else a...

306
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,634
星际脑残粉了
Trekkie again.

307
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:14,136
但是我道过歉你也接受了
But I apologized and you accepted.

308
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,438
我还买了橙子赔给你
I even bought you more oranges.

309
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,929
我气的不是你 明白了吗
Look, it wasn't you, okay?

310
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:27,299
宝贝 我知道你在模拟联合国的发言很重要
Baby, I know your speech at the Model U.N. Is a big deal,

311
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:29,785
但是我不知道我赶不赶得及了
but I'm just not sure I'll make it in time.

312
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,203
我在努力赶路
I'm trying.

313
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,404
你知道吗
You know what?

314
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,123
你直接别来算了
Don't bother coming.

315
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,079
也就是说你当时在机场说的是真的了
So, back at the airport, that story was true?

316
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:41,113
你有个女儿吗
You have a daughter?

317
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,831
她跟她爸过
She lives with her dad.

318
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,285
而且因为我老是出差 总是错过很多
And since I travel for work, I miss a lot of stuff.

319
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:50,589
我努力工作也是为了让她过上好日子
I only work as hard as I do to provide for her.

320
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,926
孩子不认逻辑
But kids, they don't understand logic.

321
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,395
孩子只认有谁陪伴
Kids understand who shows up.

322
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:59,398
这就是为什么她爸爸是她的英雄
That's why her dad's her hero...

323
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,152
而我却被挂电话
and I get hung up on.

324
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,653
去看你女儿的演讲吧
Go see your daughter's speech.

325
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:06,739
只要你出现 一切都会被原谅的
If you show up, all will be forgiven.

326
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:07,990
别管这事儿了
Just drop it.

327
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:09,942
直接开回我家吧
And drop me at home.

328
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,527
然后赶快去你那场婚礼
Then head out to your wedding.

329
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,162
讨论结束
End of discussion.

330
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:16,832
巴尼 哪怕你的计划能成功
Barney, even if your plan worked,

331
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,500
你也毁了你爸爸的婚姻啊
you'd be destroying your dad's marriage.

332
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,652
好吧 你说的有那么一点道理
Okay, you may have a point.

333
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:21,787
我能提个建议吗
Can I suggest something?

334
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,505
休战吧
Truce?

335
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,490
我们都同意放下这件事如何
We both agree to drop this.

336
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:27,492
同意
Agreed.

337
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:28,944
对了 我新换了一瓶
Hey, I got a replacement bottle

338
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,764
-30年陈的格伦•麦肯纳  -好
-of 30-year Glen McKenna. -Okay.

339
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,133
听着 就算妈妈再也没有跟
Look, even if Mom never gets back together

340
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,885
我们俩的爸爸之一复合 我们仍然是兄弟
with either one of our dads, we're still brothers.

341
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:38,854
这可不是比赛
It's not a competition.

342
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:44,693
我赢啦
I win!

343
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,337
把你的臭手从我妈身上拿下来
Get your damn hands off my mom!

344
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:54,055
把你的臭手放到我妈身上去
Get your damn hands on my mom!

345
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:55,389
一只放上去一只拿下来吗
One on, one off?

346
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:57,525
这到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

347
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,660
几年前 在你们哥俩找到山姆之后
After you boys tracked Sam down a few years back,

348
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,629
我们联系上了 我们又成为了朋友
we got in touch. We became friends again,

349
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,664
-开始一起玩  -然后某一天
-started hanging out. -And then one day,

350
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,100
她从洛蕾塔变成了...
she went from being Loretta to being...

351
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:08,235
洛♀蕾♀塔
Lo-ret-ta.

352
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,654
我们想等等再告诉你们
We wanted to wait to tell you

353
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:10,871
因为时间还不长
because it's still new,

354
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,740
但一旦山姆来主持婚礼仪式
but it was inevitable you'd find out

355
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,076
你们肯定会发现这事的
once Sam came to perform the ceremony.

356
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,527
这是你俩的亲密用语吗
Is that what you two call it?

357
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,913
"主持婚礼仪式"
"Performing the ceremony"?

358
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:20,164
不 山姆明天会为你证婚啊 亲爱的
Oh, Sam's marrying you tomorrow, dear.

359
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,700
哦对 多谢你了 牧师大人
Right. Thank you, Reverend. 

360
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,219
听着 你们可以好好的接受这件事吗
Look, is there any way you guys can be all right with this?

361
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,421
我当然可以啦
Of course I am!

362
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:30,057
巴尼呢
Barney?

363
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:33,010
我知道我今天一直不正常 但...
I know I've been acting crazy today, but...

364
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:35,229
我只有一个真正想问的问题 妈妈
I just have one real question, Mom,

365
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,047
我希望得到诚实的回答
and I want an honest answer.

366
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:38,816
有没有这样一刻
Is there a scenario--

367
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:39,850
听我说完
and hear me out--

368
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,019
你曾经考虑过
where you might consider

369
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,555
跟我们俩的爸爸们一起来个三人行呢
doing kind of a three-way deal with both of our dads?

370
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,741
-天哪 你到底什么毛病  -喂 老弟 说什么呢
-God! What is wrong with you?! -Oh, dude, come on!

371
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,993
我就知道会这样
That's what I thought!

372
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:53,698
是时候承认了 泰德
It's time to admit it, Ted.

373
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,334
是你自己弄洒了墨水 根本就没有什么阴谋
You spilled the ink. There's no conspiracy.

374
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,702
我想也是吧
I guess you're right.

375
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,120
我是说 只剩下最后一个
I mean, the only other person

376
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,422
看到巴尼给我那张照片的人了...
who saw Barney give me that photo...

377
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:02,673
就是你
was you.

378
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:05,743
嘿 白痴
Hey. Idiot.

379
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,411
在你忙着玩侦探游戏的时候
While you've been playing detective,

380
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,797
我一直在帮你收拾烂摊子
I've been cleaning up your mess.

381
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,916
看 消字灵很有效呢
Look, the ink remover works.

382
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:13,684
我去把这个弄好
I'm gonna finish this.

383
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,770
你去向巴尼坦白
You come clean to Barney.

384
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,254
好吧
Okay.

385
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:19,306
她已经消失一整天了
She's been missing all day,

386
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:23,561
而且我在我床上找到一张疑似自杀留言的东西
a-and I found what appears to be a-a suicide note on my bed.

387
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:26,030
但语气并不像她
But it doesn't really sound like her.

388
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:30,534
"我要杀了我...等一下...自己"
"I'm going to kill my-- wait for it-- self."

389
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,954
扎布卡先生还好吗
Is everything okay with Mr. Zabka?

390
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:37,941
等等 等一下 你为什么认为那是比利•扎布卡
Wait. W-Wait. Why do you think that's Billy Zabka?

391
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,446
看到没
See?

392
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:44,415
是大堂那个男人做的这个按摩
The man from the lobby got this massage.

393
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,500
一位年轻一些的先生作为礼物送他的
A younger gentleman bought it for him as a gift.

394
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:47,918
还帮他签名了
He even signed his name for him.

395
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,119
就在这儿
Right here.

396
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,984
我告诉你们...
I'm telling all y'all...

397
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,686
这是扎布卡破坏
it's Zabka-tage.

398
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:05,686
{\a6}原词为sabotage 蓄意破坏

* 我已忍无可忍 我知道你掌控了全局 *
I can't stand it, I know you planned it

401
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,292
* 我这就要把一切澄清 整个局中局 *
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate

402
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,076
* 我在里面已经不能忍受其中的韵律 *
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here

403
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,412
* 因为你的水晶球并不像你说的那样清澈透明 *
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear

Lily's second tackle of the weekend.

407
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:29,727
毁灭吧
Sabotage.

408
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,695
醒一醒吧 我们到了
Wakey, wakey.

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,017
等等 这不是...
Wait, this isn't...

410
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,369
这是你女儿的学校
It's your daughter's school.

411
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,954
你需要进去
You need to go in.

412
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,939
她说让我不要来了
She asked me not to come, Marshall.

413
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,325
这完全讲不通啊
This doesn't make any sense.

414
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,126
孩子不认逻辑
Kids don't understand logic.

415
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:49,330
孩子只认有谁陪伴
Kids understand who shows up.

416
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:11,402
人们常说 孩子就是未来
People say children are the future.

417
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,970
我说...
I say...

418
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,438
石油才是未来
oil is the future!

419
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,824
少听点那些胆小如鼠娘们儿唧唧的环保主义者的屁话
Don't listen to these gutless environmental sissies!

420
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,642
-这才是我姑娘  -勘探海洋
-That's my baby. -Drill in the oceans!

421
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,277
-谢谢你  -勘探湿地
-Thank you. -Drill in the wetlands!

422
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,079
-傻冒  -勘探国家公园  
-Pumpkin head. -Drill in the national parks!

423
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,313
不客气
You're welcome.

424
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,915
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

425
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,984
-宝贝 快来钻  -我们该走了
-Drill, baby, drill! -We should go.

426
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,286
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

427
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:32,623
宝贝 快来钻 宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill! Drill, baby, drill!

428
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,124
宝贝 快来钻
Drill, baby, drill!

429
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,759
你都说了
You said it was nuts

430
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,995
我让我的父母重归于好这个想法很疯狂
to think that my mom and dad would get back together.

431
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,496
但是詹姆斯和我想得一样
But that's what happened for James.

432
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,849
我从五岁开始就一直幻想着
I've been dreaming of that since I was five.

433
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:44,835
当然除了这个以外 还想要一个我自己能操控的死星
Well, that and my own operational Death Star.

434
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:44,835
{\a6}星球大战中黑武士毁灭星球的空间站

435
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,137
但最主要还是他们重归于好
But mostly them getting back together.

436
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,139
为什么詹姆斯的想法实现了 我却没有
Why does James get it and I don't?

437
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:50,224
嗯 你想想
Well, think about it.

438
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,776
你有了我 你爸爸有了谢丽尔
You have me, your dad has Cheryl...

439
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:53,861
所以 综上所述
"So to summarize:

440
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:54,945
我死定了
"I'm super dead,

441
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,448
你应该和洛蕾塔好好啪啪啪
"You should totally bone Loretta,

442
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,034
我从未爱过你 谢丽尔
"And I never loved you, Cheryl,"

443
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,703
名字还拼错了
which is misspelled.

444
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,622
...詹姆斯刚刚离婚
...but James is going through a divorce.

445
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:06,523
他刚刚失去了家庭
He just lost his family.

446
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:09,576
我知道你一直有这个梦想 但是...
I-I know you've been dreaming of this, but...

447
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,212
也许 他比你更需要"合家欢"里面的情节
maybe he needs "Mom and Dad" More than you.

448
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,334
所以 比利 你真的觉得你能瞒天过海吗
So, Billy, did you really think you could get away with it?

449
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,385
实话说 我是这么想的
Actually, I did.

450
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:19,253
-啊  -我本来想
-Ah. I was gonna

451
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,537
把这个给巴尼的
give this to Barney

452
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,639
然后说我开了一个小时的车
and say I'd driven an hour away

453
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,757
在一个卖签名照的人手里买了一个新的
to get a replacement from an autograph dealer.

454
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,659
首先 我需要不在场证明
First, I needed an alibi.

455
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,561
所以我让巴尼的爸爸去做按摩
So I got Barney's dad a massage

456
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:29,847
但是我签的是自己的名字
but signed in my name.

457
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,216
接下来我把格雷茨基的大头照换成我
Then I switched the Gretzky head shot with one of myself.

458
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,986
我后备箱里常年放着
I always travel with 2,000 of those handsome devils

459
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:38,188
两千多张我英俊的小恶魔照片
in the trunk of my car.

460
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,526
我有无数个问题要问你 但是首先...
I have so many questions for you, but first...

461
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:45,946
你为什么把两千多张你的大头照放在你车里
you keep 2,000 head shots of yourself in your trunk?

462
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,748
因为没人要啊 他们只想要
No one ever wants them! They only want

463
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,950
好人的签名照
the "Good guy's" Autograph!

464
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,586
在80年代 我在每部电影里都是反面人物
In the '80s, I was the bad guy in every movie.

465
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:55,205
你知道我人生是什么样子的吗
Do you know what my life has been like?

466
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:58,592
每次首映 当我出现的时候...
Every premiere, when I came on-screen...

467
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,345
但我在生活中不是坏人啊
I wasn't a bad guy in real life,

468
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,180
只是一个很不错的演员啊
just a kick-ass actor.

469
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:04,598
但是没人懂我...
No one got that.

470
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,750
不管我在哪都有人这么做
It happened everywhere I went.

471
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:09,386
也不知道为什么 他们总有爆米花在他们手里
Somehow, people always had popcorn.

472
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:13,357
{\a6}功夫小子中的经典桥段

473
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:13,357
二十五年了 我都在被人踢爆蛋蛋
25 years of getting crane-kicked in the nuts,

474
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,227
直到巴尼•斯丁森给了我人生中最光彩夺目的一天
until Barney Stinson gave me the best moment of my life.

475
00:19:17,229 --> 00:19:19,863
嘿 嘿 泰德那边出了一点问题 所以...
Hey. Hey, some issues just came up with Ted, so...

476
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,115
你愿意当我的伴郎吗
will you be my best man?

477
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,483
-当然  -谢谢
-Sure. -Thanks.

478
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,571
-喂  -妈
-Hello? -Mom?

479
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:29,540
别 别 听着 听
No, no, listen, listen.

480
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,792
我刚成了某人的伴郎
I just became somebody's best man.

481
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:35,445
今年感恩节你可以来了
You can come to Thanksgiving this year!

482
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,781
在巴尼•斯丁森眼中 我不是坏人
To Barney Stinson, I wasn't a bad guy.

483
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:42,119
在巴尼•斯丁森眼中 我是他的伴郎
To Barney Stinson, I was the best man.

484
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,839
我就想着要是泰德再搞砸一次 我就又有机会了
I thought if Ted screwed up again, I'd have another shot.

485
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,393
想必 我这回真的是个坏人了
But I guess this time I really was the bad guy.

486
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,061
怎么了 泰德 什么事情这么紧急
Hey, Ted, what's so urgent?

487
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:53,647
有些事情我要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

488
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,467
我把格雷茨基的大头照毁了
I destroyed that Gretzky head shot

489
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,970
我修复不了 比利力挽狂澜
and I couldn't fix it. Billy saved the day

490
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:02,740
跑到附近的卖签名照的地方买了个新的
by getting a new one from an autograph dealer nearby.

491
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,907
一小时车程呢
A-An hour away.

492
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:05,943
对对 一小时 淡定点
An hour away. Just be cool.

493
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,911
太棒了 谢谢你 比利
Awesome. Thanks, Billy!

494
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,834
还有 泰德
And, Ted...

495
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,203
我很高兴你说了实话
I really appreciate that you told the truth.

496
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:17,921
-痛  -去你的
-Ow -Psych!

497
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,456
比利牛人 泰德衰人
Billy rules, Ted drools,

498
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,657
斯丁森闪人
Stinson out.

499
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,645
没事啦 莫斯比
You're all right, Mosby.

500
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:28,265
而就是这百年难见的神奇周末
And for an all too rare moment that weekend,

501
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,749
竟然一切安好
everything was all right.

502
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,224
呃 巴尼
Um, Barney?

503
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,776
你就是这样支持我们的吗
Is this your way of saying you're supporting us?

504
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:41,428
是的 快上吧
Yes! Go for it.

505
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,980
达到爱的巅峰吧
Consummate your love!

506
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,649
谢谢了 兄弟
Thanks, bro.

507
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:49,486
但这很奇怪啊
But this is super weird.

508
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,406
各种奇怪
Super weird.

509
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,481
我们快到了吗
Are we almost there?

510
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,015
很快就到了
Almost there.

511
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,317
还我老婆 你个贱人
Give me back my wife, you son of a bitch!

512
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,370
HIMYM字幕组 谢谢观看
