1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,522
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:03,883
When are you speaking with the Vice President?

3
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:04,874
I'm on my way now.

4
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:08,147
We're going to discuss potential running mates for his presidential campaign.

5
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:10,862
When I'm finished, you will be at the top of his list.

6
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:13,182
So you've made up your mind to run when Kincaid's second term is up?

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:16,906
The only question is, are you interested in running?

8
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,704
I have a business proposition for you.

9
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:23,207
I need a spy inside Duncan's operation.

10
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,000
What about the girl? She accept your offer?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,800
She's in. 

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,215
The President is gonna be in New York today.

13
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,103
Another team is being assembled.

14
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:31,982
Sir, I've got a hit on Duncan Carlisle in New York.

15
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,767
- 15 minutes ago. - Son of a bitch.

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,703
He's trying to sabotage this whole thing.

17
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:43,325
- Targets are down. - Copy that.

18
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,983
- I can't believe you did it. - You came through for me, Ellen.

19
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:49,635
Without you,

20
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,742
I don't know what would have happened today. 

21
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:53,229
Don't move!

22
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,902
There's easier ways to get in touch with me, Logan.

23
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:15,904
Phone call, text, send me an e-mail.

24
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,139
We know what you did in New York.

25
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,159
- People are very upset. - I'm upset too, now what?

26
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:24,400
Not my call.

27
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,317
Agent Carlisle. We've never officially met.

28
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,489
Thomas Blair.

29
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:56,506
I'm aware of what you and your team did in New York.

30
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,606
And I'm aware of what you and your team tried to do.

31
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:02,753
Should've stayed out of it.

32
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:05,155
If you had succeeded, that would've made me expendable,

33
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:08,347
- and we both know where that leads. - You're smart.

34
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,824
I'm also your best chance at getting this thing done.

35
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:14,505
We could still work together. You already failed once.

36
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:16,496
Why should I believe you'll succeed this time?

37
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:19,906
Well, for starters, I just took out your crackerjack sniper team.

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,349
And you're confident Dr. Sanders will come through for us?

39
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,740
I'm positive.

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,454
And you're confident you'll hold up your end of the bargain?

41
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,400
Dr. Sanders will need a certain amount of help in the operating room.

42
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,660
- We need to talk about that. - What the hell does that mean?

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,574
A problem has come up.

44
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:56,730
We need your help solving it.

45
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,759
Eh... About last night...

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,810
Right.

47
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,018
I mean, everything's been so confusing and...

48
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,002
heightened.

49
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,632
I know what I'm supposed to feel. I'm supposed to hate you.

50
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:30,356
But, uh...

51
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:36,219
I don't.

52
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,108
I'm glad to hear that.

53
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,083
Ellen, we can't. We need to focus right now

54
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,459
on what really matters,

55
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:56,356
- saving our families. - Yeah.

56
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,208
We're doing the right thing.

57
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:15,583
I gotta head out. I just got a call from a detective.

58
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,627
- About? - The murder of that limo driver.

59
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,091
One of the detectives working on the case wants to talk to me about Jake's testimony.

60
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:25,518
What number did he call you on?

61
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:29,266
My work number. Called my secretary and she told me to call here.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,993
Check it yourself. Press redial.

63
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:39,513
Do you really want the DC police knocking on the door, asking where the hell I am?

64
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,085
Archer will give you a ride.

65
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,606
Burton, hey.

66
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,577
I need you to check something out. Right away!

67
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,114
I'd like to talk to Detective Hall.

68
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,376
- Is he expecting you? - No.

69
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:19,876
- What's it about? - I'd rather talk to him directly.

70
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,597
He's in court right now, he should be back pretty soon.

71
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,953
- Okay, I'll wait. - Follow me.

72
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,544
- I thought we had a deal! - We did, we still do.

73
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,973
I gave you $10,000 as a gesture of good faith and you screwed us.

74
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,215
I told you I needed to know where Duncan was, if he did anything out of the ordinary.

75
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:45,785
The man went to New York and took out a team of assassins!

76
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:48,698
Not only did you fail to warn us, you went completely off line.

77
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:51,334
Listen! Duncan ordered me to shut off my phone.

78
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,928
Then he had me and another guy parked on a stake-out all day.

79
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:57,865
If I tried to call you, my cover would've been exposed.

80
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,811
You're saying you had no idea what he was up to?

81
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:03,587
No. Not a clue, I swear.

82
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,102
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

83
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:10,844
To save your ass and live happily ever after with your son in Canada.

84
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,100
What do I have to do?

85
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:19,100
When this operation is over, we're going to eliminate a few loose ends.

86
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:23,051
- A few? - Three.

87
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:25,767
Duncan, Archer and Kramer.

88
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,893
Assuming you're on board, of course.

89
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,619
Otherwise, the number would be four.

90
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:33,704
I'm on board.

91
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,973
Hey. Your lawyer's here.

92
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:47,158
Hello, Brian.

93
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:48,858
What are you doing?

94
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,279
- I'm here to help. - This is a police station. When that detective comes in here,

95
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,026
I'm gonna tell him everything! You can't stop me!

96
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:02,830
You're right, but hopefully I can convince you you're making a mistake.

97
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,863
I doubt it.

98
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,182
Patty Hearst, she was taken hostage,

99
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,255
locked in a closet,

100
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:16,491
and after months of abuse, her captors robbed a bank.

101
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,145
Patty Hearst was caught, on tape, helping them.

102
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:23,332
She was tried for bank robbery, and in spite of the fact that

103
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:27,708
she was kidnapped and held against her will, she was convicted.

104
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,054
- Well, this is different. - You're right, it's even worse.

105
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:32,260
You're crazy!

106
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:36,757
Your wife injected the President with blood thinners,

107
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,781
lied to the Secret Service.

108
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:42,638
- Helped bury her friend... - The police are going to believe us!

109
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:43,623
Not you.

110
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,025
- You think so? - I know so.

111
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,670
Tough to prove you're a victim, when you're kissing the captor.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000

Congratulations, you've successfully doctored

116
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:32,809
a photograph of my wife kissing Duncan.

117
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,347
No one's gonna think that's real.

118
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,908
There's video, as well.

119
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,485
It's real, Brian.

120
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,341
How's it going? I'm Detective Hall.

121
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,520
So, what can I do for you?

122
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,131
Well, after, um, consulting with my attorney,

123
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:08,007
I realize that the information I was about to disclose is inaccurate.

124
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,374
Excuse me?

125
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:13,001
Sorry for the inconvenience. I made a mistake.

126
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:16,168
I have nothing to say.

127
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:25,113
Where have you been? I've just been trying to call you.

128
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:25,922
You kissed him?

129
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:28,879
- What? - I saw the photo, Ellen!

130
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,822
Photo? What are you talking about?

131
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,625
I went to the DC Police Department, I was gonna tell them what's going on.

132
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,424
- What! You were gonna talk to the police? - We need help, Ellen, okay?

133
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:39,243
There's no other way out of this, so yeah, I went to the police,

134
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:42,793
and Burton Delaney was there and he showed me a photograph of you and Duncan.

135
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,680
Kissing.

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,858
Is it real?

137
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,645
Yeah.

138
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:57,236
Yes, we kissed. Once.

139
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,190
God.

140
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:02,311
What the hell is wrong with you?

141
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,676
I just, I was trying to convince him that I...

142
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,563
- I was willing to cooperate. - Oh, so, you kissed him?

143
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:09,726
Is that what you're saying?

144
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:13,590
I'm saying it just happened, okay. I don't know why. It just did.

145
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,319
I'm sorry, that's the honest truth.

146
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,345
Look, I understand things just happening, I do,

147
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,090
but not with that son of a bitch!

148
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,587
It's not what you think.

149
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:25,518
What the hell does that mean?

150
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,850
He's doing this to save his wife.

151
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:39,104
- Where's Sandrine? - She went to see the lawyer about her son.

152
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,300
So, what's up?

153
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,203
- Where you been? - Talking to our partners.

154
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:47,958
They know we took out their hit team. They think, or they know?

155
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,184
- Know. - How?

156
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:54,645
Let's just say these guys have lots of resources. Good news is they don't hold a grudge.

157
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:58,239
The mission is still a go, but there's one slight hiccup.

158
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,155
A Secret Service agent named Jack Cahill,

159
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:04,353
has just been assigned to the President's personal detail, and he's senior to our inside man.

160
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,416
Which means, Logan won't have operational control on the day.

161
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,098
Exactly. Unless, we find a way to remove Cahill.

162
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,903
Not that easy to take out a Secret Service agent.

163
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:16,124
I didn't say we were gonna kill him. I said, we need to remove him.

164
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,399
I have a plan. 

165
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,158
Who cares why he's doing all this?

166
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,590
The fact is he's doing it!

167
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,242
And he's harming innocent people in the process.

168
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:27,450
To hell with his damn wife. What makes her so special?

169
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,086
- She's dying, he loves her. - That doesn't justify killing someone.

170
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:34,217
Well, the only person who was supposed to die was Kincaid, that's it.

171
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:37,623
Ellen, listen to yourself, "The only person who was meant to die?"

172
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:40,379
- Like that's okay? - Kincaid is a bad person...

173
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,024
- Says Duncan. - Well, I believe him.

174
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:47,424
I met with Nina's mom and she confirmed everything. It's all true.

175
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,093
Okay. Great.

176
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:52,666
It's true.

177
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,079
Kincaid's a monster, he's like, the most horrible guy in the world,

178
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,180
but that doesn't mean that it's okay to kill him.

179
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,082
And Duncan's wife being sick doesn't entitle him to commit murder!

180
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:10,291
Look, you know, I dunno, life isn't fair. Okay?

181
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:14,300
Good people die, bad people live.

182
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,295
There's no rhyme, no reason, no justification, it's just

183
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,814
the way it is.

184
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,620
Well thank you, Colonel.

185
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:30,151
I don't mean to impose, but I was just in for a procurement meeting

186
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,405
with one of the joint chiefs, so I thought I'd stop by.

187
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:35,971
- No, I'm glad you did, Lyndon. - So, how are things going?

188
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,540
You know how it is. Wars are won and lost over the long haul.

189
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,050
Power is like business.

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,516
Lots of ups and downs, you just wanna make sure it all pays off in the end.

191
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:47,284
Now, this most recent setback has been a little disturbing.

192
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,715
And my company made substantial investments,

193
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,382
with the understanding that OTI would continue.

194
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:56,513
It represents government contracts worth billions to us.

195
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:58,384
I have some good news on that front.

196
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:01,437
The President has decided to wait a few weeks to expose it.

197
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,171
That is good news.

198
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,967
Happy to walk you through the game plan, if you'd like?

199
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,641
Oh, no. Details make me nervous. I just wanna make sure that

200
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:14,265
we are all heading in a direction that is in our mutual best interest.

201
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:19,260
Oh, I understand. Have faith. The balance of power is shifting, soon.

202
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,851
Oh, son. The balance of power is always in the same place.

203
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,522
Where the money is.

204
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:36,802
- Thanks for meeting me. - Thanks for calling.

205
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,008
So, like I said on the phone,

206
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:42,100
- I got some work for you. - Great.

207
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,824
This gig's a little different. It requires discretion.

208
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,336
Discretion costs extra.

209
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,510
Not a problem.

210
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:02,549
What the hell were you thinking, going to the police?

211
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,695
- Screw you! - You are minutes away from signing your own death warrant.

212
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,155
- Go to hell. - Three more days, that's it, then we're gone.

213
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,489
- Out of your lives forever. - I don't believe a word you're saying.

214
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:14,619
Your wife does.

215
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:18,406
- Excuse me? - Your wife. Ellen.

216
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,928
She believed me.

217
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,626
Don't you ever talk about my wife!

218
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,687
- I hope you burn in hell. - I probably will.

219
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:30,825
But, that won't change a damn thing.

220
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,252
How did it go with your lawyer?

221
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,084
Good. He's trying to work out a custody arrangement.

222
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:56,899
It's not easy though, it's not like I can go to court and talk about my stable career.

223
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:02,720
- So, your lawyer, he's based here? - Excuse me?

224
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,090
Just wondering since your son's in New York, thought you have a New York attorney.

225
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,099
You a family law expert, now?

226
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:11,658
Just concerned about you.

227
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:14,730
You worry too much.

228
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,793
It's bad for the heart.

229
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:21,216
You're right. Need to lighten up a little.

230
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,607
Relax, start doing yoga.

231
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,066
Drinking chamomile tea.

232
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:41,252
Getting homework done?

233
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:47,166
Some, but, it's kinda hard to have focus on calculus these days.

234
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:49,799
This will all be over soon.

235
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:55,898
Look, um, I need a phone, one that can't be traced or listened to.

236
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,848
You think you can borrow one, from a friend?

237
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,129
Mom said that we need to cooperate,

238
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,586
that everything's gonna be okay if we just do what they say.

239
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,545
I know what Mom said.

240
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:11,668
- But... - Look, I need to make a phone call.

241
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,901
Your mother's doing what she thinks is right and I respect that,

242
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,987
but I think I know a way out of this and I just gotta make a phone call.

243
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,351
Can you help me out?

244
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:26,591
Clear a path! Make way! Hang in there.

245
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:29,669
Move, move, move. Excuse me!

246
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,128
He can wait.

247
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:32,673
This way, the neurosurgeon is waiting.

248
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:38,475
- Hey, I got your page, what have we got? - Multiple gunshot wounds. Chest and legs.

249
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,721
He's losing a lot of blood. We need to get him on the table.

250
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,513
Take him to OR four, we'll both scrub in.

251
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:57,480
So, what are the specifics?

252
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,745
These are the specifics.

253
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,227
They're shaped charges.

254
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,433
They're small, powerful, and untraceable.

255
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,912
I need you to attach one to each vehicle.

256
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,332
What about the detonators?

257
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,116
I'll handle that.

258
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:18,986
When the surgery is over, the team is gonna split up and disappear.

259
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,497
That's when the bombs are gonna go off.

260
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,558
I'll take care of it.

261
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,771
Take care of it today.

262
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,919
I met up with our girl.

263
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,936
- All systems go. - Good.

264
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,584
But there's something else, D.

265
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,777
It's about Sandrine. I think she's playing us.

266
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,400
What?

267
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:12,756
She was acting suspicious, so, I followed her today.

268
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:16,340
Met a guy at the park. Car with government plates.

269
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,569
I think she flipped.

270
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,717
If she flipped, we'd already be in prison.

271
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:25,045
So, she isn't talking to the Feds, who's that guy?

272
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,271
What this guy look like?

273
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,776
Like a fed. Tall, fit, white, about 45.

274
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,185
- Is this the man she was talking to? - Yeah, that's him.

275
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,994
On the right. Who is he?

276
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,743
My contact at the Secret Service.

277
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:48,773
Why the hell is she talking to him?

278
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,091
That's a good question.

279
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,943
Okay, I think I've got the last of the bleeders. How are you doing?

280
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,538
Still closing holes.

281
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:11,912
Looks like the bullet missed his major arteries.

282
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:15,185
- He just might make it. - Vitals are stabilizing.

283
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:19,200
- Hey, this is an operating room! - Is that son of a bitch gonna live?

284
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,795
- Sir, please step out of the room. - My partner just died.

285
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,102
Your patient shot him in the face.

286
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:27,778
Just keep that in mind while you're trying to save his sorry ass.

287
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,453
What's going on?

288
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,918
This guy ambushed two cops, during a traffic stop.

289
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:38,687
The one who got shot was a young father. He just had his first kid.

290
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,437
You need to be careful around Sandrine.

291
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,265
Come on, Duncan, I'm not a kid.

292
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,014
I'm not worried about you getting your heart broken.

293
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:02,762
I'm saying you can't trust her.

294
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,757
- What are you talking about? - She's a criminal.

295
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:07,591
She plays by different rules.

296
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,873
- You don't know her. - Neither do you.

297
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,688
I think she might be selling us out.

298
00:20:17,195 --> 00:20:20,178
- To who? - Logan.

299
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,129
I don't buy that. If she's selling us out,

300
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,467
why'd she take out that sniper team in New York?

301
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:32,505
I don't know.

302
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:38,432
In the meantime, I want you to take her with you and watch a guy named Steve Patterson.

303
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,727
- What are we watching him for? - Nothing.

304
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,937
It's a fake mission, but if she is working for the other side, word will get back to them.

305
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,459
I wanna see if Sandrine takes the bait.

306
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,901
How you doing?

307
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,588
Fine.

308
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,439
Why?

309
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:07,934
Just thought, after what happened in New York, if you wanted to talk about it.

310
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,157
There's nothing to talk about. I did what I had to do.

311
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:12,786
If the two shooters had the drop on me,

312
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,300
they would've put a bullet in my head in a heartbeat.

313
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,406
- That's how it works. - Got it.

314
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,600
Duncan wants us to scope out this address.

315
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:27,527
Who lives there?

316
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,915
Some federal prosecutor. His name is Steve Patterson.

317
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,001
I'll get my gear.

318
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:47,227
- We're losing him, what happened? - I've got him all cleaned up here.

319
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,385
I pulled out a bullet fragment that was blocking his femoral vein,

320
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:50,560
I can't stop the bleeding...

321
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,439
- Push one cc of epi. - Close the bleeder, Lena.

322
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,852
I'm trying, Ellen. There's too much blood.

323
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:01,642
I said epi now!

324
00:22:01,642 --> 00:22:05,419
He's gone, Ellen. There's nothing we can do.

325
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:09,579
- Okay, step out of the way. - What are you doing?

326
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,656
Expose the patient, I need paddles.

327
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Clear!

328
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:20,910
- There's too much damage. - Just give me some space.

329
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,648
Suction, roll of vicryl.

330
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,969
You did it.

331
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,375
I can't believe it!

332
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:53,650
Close him up.

333
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:09,584
You ready?

334
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,361
Just throwing my bag in the back.

335
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,911
Why are we staking out this prosecutor?

336
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,999
- It have to do with the limo driver? - I don't know.

337
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:32,210
I gotta be honest, I can't forget that guy's face.

338
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,146
I can't get it out of my mind.

339
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:40,065
He was pointing a gun at me. You saved my life that night.

340
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:45,361
Well,

341
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:49,428
you'd do the same for me, right?

342
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,513
Of course.

343
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,862
WASHINGTON, DC
17 CD63

344
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:24,748
Ellen?

345
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,467
I didn't mean to...

346
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,121
I thought he was dead.

347
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,141
I certainly wasn't trying to kill him.

348
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,413
Well, you weren't trying to save him either.

349
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:42,120
Look, my hand aren't as good as yours. I didn't think we could save him.

350
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,476
Not to mention, the son of a bitch is gonna die anyway.

351
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,899
He's a cop killer, Ellen. He's gonna get the death penalty...

352
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,086
- What? That has nothing to do with us. - I know. I was just saying...

353
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:56,548
We're doctors. Not judges, not jurors.

354
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:27,742
Still got the magic touch, huh?

355
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:30,766
- What's cracking, D? How ya been? - I'm good, how 'bout you?

356
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,421
Can't complain, man.

357
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:37,100
- Kids? - Killin' it. Maggie's getting all A's, and Jack's playing football, starting quarterback.

358
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,750
- Just like his old man. - Yeah. Except better, and smarter.

359
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:44,469
Hey, thanks for meeting with me on such short notice.

360
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,406
- I appreciate it. - Tell me what you need.

361
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,915
I'm working an undercover case, I need to put some pressure on a suspect.

362
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:55,535
Shake him down. I need an arrest, nothing major, doesn't even have to stick.

363
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:57,543
Guy's name is Jack Cahill.

364
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:20,819
You in the bathroom?

365
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:24,685
What the hell are you doing?

366
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:28,918
Told you before, I need to know where you are at all times.

367
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,847
What you did today, going to the cops.

368
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,178
You're lucky Duncan didn't tell me to put you down.

369
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:42,891
You are definitely gonna be the hottest First Lady in recent history.

370
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,035
- What about Jackie Kennedy? - Not even close.

371
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,701
So, how did your meeting go with the Vice President?

372
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:53,707
Very well.

373
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,622
He said he would be lucky as hell to have someone like you on his circuit.

374
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,527
- Love you. - Mmm-hmm?

375
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,553
One more thing,

376
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,347
drop by the Attorney General's office and kiss his ring.

377
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,462
He and Vice President Grant are good friends.

378
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:23,712
I will make up a reason to pay him a visit this afternoon.

379
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:24,604
Good.

380
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:28,594
Just keep it quiet.

381
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:32,243
You don't want anyone to know that you're lobbying for this.

382
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,466
Are you Dr. Sanders?

383
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Yes.

384
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,119
That was my father, the man you saved.

385
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:58,346
Oh, well, he's gonna pull through.

386
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:01,520
I know my father has a lot of problems, um,

387
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,398
I don't know if he killed that police man or what, but either way,

388
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,866
he's still a person, and he's still my father, so,

389
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,315
thank you for taking care of him.

390
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:42,598
Scotch, please.

391
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,631
You look familiar. You work for the Bureau?

392
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:57,907
I used to, 20 years ago.

393
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,012
- Where are you now? - Secret Service.

394
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,951
Duncan Carlisle, FBI.

395
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:08,968
- Jack Cahill, nice to meet you. - You too.

396
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,263
What division are you with?

397
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:13,244
- Crisis negotiation. - Good for you.

398
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:15,802
Has its moments.

399
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:24,880
You seen Sandrine?

400
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:29,474
She came back with me a few hours ago. She's around here somewhere. Why?

401
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,274
Just wondering.

402
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:36,070
Why don't you just focus on babysitting this one?

403
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,107
Don't got anywhere, Brian. I'll be right back.

404
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,682
Leave a message.

405
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:38,228
Hey, Sandrine, it's me.

406
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:40,524
Just checkin' in. Call me when you can.

407
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,622
Come on, come on.

408
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:08,245
- Hello? - Hi, is this Nina?

409
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:10,678
Yes, who is this?

410
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:14,950
- My name is Brian Sanders. - Um, do I know you?

411
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,766
<i>No.</i>

412
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:20,361
I'm confused, why are you calling?

413
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:23,698
- <i>What's this about?</i> - I know your husband, Duncan.

414
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,099
I'm calling, because...

415
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:27,871
he's holding my family hostage.

416
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:40,045
Look, I know this sounds impossible,

417
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:43,180
but, on the lives of my two kids, it is true, every word.

418
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:47,893
I don't believe you. Is this some sort of sick joke?

419
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:50,033
Look, my wife came to visit you the other day.

420
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,258
You thought she was an alternative doctor?

421
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,299
- That was your wife? - Yeah. Her name is Ellen Sanders.

422
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,477
She's operating on the President in three days. Look it up online if you have to.

423
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,675
So, you're telling me that the President is...

424
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,767
Your biological father, yeah.

425
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,998
And my husband,

426
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:17,285
- is holding your family hostage? - Yes! For the past two weeks.

427
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:21,304
Your husband has lost his mind. Innocent people are dying.

428
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:23,180
You have to stop him! Now!

429
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,615
What's making me crazy is the idea of losing you.

430
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:29,847
- Some things are just beyond our control. - There are other ways.

431
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,289
Other choices we can make.

432
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,536
- Is it legal? - It's a chance.

433
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,132
Our only chance.

434
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,944
I know you're sick, but I don't care!

435
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:44,223
If my family dies, it's on you! Not your father, not your husband,

436
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,091
you!

437
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:57,637
The hardest part about having a simple life, is being a spectator.

438
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:00,516
You wanna help, do something, but...

439
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,455
I can relate. My wife's in the hospital too.

440
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,685
She was in a car accident a few years ago.

441
00:33:09,794 --> 00:33:12,531
- She suffered some brain trauma. - I'm sorry to hear that.

442
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,555
You're right, though, about how tough it is.

443
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:19,134
Whether you like it or not, you, uh, you're helpless.

444
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:23,757
You just have to sit around and hope.

445
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,089
Easier said than done.

446
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:31,414
To getting through it.

447
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:43,527
Sorry, could you get that bartender's attention for me?

448
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,584
- No problem. Phil? - Yeah.

449
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:48,499
It's the same.

450
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:53,392
- Okay if I squeeze in here? - Be my guest.

451
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:57,320
I'm Nicole.

452
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,163
- Jack. - Jack.

453
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:04,877
I always liked that name. Never met a Jack who wasn't a decent guy.

454
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,660
Hello, Vanessa.

455
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:14,130
Lyn. Hello!

456
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,311
- Always a pleasure. - How are you holdin' up?

457
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:20,305
I'm okay.

458
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,415
- But... - What, what is it?

459
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,748
Come here.

460
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,508
I'm a little concerned about Colonel Blair.

461
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:34,095
It's probably nothing, but I heard he was meeting today with the Attorney General.

462
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,648
Well, I'm sure he had a reason.

463
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:39,843
You would think so, but when I spoke to him, he...

464
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,593
He lied.

465
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,034
He said he never left the office.

466
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,441
You don't think the Colonel's getting nervous and looking to cut a deal?

467
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:52,615
Well, either it's a coincidence or it's a problem,

468
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:57,303
and as I don't believe in the former, I'm gonna presume that it's the latter.

469
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:01,251
So, let me make a few calls.

470
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,613
See what's going on.

471
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,076
We split up about a year ago.

472
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:08,130
He was a nice guy, he was just selfish.

473
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,990
All he talked about was his job and his problems, I just...

474
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,583
- I felt like I was all alone. - Well, you have to talk,

475
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,694
laugh, connect. I mean, that's the whole point of being with someone, right?

476
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:19,804
Exactly!

477
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:24,302
I'm gonna get out of here. Good to meet you.

478
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:25,203
You too.

479
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,314
Well, are you sure this guy's hooking up tonight?

480
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,789
He should be heading out any minute.

481
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,523
Who is he?

482
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,466
Off-duty Secret Service agent.

483
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:47,522
- It's complicated. - Okay, fine.

484
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,055
Forget I asked.

485
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,628
So,

486
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:56,609
how's Nina doing? Any better?

487
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:02,443
- I think she's gonna pull through. - Really?

488
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:06,503
I'm thrilled. I, you know...

489
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:12,695
You know, to tell you the truth, uh, I was afraid to ask.

490
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:17,842
- I'm happy for you. - Thanks.

491
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:23,423
There he is.

492
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:27,793
Thanks for giving me a ride.

493
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:31,138
No problem, it's on my way. I live over on Capitol Hill.

494
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:36,243
Thank you.

495
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:57,044
Um, I'm sorry, but I'm married. I should've said something earlier.

496
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,931
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

497
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:07,609
I'm flattered but, uh, I can't. It's a long story.

498
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:16,192
- You're not attracted to me? - No! You're beautiful, trust me. Just...

499
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:18,730
I love my wife.

500
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:23,975
Well, that's really sweet.

501
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,706
I could still give you a ride home, there's no rule against that.

502
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:32,679
- Please step out of the vehicle. - What for?

503
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,011
Sir, please step out of the vehicle. DC Police.

504
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:38,385
- We were just talking, Officer. - Just keep your mouth shut.

505
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,907
You're facing solicitation charges, so just sit tight...

506
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:43,669
Whoa, whoa. Solicitation? Look, you got things mixed up, fella.

507
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:46,650
- He was just gonna give me a ride... - I'm not gonna ask you again.

508
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,610
Get out of the vehicle now!

509
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,906
Just relax, I'll handle this.

510
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:53,358
Listen, you don't have to raise your voice, okay?

511
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,123
Look, just let me explain, all right?

512
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:57,613
- You don't have to explain anything. - You're under arrest.

513
00:37:57,613 --> 00:38:01,572
- Look, tough guy. I'm just gonna show... - Whoa. Don't touch anything.

514
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,728
- I'm just gonna show you... - Keep your hand away from the gun.

515
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:30,572
Amelia just called. You don't have her phone, do you?

516
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:36,340
Yeah. I stole it.

517
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,021
Why?

518
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:43,514
Because, Dad said he needed a phone that couldn't be traced.

519
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:46,493
I think he has a plan to get us out of this.

520
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,547
A plan?

521
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:51,657
- I thought Mom told us to cooperate? - She did, but

522
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:55,502
I don't know what's going on with them. I think...

523
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,438
How was work?

524
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:04,167
I had a patient with a very complicated surgery.

525
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:05,906
Did he die?

526
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,700
No.

527
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,151
So, what about us? Do you and Dad have a plan, or?

528
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,590
We're gonna make sure you're safe.

529
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,395
Does that mean you've decided to kill the President?

530
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:32,991
I heard what happened.

531
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:35,751
Little more drama than I was expecting, but a win is a win.

532
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,768
An honest cop got shot. That's not a win.

533
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,923
I apologize,

534
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,717
but we accomplished what we set out to do, discredit Cahill.

535
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:49,340
There's no way he stays on the President's detail after this.

536
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,036
Dead cop, a career hooker in his front seat.

537
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:55,072
So, despite the loss of your colleague...

538
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:57,510
Friend. My friend.

539
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:02,900
Despite the loss of your friend, this was an operational victory.

540
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,292
We're back on track. Logan will be in charge of the detail.

541
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:13,174
We're in this together. You and me.

542
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,654
One more thing,

543
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:23,843
why do you have two of your people following a federal prosecutor named Steve Patterson?

544
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,334
How did you know that?

545
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:29,805
You forget? I'm with the NSA.

546
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:34,665
Steve Patterson is part of an ongoing FBI investigation,

547
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,584
we think he might be playing ball with a drug cartel.

548
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,833
Like you, I'm working two jobs right now.

549
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:43,661
So, I had to outsource my surveillance work to a few of my team members.

550
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:45,629
Good.

551
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,439
I thought you were getting cold feet.

552
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,451
My feet are just fine.

553
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:02,381
Archer?

554
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:07,261
Sandrine took the bait. She's working for the other side.

555
00:41:12,624 --> 00:41:14,362
A hero is strong.

556
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:17,738
A hero does things nobody else is brave enough to do.

557
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:22,586
A hero is a good person, who wants to make sure that people are safe and don't die.

558
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,664
That's why my dad is a hero.

559
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,209
Thank you, honey.

560
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:34,993
Thank you.

561
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:41,501
Just checked my voicemail, Nina called, several times.

562
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,009
She's been trying to reach you.

563
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:48,558
I told her everything.

564
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,364
She's the only one 

565
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:55,337
that can stop this madness.

566
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:00,500
No, she's not.

567
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:05,675
I can.

568
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,853
I was wrong.

569
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:14,226
I mean, I'm a doctor. What was I thinking?

570
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:19,040
I need to tell him I won't do it.

571
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:25,524
I am so sorry, Brian.

572
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:27,853
You were right.

573
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,488
I just,

574
00:42:34,815 --> 00:42:36,240
lost myself.

575
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,369
I love you.

576
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,277
What's wrong? Are you okay?

577
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:58,232
I talked to Brian Sanders.

578
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:02,977
He told me what's going on, what you've done to his family,

579
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:04,647
what you're planning.

580
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:08,095
Is it true?

581
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:15,715
