Taxi!

00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,980
能麻烦你载我去这里吗
Can you take me here, please?

3
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,020
对  查尔斯  不好意思
Right, Charles, sorry about that.

4
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,790
我给你讲讲我们的进展
OK, let me fill you in on where we are.

5
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,380
我们在行李箱里装了可卡因
We had the cocaine in a holdall.

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,960
然后到了停车场
We moved into the car park

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,970
看见斯科特先生拿着杆双管猎枪
where we saw our friend Mr Scott walking out

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,200
从他的车后面走出来
from behind his van holding a double-barrelled shotgun.

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,180
好  听着  大概一个小时以后见
OK, listen, see you in about an hour.

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,810
好好  再见
OK. OK, bye.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,430
不好意思  我是律师
Sorry about that. I'm a lawyer.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
真的
Honestly.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,540
这是杰米的爸爸伯顿先生
Jamie's dad, Mr Burton,

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,700
他今天来给大家讲讲他的工作
has come in today to talk about what he does at work.

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,550
-嗨  -你们知道律师干什么吗  杰米
- Hi. - Do any of you know what a barrister does? Yes, Jamie?

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,800
-他让人不用坐牢  -怎么做到的呢
- He stops people from going to prison. - And how does he do that?

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,410
他告诉法庭这个人没罪
He tells a court that someone didn't do a crime.

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,080
有时候证据不足
And sometimes the evidence doesn't cut it.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,650
然后他说好了放假回来却不能回来
And sometimes that means he can't come on holiday like he promised.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,450
其实我大部分时间都在庭上对法官讲话
Actually, my job is mostly standing up and talking to a judge in court.

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,350
你都说些什么
What do you talk about?

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,350
如果有人说看见你偷了同学的笔
If someone said they saw you take your classmate's pen,

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,860
而你说你没偷
and you said you didn't take it,

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,730
我的职责就是证明目击者看错了
my job would be to show that whoever saw you was mistaken.

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,160
要是我真的偷了笔呢
What happens if I did take the pen anyway?

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,540
那你就有罪
Well, then you'd be guilty.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,700
对  但如果我说我没偷
Yeah, but what if I said I didn't take it,

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,130
而看见我偷的人眼神又不好呢
and the person who saw me has bad eyesight,

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,950
而你嘴皮子很厉害
and you're so good at arguing

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,070
他们也不能确定是我偷了呢
they can't be sure it was me who took it?

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,160
这样啊  那就叫合理怀疑
Ah! Well, then, that's what you call a reasonable doubt.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,810
那我能把笔留着了
So I get to keep the pen?

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,000
对  那是你侥幸脱罪
Yes, but then you'd be getting away with it.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,330
如果你爸爸站我这边的话
Only if your dad was on my side.

又是她
Again?

41
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,940
她居然上电视之余还能接手案子
Surprised she could squeeze in a case between TV appearances.

42
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,100
看来是我的荣幸
Suppose I'm flattered.

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,070

It's like a derby match with you. They should sell tickets.

44

库马因先生手边就这把刀
It was the only object Mr Kumarin had to hand.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,020
猎刀不是防卫性武器
A hunting knife is not a defensive weapon!

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,480
听名字就知道
The clue is in the name.

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,450
-加德纳女士  -抱歉  法官阁下
- Miss Gardner. - I apologise, My Lord.

48
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,860
即将受到袭击的人不需许可即能自卫
A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for permission.

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,320
法律明文规定  适当情况下
The law tells us that in the right circumstances,

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,140
先发制人保护自己是完全合乎情理的
a pre-emptive strike is entirely justified.

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,200
在此案中  有人用上膛的猎枪指着他的脑袋
In this case, a loaded shotgun aimed squarely at his head!

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,220
多亏斯科特先生准头太差
We only have Mr Scott's appalling aim to thank

53
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,680
库马因先生今天才能坐在这里
that Mr Kumarin is sitting here today

你得先按下按钮吧
I think you'll find you have to press the button first.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,500
我按了  就是按下去这个动作
I did press it. I used a pressing motion.

136
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,190
现在好了
There now.

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,060
-我刚刚就是这么做的  -行吧
- I just did that. - OK.

138
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,190
谢谢你的支持  太感谢了
Thanks for your support. Really appreciate it.

139
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,060
好了  出发啦
Come on, we're going.

140
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,540
等等
Hang on.

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,320
把你的包从后座拿下来  好吗
Get your bags off the back seat. OK?

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,320
-本  -你们好啊
- Hey, Ben. - All right.

143
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,880
你是洗泡泡浴的花衣魔笛手
You're the Pied Piper of bubble baths.

144
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,880
{\an8}花衣魔笛手  德国童话中的人物

145
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,330
这里也许还能挤进来一个高大的苏格兰人
You know, there might be room in here for a large Scotsman.

146
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,090
-我还有点事  -随便你吧
- I've got to catch up on something. - Oh, well, suit yourself.

147
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,680
可惜了这儿朦胧的烛光
It's all candles and twilight in here though.

148
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,430
是你的损失哦
Your loss.

149
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,380
别打呼了
Stop snoring.

150
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,130
抱歉  害你睡不着吗
Sorry, am I keeping you up?

151
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,830
真幽默
Funny guy.

152
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,280
杰米说你昨天在学校帅呆了
You were quite the hit at school yesterday. So Jamie said.

153
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
他们貌似挺喜欢
They seemed to enjoy it.

154
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,650
他的小伙伴们都想让你做他们的律师了
All his wee pals want you to be their lawyer now.

155
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,970
知道有你撑腰  他们都要有恃无恐
They're all going to go out and commit GBH safe

156
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,900
去犯重罪了
in the knowledge you'll get them off.

157
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,630
还真让人宽心啊
Well, that's very reassuring.

158
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,810
可他们不知道你的大脑里满是洞洞
Little do they know that that large brain of yours is full of holes.

159
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,450
你的硬盘满了
Your hard drive's full.

160
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,940
-这就是你的问题  -我明白了
- That's your problem. - I see.

161
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,750
你需要时不时做个备份
You just need to back it up now and again.

162
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,390
要怎么做呢
How do I do that?

163
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,760
你身上又暖又舒服
You're so nice and warm.

164
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,890
希姆金斯先生  为什么选我去打官司
Mr Simkins, why did you choose me to lead this?

165
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,440
而不选皇家律师呢
I mean, why me, over a silk?

166
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,430
因为我见过太多皇家律师潇洒地接手
Because I've seen too many silks who try and waltz in

167
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,440
草率地应对一桩案子
and blunderbuss their way through a case

168
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,050
他们只在出庭的路上瞥一眼而已
they've only glanced at on the way to the court.

169
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,240
因为像这样的案子  我想要
Because in a case like this I want someone

170
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,950
一个整天埋头研究证据的人
who spends days elbows deep in the evidence.

171
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,380
因为我的委托人如今正站在一块石头
Because my client stands between a rock

172
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,450
和一大坨屎中间
and a bucket of shit

173
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,530
他需要尽可能多的帮助
and he needs all the help he can get.

174
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,700
还有呢
And?

175
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
-说实话  -是的
- Honestly? - Yeah.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,740
因为你总能赢
Because you win.

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
你现在睡这里了吗  伯顿先生
Are you sleeping here now, Mr Burton?

178
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,450
-现在什么时候了  -周二
- What time is it? - Tuesday.

179
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,430
我爱上卡洛斯·特维斯了[阿根廷球员]
I think I fancy Carlos Tevez.

180
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,970
他是队长
For captain.

181
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,110
你看过这些照片吗
Did you look at these pictures?

182
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,760
以前见过这样的情况吗
You ever seen anything like it? Before?

183
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,890
我从没见过
I've never.

184
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,990
大多时候她都没断气
She was alive for most of it, you know?

185
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,330
活着呢
She was alive.

186
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,340
我们步行穿过公园
"We were walking through the park,

187
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,730
听着iPod里面的音乐
and listening to music on our iPod.

188
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,320
回家以后才发现鞋底有血迹
We did not notice the blood on our shoes until we got home."

189
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,500
我们没注意走过了哪些地方
Because we'd not been paying much attention to where we'd been walking,

190
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
我们走到了
and because our walk had taken us through

191
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,660
灌木深处  以及很深的草丛中
areas of deeper undergrowth and high grasses.

192
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,150
第一眼看到这血  我们以为
When we first saw the blood we presumed

193
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,930
误踩了动物尸体
we had stepped in the remains of an animal."

194
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,990
-比方说  一只松鼠  -没错
- A squirrel, for example? - Yes.

195
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,230
知道吗  灰松鼠正在杀红松鼠
Did you know the grey squirrels are killing all the red squirrels?

196
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,030
-有耳闻  -可他们最近又发现一种黑松鼠
- I did, yes. - But now they've discovered a black squirrel.

197
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
-福伊尔先生  -它们又在杀灰松鼠
- Mr Foyle. - And that's killing all the greys.

198
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,210
早晚会知道  小心没大错
Goes to show, you can't be too careful.

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,980
福伊尔先生  可以开始了吗
Mr Foyle. Can we please get on?

200
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,190
福伊尔先生  你通常哪天去洗衣房洗衣
What day do you take your laundry to be service washed, Mr Foyle?

201
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,800
-周二是洗衣日  -能不能解释
- Tuesday's wash day. - Can you explain why,

202
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,990
数月来一直周二洗衣的你
after months of Tuesdays,

203
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,080
为何突然周一去洗衣
you took your washing in on a Monday?

204
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,270
裤子不够穿了  不是吗
We'd run out of pants, hadn't we?

205
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,710
因为没有干净衣服可穿
We took our laundry to be washed a day early

206
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,450
所以提前一天去洗
because we'd run out of clothing.

207
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,010
-是的  -鞋子上的血迹让你更加迫切地
- Correct. - The fact we found blood on our shoes after our walk

208
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,490
-想要提前去洗衣  -事实如此
- increased our desire to do our washing early. - That's the truth.

209
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,550
你的鞋子一般都用洗衣机洗吗
Do you normally wash your shoes in the washing machine?

210
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,260
沾了血的话就用
I do if they have blood on them.

211
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,880
好
Right.

212
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,710
我们必须要谈一下网站的事情
We're going to have to talk about the websites.

213
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,180
对方会试图指控
The other side are going to try to claim

214
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,920
你习惯性地浏览通常被称为
you habitually view images and video

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,670
"极端色情"的图片和视频
that are commonly referred to as "extreme pornography",

216
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,980
"极端色情"包含
an umbrellaterm for filmed acts

217
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,000
危及或状似危及人身生命
which threaten, or appear to threaten, a person's life,

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
造成参与者严重伤害
result in serious injury to participants

219
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,400
或者有殴打  啃噬
or appear to involve torture, biting,

220
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,980
针对人类尸体的性行为等内容
sexual interference with a human corpse.

221
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,180
这与被害者遭受的伤害
And that this has a link to the nature of the injuries

222
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,700
构成一定的联系
sustained by the victim.

223
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,900
我不做那种事情
I don't do that kind of thing.

224
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,880
很遗憾  你的信用卡记录显示的恰恰相反
Unfortunately, your credit card statements tell a different story.

225
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,220
你在数家网站都有消费记录
They show payments to a number of websites,

226
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,360
这些网站被曝光含有
which have been revealed to distribute this...

227
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
这种类型的内容
this kind of material.

228
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,590
信用卡撒谎
The credit cards are lying.

229
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,400
好吧
Right.

230
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,580
我必须告诉你  福伊尔先生  形势很严峻
I have to tell you, Mr Foyle, already this is a huge challenge.

231
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,520
你陈述的方式需要仔细琢磨
We're going to have to work on your presentation style.

232
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
你所见都是事实
What you see is what you get.

233
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,070
没错  现在这正是问题所在  不是吗
Yes, well, that's part of the problem, isn't it?

234
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,100
-他一定要在这里吗  -是的  必须
- Does he have to be here? - Yes, he does. Yeah.

235
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,690
是这样的  伯顿先生
Here's the thing, Mr Burton,

236
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,030
不知道你有没有注意到
and I don't know whether you've picked it up

237
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,660
或者你的第六感有没有发觉
or perhaps your sixth sense might have spotted it.

238
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,560
我不是特别喜欢人
I don't like people very much.

239
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,900
我就不是那么和善的一个
I'm just not a very nice person.

240
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,120
-我不是来评判你的  -对  归红衣服做
- I'm not here to judge you. - No, the man in red does that.

241
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,110
我来是为你辩护  尽我所能陈述你的案件
I'm here to defend you and present your case as best as I can.

242
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,960
-为此...  -你认为是我做的  对吧
- In order to do that... - You think I did it, don't you?

243
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,160
这就是问题所在
That's the problem here.

244
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,320
我没这么说
It's not what I was saying.

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,970
你认为我对那可怜的女人做了那些可怕的事
You think I did all those awfulthings to that poor woman.

246
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,140
-福伊尔先生  请听我说  -我想我不会
- Mr. Foyle, please listen to me. - I don't think I will.

247
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,300
福伊尔先生
Mr Foyle.

248
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,630
我要他出去
I want him gone.

249
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,120
他是你的事务律师
He's your solicitor.

250
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,970
出去
Gone.

251
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,210
他让我紧张
He was making me nervous.

252
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,570
要休息一下吗
Do you want to take a minute?

253
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,570
瞪着我
Staring at me.

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,770
-福伊尔先生  -看着我的眼睛
- Mr Foyle. - Look me in the eye.

255
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,180
可以继续了吗
Shall we get on?

256
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,840
要不要来杯热茶
How about a nice cup of tea?

257
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,920
福伊尔先生  我是你的辩护律师
Mr Foyle, I'm your defence barrister.

258
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,170
如果你以任何形式私下向我承认有罪
If you privately confessed your guilt to me in any way

259
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,610
但公开坚称无罪
but publicly maintained your innocence,

260
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,500
我马上跟着希姆金斯先生出去
I'd be following Mr Simkins there,

261
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,120
并且离开时鼓励你承认有罪
and I would have encouraged you as I left to enter a guilty plea.

262
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,300
我没有罪
I'm not guilty.

263
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
那么我们可以开始了
Then this is where we are.

264
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,820
你干得很不错
Well, good job you're here then.

265
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,210
-令人振奋  -但愿如此
- Refreshing. - Let's hope so.

266
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,710
你做事的方式
Your manners.

267
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,950
-倒满  -一点点就好
- Full? - Just a splash.

268
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,950
知道吗  说来有趣
You know, it's funny.

269
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,710
和你相处越久
The more time we spend together,

270
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,140
就越觉得我们相似
the more you remind me of me.

271
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,190
好吧
Right.

272
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,460
-伯顿先生  -等一下
- Mr Burton? - Give me a minute.

273
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,270
-你没事吧  -只是需要透透气
- Are you all right? - I just need some air.

274
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,870
-麻烦给我一包万宝路  -好
- Can I have 20 Marlboro Lights, please? - Yep.

275
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,660
-有的话再来一只打火机  -有
- And a lighter if you have got one. - Sure.

276
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,090
她来了  哈洛街57号升起的新星
Ah, here she is, the rising star at 57 Harlow Street.

277
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,440
玛吉  我知道我应该无条件支持你
Now then, Maggie, I know I should really be rooting for you

278
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
可是你该明白
without exception, but you should know

279
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,910
第二也没什么丢人的  你看巴兹·奥尔德林
there is no ignominy in coming second. Just ask Buzz Aldrin.

280
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,080
我要求重新计票
Well, I demand a recount.

281
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,520
-仿佛回到了律师学院辩论决赛  -是吗
- Takes me back to Middle Temple Moot Finals. - Really?

282
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,030
是的  你和我  几乎一模一样
Yeah, you and me. Almost an exact replay.

283
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,630
那是很久以前的事情了
It was a long time ago.

284
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,350
听说利亚姆·福伊尔的案子是你对我们朱利安
I heard you're up against our boy Julian on this Liam Foyle malarkey.

285
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,290
-是吗  我们的朱利安  -是  很意外
- Is that so? Our boy? - Yes. Surprised it's not

286
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,070
对手竟然不是你  还真有点不习惯
you on the other side. Seem to be making a habit out of it.

287
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,860
我这不是给你机会挑战下别人吗
Thought I'd give you a go against someone else for a change.

288
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,840
-差不多了吧  -不嫌多
- Had enough, eh? - Never.

289
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,400
我在想是不是多做做辩护
I am just thinking of transitioning into more defence work.

290
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,570
-失陪了  -好的
- Excuse me. - Sure.

291
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
福伊尔这个案子对我来说太"犹大"了
Anyway, this Foyle case is a little too St Jude for my liking.

292
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,300
他是败局的守护神
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

293
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,660
是吗  我还不知道
Oh, I didn't know that.

294
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,880
好吧
Right, well,

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,500
-我再去找点酒来  -好的  谢谢
- I'll go and get us some more rubbing alcohol. - Great, thank you.

296
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,470
我是认真的  我看过案情摘要
I'm serious. I've seen the brief.

297
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,060
-你为什么接这个案子  -我是律师
- Why are you doing? - I'm practising law.

298
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,130
拜托  这根本是收拾不干净的烂摊子
Oh, come on. It's almost a no-questions jobbie.

299
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,150
你就是想增加曝光度吧
It might be exposure for all the wrong reasons.

300
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,520
我才不是为了曝光度  玛吉
I don't do things for exposure, Maggie.

301
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,780
那为什么接
Why do you do it?

302
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,260
因为每个人都有权申辩
Because everyone deserves a defence.

303
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,170
吹蜡烛吧
There you go.

304
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,950
-许愿吧  -老妈不要再烦我了  -没错
- Make a wish. - I wish my mum would stop annoying me. - Yes.

305
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,790
-谁要吃蛋糕  -我
- Who wants a piece of cake? - Me!

306
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,310
-真的吗  -要吃  要吃
- Are you sure? - Yes! Yes! Yes!

307
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,180
好吧  你是说还要继续调查吗
OK, so you're saying there's more to find?

308
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,060
好的  能把一切都记录在案吗
Yeah. And would you go on record with that?

309
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,770
很好  好的  明天我让事务所的人联系你
Great. Great, OK. Someone from my office will call you tomorrow

310
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,160
我们约个时间
and set up an appointment.

311
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,860
谢谢  明天见  再见
Thanks. Thank you. Speak soon. Bye-bye.

312
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,350
-他是谁  -懂电脑的聪明人
- Who was that? - That's a clever man who knows about computers.

313
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,250
帮你备份大脑吗
Is he going to back up your brain?

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
不是  工作上的事
No, it was for my work.

315
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,520
-他能帮你胜诉吗  -但愿吧
- Will he help you win the case? - I hope so.

316
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,590
他们来了
Oh, here they come.

317
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,390
-凯特和孩子都好吗  -很好  谢谢
- How's Kate and the family? - Very well, thank you.

318
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,310
玛吉今天应该会来旁听
I think Maggie's in the gallery today.

319
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,460
-为什么  -掂量掂量对手的能耐吧
- Why's she doing that? - Checking out the competition I expect.

320
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,100
当第一名就要有觉悟  威尔
That's the trouble with being number one, Will.

321
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,010
人人都想把你拉下马来
Everyone wants to knock you off your perch.

322
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,120
我听说你上周申请了延期审理
Now I heard you asked for an adjournment last week.

323
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,910
-是的  -遇到麻烦了吗
- I did indeed. - Trouble at mill?

324
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,880
也不是  就是需要更多时间
Not really. Just needed more time.

325
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,350
怕是没时间了  咱们都来了
Well, here we are, I'm afraid.

326
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,060
没错  都来了
Here we are indeed.

327
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,560
我真是喜欢你铁面无私的表情  老兄
I must say, I do like your game face, old boy.

328
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,470
还没到那个时候呢  兄弟
You haven't seen it yet, old boy.

329
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,460
有的罪行恶劣到无以言述
Some crimes defy description.

330
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,470
那是对文明一词的玷污
They debase our so-called civilisation

331
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,350
公然挑衅人性的底线
and defy every boundary of humanity left to us.

332
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,340
杀害桑德拉·马林斯的人
Now the person who took the life of Sandra Mullins

333
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,250
只能被称作卑劣的施虐狂
can only be described as a malignant sadist,

334
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,110
他这种行径是蓄意伤害  恐吓
who did so with the intent to traumatise, to terrorise,

335
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,370
给予受害者非人的痛苦与折磨
and to inflict the maximum amount of pain and suffering.

336
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,590
控方力在证明  毫无疑问
And we intend to prove, without doubt,

337
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,590
这个人就是利亚姆·福伊尔
that that person was Liam Foyle.

338
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,560
脖子周围有严重的瘀伤
Severe bruising around her neck,

339
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,120
甲状软骨和舌骨严重骨折
her thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone were badly fractured.

340
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,910
死因是勒杀
Cause of death was strangulation.

341
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,520
另外还有性侵犯
Other injuries were sexual in nature,

342
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,460
体内体外均造成伤害
internal and external,

343
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,000
未发现双眼眼球
both eyes were missing,

344
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,240
是在死前或者更早时被强行取出的
removed with force close to the time of death, possibly before.

345
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,100
公园的植被覆盖到了东北角
The park gets overgrown towards the north eastern corner.

346
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,310
有很深的草丛  山楂  薰衣草和荨麻
Long grass, hawthorn, lavender, nettle beds.

347
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,760
你早上经过时发现了什么异样吗
And did you see anything unusual on your morning route?

348
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,420
我看到一个男人
I saw a man.

349
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,630
原本躺着  后来起身了
Getting up from a lying position.

350
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,530
休斯先生  依你的职业素养
Mr Hughes, in your professional capacity,

351
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,300
你能确认面前的这份信用卡交易记录
can you please confirm the credit card statements before you

352
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,370
准确说明了这些交易是由你的银行
are an accurate reflection of payments made by your bank

353
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,670
代表账户所有者利亚姆·福伊尔先生做的吗
on behalf of the account holder, Mr Liam Foyle?

354
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,690
是的
Yes.

355
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,390
此卡的这些交易
And these payments were made by the card

356
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,860
都是在今年前三个月进行的  对吗
over the first three months of this year, is that correct?

357
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,500
对
Yes.

358
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,010
并且都是网上在线
And they were all made online to companies

359
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,680
与亚洲和欧洲的公司交易
across Asia and Europe,

360
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,570
这些公司都传播和制作相同的产品
all of which distribute and produce the same... product,

361
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,770
也就是淫秽作品  对吧
namely pornography, is that correct?

362
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,790
据我们所知是这样的
Yes, that is our understanding.

363
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
休斯先生  大部分网站
Mr Hughes, many of these sites,

364
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,450
我们为了进行调查
and I'm afraid we have had to visit them

365
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,600
必须对其进行访问
in the course of this investigation,

366
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,270
发现它们都含有极度恶劣的行为
have shown acts of extreme depravity

367
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,650
根据我们对法医报告的研究
which, we understand from the forensic reports,

368
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,580
发现其与桑德拉·马林斯被谋杀前
show disturbingly accurate similarities to the injuries

369
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,410
所受的伤害惊人的一致
that befell Sandra Mullins before she was murdered.

370
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,020
这里我特指身上的咬痕
I talk specifically in relation to the bite marks

371
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,400
-还有对生殖器的损毁  -胡说
- and the mutilation of genitalia. - Liar!

372
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,400
福伊尔先生  我只给你这一次机会
Mr Foyle! You have one chance with me, and that was it.

373
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,380
再违反秩序就算作藐视法庭
Any more from you and I shall hold you in contempt.

374
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,870
-杀人犯  -请安静
- Murderer! - Silence, please!

375
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,160
休斯先生  请回答问题
Mr Hughes, please answer the question.

376
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,660
没错  是这张信用卡
Yes, it is the same card.

377
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,210
谢谢  没有要问的了  法官大人
Thank you. No further questions, my Lord.

伯顿先生
Mr Burton?

380
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,570
法官阁下  在庭审之前
My Lord, before this trial began

381
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,040
我提交过延期审理的书面申请
I made a written application for an adjournment.

382
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,790
鉴于现在缺少专家证词
I'm asking you now to reconsider that

383
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,660
我希望您能重新考虑下那份申请
application in the light of the gravity of the expert testimony.

384
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,880
-拜托  -伯顿先生
- Oh, come on. - Mr. Burton.

385
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,490
你的请求非常不合时宜
This is most inappropriate.

386
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,390
我认为这期间能发现更多关键证据
I submit an adjournment will bring vital evidence to light.

387
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,030
双方都可以让专家参与
Let both sides have their expert,

388
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,090
再由陪审团做最终判断
and let the jury decide.

389
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,380
伯顿先生
Mr Burton,

390
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,370
公众对这起案件极为关注
there is huge public interest in having

391
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,760
希望能尽快进行审判
this case heard as soon as possible.

392
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,050
你的专家
The fact your expert

393
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,100
未能完成查验证据的工作
has not mustered himself to the task at hand

394
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,350
本庭对此并不关心
is neither here nor there.

395
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,350
不是他效率低
He's not slow,

396
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,320
他正在收集可能的新证据
it's that he's gathering potentially new evidence.

397
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,450
那是同一台电脑
It's the same computer.

398
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,540
双方请的都是电脑取证的专家
Both of your experts are computer forensic specialists.

399
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,600
我不认为两个训练有素的人
I can hardly see how two trained men

400
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,030
检查同一台电脑
looking at the same equipment

401
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,410
会得出截然不同的结论
could produce so radically different conclusions

402
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,980
并对审判结果产生影响
that it would make a difference.

403
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,080
恐怕这是不可能的
I'm afraid it simply isn't on.

404
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
如果法官阁下能再仔细考虑...
I think if My Lord could look a little closer...

405
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,700
你的申请被拒了  这个决定不会更改
Your application was refused and it shall stay refused.

406
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,150
我不会因藐视法庭而处罚你
I will decline from pursuing you on contempt

407
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,060
但这是给你的最后一次警告
but let this be your last and final warning.

408
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
现在是午餐时间  暂时休庭
We'll break for lunch now.

409
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,330
木已成舟  伯顿先生
But the train is on the tracks, Mr Burton.

410
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,650
为了你的委托人着想
And for the sake of your client

411
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,830
你还是随机应变为好
I suggest you deal with it.

412
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,580
-明白  法官阁下  -起立
- My Lord. - All rise.

413
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,480
威尔
Will?

414
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,530
你要睡会儿觉
You should try and sleep.

415
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,310
-我没事  -我说真的
 - I'm fine. - I mean it.

416
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,630
你认为自己战无不胜  但其实不是这样
You think you're invincible, and you're not.

417
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,550
我们应该给这些窗户换锁
We should get new locks on these windows.

418
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,950
你听到我的话了吗
Were you even listening to me?

419
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,960
换成带钥匙的框架锁
Frame locks, with keys.

420
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,060
我的天  接下来的两个月
Oh, God. You're going to drive me crazy

421
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,080
你是要把我逼疯吗
for the next two months now, aren't you?

422
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,020
我的一位同事刚为一个十二岁男孩辩护
A colleague of mine just defended a 12-year-old boy

423
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,240
他把下水道清洗剂
who poured drain cleaner

424
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,770
灌进了好朋友的喉咙
down the throat of his best mate

425
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,330
就因为他朋友不让他用自己的手机玩游戏
because he wouldn't let him play a game on his phone.

426
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,120
什么世道
The world is broken.

427
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,630
你不该在睡觉前看恐怖电影的
You shouldn't watch scary movies so close to bedtime.

428
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,980
是啊
Yeah.

429
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,900
你的表现可没给我什么信心  威尔
Not inspiring much confidence up there, Will.

430
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,920
我知道我在做什么  福伊尔先生
I know what I'm doing, Mr. Foyle.

431
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,730
我在那儿可没看到
Not from where I'm sitting.

432
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,050
-那就解雇我  -为什么我要那么做
- So sack me. - Why would I want to do that?

433
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,560
你说呢
You tell me.

434
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,900
只要我受雇于你  就为你工作
I work for you as long as you'll have me.

435
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,100
我道歉  威尔  我知道你在尽力帮我
I apologise, Will. I know you've got my back.

436
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,320
很感谢你对我坦诚相待
I appreciate your honesty very much.

437
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,890
我们继续吧
Shall we get on?

438
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,440
-你只有一台电脑  对吗  -没错
- You only have one computer, is that correct? - Yes.

439
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,700
但我不明白这与那女人的遭遇
But I don't see what that's got to do with

440
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,550
有什么关系
what happened to that woman.

441
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,430
你会明白的
You will.

442
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,840
必须有人为桑德拉·马林斯的死付出代价
Someone must pay for what happened to Sandra Mullins.

443
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,400
我们面临的是人性危机
Our very humanity is at stake,

444
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,390
正如我这位渊博的同行所说
as my learned friend has indicated.

445
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,890
如果利亚姆·福伊尔有罪的话
It would be convenient for everyone here today

446
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,980
对今天在座的人而言是顺理成章的
if Liam Foyle was guilty.

447
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,010
戴上手铐后  他将永不能翻身
The cuffs go on and he's gone forever.

448
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,180
看上去似乎是铁证如山
The evidence seems overwhelming.

449
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,270
但事实并非如此
But it is not.

450
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,530
可能福伊尔先生并不招人喜欢
We may dislike Mr. Foyle.

451
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,560
如果我们看到他走过来  可能都要绕道走
We might cross the street if we saw him coming.

452
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,100
但为他辩护并不需要喜欢他
But we do not have to like him to defend him.

453
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,700
因为这里并不是比人气
Because this is not a popularity contest,

454
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,690
也不是搞政治迫害
this is not a witch-hunt,

455
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,670
这里是法庭
this is a court of law,

456
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,920
在这个国度  当你被指控犯罪时
and in this country, when you're accused of a crime

457
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,390
在最终被证明有罪前  都假定你是无辜的
you are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.

458
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,810
毫无疑问  我这位渊博的同行
And make no mistake, not a shred of what you've heard from

459
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,590
为检方说的每一句话
my learned friend acting for the Prosecution

460
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,410
都是无凭无据的
has given any proof at all.

461
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,760
所展示的是不可靠的证人证词
I will show you unreliable witnesses,

462
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,520
懒惰无能的法医鉴定
lazy forensic science,

463
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,600
以及情感诉求  而不是事实真相
emotional appeals instead of factual accuracies.

464
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,270
就是如此  还妄自断言我的委托人
Oh, yes, and the casual assertion that my client is

465
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,370
是极端色情片的消费者
a consumer of extreme pornography.

466
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,940
首先  我们来谈谈这一点
First, I think, we will talk about that.

467
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,010
我的专业是电脑取证和数据分析
I am an expert in forensic computer data analysis.

468
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,860
克罗博士  你检查过福伊尔先生的
Dr. Crowe, have you had a chance to examine the hard drive of

469
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,900
电脑硬盘吗
the computer belonging to Mr. Foyle?

470
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,010
检查过
Yes, I have.

471
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,500
你是按照这起案件的
And you did this instructed by

472
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,340
检察官的指示去做的  对吗
the Prosecution in this case, is that correct?

473
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,370
是的
Yes.

474
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,380
遗憾的是  为辩方
And unfortunately Dr. Weeks, the gentleman

475
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,510
检查电脑的威克斯博士
who has helped examine the computer for the Defence

476
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,830
还没能完成他的工作
has not yet finished his work.

477
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,220
不过他把到目前为止的记录给了我
However, he has passed me his notes to date

478
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,710
我想就此对你提几个问题
and I'd like to ask you questions about them.

479
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,170
不论你使用电脑上过什么网站
Wherever you go on the internet, using a computer,

480
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,280
都会留下痕迹
you leave footprints.

481
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,830
-对吗  -没错
- Is that correct? - Yes, it is.

482
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,790
即便把文件删除了
Even if you've deleted a file,

483
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,210
像你这样的专家还是能找出痕迹
someone like you is able to see it.

484
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,560
-通常是如此  -你到底想问什么
- Most of the time. - Where is this going?

485
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,450
在我的专家缺席的情况下  法官阁下
And in the absence of my own expert, My Lord,

486
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,570
我这位渊博的同行友好地
my learned friend has kindly

487
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,230
提供检方的专家来参与审理此案
tendered the Prosecution expert on this matter.

488
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,470
我请求跟他探讨一下这一点
I beg some time to explore this point with him.

489
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,550
好吧
Very well.

490
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:46,200
我渊博的同行断言我的委托人
My learned friend alleges that my client paid for and viewed,

491
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,680
经常购买和观看
on a regular basis,

492
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,720
大量不堪入目的图片  包括
numerous depraved and abusive images, including...

493
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,020
"折磨  损毁  勒杀和奸尸的行为"
"Acts of torture, mutilation, strangulation, and necrophilia."

494
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,930
在你对他的电脑的分析中
Um, in your analysis of his computer,

495
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,590
你有否证实福伊尔先生
did you establish that Mr Foyle

496
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,730
确实访问过那些图片
had actually visited any of those websites that

497
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,230
所属的网站吗
pertained to those images?

498
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,170
-没有  但他的信用卡账单  -谢谢
- No, but his credit card bills... - Thank you.

499
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,130
我渊博的同行声称我的委托人用信用卡
And my learned friend asserted that my client paid for access

500
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,480
购买了那些网站的访问权限
to many of those websites with his credit card.

501
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,300
那么
Now,

502
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,700
如果他没有访问这些网站  为什么要付钱呢
why would he pay for them if he didn't actually visit them?

503
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,650
这话说起来不中听
It may sound reprehensible

504
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,550
但他付的钱没有得到回报  不是吗
but he's not getting his money's worth, is he?

505
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,790
如果他不访问那些网站
How did he pay for access

506
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,030
那又是如何购买权限的呢
to those sites without actually visiting them?

507
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,390
在他的上网记录中  他向许多色情网站
Many porn sites were on his internet history

508
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,550
提供了信用卡的信息
to which he submitted his credit card details.

509
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,640
这样他就能得到一个解锁其他内容的密码
That's how he received a password to unlock other content elsewhere.

510
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,750
他的信用卡信息有没有可能是伪造的呢
Is it possible that his card details were falsified at that point?

511
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,240
你是什么意思
How do you mean?

512
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
就是当他向成人网站提供信息时
That when he submitted his details to the adult site,

513
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,000
它们被
they were taken

514
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,250
未知的第三方盗取和利用
and used by unknown third parties

515
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,250
并用来购买和解锁你所说的"其他内容"
to pay for and unlock this "other content" as you call it.

516
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,700
-有那种可能吗  -我觉得有吧  有
- Is that possible? - I suppose so, yes.

517
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,860
考虑到这种可能性  如果我们能证明
So given this possibility, if we were to prove, in this court,

518
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,170
真的发生了信息伪造  那福伊尔先生
that such falsification occurred, would Mr Foyle be shown to be,

519
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,160
是不是就成了身份欺诈的受害者
in fact, a victim of identity fraud?

520
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,730
这不是有关极端色情的庭审
This is not a trial about extreme pornography,

521
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,410
而是审理令人发指的谋杀...
this is about the horrific murder...

522
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,450
我们的专家本来在证实其中的联系
Our expert was in the process of proving this link.

523
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,890
因此我们所提出的延期申请被驳回了
Hence our application for an adjournment, which was refused.

524
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,460
我渊博的同行提出了一系列
My learned friend brought these hideous

525
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,960
耸人听闻的主张  而我再次申请延期
allegations to bear on this case and I reiterate my request.

526
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,240
专家证词对双方都有影响
The expert testimony cuts both ways.

527
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,070
庭警  请带陪审团离开
Usher, please excuse the jury.

528
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,420
刚刚出现了程序问题
A matter of procedure has just arisen,

529
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,890
我需要跟两方都谈一谈
I need to talk to both sides about it.

530
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,390
我们很快就会叫你们回来
We will call you back presently.

531
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,970
去我的办公室
My room, I think.

532
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,840
法官
Judge.

533
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,230
我的委托人被皇家检察院
My client has been falsely

534
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,510
错误地戴上了极端色情爱好者的帽子
branded an extreme porn enthusiast by the Crown,

535
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,230
此事已经泄露到网络社交媒体上
this has now leaked online to social media,

536
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,820
平面媒体也趁势加以报道
where it's been duly picked up by the print media,

537
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,780
给我的委托人贴上了
which has now tainted my client

538
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,140
虐待狂  变态和恋尸癖的标签
with the label torturer, pervert, necrophiliac,

539
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,860
所以这个陪审团必须解散
so much so this jury must be discharged

540
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,330
重新召集  即使有报道限制
and a new jury called. Even with the reporting restrictions,

541
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,010
考虑到本案已经产生的新闻
given the press this case has already generated,

542
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,510
福伊尔先生也得不到公正的审判
Mr Foyle cannot be given a fair trial.

543
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
-我申请停止起诉  -太荒唐了
- The inevitable application is to stay the indictment. - This is absurd.

544
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,490
我此时请求是恰当的
I made the request in good time.

545
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,540
-是  我知道  -陪审团对被告的偏见
- Yes, I know. - The prejudice to the accused

546
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,350
在我看来是永久性的
in the eyes of this jury is, in my view, permanent.

547
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,610
我虽不情愿  但这种情况下除了批准申请
Reluctantly, I feel that I have little option in these circumstances

548
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,460
-我别无选择  -法官  拜托
- but to accede to your application. - Judge, please.

549
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,250
我没有办法  朱利安
I ballsed up, Julian.

550
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,350
抱歉  我们去结束这件事吧
I'm sorry. Let's get this over with.

551
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,450
所以  最终结果是  我别无选择
And so, as a result, I have no alternative

552
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,070
只能解散陪审团并释放被告
but to discharge the jury and release the defendant.

553
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,370
全体起立
All rise.

554
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,950
你应该感到羞愧
You should be ashamed of yourself!

555
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,220
-恭喜  干得好  -那是个漏洞
- Congratulations, well done. - It was a mistake.

556
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,990
我只是确保他们付出代价
I just made sure they paid for it.

557
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,750
威尔  好样的
Will, good man.

558
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,020
-这是我的工作  -谢谢你  我的朋友
- Just doing my job. - Thank you, my friend.

559
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,160
不客气  保重
Pleasure. Take care.

560
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,010
-再教我一次  -你自己来
- So show me again. - You do it.

561
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,340
好吧  但是别看着我
OK. But don't watch me,

562
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,660
你看着我就弄不好  我鸭梨山大
I can't do it if you watch. I'm like a kettle.

563
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,160
你鸭梨山大是什么意思
What do you mean you're like a kettle?

564
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,000
-弄好了我再告诉你  去吧  -好吧
- If I get this right I'll tell you. Go on. - OK.

565
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,530
"买衣服的时候要用  想要"
 "When buying clothing to say what you want, use... Gostaria."

566
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:48,260
-想要  -"我想要一件衬衫"
- Gostaria. - "I'd like a shirt. Gostaria uma camisa."

567
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,420
我想要一件衬衫

568
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
"我想要一条裤子  你想要一条裤子吗"
"I'd like a pair of trousers. Gostaria umas calcas."

569
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,550
什么
What?

570
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,950
"要合适的尺码
"To get the right size,

571
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,150
用下面的短语  我是40号"
use the following phrases. I am a size 40."

572
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,070
"我是40号"
"O meu numero e quarenta."

573

我是4...40号
O meu numero e qua... quarenta.

574
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,230
"如果他们没有合适的颜色
"If they don't have the right colour,

575
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,000
要同样款式的蓝色就这样说
here is how to ask for the same thing in blue.

576
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,360
这个有蓝色的吗"
Do you have this in blue?"

577
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,620
你在冲谁挥手
Who are you waving at?

578
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,550
我不知道
I don't know.

579
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,590
你不知道是什么意思
What do you mean you don't know?

580
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,880
那个男人  是他开始挥手的
That man. He just started waving.

581

他已经走了

你说呢  听着  深呼吸  推开门
Possibly. Listen, just take a deep breath and open the door,

585
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,600
别扭扭捏捏的
you big Jessie.

586
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,460
我做不到  我有点怕
I can't. I'm scared.

你们总该有些共同点吧

我们说好的  现在哪儿都找不见她
We had a deal. I can't see her anywhere.

591

我洗澡的时候他就一直看着我
He was looking in at me when I was in the bath.

626

627
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,990
我也不知道  但他就在窗外

Is it possible that one of your ex-clients has a point to prove?

636
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,940
可能你败诉了  有过吗
Someone you failed to defend, perhaps did some time?

挑拣案子是不允许的
Cherry-picking is frowned upon.

643

大家都饿了  你们都饿了

649
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,470
他怎么没先来找我们
He didn't come to us first?

650
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,970
看来他是想让你更难受些
Looks like he wanted to cause you maximum discomfort.

651
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,820
直接找法律监察员和律师标准委员会  难办
Went straight to the Legal Ombudsman and the BSB. Both barrels.

652

"根据第301条A1

出庭律师名誉的行为
to paragraph 301 A1,

656

尤其是你对他的辩词的准确度和
in particular that you expressed doubts about

657
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,580
真实性表达了质疑"
the validity and honesty of his plea."

658
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,300

What?

659
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,780
-这是真的吗  -当然不是
- Is this true? - Of course not.

660
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,480
简直是疯了  我们赢下了这个案子  赢了
This is insane. We won the bloody case. We won!

661
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,300
似乎这还不够
Looks like it's not enough.

662
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,020
他到底是在干什么
What the hell's he doing?

663
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,390
你提交的皇家法律顾问的申请
I'm afraid your silk application is going to have to wait

664
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,480
恐怕要等到此事解决后了
till this is all sorted out.

665
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,980
威尔  我很抱歉  太不走运了
