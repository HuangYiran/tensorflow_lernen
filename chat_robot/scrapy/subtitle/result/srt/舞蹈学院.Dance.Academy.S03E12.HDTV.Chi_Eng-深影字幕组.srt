舞蹈学院 前情提要 
Previously on Dance Academy... 

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,790
停 收工
Cut! Print!

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,168
各位 凯特莉娜・卡拉马科夫的拍摄活动完美谢幕
Everybody, that is a wrap on Katrina Karamakov!

4
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:12,660
奥利 你是来结交关系的呢 还是来和我约会的
Ollie, are you here to network or to hang out with me?

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,707
这很重要 关及我的事业
This is my career. It's important.

6
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:16,705
马库斯 你求婚了 
Marcus, you put a ring on it! 

7
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:19,468
你们是都准备搬去德克萨斯州吗
Are you all planning on moving to Texas?

8
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:24,181
- 无视我好了 - 又没起效果
- Ignore me. - Zero impact again!

9
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,898
你的背一有好转 你要跳我为你选的独舞
When your back improves, you'll do the solo I selected for you.

10
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:29,879
我会继续和赛斯吉娅合作 从她那儿我学到很多
I'm going to keep working with Saskia. I'm learning a lot from her.

11
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,233
游戏开始了 塔拉・韦伯斯特 游戏开始
Game on, Tara Webster. Game on.

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,537
舞蹈学院 第三季第12集

13
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,484
这真难理解
It's hard to comprehend

14
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:27,563
明晚我将要去参加国家芭蕾舞团的试镜
tomorrow night I'll be auditioning for the National Ballet Company.

15
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:31,985
这是我们最后一次以学生的身份跳舞了
The final time we dance as students.

16
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,989
过去三年的高潮部分
The culmination of the past three years.

17
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,021
注意 不要太张扬
Careful! Don't oversell it.

18
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,985
能给我一个幸运三叶草吗
Do I get a special clover?

19
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,065
我不用参加舞团试镜 但今晚是我的全球首映
I don't have a company audition, but it is my world premiere.

20
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,901
如果电影很糟糕呢
What if the movie sucks?

21
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:55,809
如果我演得很烂 人们向我丢东西呢 比如很锋利的东西
What if I suck and people throw things - sharp things?

22
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,813
每个人都会得到三叶草 连格瑞斯都有
Everyone gets a clover, even Grace.

23
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,897
我要把以积极的心态结束这一学年当做我的使命
I'm making it my mission to end the year on a positive note.

24
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:04,407
不仅是为了积善
And not just to get my karma points up

25
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,300
以使宇宙奖励我一份合同
so the universe rewards me with a contract.

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,668
那会显得我...
That would make me...

27
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:11,469
你是个冷酷无情的战士
You're a cold, ruthless warrior.

28
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:14,772
这些人自以为他们把你那好胜的骨髓给抽走了
These people think they've sucked you of your competitive marrow?

29
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:19,767
证明他们是错的 打倒他们
Prove them wrong. Take them down.

30
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,869
舞团能把我俩都招进去吗
Could the company take both of us?

31
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,817
他比我更应得这个
He still deserves it more than I do.

32
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,809
他饰演的王子比我的更梦幻
His prince is dreamier than mine.

33
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,897
这是基佬思想还是嫉妒思想
Is that a gay thought or a jealous thought?

34
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,841
当然是嫉妒思想了
Jealous thought. Definitely.

35
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,865
他是个骗子 什么技术都没有
He's a fraud, a mere blow-in.

36
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:54,865
得了 不要再扮礼貌了 拿出点行动 伙计
Sheesh, stop being polite and make a move, buddy.

37
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,813
我才不迷信
I'm not superstitious...

38
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,813
世界上没有运气这个东西
there's no such thing as luck.

39
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:07,905
奥利弗 做了点调查 麦克白的诅咒是很强劲的
Oliver, did some research. The Macbeth curse is potent.

40
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:11,841
我真怀疑你的幸运毛衣都救不了你
I doubt even your lucky cardigan can save you.

41
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:12,646
不是幸运
It's not lucky.

42
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,193
是情感
It's sentimental.

43
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:17,781
因为如果我相信运气了
Because if I believe in luck,

44
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,461
我得去相信我已经倒霉很久了
I have to believe I've been unlucky for a very long time.

45
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,786
我想现在 我们都有各自的焦虑
I guess right now, we all have our own hang-ups.

46
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:29,059
简直有千万个想法在我们的脑海里奔腾
Literally a thousand thoughts are running through our heads.

47
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:33,930
最难接受的是 接下来发生的事情是我们无法掌控的
The hardest one to accept... what happens next is out of our hands.

48
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,837
我预测四颗星
I'm predicting four stars.

49
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,869
明天我们在课前跳个致谢舞怎么样
What about a thankyou dance at the start of class tomorrow?

50
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,022
我们全部参与一个精心编排的颂词
We all launch into a choreographed tribute?

51
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,679
一点创意都没有
Negative points for originality.

10052
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:46,234
拜托 这是我们最后一堂课
Oh come on, this is our last class.

53
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:48,699
雷恩老师要搬去奥斯汀舞团了 这是一个时代的尽头
Miss Raine's moving to Austin. It's the end of an era.

54
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,543
我们得告诉她我们有多感谢她
We have to show her how much she's appreciated.

55
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:53,262
我很确信她能应付 你们对她来说只是学生
Pretty sure she'll cope. You're all just students to her.

56
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:54,598
嘘 好戏开始了
Shh! Showtime.

57
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:56,413
这部地方电影出彩的是
What's great about this local film

58
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:59,370
它采取了一种被荒废的类型 舞蹈电影
is that it takes a tired genre, the dance movie,

59
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,284
使得故事真挚而有深度
and gives it real heart and depth.

60
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,563
更不用提莱斯・奥利瑞
And not to mention Rhys O'Leary.

61
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:05,463
谁会预料表演那般精彩
Who would have predicted that performance?

62
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:08,867
我觉得他和新人凯特莉娜・卡拉马科夫之间的火花
I thought his chemistry with newcomer Kat Karamakov

63
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,786
非常强烈
was particularly strong.

64
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,064
她的确是新人 是吧 是有这么一些时候
She is very new, isn't she? I mean, there were some moments.

65
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:19,961
表演略显笨拙 但总体来说还是十分入戏的
That were a bit clunky, but overall I thought it was thoroughly engaging.

66
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,875
我也这么觉得 我给四颗星
Oh, so did I. I'm giving it four stars.

67
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,828
我也是 四颗星
Me too. Four stars.

10068
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:27,922
- 四颗星 - 我女朋友十分入戏
- Four stars! - Oooh, my girlfriend's thoroughly engaging.

69
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:39,605
我称之为"放弃前夕焦虑综合症"
I'm calling it 'impending abandonment anxiety'.

70
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:45,473
快看 莎拉・维斯塔里尼 第一个被我弄哭的学生
Oh, look! Sarah Vistarini. First student I ever made cry.

71
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:49,372
什么时候想去奥斯汀和我们住 
Any time you want to move to Austin to live with us, 

72
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,215
我们随时欢迎你
we'd love to have you.

73
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:53,895
你们是新婚夫妇 我在会打扰到你们频繁的欢好时光
You'll be newlyweds. I'd be in the way of all that constant nakedness.

74
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,537
- 格瑞斯 - 以那副画面惩罚我自己了
- Grace! - Punish myself with the image.

75
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,280
好吧 相信我 这是个自私的提议
Yeah, well, believe me, it is a selfish offer.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,912
即便不是因为露西
Even if Lucy wasn't a factor,

77
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:04,795
我的舞团还是会很渴望招到你 所以考虑一下吧
my company would still be angling to get you, so think about it.

78
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,230
好 在一个像今天这样美好的早晨
OK, he would be calling them alarmist

79
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,579
他会叫他们杞人忧天者
on a morning like this,

80
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,386
但是气象局已经发布了一个恶劣天气预警
but the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather alert

81
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,019
预测中午的天气会突变 伴随暴雨与强风
predicting a midday change, with strong winds and heavy rain.

82
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,170
娱乐新闻方面 大明星莱斯・奥利瑞
And in entertainment news, Rhys O'Leary is in town

83
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,873
来宣传他的新近献礼"彩虹之上"
to promote his latest offering Over The Rainbow.

84
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,183
明星们会出席该电影的全球首...
The stars will be at the film's world prem...

85
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:36,902
他是你爸 这还不足以让你发条短信吗
He's your dad. Is it not worth a quick text?

86
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,190
我们的关系还没好到发短信
We didn't leave things on texting terms.

87
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,689
但你要毕业了 他还是想来的
But you're graduating! He'd still wanna be here.

88
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,807
现在我能说出这样的话算不算很解放
Isn't it liberating that I can say stuff like that

89
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,052
因为我不是你女朋友
now that I'm not your girlfriend,

90
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:51,077
也不是潜在女友 也不是心碎的前女友
or potential girlfriend, or heartbroken ex?

91
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:52,662
过去我也没阻止过你
Didn't stop you in the past.

92
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,837
所以你就这样准备你的试镜吗
So, this is how you're gonna prepare for your audition?

93
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,705
父子奇迹言和 致谢舞
Father-son miracles, thankyou dances.

94
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:07,254
我只是希望上台的时候 一切都
I just don't wanna go on stage until everything's...

95
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:08,482
很完美
Perfect.

96
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:12,614
你不能把整个学业经历简化成一个鞠躬
You can't wrap the entire academy experience up into a bow.

97
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:14,910
现在是时候抱着必胜的信念了
It's time to want to win.

98
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,125
被诅咒了
Cursed!

99
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,160
我们有着不同的生殖器[性别不同]
You and I have different genitalia.

100
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,362
我又不是你的竞争对手 你干嘛还要在精神上排挤我
I'm not your competition, so why are you trying to psych me out?

101
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:35,424
这能让我冷静 就跟冥想一样
It's calming. Like meditation.

102
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:38,704
我能轻易为你争取一个试镜机会
I can easily get you an audition,

103
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,361
而且这对我们明年的家庭团聚也是件好事
and it would be good for us to have some family comforts next year.

104
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,125
露西厨艺不精 但看她涂上嘴唇
Lucy is not the greatest cook, but watch her wax her upper lip.

105
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,086
我满脑子都是国家芭蕾舞团
I can only think about the National.

106
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,705
奥斯汀甚至都挤不进前五
After that, Austin doesn't even make top five.

107
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:53,900
我们要确保舞团和我们两个都签约
We need to make sure that the company is a lock for both of us.

108
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:58,759
最后一课
Last class.

109
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,062
好了 够了
Alright, that's enough.

110
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:17,150
扶好扶手杠 就像过去三年的每一天一样
To the barre, like you've done every day for the past three years.

111
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,839
瞧见没 注意这线条
See? Note the T-cut.

112
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,181
锻炼锁骨与肘部之间的角度 别撅嘴
You wanna work the collarbone to the elbow, minimise the duck face.

113
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:33,249
这都是弄虚作假 掩盖我有多糟糕
This is all just window dressing to disguise how much I clunked.

114
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:36,529
别因为一点负面评价就缺席自己的电影首映
One comment does not make you ditch your own movie premiere.

115
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:40,051
奥利弗 难道我不该去剧院力挺你们吗
Oliver! Don't you think I should be at the theatre supporting you guys?

116
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:43,387
无所谓 我的其他戏服放在衣柜里都缩水了
I don't care. Wardrobe somehow shrunk my other costume.

117
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,740
我能看看吗
Can I pull this off?

118
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,236
嗨
Hi.

119
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:52,674
我正打算留言 祝今晚的首映礼顺利
Uh, I was gonna message. Good luck with the premiere tonight.

120
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,613
你试试这两件
You are trying on these and these.

121
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,178
原来传言是真的
Grapevine's accurate, then.

122
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:09,985
她想让舞团更现代化
She's pushing the company more contemporary.

123
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,993
是啊 意味着她不会喜欢我扮演的白马王子
Yeah, which means she'll hate my Prince Charming.

124
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:19,745
有一点你说错了 那就是我们才华横溢
The thing you get all twisted up on is that we're the talent.

125
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,985
她需要我们
She needs us.

126
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:29,261
我还有一场面试
I do have an interview to get to.

127
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:33,999
当然 我们不是要上演一场争夺战啥的
Of course, and, hey, we're not trying to start a bidding war or anything.

128
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:37,221
只是想让你知道
We just felt it was respectful for you to know

129
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,795
别的舞团也想和我们签约
that there are other companies getting a tad poachy.

130
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:43,058
听上去不错 恭喜
That must be very flattering. Congratulations.

131
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:44,654
但我们坚定选择贵舞团
Oh, but we're committed to this company.

132
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,075
我打算纹一个"我爱国家芭蕾舞团"
I'm getting tattooed 'I love the National'...

133
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:51,225
它在我们的考虑范围内 但我们想知道
Well, it's on the shortlist, although it's hard to know for sure

134
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,596
贵公司的签约条件 看看自己是否符合要求
until we have an idea of your plans for the company,

135
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:55,824
才能做决定
how we might fit in.

136
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:59,812
你们想在试镜之前知道签约条件
You two want to know what's on offer before you deign to audition?

137
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,862
作为前任冠军 我有很多选择
Well, as the pre champion, I do have options,

138
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:05,404
我们还是一揽子交易
and we are a package deal.

139
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:08,937
好的 我记住了
Well, I'll keep that front of mind, then.

140
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,613
她被我们征服了
Hooked and gagging for us!

141
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,769
她会觉得我们目中无人
She thinks we think we're too good for the company!

142
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,309
人们需要有所追求才会有所收获
People need to chase to know they want something,

143
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,975
我要去争取 这样我们才能在一起
and I'm wrangling it so that we can stay together.

144
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:27,454
但我们现在不在一起 只不过一起策划了几次报复活动
But we're not together now! We revenge-pashed a couple of times!

145
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:29,244
这都是你难以捉摸的思想在作怪
This is all the freaky workings of your head!

146
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,127
- 本 - 别烦我
- Ben... - No, stay away from me!

147
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:47,600
排练室都满了 你还要练多久
All the studios are booked. How long do you think you'll be?

148
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,697
我不介意一起练
I don't mind sharing.

149
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,909
怎么穿这件 我以为你扮演的是珀尔塞福涅
What's with the costume? I thought you were doing Persephone.

150
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,909
{\an8}宙斯之女 被冥王劫持娶作冥后

151
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:59,197
珀尔塞福涅是很漂亮
Persephone's beautiful,

152
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,965
但雷恩老师认为火鸟更戏剧化
but Miss Raine thinks Firebird is more dramatic,

153
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,726
我背上的伤不痛了 所以
and my back's not hurting, so...

154
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,584
我打算辞演白马王子
I'm just about to ditch Prince Charming.

155
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:10,117
什么 但这角色是为你量身定做的
What? But that role may as well have been invented for you.

156
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:12,172
他们会说克里斯提的白马王子更时髦
They'll say Christian's Prince is edgier,

157
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:17,175
而且我还在练一个现代舞 以防万一
and I have a contemporary piece I've been working on, in case.

158
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:23,246
要不我看你跳给你提意见 然后你看我跳
Well, why don't I watch you and give you feedback, and you watch me,

159
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:26,447
我们假装没有彻底诀别 紧急关头交换意见
and we'll both pretend we're not cracked, switching last minute?

160
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:32,667
本 是我 我不想破坏你的舞蹈生涯
Ben, it's me, the person who hasn't ruined your career

161
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,935
所以我来弥补
because I am going to fix this!

162
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,891
再来一次
Go again.

163
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,353
还要来吗
Should I do it again?

164
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:59,390
看 安然无恙 我鄙视你所谓的诅咒
Here, intact, I spit on your alleged curse.

165
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,825
艾比盖尔・阿姆斯特朗
Abigail Armstrong?

166
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,856
希望不要是花
Better not be flowers.

167
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:07,999
我明确告诉妈妈和韦斯不要干扰我
I explicitly told Mum and Wes no distractions.

168
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,899
我才不会被打动 谢谢
I will not be humanised. Thank you.

10169
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,242
是韦斯
Wes.

170
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,054
你没事吧 噎着了吗
Are you OK? Are you choking?

171
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:27,893
我要做什么
What do I... do?

172
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:36,684
- 你还好吗 - 不
- Are you OK? - No!

173
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:39,553
我果真中邪了 我得走了
I am superstitious, and I have to go.

174
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:40,627
去哪儿
Where?

175
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:44,107
- 我去拿我的幸运毛衣 - 什么 奥利
- I need my lucky cardigan. - What?! Ollie!

176
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,751
他有些过于兴奋了
He's a little bit overexcited,

177
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:50,129
别担心 我都严格地嘱咐过他了
but don't worry, I've given him strict instructions.

178
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,834
只能轻轻地鼓掌 太遗憾了
Polite applause only, which is a real shame,

179
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,145
因为我一直在练习"塔拉小可爱"加油声
because I've been practicing my 'Tara Banana' shout-out.

180
00:11:55,145 --> 00:12:01,496
克里斯提 谢谢你的邀请
Christian! Hey. Thanks for the invite.

181
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:04,732
- 爸爸妈妈 这是拉弗・里德 - 你好
- Uh, Mum, Dad, this is Raf Reed. - Hi.

182
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:05,986
你好 
Hi. G'day.

183
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:11,246
如果你想让我离开就告诉我 我不想干扰你
You tell me if you want me to go. I don't want to distract you.

184
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:15,410
不 我没想到你会来
No, I... I didn't think you would want to come.

185
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,407
开玩笑 这是我第一次看芭蕾
Are you kidding? This is my first ballet.

10186
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,353
希望你们喜欢这部电影
I hope you enjoy the movie.

187
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,217
来吧 笑一个
Come on, smile, smile!

188
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:36,338
和莱斯・奥利瑞合作什么感觉 你崇拜他吗
What was it like working with Rhys O'Leary? Were you starstruck?

189
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:43,412
放松 微笑
It's alright, smile.

190
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:50,534
- 凯特 看这边 - 放松 放松
- Kat, over here! - Just relax, relax.

191
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,269
快结束了 保持微笑
It's almost over. Just smile away.

192
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,577
你没在笑
You're not smiling.

193
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,875
我 我打算在这儿趴一会儿
I'm just... I'm gonna stay down here for a while.

194
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,569
尊敬的来宾
Distinguished guests,

195
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,964
国家芭蕾舞团的艺术总监瑞贝卡・布雷斯韦特
artistic director of the National Ballet Company Rebecca Braithwaite,

196
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:52,111
老师们 同学们 家长们 朋友们 女士们和先生们
teachers, students, parents, friends, ladies and gentlemen,

197
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,682
欢迎莅临今年的毕业典礼
welcome to this year's graduating class.

198
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,862
在今晚的演出之前 请允许我
I'd like to begin tonight's performance

199
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:03,890
介绍一下克里斯提・里德
by introducing Christian Reed,

200
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,664
出演灰姑娘中的白马王子
dancing Prince Charming from Cinderella.

201
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:20,290
破坏演出服 一如往昔
Costume sabotage. Takes me back.

202
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:31,292
抱歉 能否暂停一下音乐
Sorry, can we, uh... can we stop the music for a second?

203
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,945
我的一位好友
A good friend of mine has been trying to figure out

204
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,396
试图找寻最佳的方式来感谢舞蹈学院
the right way to say thank you to the Academy.

205
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,312
可是没有任何一种方式
But it's impossible,

206
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:51,353
足以回报学院以及你们所有人
because we can never repay what it has given us.

207
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,748
给予我们的一切
What you've all given us.

208
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:04,044
我不是个演说家 让我用舞蹈来表达吧
So, I'm not a speechmaker. I should probably dance now.

209
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,194
我也不喜欢自己在荧幕上的样子 但我还是会看
I loathe watching myself on screen too, but I do it anyway.

210
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,291
还有什么方面你想要提高演技的
How else are you gonna hone your craft?

211
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:51,343
没想那么多 反正我只是到演艺圈打个酱油就会离开的
Not a pressing concern, as this will be my only acting foray, so...

212
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,814
哦 太笨拙了
Yeah. Clunky!

213
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:57,631
不止笨拙 我演得太烂了
Clunky is too generous! I'm horrific!

214
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,844
从臀部两腿外翻
Turn out from the hips...

215
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:02,663
怎么会烂到这么令人难以置信
How is that there even remotely believable?

216
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:08,150
- 我不再羞涩了 - 你别再...
- I'm not ashamed anymore. - You're never gonna...

217
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,559
试映期间 你应该来洛杉矶
You should come to LA for pilot season.

218
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,812
我会把你介绍给我的经纪人
I'm gonna hook you up with my manager.

219
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:16,806
我还有"微不足道"的第三年学业要完成 记得吗
I just have this little thing called third year.

220
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,143
哦 我嘟嘴了 哦 不
Oh! Oh, I'm duck-facing! Oh, no!

221
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:24,019
奥利发私信给我求救 说他没带手机 被反锁在休息室了
Hey, Ollie's just tweeted me, 'SOS, no phone, stuck in boarding house.'

222
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,799
有人特别渴望得到关注呢
Someone's starved for attention.

223
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:32,331
还关注着奥利的微博呀
So, still following Ollie's tweets, huh?

224
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,134
全体出动 救人去
All move to the rescue!

225
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,364
本杰明・狄克尔准备上台 三十秒倒计时
Benjamin Tickle to the stage. 30 seconds.

226
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:13,342
坚持住 亲爱的 我们会救你出来的
Hold tight, precious. We're gonna bust you out.

227
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:16,550
别费劲了 一切都很明了
Don't bother. The universe has been clear.

228
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,911
我注定签不成约 我没那么幸运
I am not fated to get a contract. I am not the lucky one.

229
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,437
不能如你所愿了
That's disappointing.

230
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,038
你怎么不告诉我 试镜演出这天
You need to tell me that on the day of the auditions,

231
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,239
你和本都已决定要换舞蹈呢
you and Ben have decided to change dances?!

232
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,896
我知道我去找赛斯吉娅的事情让你不高兴
I knew you were upset that I went to Saskia.

233
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,761
我应该相信你的判断
I should have trusted your judgment.

234
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,797
不 是时候相信你自己了
No, it's time to trust your own.

235
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:15,926
学生总会青出于蓝而胜于蓝
Students outgrow their teachers.

236
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:20,574
这是必然的 只是老师们还是会不愿面对这个事实
It's natural, but it can still be difficult for us to accept.

237
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:23,005
我不会...这怎么可能呢
I would never... That could never happen.

238
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,420
这说明你已经准备好了
It means you're ready.

239
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,055
现在 该上台演绎你的珀尔塞福涅了
Now, it's time for you to go on stage as Persephone,

240
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,055
{\an8} 珀尔塞福涅是史特拉汶斯基的一部芭蕾舞剧 讲述希腊神话中的冥后的故事

241
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,124
我知道 如果你能倾情舞出真我
and if you dance it the way I know you can,

242
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:37,516
那么你的未来 一定是璀璨夺目的
your future, it's written in the stars.

243
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:51,662
我支持你 虽然这不符合竞争原则 不过...
I had your back, which goes against all competitive logic, however...

244
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,782
你支持我 却弄坏我的演出服
You had my back, yet you destroyed my costume?!

245
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:54,704
格瑞斯干的
Grace destroyed it.

246
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:57,575
我特意没告诉她你换成跳火鸟了
I neglected to tell her that you'd switched to Firebird.

247
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:03,910
- 我刚决定跳回这个了 - 哦噢 糟糕咯
- I just switched back!-  Well, whoops.

248
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,257
你霉运上身了
You are cursed!

249
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,432
不要 它差点砸掉我们的脑袋
No. It could have decapitated us.

250
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:26,425
我是不是应该停止抱怨上天不给我想要的东西
How about I stop blaming the world for not giving me what I want,

251
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,853
而直接去争取呢
and just take it already?

252
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:29,462
听起来很有道理
Sounds pretty intelligent to...

253
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:11,554
塔拉・韦伯斯特 一分钟倒计时
Tara Webster, this is your one-minute call.

254
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,991
嘿 
Hey. Hey.

255
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:17,143
看看你 没什么能阻碍你的
Look at you. Nothing sticks!

256
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,917
我得走了
I've gotta go.

257
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,560
你知道吗 我这一年以来都期待同一件事情
You know the one thing I've looked forward to all year

258
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,357
就是阻止你签约进舞团
is stopping you from getting into the company?

259
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,534
格瑞斯 我不想听这些 你不是这样的人
I'm not listening, Grace. You're better than this.

260
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,760
你总是这么一副屈尊降贵的样子
Always with the condescension!

261
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,654
因为我们曾经是朋友 所以我知道你不是这样的人 
You are, I know you are, because you and I were friends once.

262
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:39,259
我背受伤的时候 你是那么忠诚的朋友
You were so loyal when I broke my back.

263
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,096
可你却把我当成可有可无的人
And you treated me like I was disposable!

264
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:49,151
我愿意付出所有努力修补我们之间的关系 我真的愿意
I would give anything to make things right between us. I really would.

265
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:10,081
我是农场主的女儿
I'm a farmer's daughter.

266
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:12,822
我知道种植庄稼的时候 尽管你做出了所有的努力
I know you can plant the crop and do all the work,

267
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:15,154
还是要靠老天的恩赐
but the weather has the final word.

268
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:19,498
大自然的力量
Those forces of nature bigger than you

269
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,016
远远超越你能控制的范围
that can't be controlled.

270
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,513
父亲曾经给我讲过完美风暴形成的过程
Dad explained to me once how a perfect storm is created,

271
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:24,228
那是许多无关痛痒的事件同时发生
that a combination of harmless events occurring together

272
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:29,988
共同作用而产生的灾难性的结果
conspire to produce an outcome that is disastrous.

273
00:22:47,484 --> 00:22:50,319
如果不是这粒珠子
If not for a bead.

274
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:54,945
如果我第一个跳
If I'd danced first.

275
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,524
或者最后一个跳
Or last.

276
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:02,388
或者根本不跳
Or not at all.

277
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,093
如果我的背没有折裂过
If my back wasn't already fractured.

278
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,487
塔拉 你还好吗
Tara, you OK?

279
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:13,912
- 我的腿没有知觉了 - 塔拉
- I can't feel my legs. - Tara?

280
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,333
塔拉
Tara?

281
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:19,861
没有知觉了...
I can't feel my...

282
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:22,817
好了 大家请散开 请散开
OK, guys, move away, move away, please.

283
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,813
阿比盖尔 叫救护车
Abigail, ambulance.

284
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:27,853
你会没事的
You're gonna be OK.

285
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:30,853
你能捏一下我的手吗 就是这样
Can you squeeze my hand? That's it.

286
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:33,893
- 天哪 我的腿没有知觉了 - 你会没事的 
- Oh, my God, I can't feel them... - You're gonna be fine.

287
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:35,897
你会没事的
It's gonna be OK.

288
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:44,841
你可以说这是偶然 运气不好 或是我命中注定
It really doesn't matter if you call it random chance, bad luck, my fate.

289
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:49,845
而这一切发生与否
The difference between everything and nothing

290
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,901
都取决于那些"如果"
comes down to 'if', 'if', 'if'.
