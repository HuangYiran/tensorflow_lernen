00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was making deposits in the whac koff warehouse for later.

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though, to be honest, it didn't take much to set me off.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear, when my hormones balance out...

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the fuck!

00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just a regular guy.

66
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No radioactive spiders, no refugee status from a doomed alien world.

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? Todd said they do still make count Chocula.

68
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just don't sell it at the store any more.

69
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother was killed by an aneurism in the kitchen.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As opposed to a gunman in the alley.

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you were hoping for any...

72
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will avenge you, mother!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you're out of luck.

74
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the 18 months since my mother died...

75
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the only epiphany I had was realising that life just goes on.

76
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did they change the bee's face?

77
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

78
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy, I dunno. probably because it's fucking impossible, dipshit.

80
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, putting on a mask and helping people, how's that impossible?

81
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not superhero, though.

82
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Super's like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit.

83
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just hero.

84
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not even hero. it's just fucking psycho.

85
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Bruce Wayne? he didn't have any powers.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but he had all the expensive shit that doesn't exist.

87
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you meant how come nobody does it in real life?

88
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

89
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, if anybody did it in real life they'd get their ass kicked.

90
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They'd be dead in, like, a day. - A day.

91
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't figure out why nobody does.

93
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes,

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd think one would give it a try.

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why thousands of people wanna be Paris

97
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hilton and nobody wants to be spiderman?

98
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what's with that? she has, like, no tits at all.

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's a porn tape. he doesn't have a porn tape.

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys never saw 'One Night in Spiderman'?

101
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oooh, guess who?

102
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it me or do you kinda feel sorry for chris D'Amico?

103
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want.

104
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you wouldn't have said anything

105
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...

106
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact that he's always on his own.

107
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should, like, talk to him.

108
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See if he wants to hang out with us.

109
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I didn't say we should talk to him, I just...

110
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about it. come on, it'd be awesome.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he was our friend, no one would ever fuck with us again.

112
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on then, Todd.

113
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wanna go talk to him? - No, no, no. no.

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you wanna go talk to him? I can move.

115
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dave, Dave should go. - Dave should go.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - Dave, you should totally go.

117
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a dick. - Don't be afraid, dave.

118
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a pussy.

119
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck off!

120
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you spray anything over there? - I think I might have shat my pants.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that guy spoke to me like that I would have kicked his ass.

122
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd, when have you ever kicked anyone's ass?

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever, man. I would have just gone for his knees.

124
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're not making sense.

125
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what I'm saying is the superior force of batman's batarang

126
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would undoubtedly penetrate the joker's force field,

127
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leaving him totally vulnerable to the...

128
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right, and then... but, you know... - Whoa, whoa, whoa pussy patrol.

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phones. Money.

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, not again, come on.

131
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phone.

132
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have one someone else jacked it last week.

133
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pussy. - Give me the bag.

134
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's just comics. - Yo, you wanna get cut?

135
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this asshole just watching.

136
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, be honest with yourself.

137
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you do anything differently?

138
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We see someone in trouble and we wish we could help,

139
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we don't.

140
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world I lived in... heroes only existed in comic books.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360


142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that would have been okay if bad guys were make-believe, too.

143
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they're not.

144
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,410


145
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frankie, I'm telling you, man, I swear I'm not making this up.

146
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This fucking guy comes out of nowhere.

147
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kicks our asses and steals all the coke.

148
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The guy that looks like batman? - I didn't say he looked like batman.

149
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did Tre, you said the guy looked like batman.

150
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He said like a mask and stuff. - And a cape.

151
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like batman.

152
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say "like batman". I never said "batman".

153
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

154
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you the problem I got with that, Tre.

155
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our mole with the Russians tells things a little different.

156
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to him, you sold him my coke and you took the money.

157
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a fucking lie!

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking Russian,

159
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man!

160
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see, Tre, what's more likely, huh?

161
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you're a greedy little

162
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cock-sucker or all my coke was stolen by superman?

163
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Batman. - I never said batman!

164
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough!

165
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My son is waiting to go to the movies and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

166
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joe, you're in charge.

167
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's gotta be the worst fucking excuse I ever heard, Tre.

168
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry you had to wait, buddy.

169
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the movie is starting in 10 minutes.

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, we're cool.

171
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're only gonna miss the trailers.

172
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.

173
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we get in there, get chris some popcorn. okay?

174
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What d'you wanna drink?

175
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You want a pepsi? - Yeah, that's fine.

176
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him a pepsi and I'll have an icee. mixed.

177
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like when they mix the red one and the blue one.

178
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a pack of twizzlers.

179
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The comic books had it wrong.

180
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't take a trauma or cosmic

181
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rays or a power ring to make a superhero.

182
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the perfect combination of optimism and naivety.

183
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are fucking awesome.

184
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on then, bring it on!

185
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320


186
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Daddy, I'm scared. - come on, mindy. honey.

187
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be a big girl now. there's nothing to be afraid of.

188
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is it gonna hurt bad? - Oh, child.

189
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only for a second, sugar.

190
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A handgun bullet travels at more than...

191
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- 700 miles an hour. - 700 miles an hour.

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So at close range, like this,

193
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The force is gonna take you off your feet for sure...

194
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

195
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate getting punched in the chest.

196
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

197
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was that? not so bad.

198
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kinda fun, huh? now you know how it feels.

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a glock.

200
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I wouldn't have been scared anyways. - That's my girl.

201
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, up you get. come on.

202
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two more rounds and then home.

203
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Again? - Uh-huh.

204
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back.

205
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The bowling alley? - Yeah. and ice-cream after.

206
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. two more rounds. no wincing...

207
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...no whining, and you got yourself a deal, young lady.

208
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

209
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good call, baby doll.

210
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, have you thought about what you might want for your birthday?

211
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get a puppy?

212
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wanna get a dog? - Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.

213
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a bratz moviestar makeover sasha.

214
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just fucking with you, daddy.

215
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'll have a benchmade model-42 butterfly knife.

216
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, child. you always knock me for a loop.

217
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know what? - What?

218
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna get you two. - Two?

219
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One balisong. two balisong. that's what you get.

220
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The glass of fashion and the mould of form.

221
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The observed of all observers, - Quite, quite down!

222
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I, of ladies most deject and wretched...

223
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be honest,

224
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There wasn't a whole lot of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.

225
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But even so, my new vocation kept me plenty busy.

226
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

227
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called it preparation.

228
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you called it fantasizing, it would have been hard to argue.

229
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I knew was I'd never felt so good about myself.

230
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck!

231
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing phase.

232
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it was a start.

233
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you looking at?

234
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nothing. - Get the fuck out of here!

235
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like every serial killer already knew,

236
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you any more.

237
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was time to engage.

238
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up, man.

239
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck...?

240
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fuck you looking at?

241
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said what the fuck are you looking at?

242
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...

243
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that someone probably worked their ass off to pay for.

244
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Say what? - Leave it be, man.

245
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This motherfucker's obviously high.

246
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not high.

247
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want.

248
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just walk away from the car and we can forget about this.

249
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're crazy, man.

250
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck this shit.

251
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shit. - Let's get out of here.

252
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came round long enough to beg the

253
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Medic not to tell anybody about the costume.

254
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He promised he wouldn't.

255
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.

256
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't I have a gun? I'm a security guard.

257
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a doorman now. you don't get a gun no more.

258
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I look like a putz.

259
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look sharp. all them buttons. do your job, open the fucking door.

260
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a nice day.

261
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning, Frank. - Hey, Joe, how you doing?

262
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

263
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Want some coffee? - Maybe later.

264
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Morning, Ange. - Morning.

265
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Chris. - Morning, Joe.

266
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, we got a thing.

267
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a big thing, Frank.

268
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

269
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry, hon. - Do what you gotta do.

270
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Chris, where do you think you're going? - I gotta talk to dad.

271
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christopher.

272
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, honey.

273
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you think you're going?

274
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mind you talking business. I was just gonna sit quietly.

275
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should probably start learning this stuff anyway.

276
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

277
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God-dammit, I'm gonna be 18 in 8 months, for christ sakes.

278
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a seat.

279
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what's the problem?

280
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our Russian says that tre just sold him another 5 k's at half price.

281
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Which Tre? Tre Tre? - Right. dead Tre.

282
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now I'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost?

283
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or tre was telling the truth.

284
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, this is my choice? I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?

285
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the part about the superhero, Frankie.

286
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just that he might have really been gaffled by somebody.

287
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we better invite our russian over for a friendly chat.

288
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See what's really going on.

289
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, early birdie. you beat me to it.

290
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to get you breakfast this morning.

291
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday, sweetheart.

292
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this out.

293
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

294
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh my gosh! dad.

295
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. watch, dad.

296
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, pop quiz. what's the proper name for one of those?

297
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Balisong. it's Filipino. Ask me another.

298
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent, good.

299
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The AR15 was a lighter...

300
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...smaller calibre version of what design?

301
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eugene Stoner's AR10. now give me a hard one.

302
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name of...

400
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,570

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows, this might even get you laid.

405
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd. you fucking retard.

406
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's really fucking helping me! - I'm just being honest.

407
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was getting back to my old self.

408
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have quit, of course...

409
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you can't just re-programme yourself...

410
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what you want, who you are, your purpose in life.

411
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm just standing around.

412
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not!

413
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It is what it is. - How about that, huh?

414
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. didn't see that, did you?

415
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think it's best that you just walk away.

416
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

417
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? huh?

418
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you looking at me?

419
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is my business.

420
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600


421
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? my hardware was fixed now.

422
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was back and running Kick-Ass version 2.0.

423
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260


424
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Have you seen this cat?

425
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No? okay, thank you.

426
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this cat?

427
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, did you see this cat?

428
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No? okay.

429
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great!

430
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, kitty. here, mr Bitey.

431
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. no, no, no, no, no.

432
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. mr Bitey, come on.

433
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back here. come on, let's get you home. come on.

434
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you, mr Bitey!

435
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, god, I'm so sorry, man.

436
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fucking...

437
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, freak.

438
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Leave him alone. - Fuck off, it's none of your business.

439
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes it is.

440
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, call 911!

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, there's a dude dressed like a superhero fighting a bunch of guys.

442
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fucking awesome!

443
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him alone!

444
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it up, man. just walk away.

445
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, never.

446
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is wrong with you? you'd rather die for some piece of shit..

447
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that you don't even fucking know?

448
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy while everybody else watches.

449
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you wanna know what's wrong with me?!

450
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'd rather die. so bring it on!

451
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fucking crazy, kid.

452
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

453
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?!

454
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

455
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That fucking rocked. who are you?

456
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Kick-Ass.

457
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, you gotta check this shit out.

458
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

459
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And coming up after the hour.

460
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A costume vigilante has become the latest internet phenomenon...

461
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After a Hamilton park resident filmed the man's remarkable intervention...

462
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is awesome. - Fuck, yeah!

463
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to this special edition of eye on New York.

465
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This colourful individual has been all over the news...

466
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...after a video of his intervention of street gang violence...

467
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...became the most watched clip on the internet.

468
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy...

469
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Myspace...38 friends.

00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick Ass's myspace...16,000 and counting.

471
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thing was going crazy and I was loving it.

472
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And finally, we want to know who is this man.

473
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone have any idea who this wetsuit crusader is?

474
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must be someone's son, someone's brother,

475
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone's next door neighbour.

476
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit. what happened?

477
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened? this guy happened.

478
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a great day for america, everybody.

479
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's favourite superhero right now. Kick-Ass, right?

480
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

481
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like kick-ass. his costume is crappy.

482
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He looks like a transvestite...

483
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? everyone likes kick-ass.

484
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see the clip? He was actually pretty good.

485
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good at getting his ass kicked.

486
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He should call himself ass-kick instead.

487
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't even make sense.

488
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That guy's gonna end up dead, that's what I think.

489
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you serious? The guy owns.

490
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd e-mail his site if I had a problem worth fixing.

491
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got 100 guys can fix a problem, you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

492
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your 'business' where I'm not wanted.

493
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you have mistaken me for kick-ass, but I am not kick-ass.

494
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,940


495
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,940


496
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't actually read comics?

497
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just started.

498
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim and Shojo Beat,

499
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kinda thing.

500
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not really into the whole superhero thing, though.

501
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I guess you're not gonna line up for that new kick-ass comic, then?

502
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess not. but I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.

503
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.

504
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help? really? what with?

505
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I volunteer at the needle exchange?

506
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I didn't.

507
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's this one guy, Rasul. I felt so sorry for him and...

508
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the more I found out about his upbringing and stuff, I just...

509
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, that's weird. I'm usually the one playing therapist.

510
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I make a confession?

511
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever since I was little I've always wanted a friend...

512
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like you.

513
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it okay to say that? that's not homophobic, is it?

514
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I don't think you're all the same or anything.

515
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not, no.

516
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

517
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if I was everything Katie dreamed her gay bff would be...

518
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I tried my best.

519
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More importantly, I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.

520
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long story short, this particular lame duck of hers...

521
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

522
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't want the money back she'd given him...

523
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

524
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone.

525
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And let's be real, no other request could have given me more pleasure.

526
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the fuck are you supposed to be? The green condom?

527
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know it ain't halloween for another few months, kid?

528
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here to see Rasul.

529
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the fuck are you?

530
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.

531
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids nowadays in their tights.

532
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

533
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Rasul. can't you tell by my big titties?

534
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this? trick or treat or something?

535
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck. now I'm dead.

536
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've a message for Rasul about Katie Deauxma.

537
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Katie?

538
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you're Rasul?

539
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. you gotta stay away from Katie now. It's over.

540
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you just leave her alone everything will be fine.

541
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

542
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, kid. who the hell are you?

543
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what is this?

544
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kick-ass. Look me up.

545
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is me giving you a message. Leave Katie alone.

546
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

547
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or... I'll come back...

548
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and break your fucking legs.

549
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm right here now, baby.

550
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck!

551
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold him.

552
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are so fucking dead, man.

553
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you cunts. Let's see what you can do now.

554
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eeny, meeny...

555
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...miny, mo.

556
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?!

557
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I got one of those.

558
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

559
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you wanna play.

560
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

561
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.

562
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax, we're on the same team.

563
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, get up.

564
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, hit girl, we always keep our backs where?

565
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the wall, daddy, I know. it won't happen again.

566
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice shot, by the way. - Thank you.

567
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

568
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, asshole, you can't use the front door now.

569
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait.

570
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

571
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

572
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

573
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Hit Girl.

574
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big Daddy.

575
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

576
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

577
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit girl and Big Daddy.

578
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were the real deal.

579
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

580
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.

581
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this? what am I looking at here?

582
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.

583
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must have taken that right before he died.

584
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie, but that guy in the picture...

585
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I think it's that superhero nut job from the tv.

586
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

587
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass?

588
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One guy?

589
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, you're telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?

590
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.

591
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no merchandise on the street at all?

592
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

593
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One guy? - I think.

594
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're right, we'll look like the biggest pussies in new york.

595
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to do?

596
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:40,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want kick-ass's fucking head on a stick, and I want it now.

597
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

598
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good move, Ass... kick. Let's keep it that way.

599
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what this is?

600
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all the cartridge crap that comes

601
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of your gay little taser when you fire it.

602
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do know the police could have traced

603
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This right back to you if they'd found it?

604
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But lucky for you... I picked it up.

605
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

606
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's call it insurance. makes it easier for us to take your word.

607
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, we like you, but we don't trust you.

608
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't take it personal. we don't trust anybody.

609
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I re-routed your IP address.

610
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finding you was way too easy.

611
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. shit, I hadn't thought. my god.

612
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, I owe you.

613
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway.

614
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quitting. I mean, this is... it's fucking insane.

615
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in way over my head.

616
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a shame. you have potential.

617
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your call. but you know we're around if you need us.

618
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I get a hold of you?

619
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just contact the mayor's office.

620
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a special signal he shines in the sky.

621
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the shape of a giant cock.

622
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need us, put on your website you're on vacation. we'll find you.

623
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit girl, back to headquarters.

624
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet dreams.

625
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

626
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yo. whoa, whoa, whoa. what's up? - What's up?

627
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass is killing my men, gigante, that's what's up.

628
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My condolences, Frank.

629
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm afraid I can't help you on this one.

630
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- little bit outside my jurisdiction. - Outside your jurisdiction?

631
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law.

632
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so inside it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.

633
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me.

634
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cops pay me to nail the bad guys. you pay me not to.

635
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everything else is in the grey area. - fuck you very much. just do it.

636
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

637
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Un-fucking-believable.

638
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Cody? he's late.

639
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Cody. We appreciate your co-operation.

640
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me out now?

641
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you all them names and addresses.

642
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

643
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your crazy midget friend can go bash whoever you want.

644
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on.

645
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I know some very bad people up town. really nasty individuals.

646
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go. hey, come on.

647
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, don't do this. you don't need to do this. come on.

648
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. hey.

649
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, no, no...

650
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no! come on, please!

651
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you're crazy. please!

652
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a douche.

653
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have done self tan before, right?

654
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

655
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Murder, superheroes breaking into my bedroom.

656
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My life had turned into some fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.

657
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the good parts were totally surreal.

658
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, I read those old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.

659
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're actually pretty good.

660
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, they are.

661
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.

662
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great.

663
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once upon a time there were 2 supercops called Daddy and Marcus...

664
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who were very good at getting bad guys.

665
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank D'Amico was the baddest guy of them all...

666
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,610


667
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy.

668
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,690


669
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being framed as a drug dealer was the

670
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Worst thing that could have happened to daddy.

671
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,990


672
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prison was not his natural habitat.

673
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was very upset.

674
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,970


675
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With daddy in prison, his pregnant wife was all alone...

676
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and could not cope.

677
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But all clouds have a silver lining and out of her death...

678
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Mindy was born.

679
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marcus became the child's guardian...

680
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and daddy started a plan of his very own.

681
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}5 years later he left prison, and he was ready.

682
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.

683
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you find me, Marcus?

684
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of us is still a cop, remember?

685
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

686
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say brainwashed, I say made it into a game.

687
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You call this playing, Damon?

688
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vigilante justice. mass murder. come on, partner.

689
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where is she?

690
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's safe. - Can I see her?

691
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss her.

692
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss you both.

693
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate your concern, but you need to go now.

694
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should warn you, that asshole Gigante is looking for kick-ass.

695
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got something to do with you, Damon?

696
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started some kind of fucked-up superhero club?

697
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Never heard of him. - Okay. heads up, all right?

698
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You keep carrying on like you been carrying on,

699
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only a matter of time before Gigante is looking for you.

700
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been on D'Amico's payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity.

701
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I'm not gonna stop.

702
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not until D'Amico and his whole damn operation...

703
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are burnt to ashes and buried.

704
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It ain't gonna bring her back, damon.

705
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not the life for Mindy.

706
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You owe that kid a childhood.

707
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.

708
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank D'Amico!

709
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't fucking believe it.

711
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow him, round the corner.

00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not too fast.

713
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's with the high-fives?

714
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

715
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}High-fiving bullshit. keep going, keep going.

716
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not too close.

717
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going in the alley.

718
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going in the alley.

719
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, when I tell you, stop the car. ready?

720
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, kick-ass.

721
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing?

722
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill my men, huh? take my fucking coke!

723
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss. what are you doing?

724
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, come on, we gotta go, baby.

725
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fucking scumbag! - Come on, let's go.

726
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, come on, he's had enough.

727
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Frank, he's had enough. come on.

728
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you looking at? huh?

729
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on. come on, let's go. we gotta go.

730
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck. shit. damn.

731
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on, get in.

732
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was so young. no-one should have to die that way.

733
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't believe he's dead, that's all.

734
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I know. but, Katie...

735
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...guys like Rasul get mixed up in stuff and...

736
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I know, I know, but what if it was my fault?

737
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if kick-ass did it? I feel like I should call the cops or something.

738
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're talking crazy. there's no way.

739
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He probably didn't even read your email yet.

740
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

741
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got nothing to worry about.

742
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so glad you're here. I'm in such a mess.

743
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay. it's not a problem.

744
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the best.

745
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope it's okay to say this, but... it so sucks that you're gay.

746
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't fucking believe this.

747
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,100


748
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of children's enter-fuckingtainer is that?

749
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of kid has a...

750
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a spiderman party, sure, but a fucking kick-ass party?

751
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They selling paper plates and napkins at the store now?

752
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, you're scaring me. you're losing it.

753
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when did you start getting your hands dirty again? and in public.

754
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since when I asked you fucks to deliver me kick-ass and you don't deliver,

755
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when.

756
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me a break, it's been a week.

757
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got half the crew out doing petty crimes as bait.

758
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're busting our asses here.

759
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing?

760
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're back on the powder now as well?

761
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy, I want a kick-ass party. dumb little fucks.

762
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know a way you can get him.

763
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

764
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, how long you been there?

765
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing? Get the hell out.

766
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you wanna hear it or not? - Hear what?

767
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, look. you're a superhero and...

768
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you can't trust anyone because they'll expose your secret identity...

769
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Comic books this kid reads, all fucking day long.

770
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is, there's only one way a superhero can trust a stranger, and..

771
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I can be that stranger. you've just gotta give me a chance.

772
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I can do it. I just need a few things.

773
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what?

774
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need these things.

775
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are you fucking kidding me? what the hell is this?

776
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's, it's everything I need.

777
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you might have to screw someone over like Louie, or something.

778
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Louie? oh, hey, Chris. uhhuh.

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, or somebody. it doesn't have to be Louie.

780
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tony. - Tony.

781
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tony?

782
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I hate tony. - Yeah, fuck Tony. he's a scumbag.

783
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear, dad, if you let me do this, it's gonna work.

787
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...after a 911 call from someone claiming to be a superhero...

788
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how are things going with Katie?

791
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...watching the entire 'ugly betty' box set and did pedicures.

792
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, the, the longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.

805
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Red mist, how do you see it? - Folks have had enough of living in fear..

00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and Kick-Ass proved that one individual can make a difference.

807
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if anyone out there needs help, I'll be fighting crime 25/8.

00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we turn that off now?

810
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's so special about that guy?

811
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He caught a drug dealer. some most wanted guy.

812
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You saw him bring out a ton of stuff. - That's pretty cool.

813
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he's got a way better costume than kick-ass, too.

814
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's got a cape. - Yeah.

815
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Capes rock.

816
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kinda feeling the cape. looks good.

817
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, better than kick-ass?

818
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're both kinda hot. I just think red mist has a better body.

819
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you think, Dave?

820
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Dave, what do you think? Is that the...

821
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is he the kinda guy you'd go for, with the, all that leather?

822
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Marty, he's not really my type.

823
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,500


824
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass.

825
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red mist.

826
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. fuck me, that kinda hurt.

827
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you okay? - Yeah. no, I'm cool.

828
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe you're here, man. like, you're my hero.

829
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You inspired me. no kick-ass, no red mist. seriously.

830
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. hey, really?

831
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Straight up. and listen, if you...

832
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...wanted me to be your sidekick or something...

833
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna be my sidekick?

834
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, man. you and me together, we would own.

835
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna go fight some crime?

836
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, what you mean like right now?

837
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, man. come on, I got something I wanna show you.

838
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Er, I mean, like to be honest with you,

839
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only ever fight crime between like 9 and 2 weekdays.

840
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm gonna need to get back pretty soon.

841
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet.

842
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that yours? - Meet the mist mobile.

843
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Satnav got my iPhone so I can check the websites for emergencies

844
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we're driving around.

845
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a little bit of mood lighting right there.

846
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rear-view camera. no big deal.

847
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this. You're gonna fucking love this.

848
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mist.

849
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right, we're superheroes, love us.

850
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Smoke? - No.

851
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel a little weed takes the edge off things when I'm on patrol,

852
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know.

853
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going up against a crowd can get kinda scary, don't you think?

854
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something wrong?

855
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so not how I expected.

856
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this e-mail from this chick.

857
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said this guy's been following her home from work.

858
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got her address and stuff. you wanna check it out?

859
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sure. why not? - Cool.

860
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we're sitting there totally naked, right?

861
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I told her, "sit on my lap,

862
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk about the first thing that comes up".

863
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - Just got the text. he's on his way.

864
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did very good.

865
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't kill him till I get there. - Right.

866
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like reading all them comics paid off, huh?

867
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your boy did good, Frankie.

868
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's his father's son.

869
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on now who do you

870
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you who do you

871
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are?

872
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bless your soul

873
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh... I forgot.

874
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're crazy

875
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're crazy

876
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're crazy

877
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like me

878
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb

879
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?!

880
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

881
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, what are you doing? - There are people in there!

882
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. sh-shouldn't we call the fire...

883
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

884
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mikey!

885
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

886
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shit. fuck. - Red Mist!

887
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red Mist!

888
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man, can you hear me?

889
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jeez.

890
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red Mist!

891
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red mist! Where the fuck are you?!

892
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get the hell outta here. dude, move your fucking ass!

893
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

894
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you see those bodies? - Yeah, man.

895
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why did you save the teddy? - What?

896
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, man. come on.

897
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come.

898
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing, Frank?

899
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I can't be here. What if somebody saw me?

900
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That motherfucker kick-Ass burnt down my warehouse and killed my men,

901
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gigante.

902
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait. slow down. Kick-Ass? are you sure?

903
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta help me, vic. My son was there and he's still missing.

904
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all dead!

905
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody in the warehouse is dead.

906
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Put the gun down, Vic, it's Chris. - Chris is red mist?

907
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not red mist you gotta worry about. it's Kick-Ass.

908
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, it's not. Kick-Ass is just some geek, dad.

909
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to worry about him. you need to watch this.

910
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why, what does it do? - Are you fucking kidding me?

911
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:44,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

912
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God-damn it, just sit down.

913
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? What the hell is that thing?

914
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bought this to spy on the nanny when I was a kid.

915
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you remember?

916
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And you put it in the warehouse? - Yeah.

917
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought it'd be cool to put the unmasking of kick-ass on the internet.

918
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch.

919
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told her, "sit on my lap,

920
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk about the first thing that comes up".

921
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - Just got the text. he's on his way.

922
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did very good. don't kill him till I get there.

923
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

924
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who the hell is this guy?

925
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, dad.

926
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Kick-Ass told me we're not the only superheroes in town.

927
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he knows who this guy is.

928
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want this place locked down.

929
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

930
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not until somebody finds this cocksucker...

931
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and pulls his fucking lungs out through his ass!

932
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, they're on to you. do you hear me?

933
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're on to you.

934
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought they were looking for Kick-Ass.

935
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not any more. gigante put on a movie show for us.

936
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Different superhero.

937
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a warehouse, killing a whole bunch of D'Amico's guys.

938
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna guess that was you.

939
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I killed all the cameras. - Apparently not. look, bro...

940
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you need to get ghost, hide yourself quick.

941
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Appreciate that.

942
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mindy... no more homework, baby doll.

943
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for Frank D'Amico to go byebye.

944
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}X-Men, the Fantastic Four.

945
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now, I envied the crap out of them.

946
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything was out of control. I didn't know what the hell to do.

947
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You okay, buddy? you look tired.

948
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Early night tonight, maybe?

949
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there was no-one I could talk to about it.

950
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave? hello?

951
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you bet I will.

952
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never felt more alone.

953
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd always dreamed of being a superhero...

954
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but this was a nightmare.

955
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was time to stop wearing this stupid costume.

956
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there was one last thing I needed it for.

957
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the difference between Spiderman and Peter Parker?

958
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spiderman gets the girl.

959
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I'm Kick-Ass.

960
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Kick-Ass. you mail me?

961
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

962
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck! oh, fuck!

963
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking freak in a mask!

964
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get out of my house! - Katie, I'm not gonna hurt you.

965
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right?

966
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no, it's me, it's me. all right?

967
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I, I was only trying to surprise you, I'm sorry. - Dave?

968
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you doing? why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?

969
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Because I am Kick-Ass. - what are you talking about?

970
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm also not gay.

971
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck!

972
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm an idiot, and a shit friend. I lied to you, I know, and if...

973
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh my god.

974
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. If it makes you feel any better,

975
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, I don't think you can hate me any more right now than I hate myself.

976
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please...

977
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...look, I'm really, really sorry.

978
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never met anyone who's as beautiful and as kind and...

979
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...lovely as you.

980
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You deserve better.

981
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave.

982
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?

983
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom has the burglar alarm on downstairs,

984
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you should probably use the window.

985
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or...

986
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or you could just stay.

987
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay? What like when we have a sleepover?

988
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

989
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

990
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get over it...

991
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on top of it and then into it. right in the middle of it.

992
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, I think I've found one.

993
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's perfect and they can deliver it in 3 days.

994
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, it's 300,000 bucks.

995
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, can you think of anything else you'd rather spend it on?

996
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh my gosh. that is cool.

997
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

998
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Add to shopping cart.

999
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1000
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of Kick-Ass and Red Mist, who would win in a fight?

1001
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are they fighting? that seems stupid.

1002
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think? - I don't know,

1003
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Kick-Ass is cuter.

1004
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1005
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

1006
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I for one would definitely fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

1007
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You would? - Definitely.

1008
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you feel like checking out that new Kate Hudson movie...

1009
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where she's a shoe designer who can't get a guy?

1010
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- we could make the next showing... - Hell, yeah.

1011
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess we're not invited.

1012
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? Come here.

1013
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna convert you to a comics reader right now.

1014
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suddenly I understood why superheroes only existed in comic books.

1015
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got why people didn't risk their lives for strangers.

1016
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, for the first time in my life, I had something worth living for.

1017
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something to lose.

1018
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Katie worried about me getting hurt,

1019
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I promised her my Kick-Ass days were over.

1020
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the truth was I hardly missed it at all.

1021
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hadn't even checked the website for, like, a week.

1022
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm off, then.

1023
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Katie tonight?

1024
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow. Wednesday, she's got one of those volunteer things.

1025
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You seem like a different guy, you know that?

1026
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mom would have been so happy to see you out of your shell like this.

1027
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a good night.

1028
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800


1029
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, baby.

1030
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's going on?

1031
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta do a Kick-Ass thing.

1032
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I thought you were done with that.

1033
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the last time. I totally swear.

1034
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I worry about you.

1035
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I wish you wouldn't worry.

1036
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help it, I do because I...

1037
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I care about you a lot.

1038
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I care about you a lot, too.

1039
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This better be pretty serious, dude.

1040
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cos I promised my girlfriend that I'm done with all this shit.

1041
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about both of us being dead? is that serious enough for you?

1042
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dead? how?

1043
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it turns out those dead guys from the warehouse

1044
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had some bad motherfuckers for friends, and they think we did that shit.

1045
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a price on our heads, man.

1046
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A price on our heads? what is this, the wild west?

1047
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not messing with you, dude. they found out where I lived.

1048
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They trashed my place. I'm fucking screwed,

1049
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and you're next, okay! - All right. what?

1050
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1051
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do?

1052
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember you mentioned that there are other superheroes?

1053
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1054
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, do you think they can help us?

1055
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hot chocolate... extra marshmallows.

1056
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, that looks even cooler than it did in the picture.

1057
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Child, you know that's because in the picture it didn't have Gatling Guns.

1058
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice job. I'm gonna take mine to bed, okay?

1059
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, baby doll. sleep tight.

1060
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

1061
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, kick-ass? - Mmm-hmm.

1062
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:51,800


1063
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go get dressed. I'll tell him to meet us at safe house 'b'.

1064
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll have our hot chocolate when we get back.

1065
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, daddy. - Come on.

1066
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

1067
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you know where that is? - No, but I'll put it in the gps.

1068
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, let's go.

1069
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1070
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, okay.

1071
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well. here you are and... Red Mist. two.

1072
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pleasure to meet you. - Good to meet you, sir.

1073
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, come in.

1074
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After you.

1075
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit girl. manners, honey.

1076
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm hit girl.

1077
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1078
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your ass is mine!

1079
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's with me, he's okay.

1080
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut the fuck up kid. your daddy's the boss. you go home.

1081
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you shitting me?

1082
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fine. He's with me! Let him go!

1083
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get outta here! Get the fuck out of here.

1084
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hot damn. I always wanted one of these.

1085
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you seriously gonna take that? - Yes. come on, sweet cheeks.

1086
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't get your wannabe superhero ass in the car...

1087
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you're gonna have a lot of trouble on your hands.

1088
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's really funny. you're so fired.

1089
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass...

1090
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him outta here, get him outta here. get him in the van.

1091
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick-Ass, I'm sorry, I...

1092
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the car. get in there.

1093
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better fire this asshole.

1094
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ignore him...

1095
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bazooka?

1096
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1097
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:43,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a fucking deal, dad, that I'll get you the guy who did it...

1098
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and all I'm asking is you let kick-ass go. he didn't do anything wrong.

1099
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, you gotta look at this from my point of view. okay?

1100
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta send a public service message to the people out there...

1101
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that being a superhero is bad for your health.

1102
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the big motherfucker...

1103
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...nobody knows who he is.

1104
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not fair. - Life's not fair, get over it.

1105
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do to them?

1106
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really wanna be a part of my business?

1107
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1108
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then sit down, shut up and watch.

1109
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, we're ready. enjoy the show.

1111
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big brother, watch and learn.

1112
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back. breaking news,

1113
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A worldwide web broadcast of the new york superhero

1114
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who calls himself Kick-Ass is about to be shown live.

1115
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rumours have it this will be his farewell appearance...

1116
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that he will announce his retirement from crime fighting...

1117
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but as word of mouth spreads internet providers are predicting that...

1118
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it could be one of the most widely viewed live events in web history.

1119
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Dave?

1120
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no clues as yet as to the exact nature of the broadcast...

1121
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit, have you guys noticed...

1122
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's with Katie, obviously.

1123
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why else would I be here?

1124
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no idea who is behind the broadcast of this show...

1125
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but we could see widespread server crashes...

1126
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, why didn't you tell me this is what you were doing?

1127
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're on the news. Call me.

1128
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We go live to the countdown clock as we are moments away.

1129
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Showtime.

1130
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, boys and girls. now this...

1131
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...well, you know who this guy is.

1132
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this guy here is Big Daddy.

1133
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And these are my friends. come on in, guys, say hello.

1134
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. yeah, there they are. hello, hello.

1135
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, big daddy and kick-ass are gonna help us...

1136
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...show you why being a hero is a bad idea.

1137
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what a silent 'K' is?

1138
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when 'k' is at the beginning

1139
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of the word but you don't pronounce it...

1140
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like in the word 'knuckle-duster'. show them what it can do, guy.

1141
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must've hurt. let's see it from the other side.

1142
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it did. now in France they say the word "stick" like this.

1143
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baton.

1144
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got some of kick-ass's batons. we're gonna show you what they can do.

1145
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead, boys.

1146
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, in america we say "stick" like this. baseball bat.

1147
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is very good for hitting knees and stomachs.

1148
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's also good for hitting balls.

1149
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't do them individually...

1150
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we do them all together.

1151
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, please.

1152
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this looks very painful.

1153
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Due to the distressing nature of the images...

1154
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we are unable to broadcast the events streaming live on the internet.

1155
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1156
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no...

1157
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Despite initial speculation that this may be some kind of hoax...

1158
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or publicity stunt, it is now clear the hostages are in genuine danger.

1159
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That all signs point to the intention to

1160
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stage a live execution in the next few minutes.

1161
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even with my metal plates and my fucked-up nerve endings...

1162
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I gotta tell you... that hurt.

1163
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kerosene. yes, the silent killer.

1164
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not half as much as the idea of leaving everything behind.

1165
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Katie.

1166
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad.

1167
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd and Marty.

1168
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all the things I'd never do.

1169
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like learn to drive.

1170
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or see what me and Katie's kids would look like.

1171
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- or find out what happened on 'Lost'. - Spicy, spicy.

1172
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you think I'm gonna make it

1173
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through this since I'm talking to you now...

1174
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...quit being such a smartass.

1175
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, dude, you never seen 'sin city'...

1176
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...'Sunset Boulevard', 'American Beauty'?

1177
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this...

1178
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for all you cavemen out there...

1179
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is fire.

1180
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1181
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire. fire is good.

1182
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire is our friend.

1183
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

1184
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen...

1185
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...time to die.

1186
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...?

1187
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What the fuck just happened? - Hey, hey, somebody find the lights.

1188
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the lighter!

1189
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's on the floor right over there. find the lighter.

1190
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it.

1191
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1192
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take cover, child!

1193
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now switch to kryptonite!

1194
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kryptonite. yeah.

1195
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to Robin's Revenge!

1196
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robin. Robin, Robin...

1197
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show's over, motherfuckers.

1198
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm in love with her, dude.

1199
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She looks like she's about 11 years old, but...

1200
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can wait. I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

1201
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That should be really difficult for you. are you okay?

1202
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1203
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job.

1204
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so proud of you, baby doll.

1205
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1206
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1207
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But getting shot, daddy, it hurt a lot more than when you did it.

1208
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because I used low velocity rounds, child.

1209
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the kindest daddy in the whole world.

1210
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just...

1211
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... love you.

1212
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, too, daddy.

1213
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, too, daddy.

1214
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep tight.

1215
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

1216
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean your real name.

1217
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A superhero never reveals his true identity.

1218
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? look, you can't go on...

1219
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However you lived before...

1220
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it's over.

1221
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anybody else? Any family or...?

1222
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I can take care of myself.

1223
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saved your sorry ass.

1224
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about money? you gotta think long term.

1225
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got 3 million dollars in a suitcase.

1226
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That long term enough for you?

1227
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not all about the money.

1228
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I owe you.

1229
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it wasn't for you I'd be dead.

1230
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if it wasn't for you...

1231
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...my dad wouldn't be.

1232
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look...

1233
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...pack up whatever you need and we'll go back to my place.

1234
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need to clean my face.

1235
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go.

1236
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant like pyjamas and clothes and stuff.

1237
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't take that stuff to my house.

1238
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what my dad really would have wanted?

1239
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He would have wanted me to finish what we started.

1240
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1241
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

1242
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that security.

1243
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy?

1244
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom already died for nothing.

1245
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm sure as hell not gonna let my dad die for nothing, too.

1246
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do this on your own.

1247
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

1248
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you wanna deal with owing my dad?

1249
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then shut the hell up and pick your weapon.

1250
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what I think it is?

1251
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn straight. you better start reading the instructions because...

1252
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you're gonna be using it in about 5 minutes.

1253
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen up, we got 5 minutes and I want you back on your post.

1254
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't leave a mess.

1255
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everything okay? - Everything's all right, boss.

1256
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe I got my gun back. look at that.

1257
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's not the...

1258
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let her in.

1259
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little kid. what's the matter with you?

1260
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay, sweetheart?

1261
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I lost my mommy and daddy.

1262
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She lost her mommy and daddy.

1263
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna use my cell phone?

1264
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now can you remember the number?

1265
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had I ever been a real superhero?

1266
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The most I'd ever had to offer the world was good intentions...

1267
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and a slightly elevated capacity to take a kicking.

1268
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With no power comes no responsibility.

1269
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except...

1270
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that wasn't true.

1271
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Holy shit. - Boss, take cover, please.

1272
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation

1273
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're living in the past it's a new generation

1274
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A girl can do what she wants to do and that's what I'm gonna do

1275
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

1276
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not me

1277
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not me

1278
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn!

1279
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

1280
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

1281
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in here! help me out man!

1282
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy fuck... everybody's dead!

1283
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's behind the counter. she's out of ammo, okay.

1284
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think they caught him?

1285
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they didn't, he will.

1286
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get out there. - Now?

1287
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, now.

1288
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is going on?

1289
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got her trapped. she's unarmed.

1290
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what the hell are you guys waiting for?

1291
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go get her. - Go on, man. go get her!

1292
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't got no fucking gun. I'm not going in.

1293
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do now.

1294
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now move!

1295
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

1296
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck this shit. I'm getting the bazooka.

1297
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bazooka?

1298
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bazooka?

1299
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only me, boss. everything's under control.

1300
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Un... under control? you're grabbing a fucking bazooka, you dumb ass.

1301
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir?

1302
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:27,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it.

1303
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wanted to say this...

1304
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...say hello to my little friend!

1305
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glory, glory, hallelujah

1306
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- His truth is... - Dirty motherfuckers!

1307
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...marching on

1308
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His truth is marching on

1309
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit!

1310
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is one weird sounding bazooka.
