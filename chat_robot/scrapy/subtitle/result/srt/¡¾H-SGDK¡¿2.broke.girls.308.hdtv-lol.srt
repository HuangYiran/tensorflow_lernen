1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,300
多谢惠顾
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,680
那是我们今晚的第十位同志顾客了
That was, like, our tenth gay guy tonight.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,700
希望这股同志人气比骚当的还要持久
Let's hope our gay buzz lasts longer than Adam Lambert's

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,720
噢 会的 我都投身下去
Oh, it will. I'm all over it.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
我指的是我都投身在grindr了
And by "It," I mean I'm all over grindr.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,290
Max 你为什么用那App
Max, why are you on that app?

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,580
你又不是要约炮的同志
You're not a gay man looking for anonymous sex.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,320
别给姐定型
Don't put me in a box!

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,620
你告诉我要找法子招揽生意
You told me to find ways to drum up business.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,220
而我在用这家伙的巨J来招揽
Well, I'm drumming it up by showing off this guy's "Bid'ness."

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,240
我装作一个粗犷
I pretended to be a rough and

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,260
想着得到抱抱的波多黎各同志
ready Puerto Rican guy who still likes to cuddle.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,060
同志密友就是如此好用
That there's gay chum, my friend.

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,760
噢 我又勾引了个猛男了 拿网来
Ooh, I hooked a big one. Get the net.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,640
嗨 刚有个波多黎各猛男在此吗
Hi. Was a muscular Puerto Rican guy just here?

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,320
他不是刚在这吗
When is there not?

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,980
你想在等的时候买个杯子蛋糕吗
Would you like to purchase a delicious cupcake while you wait?

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,200
好吧 反正我等着
Well, maybe, while I wait.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,140
我的电话说他在此
My phone says he's right here.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,520
来 我们请客
Here, this is on the house,

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,180
因为他就是那猛男
because the muscular gay guy, that's him.

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,020
你是在变性没关系
It's cool that you're transitioning,

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,480
但你应该坦白自己不是波多黎各人
but you really should let people know you're not Puerto Rican.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
他说自己是22岁 充满男人味 我也很不满好吗
Well.... He said he was 22 and butch, so I'm mad too.

Earl 我要今晚的结帐单
Earl, I need my checks for tonight.

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,120
- 美丽动人  - 确定
- Beautiful? - Check.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,220
- 性感诱人  - 确定
- Sexy? - Check.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,140
- 酷炫狂拽吊炸天  - 确定
- Cool? - Check.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,320
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,020
我早来10分钟接班
I was ten minutes early for my shift,

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,920
所以我想有20分钟可以消磨
so I thought "Well, I have 20 minutes to kill,"

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,660
而我闲逛到一间很酷的冲浪用品店
and I wandered into this cool surf shop

37
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,370
我见到一个汉纸在给冲浪板抛光
and saw this guy polishing a surfboard.

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,060
一个在此的冲浪者
A surfer here?

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,620
你不会在威廉斯堡冲浪的 这儿只是上吊胜地
You don't hang ten in Williamsburg, you hang yourself.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
我认同Max说的
I'm with Max, the only waves

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,040
布鲁克林区有的只是热浪 以及罪恶浪潮
we get in Brooklyn are heat waves and crime waves.

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,480
- Earl 你从没去沙滩的吗  - 妹纸你疯了吗
- Earl, you never go out to the beach? - You crazy?

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,520
我才不去当鲨鱼粮食
I'm ain't gonna get eaten by some shark.

44
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,100
而且也没这种时间
Ain't nobody got time for that.

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,560
你会鲨鱼咬的机率也就0.0001%而已
The chances of you being bit by a shark are, like, .0001%.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,140
黑人例外
Not if you're black.

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,110
鲨鱼种族歧视妥妥的
Sharks are racist as hell.

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,940
这是它们叫"大白鲨"的缘故
That's why they call them "Great whites."

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,170
那冲浪者 Marc 我跟他很合缘
Marc, the surfer, and I really hit it off,

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
他很可爱
and he is so cute, like a

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,080
而且他像年轻版 一头真发的Matthew McConaughey
young Matthew McConaughey, but with real hair.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
那即是没半点像Matthew McConaughey
So nothing like Matthew McConaughey.

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,060
真希望他给我短讯 我爱死冲浪了
I hope he texts me. I love surfing.

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,500
我从不下水
I never go in the water,

55
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,420
因为我晓得一但下沉 我会随着去的
'cause I know if I start drowning, I'm not gonna fight it.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,920
我过去在夏天
When I used to summer in

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,300
待在St. Barths时 有几个意大利冲浪猛男
St.Barths, there'd be these sexy Italian surfers,

58
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,190
他们还邀请我们在冲浪上做日光浴
and they'd invite us to sunbathe on their boards.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
虽然他们是抢劫了我们 但那经历太美好了
I mean, they robbed us, but it was amazing.

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,360
Caroline 要是你在找爱水男儿
Caroline, if you're looking for that kind of guy,

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,320
我有个表弟很爱待在海
I have a cousin who loves the water.

62
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,520
因为那是他唯一能动脚的地方
It's the only place he can move his legs.

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,460
- 噢 拍谢不用了  - 考虑一下
- Oh, sweet. No thanks. - Well, think about it.

64
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,200
你可以在任一演唱会坐前排
You'll be at the front row of every concert,

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,680
而且他还不会翻睡
and he doesn't move around a lot when he sleeps.

66
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,140
来 把我号码给辆椅男
Here, give old Ironside my number.

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
啥了 我热爱音乐 而且要是他对我抓狂
What? I love music, and if he bugs me,

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,020
随时能找辆警车来抓他回家
the city has one of those free vans that'll take him home.

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,260
冲浪男约我晚餐了
It's the surfer asking me out to dinner!

70
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,120
而且他想能带我去
And he thinks he can get us into the hot,

71
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,733
新潮热点"Harlow and Daughters"
new spot, Harlow and Daughters.

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,880
噢 就是那取代了完美的"hot dog on a stick"
Oh, that's that trendy restaurant that replaced

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,580
的主题餐厅吧
a perfectly good hot dog on a stick.

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
晚安了 穷逼两后
Good night, broke-ass divas.

75
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,760
晚安 断背侍应
Good night, Brokeback waiter.

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,880
我要去做按摩
I'm gonna go get a massage,

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,680
然后呢 或者要来一发吧
and then, who knows? Maybe give one.

78
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,300
噢 我在说啥 明天我来时肯定有了
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm coming back here pregnant.

79
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,760
- Luis 明天你能帮我顶班吗  - 当然~不~行
- Luis, can you work for me tomorrow? - Absolutely not, no.

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,060
Oleg明天上班 我会叫他穿鱼网背心上衣
Oleg's working, and I'll ask him to wear his fishnet tank top.

81
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,100
那好
Then yes.

82
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,310
跟个可爱男生晚餐 而且还能在热门餐厅里
Dinner with a cute guy who has connections to the "A"-list place?

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,740
我重获旧生了
I'm living my old life.

84
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,600
嘿 各位
Hey, everybody.

85
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,180
你的昔日包括这吗
Did your old life have one of these?

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,070
Caroline 我是餐厅首要规矩是什么
Caroline, what is my number-one diner rule?

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,040
千万别跟人家说肉是假的
Don't tell anyone the meat isn't real?

88
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,000
嘘 少来 肉见故肉真
Shh. Come on. If you can see it, it's real.

89
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,780
别跟人家说你在朋友后车厢买的虾子
Don't tell anyone you buy the shrimp out of your friend's trunk?

90
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,080
他有用毛毯包着好吗 不是这回事
He lays down a blanket! No.

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
不能用电话
No phones.

92
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,846
Max 他订到位子了
Max, he got us the reservation!

93
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,880
我要去新热点餐厅吃晚饭了
I'm going to dinner at the new "It" Place.

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
噢 新热点
Ooh, the "It" Place!

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,900
"来去新热点吃晚餐吧"
"Let's have dinner at the 'it' place."

96
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,600
为何这儿不是热点
How come this isn't the "It" Place?

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,380
这非但不是热点 更像是黑点吧
This isn't an "It" Place. It's more of an "It" Hole.

98
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,360
好吧 那我们要如何才能令此成为热点
Okay, so how do we become an "It" Place?

99
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,620
首先 一把火烧光这儿 重新装潢
First, burn the place down, start fresh.

100
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,580
然后你再制造出
Then you create hype by

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,320
一股难以预订的热潮
making it impossible to get a reservation.

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,770
基本上就是把所有人都拒绝了
You basically refuse to let anyone in.

103
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,940
我可以第一个拒绝吗
Can I be the first?

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,800
好了 我把约会包带上啦
Okay, I've put my date purse together.

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,860
口香糖 眼镜齐全
I've got my gum, my gloss,

106
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,980
这20刀让我看起来有钱
and a $20 bill to make it seem like I have money,

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,740
我明天会把这钱还回餐厅收银机去的
which I will return to the register at the diner tomorrow.

108
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
欢迎你用我的约会包
Well, you're welcome to use my date purse.

109
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,460
有装着雪茄和四角裤的保鲜袋
It's a Ziploc with a cigar and a change of boxers.

110
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,700
手机电充满了
And my phone is fully charged,

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,420
可以用高档叫车服务来载我回家
so I can call an uber car to take me home.

112
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:22,851
高档叫车
An uber car?

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
你才坐不起高级轿车
You can't afford a fancy town car.

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,060
就在昨天 你还拿英式松饼做去角质呢
Yesterday, you used an English muffin to exfoliate.

115
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,440
是啊 然后我还把它吃了呢
Yeah, and then I ate it.

116
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,520
再说了 这信用卡我们俩联名的
Plus, it's on our joint credit card,

117
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,320
意味着你傻逼下用了钱
which means every time you make a dumb purchase,

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,120
你也欠我的
you owe me a joint.

119
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
我不想让他送我回家
I don't want to have him

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,340
然后再误会什么
take me home and give him the wrong idea.

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,950
别这样 请让他误会什么吧
Oh, please do give him the wrong idea.

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,400
整晚都跟那个冲浪男一起吧
Stay out all night with the surfer.

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,500
在单板U型场浪一下
Ride his half-pipe.

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,370
这不是冲浪板  是滑雪板
That's not surfboard, that's snowboard.

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,680
完美啊 因为我对这个对话感到厌烦了
Perfect, 'cause I'm snow-bored with this conversation.

126
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,920
如何 这对咪咪效果好吗
What do you think? These things on full display?

127
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,140
我不想成为那种讨人厌的室友
I hate to be that roommate,

128
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,820
但我没说你可以把借我的咪咪
but I didn't say you could borrow my breasts.

129
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,520
什么 这就是个集中型胸罩
What? It's just a push-up bra,

130
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,420
外加胸垫 一些纸巾 以及胶贴
chicken cutlets, a little tissue, and some tape.

131
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,220
多纯天然
You know, natural.

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,300
快去约会吧
Just go on your date already!

133
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,520
Nancy和我一直在盼着你走
Nancy and I have been really looking forward to you leaving

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,070
这样我们可以光着身子走 顺便来玩猫薄荷
so we can walk around naked and do some lines of cat nip.

135
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,860
哦 这个肯定是他 别担心 他不会进来的
Ooh, that must be him. Don't worry, he's not coming inside.

136
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,760
最好不 我们养不起孩子
He better not, cause we can't afford a baby.

137
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,800
- 噢 就是Sophie  -  就是Sophie
- Oh, it's just Sophie. - "Just Sophie"?

138
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,460
这个我在波兰的脱口秀节目名字啊
That was the name of my talk show in Poland.

139
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,940
我多希望我能上那个节目啊
Oh, how I wish I could have been a guest on that show.

140
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,500
不 没有嘉宾 就是只有Sophie
No, there were no guests. It was just Sophie!

141
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,810
Caroline 你准备好去约会了啊
Oh, you getting ready for your big date, Caroline?

142
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,590
你怎么知道我有约会
How did you hear about my date?

143
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,140
很简单 你的声音
Oh, well, your voice travels.

144
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,360
我承认 我听到那些有的没得
Yeah, I hear everything that does and doesn't happen

145
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,740
这儿或那儿的声音
down here and down there, so...

146
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,820
我只是很开心你要去约会了
So let's just say I'm very glad that you're going on a date.

147
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,500
对了 我给你带了点小礼物
Oh, and I got you a little present.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,480
肉桂味的薄荷糖 你的初吻
Cinnamon mints, for your first kiss.

149
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,360
哦 真贴心 Sophie
Oh, that's so sweet, Sophie.

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,640
是啊 我还给你带了一大袋的套子
Yeah, and I got you a big grab bag of condoms.

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,580
尺寸齐全
I got all sizes.

152
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,420
大号 超大号
I got magnums, I got super magnums,

153
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,320
普通 还有
I got regular, and...

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,340
他是个好人
"He's got a great personality."

155
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,940
给你
Here you go.

156
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,400
通常情况下 "好人"就是我唯一的不碰的
Usually, a "Great personality" Is the only birth control I need.

157
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,020
谢谢你 但是我是个淑女
Thank you, but I am a lady,

158
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,140
不到第三次约会 我还不想用这个
and I won't be needing these until our third date.

159
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,920
你可得快点打扮好
Well, you better hurry up and get dressed.

160
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,680
Sophie 我已经打扮好了
Sophie, I'm already dressed.

161
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,760
你~确定
You are?

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,100
我喜欢今天的这身
And I like what I'm wearing.

163
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,220
真的~吗
You do?

164
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,900
那脸上画点小妆
Well, just put on a little makeup.

165
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,270
我已经画好妆了
I'm fully made up.

166
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,760
你~确定
You are?

167
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,600
或许你可以弄一下你的发型
Oh, well, you know, maybe when you do your hair.

168
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,640
我是有点没把发型放心上
Okay, I'm a little behind on my hair.

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,280
我把胸部看作头等大事了
My boobs were a bigger project than I thought.

170
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,280
我喜欢我这身打扮 也没时间去换了
And I like what I'm wearing, and I don't have time to change

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
因为他已经迟到二十分钟了
'cause he's already 20 minutes late.

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,700
迟到二十分钟
20 minutes late?

173
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,620
哇
Wahh-wahh.

174
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
这就意味着他不来了
That's a no-show.

175
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,260
你被放鸽子了 那人凶残地放你鸽子了
You've just got stood up. You got stood up somethin' awful.

176
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
我才没被放鸽子 我从来没被放过鸽子
I did not get stood up. I've never been stood up.

177
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,680
事实上  我都不知道我是不是被放鸽子了
In fact, I wouldn't even know if I was being stood up,

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,460
因为我好像没什么机会被放鸽子
because that's how little I know about being stood up.

179
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,460
我被放鸽子了吗
Am I being stood up?

180
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,880
才没有 男人都是爱迟到的
No, you are not. Guys are always late.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,800
由此我等一个男的等了三天
I once waited three days for a guy.

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,400
他终于带着赎金出现了
But he showed up with the ransom money,

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,920
然后我再也不用待在冰箱里面了
and you don't see me living in a fridge anymore.

184
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,980
好吧
Okay, fine.

185
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,680
没人被放鸽子
Nobody got stood up.

186
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,520
我就坐在这儿 发短信等着
So I'll just sit here and text while we wait...

187
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,440
大概 永远吧
You know, forever.

188
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,060
当破晓来临的时候
And then, finally, when it dawns on you,

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,160
我们呼唤我们的老朋友 Oleg 抓他出气
we can call our friend Oleg, and he can go put a hit on him.

190
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
也许 他觉得我们定在约会的地点见面
You know what, maybe he thought we were meeting there.

191
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,940
我打电话给餐厅看看
I'm calling the restaurant to see...

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,080
对 你好 Marc Faison有来吗
Yes, hi, has a Marc Faison checked in yet?

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,300
还没
He has not.

194
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,160
现在呢
What about now?

195
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,350
也许他
It's just that he was supposed...

196
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,480
我也很忙啊
Well, I'm busy too.

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,160
别这么狂 你那先前还不是"hot dog on a stic"
Don't be so snooty, you used to be a hot dog on a stick.

198
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,080
顺便说一声 如果他还不出现 那我就还是要裸着
Just a heads up, if he doesn't show, I'm still getting naked.

199
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,460
哦 他来了啊
Ooh, there he is!

200
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,040
不 是亚马逊的
No, it's from Amazon.

201
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,760
有人要送我套"他其实没那么喜欢你"的碟
Someone's sending me a copy of He's Just Not That Into You.

202
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,480
哈 妹纸 就是我
Yeah, I'm here for you, girl.

203
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
好吧 我被放鸽子了
Well, I got stood up.

204
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,160
Max 记住这一刻
Remember where you are, Max.

205
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,400
这一天Caroline Channing被放鸽子了
This was the day Caroline Channing got stood up.

206
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,987
去他的什么约会
Well, screw him for standing you up.

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,360
从现在开始 绝不要相信一个不找黄片的男人
And from now on, never trust a guy who surfs anything besides porn.

208
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,810
喔 看那 "Harlow and Daughters"
Oh, look, Harlow and Daughters

209
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,820
有种旧时杂货店的感觉
has a real old-timey, general store kind of vibe.

210
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,420
我想他们可能是把"星期四回顾"太当真了
I guess they take "Throwback Thursday" Really seriously here.

211
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,800
我是说 这可是1840年啊
I mean, it's 1840.

212
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,320
是啊 我也想带你回到你没被放鸽子前的时候
Yeah, I wanted to take you back to a time before you were stood up.

213
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,110
Max 感谢你带我来这里
Thank you for making me take the reservation, Max.

214
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,440
我是说 否则我只能爬到床上然后独自哭泣到天明了
I mean, otherwise, I was just gonna get in bed and be depressed.

215
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,560
你刚才不就这么干呢吗
You were in bed and you were depressed.

216
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,480
别因为这帮人在重写历史 你也这么干
Don't rewrite history just 'cause these folks have.

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,740
我们人在威廉斯堡讽刺风格里
I mean, we are smack in the belly

218
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,280
我得要滋味一下
of Williamsburg ironic chic, and I want to smack it.

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,980
看 他们甚至还有挂着小孩衣服的乡村风晒衣绳
Look, they even have a country clothesline hung with baby clothes..

220
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,680
我们真该给Han带回去
We should get this for Han.

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,300
这真是我见过最做作的一件东西
I mean, that is the most pretentious thing I've ever seen.

222
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,720
你们好 欢迎来到Harlow and Daughters 我是这儿的老板 我叫Brain-Brain
Hi, welcome to Harlow and Daughters. I'm the host, Brian-Brian.

223
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,760
我刚才错了 他才是
No, that is.

224
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,810
哈喽 呃 Brian-Brian
Yes, hi, um, Brian-Brian.

225
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,110
我们有预订 名字是Faison 两个人
We have a reservation. Faison, party of two.

226
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,360
你们俩都到齐了吗
Is your whole party here?

227
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
这个嘛 我不知道还能怎么到齐
Well, I don't know how whole

228
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
因为我是个私生子
I could ever hope to be, as I'm illegitimate.

229
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
是的 我们都到了 多谢你
Yes, we're both here. Thank you.

230
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,460
所以你和Faison先生都在这里
So both you and Mr. Faison are here?

231
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,080
是啊 大家都知道我变性了
Yes, I'm transitioning. Ask around.

232
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,120
你们可以先拿杯喝的 当有空位的时候我会叫你们
You can have a drink, and I'll call you when your table is ready.

233
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,380
多谢你 多谢你 Brian-Brian
Thank you, thank you, Brian-Brian.

234
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,380
我就在这儿呆着了
I'll be right over.

235
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,340
赶紧用你的大胸给我们在吧台找个地儿坐
Go use your new boobs to get us a seat at the bar.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,660
你好 我知道什么叫 在吧台等候
Hi, I know what "Wait by the bar" Means.

237
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,060
从你这套衣服流行之后 我就一直在餐厅工作了
I've been working in restaurants since your clothes were in style.

238
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,600
它意味着我会给你们找地方坐 当你们的
It means I'll seat you when your...

239
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,380
Brian-Brian 阿B 阿B 小B 小B 别来这套
Brian-Brian, Bri-Bri, B.B., come on.

240
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,230
咱俩都清楚根本就没有其他男人要来
You and I both know there's no guy coming.

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,824
我朋友被放鸽子了 所以你就别把事情弄得更糟了
My friend got stood up, so please don't make things worse.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,860
赶紧把你的酷酷的
Just take out your cool,

243
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,740
小猎刀拿出来 放我们一马
little hunting knife and cut us some slack.

244
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,120
我会给你现金小费 或者让你上了我
This is where I'd tip you with cash or offer you sex,

245
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,260
但是我破产了 而你看着也像个基佬 所以你还是友好点吧
but I'm kinda broke and you're kinda gay, so just be nice.

246
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,040
我们一般不把性向跟工作搅在一起
We don't really need to bring my sexuality into it.

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,220
我懂 就像100年前一样困难
I understand, it's hard to be out 100 years ago.

248
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,200
真有趣
Oh, funny.

249
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,340
这边走 Faison先生
Right this way, Mr. Faison.

250
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,760
哇 ，那真快 他们在这里真好
Wow, that was quick. They're so nice here.

251
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,740
是的 只是普通的人 坐在设计师的泡菜桶里
Yep, just regular folks, sitting around designer pickle barrels.

252
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,240
好吧 这里是你的座位 请坐
All right, here's your table. Have a seat.

253
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,040
好吧 哪里 在这我们都叫做椅子
Sure, where? On these Amish

254
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,800
的阿米什人分娩椅上面吗
birthing stools we're all calling chairs?

255
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,500
开同性恋的玩笑就够了
Stick to the gay jokes.

256
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,680
我们的WIFI密码在牛皮上
Our Wi-Fi password is on the ox hide.

257
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,180
你的服务员马上过来
Your waitress will be right over.

258
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,240
Max 服务员马上会过来啊 而那不会是我们
Max, a waitress will be right over, and it won't be us.

259
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,000
看 满是肮脏木屑的地板
Look, dirty sawdust floors.

260
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,220
如果我们有一袋木屑
If we got a bag of wood chips,

261
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,020
我们的公寓会是新的热点
our apartment could be the new "It" Place.

262
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,100
你好 我叫York
Hello, my name is York.

263
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,400
难以置信 一个男的叫Brian-Brian也能被完爆
Hard to believe, but a man named Brian-Brian has been dethroned.

264
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,600
York吗 真好玩 约是纽约的纽吗
York? That's fun. "York" As in "New"?

265
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,240
"约"就是"约" 只是York
York as in York. Just York.

266
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,500
那你是哪家"女表"
So what's this bit?

267
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,080
好吧 York 我们想点喝的
Okay. Well, um, York, we'd like to start with some drinks.

268
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,700
女孩之夜开始了 所以单身女孩举起手来
Having a girls' night out. All the single ladies put ya hands up!

269
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,800
这迫不得的
Yeah, you can't force it.

270
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,880
我们今晚特别的酒是“天花”
Our special libation this evening is "The Small Pox."

271
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,110
这是苦艾酒 丁香和橘子苦酒
It's absinthe, cloves, orange bitters

272
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,060
在玻璃瓶手摇的
hand-muddled in a mason jar.

273
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,700
这个喝的是Wes Anderson发明的吗
Was that drink directed by Wes Anderson?

274
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,570
我们只是要尽快
Can we just get two of your

275
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,960
的来两杯最便宜的"Ye olde"啤酒
"Ye olde" Cheapest beers as soon as possible?

276
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,980
因为Quinn博士 我需要一些药 女人
Because Dr. Quinn, I need some medicine, woman.

277
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,280
York 特别汤里面有大蒜吗
York, does the special soup have any garlic?

278
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,440
- 哦 天哪 不可能  - 什么 有人制造肥皂吗
- Oh, my God, no way! - What? Is someone making soap?

279
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,604
没有 没有大蒜吗
No. No garlic?

280
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,280
你还一直觉得那冲浪男会来
You still think the surfer's coming.

281
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,340
是的 他可能来
Well, he might.

282
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,960
看 我理应和那男人约会
See, I was supposed to have a date with this guy...

283
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,600
你不在乎的 所以 喝汤吗
You don't care. So, the soup?

284
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,000
当然 我现在只是想要饮料单
Actually, I'm just taking drink orders right now.

285
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,840
哇 谁爱你
Wow, who loved you?

286
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,120
额 我猜她从来没和她妈妈的大麻贩子
Eh, I'm guessing she never went

287
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,380
一起去父女舞会
to a father/daughter dance with her mom's weed dealer.

288
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,662
你不懂 Max 可能他丢了手机
You don't know, Max. Maybe he lost his phone

289
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,360
或者他没有我的号码 所以他只好回到这里
and he didn't have my number, so he's on his way running here.

290
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,410
你觉得他会湿漉漉的出现
You think he's just gonna rush in soaking wet

291
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,160
就像说:哦 不好意思 交通太差了
and be like, "Oh, I'm so sorry. The traffic was terrible.

292
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,760
车都排成龙了
The waves were bumper-to-bumper."

293
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,420
这不是一部Katherine Heigl的电影
This is not a Katherine Heigl movie.

294
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,220
不好意思 电影哦
Sorry, "Movie."

295
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,480
好了 他不来了
Fine, he's not coming.

296
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,240
我才不稀罕Katie Heigl的什么烂电影呢
And I'm not getting into the Katie Heigl thing.

297
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,800
至少此时此地是这样 还是尝尝这橡子吧
Not here, not now. Let's just enjoy our acorns.

298
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,900
哦 "未知号码" 说不定是他打来的呢 喂
Ooh, "Blocked number." Maybe it's him. Hello?

299
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
傻妞儿 挂了吧 他连个鬼影都不会有的
Hang up. He's not coming.

300
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,320
我们喝的东西就在那儿
Our drinks are right there.

301
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,700
它们正在那边等着我们呢 就在吧台上
I can see them over yonder, on ye olde bar.

302
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,560
都一个小时了 我们那个女招待 Lizzie Borden 哪儿去了
It's been an hour, where is our waitress, Lizzie Borden?

303
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,200
或许正在后台琢磨还有什么发音能更怪些的词呢
Probably in the back deciding which words to pronounce weirdly.

304
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,280
饿死老娘了 给姐扯块儿胸垫
I'm starving. Bust out those chicken cutlets.

305
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,780
怪不得他们没有收到任何yelp的差评呢
No wonder they don't have any bad yelp reviews.

306
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
压根儿就没人给上菜
No one's ever tasted their food.

307
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,200
嗨 我们点的饮料呢
Hi. Um, our drinks?

308
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,860
问过大厨汤的事情了吗
And did you ask the chef about the soup?

309
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,740
不好意思 我还没腾出空来
You know, I haven't had a minute.

310
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,760
她还没腾出空来
She hasn't had a minute?

311
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,860
那她都干啥啦 演"与狼共舞"啦
What's she been doing, dancing with wolves?

312
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,820
我说 你遇到过这情况吗
I mean, have you ever?

313
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,760
就是 你还能忍吗
I know, can you even?

314
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,871
我和Byron都等半天了
Byron and I have been here forever,

315
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,570
我们的蒲公英鹰嘴豆鹅肝到现在还没上
and have yet to see our dandelion chickpea foie-gras.

316
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
他低血糖 我是Lila
He's hypoglycemic and I'm Lila.

317
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,940
我是怒了 我去搞定喝的
And I'm pissed. I'm getting our drinks.

318
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,740
- 能麻烦你给我们也来点儿吗  - 没问题 想喝什么
- Would you get us some wine? - Oh, sure, what kind?

319
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,200
给我来点儿霞多丽 Byron白索维农就行
A chardonnay for me, and Byron will have a sauvignon blanc.

320
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,780
- Max 你这是要干嘛 他们会把我们赶出去的 还有  - 还有啥 又怎么了 Caroline
- Max, no, they'll kick us out and... - And what? What, Caroline?

321
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,620
难道担心"他来的时候" 你已经不在了
You won't be here when "He arrives?"

322
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,780
姑奶奶啊 那个人不会来的
Dear Lord, the man is not coming!

323
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,880
我知道 Max 他肯定来不了啦 因为他死了
I know that, Max, and he's not coming because he died.

324
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,020
他死了 这样说我才能好受些
He died, that's the only reason I can accept.

325
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,980
怎么样啊 今晚过得如何
What's up? How we all doin' tonight?

326
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,700
糟糕透了 我女朋友刚把我踹了
Not so good. My girlfriend just broke up with me.

327
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,180
哦 是嘛 那你喜欢金发妞嘛
Oh, yeah? You like blondes?

328
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,480
我身边就有一个 随约随走
'Cause I got one who's ready to pop.

329
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,280
还是算了吧 我喜欢亚洲妞儿
No, man, I'm into Asian chicks.

330
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,340
有谁不喜欢呢 不过亚洲男人例外吧
Yeah, who isn't? Except for Asian guys.

331
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,960
嘿 能帮个忙嘛 多待数分钟
Hey, do me a favor, just wait a minute,

332
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,860
到我那桌 逗逗我朋友
and then come over to my table and flirt with my friend.

333
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,540
有什么好处
Why would I do that?

334
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,780
这个我请
On the house.

335
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,160
这是那个"蒲公英鹰嘴豆
Is that the "Dandelion chickpea and other things

336
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,620
还有一堆不靠谱"的菜吗
that don't belong in a dish together" Thing?

337
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,000
搞定了 你的蒲公英鹰嘴豆
All right, your dandelion chickpea,

338
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,540
一杯霞多丽 还有白索维农 慢慢享用
a chardonnay, and a sauvignon blanc. Enjoy.

339
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,480
你们在干嘛呢
What do you think you're doing?

340
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,100
当然是招待客人了啊 好好学着点儿
Waiting on tables. Look into it.

341
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,060
York York 千万别生气 Byron和我们都饥渴难耐
York, York, don't be mad. Byron was starving and we're thirsty.

342
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,040
千万别赶我们走 我们连爬的力气都没有了
Don't kick us out, we're too weak to go anywhere else.

343
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,740
汤里有大蒜
The soup has garlic.

344
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,830
哦 那就不要了 来份儿马哈鱼吧
Oh, then no. The salmon, please.

345
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,660
给她上那个汤 今晚没人要和她亲嘴
Bring her the damn soup, she ain't kissing nobody tonight.

346
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,720
给我来份儿以为能虎口逃生的
And I'll have the free-range

347
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,100
走地鸡肉
chicken that thought it had a chance.

348
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,960
谢谢你的帮助 Byron希望你能收下这个
For your help. Byron wants you to have it.

349
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,140
Byron才是这里最懂规矩的人
Well, Byron is the only real old-fashioned thing in here.

350
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,180
祝你们长命百岁
I hope you both survive the winter.

351
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,220
嘿 介意我坐这儿吗
Hey, can I join you?

352
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,900
哦 我想这句话是对你说的哦
Ooh, I think that "Can I join you?" Was to you.

353
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,080
当然可以 请坐
Oh, sure, have a seat.

354
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,480
你真漂亮 身材好极了
You're pretty. You have a good body.

355
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,240
喔噢 多谢夸奖
Wow, thank you.

356
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,660
事实上 这话听起来真好
That's actually kind of nice to hear,

357
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,880
虽然难以置信
because this is hard to believe,

358
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,280
但我今晚被放鸽子了
but I got stood up tonight,

359
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,940
所以你夸我漂亮 身材好
and it kind of makes me feel good

360
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,840
我真的很开心
when you say I'm pretty and I have a good body.

361
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,160
你做什么呢
What are you doing?

362
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,600
我在上tinder 就像是正常向的grindr
Oh, I'm on tinder. It's the straight grindr.

363
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,540
有人约我炮 得走了
I just got a hit. Well, I'm out.

364
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,260
谢谢请我喝酒
Thanks for the drink.

365
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,440
你花钱雇人夸我漂亮
You paid a guy to say I'm pretty?

366
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,580
然后他又把我甩了
And then he blew me off?

367
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,590
哦 天呐 我刚想到一件郁闷的事情
Oh, my God. I just realized something upsetting.

368
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,840
是什么 我们马上就能
What, that we could be

369
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,100
到"hot dogs on sticks"吃热狗吗
enjoying delicious hot dogs on sticks right now?

370
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,680
- 不是 我是"B"  - 不 你是A罩杯
- No, I'm a "B." - No, you're an "A."

371
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,280
你今天穿的胸罩托得像B罩杯而已
That bra just makes you look like a "B."

372
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,580
不是 我是说作为女人 我不是最好的
No, I mean me, as a woman. I'm a "B."

373
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,410
要知道 一直以来 我都觉得自己是最好的呢
You know, all this time, I kinda thought I was an "A,"

374
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,660
但也许我只是个"B"等货
but maybe I'm just a "B."

375
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,400
要不为什么刚才那个人甩了我 而那个冲浪的又放我鸽子
That's why he walked away and why the surfer stood me up.

376
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,880
Caroline 我真想在这儿听你唠叨
Caroline, I really want to be here for you right now,

377
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,300
但我要给角落里那个采矿的端杯杜松子酒过去
but I gotta get a gin fizz to the prospector in the corner.

378
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,860
Max 我真的没那么好吗 为什么他都不来呢
Max, am I a "B"? Why didn't he come?

379
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,315
我能告诉你的就是那个冲浪的就是个"D"等货
All I know about that surfer is that he is a "D"

380
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,820
"D"后面还有三个字母呢
followed by three other letters.

381
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
我倒真想写出来给你看
I'd spell it out for you,

382
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,080
但我实在不相信自己的那点儿拼写水平
but I'm literally afraid I'd get it wrong.

383
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,860
你竟然也没否定我是"B"等货
Interesting that you didn't say I wasn't a "B."

384
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,160
听着 姐这辈子从来没用字母给自己打过分
Look, I don't give myself letters in life.

385
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,680
对我来说 那就是过及不过的区别
To me, it is clearly a pass/fail situation.

386
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,220
振作点儿
And you're sitting up,

387
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,280
别自恋 神马都是浮云
not drooling on yourself, so pass.

388
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,320
妞儿们这一晚上都去哪儿疯了
Well, well, well, where have you ladies been all night?

389
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,040
我也搞不清 可能穿越到1846年到1860年的某个地方了吧
I don't know, I'd say somewhere between 1846 and 1860.

390
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,540
能回到1974年真是太好了
And it is so great to be back in 1974.

391
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,500
不错嘛 Han 你干得不错啊 让这个店变得更高档了
Well, Han, you did a good job of making this place exclusive.

392
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,520
高档到没人来光顾啊
There is literally nobody here.

393
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,230
这跟我屁点儿关系都没有 都是刚才男厕里那只负鼠搞的鬼
It wasn't my doing, there was a possum in the men's room.

394
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,350
纠正一下 是现在仍在男厕的那只负鼠
Correction, there is a possum in the men's room.

395
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,160
哦 厨房上演食材大逃亡了吗
Oh, the ingredients are escaping the kitchen again?

396
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,540
我要就去厕所揪出那只负鼠
Well, I gotta go to the men's room and pull out the possum.

397
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,380
哦 我俩不在时你就是这么干的吗
Oh, is that what you do when we're not here?

398
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,880
好了 坐下吧
All right, let's sit down

399
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,880
就坐那个破的快散架了的卡座 再来点吃的
in that authentically run-down old booth and eat something.

400
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,280
是啊 看见没 别以为那地方是污迹 那可真的是血迹哦
Yeah, see, those stains aren't fake, that's real blood.

401
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,200
那家伙被捅的时候我可就在现场
I was right here when that guy got stabbed.

402
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,880
就像我上次说的
Like I said at the time,

403
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,000
"再敢叫我亲爱的 信不信我捅你"
"Call me 'honey' one more time, and I will stab you."

404
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,420
猜我怎么想
You know what I just realized?

405
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:48,427
即使不是最好的 那我至少也货真价实
Even if I am a "B," At least I'm an authentic "B."

406
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,040
我就是我 不会惺惺作态
I don't pretend to be something I'm not.

407
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,200
才怪呢 你就是假装过
You do kind of pretend to be something you're not.

408
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,500
那对假咪咪
A "B."

409
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,860
终于有顾客了
Finally, I have some customers.

410
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,080
要知道 我可是坐在后台
You know, I've been sitting in

411
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,740
看着Oleg在那里撸整晚的
the back watching Oleg shuck his corn all night?

412
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,820
谢大神
Thank you.

413
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,380
现在Luis学会怎么做事了哦
Now, Luis knows how to give service.

414
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,900
算了吧 菇凉 可别这么说 这可是相当的简单
Come on, chica, don't set me up like that, it's too easy.

415
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,840
Max 我觉得还是不要用字母等级来评价自己了
Max, I think I'm gonna let go of letter-grading myself

416
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,450
决定采用你的过及不过理论
and adopt your pass/fail system.

417
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,340
我现在和你面对面而坐就说明我够格了
And sitting with you right here is so not a fail.

418
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,578
哦 是Oleg和Sophie
Oh, it's just Oleg and Sophie.

419
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,660

那个冲浪男  烂到渣
it was gonna be the surfer! Epic fail!

421
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,020
嘿 你们两个怎么又在一起了
Hey, what are you two doing together?

422
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,260
哦 Sophie和我干了件大事
Oh, Sophie and I had some business to take care of.

423
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,120
是吧 Sophie
Right, Sophie?

424
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,100
是啊 Caroline 我们挺你哦
Oh, yeah. Caroline, we got your back.

425
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,820
那个Mike要有段时间不敢再出来冲浪了
That Mike won't be out there surfing again for quite a while.

426
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,020
那个冲浪男的名字不叫Mike 他叫Marc
The surfer's name isn't Mike. It's Marc.

427
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,220
哦
Oh...

428
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,240
怪不得他一直在叫唤说 "我不叫Marc"
No wonder he kept screaming, "My name is not Marc!"

429
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,100
好吧 我得跟你说
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

430
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,600
今天晚上我们遇上的假货太多
we may have seen a lot of fake things tonight,

431
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,380
但那可是一只如假包换的负鼠哦
but that's a for-real possum.

432
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,540
哇哦 Han的负鼠可比我想的大多了
Wow, Han's possum is bigger than I thought it would be.

433
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,120
目前总资产：2420刀
