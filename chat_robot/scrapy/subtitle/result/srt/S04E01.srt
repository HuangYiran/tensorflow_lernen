1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,390
前情提要
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,490
Ellis上校 欢迎你们首次拜访
非常准时
Colonel Ellis, you made excellent
time on your first voyage here.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,190
复制者们知道地球的位置
而这些飞船
The replicators know the location
of earth, and with these new ships,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,690
可以帮他们到达那里
have the means to get there.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,690
那么 我们要炸毁他们的飞船
So, you're going to blow up their ships.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,790
Oberoth...
Oberoth...

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,790
我们攻击你们是别无选择的
你们正在建造战舰 他们必须被摧毁
we had to attack you.You were building
warships.They needed to be neutralized.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,290
现在 你们也是一样
And now so do you.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,990
不管我们躲藏在这个星球上
的哪个地方
No matter where we try
to hide on this planet,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,890
复制者的卫星总有办法追踪我们
the replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,090
我们让城市下沉
We submerge the city.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,690
海水可以减弱光束的强度
为我们争取一些护盾使用时间
The water attenuates the satellite's beam
intensity, buys us some more shield time.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,890
海水没有效果?
The water has no effect?

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,990
有效果 只是距离我们设想的太远
It's having an affect, but just
nowhere near what we want it to.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,290
你想让一颗小行星向我们飞来?
这样做明智吗?
You want to bring an asteroid
towards us?Is that wise?

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,090
Atlantis 要离开这个星球了
Atlantis is leaving this planet.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,590
- 我们飞得还不够高
- 我们没有足够的能量
We're not flying high enough.We
don't have enough power.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
关掉护盾
Lower the shield.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
超光速引擎关闭了
The hyperdrive just
shut down.We are lost.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,890
我们迷失了
我们脱离超空间太快了
We dropped out of
hyperspace way too soon.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
我不知道我们现在在哪
I have no idea where we are.

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,490
她没有反映
而且瞳孔反映迟缓
She's unresponsive and
her pupils are sluggish.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,090
我要你准备手术室
确保我们到的时候扫描器可以用
I need you to prep the O.R.And have
the scanner ready when we get there.

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,300
我们这就开始
扫描器正在就位
We're on it.The scanner
is moving into position.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,500
她要不行了
She's crashing.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,400
伙计们快点
我可不想在走廊里抢救
Let's go, guys.I don't
want to do this in the hall.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,300
好了 好了
Here we go, here we go.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,290
城市内的传感器上线了吗?
You got city-wide
sensors back on-line?

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,890
谢天谢地 是的
正在缓缓启动
Hopefully, yeah.Slowly
booting up right now.

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,990
我们能联系Apollo了吗?
Can we contact the Apollo?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,690
- 还不行
- 为什么?
- Not yet, no.
- Why not?

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,290
次空间通信还没有恢复
Because sub-space
communications are down.

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,590
别担心 我叫Chuck去解决了
Don't worry, I've got
chuck working on it.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,790
也许你应该亲自解决
Well, maybe you should be working on it.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,290
我还有更重要的事要干
I've got bigger fish to fry.

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,300
还有什么能比联系Apollo更重要呢?
What could be more important
than contacting the Apollo?

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,700
这不可能!
This can't be right.

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,400
怎么了?
What's wrong?

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,200
能量!
Power.

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,790
我们正在大量地失去能量
We're losing massive amounts of power.

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,190
- 把它拔出来就好了
- 不行
- Just pull it out.
- I can't do that.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,290
为什么?
Why not?

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,190
等扫描器空出来
我们得让你扫描一下
We have to wait to get
you under the scanner,

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,890
要保证把它拔出来
不会给你造成更多伤害
make sure pulling it out's not
going to cause even more damage.

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,290
拔-出-来!
Pull...it...out.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,590
好好 我懂 你很强悍
Yeah, yeah, I get it,
you're a tough guy.

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,790
如果你要吧的话 请自便...
If you want to pull it out, go
ahead, but I'm not going to--

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,090
你疯了吗?!
are you crazy?

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,790
数到3 准备
On three, ready?

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,090
1 2 3
One, two, three.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,400
清开
Clear.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
充电
Charge it.

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,290
我觉得问题不在我们这边
I don't think the
problem is on this end.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,900
我不管问题在哪一边
我想知道是什么出了问题
I don't care where the problem is,
I want to know what the problem is.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,100
是线路
It's in the conduits.

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,690
看上去...
It looks like...

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,290
几个主要的线路都被光束
的冲击波影响到了
several main conduits
were affected by the beam.

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,790
那就是我们得...
All right, that means
that we'll need to, uh--

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,590
是 是 你应该去...
Yes, yes, yes. You
should get the--

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,390
我会的 但是我得先关掉...
Yeah, I will, as soon as
I've shut down all of the--

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,290
是的 我也一样
Yes, yes, yes, I will do the same thing.

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,790
等一下 这里发生了什么?
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on here?

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,290
我每浪费一秒钟
就会消耗掉更多的能量
Every second I waste,
we're draining more power.

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,290
相信我 我们做的没错
Just trust me, we're
doing the right thing.

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,000
没有效果
No change.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,300
我们试试甘露醇(减小颅内压药物)
静注200cc
Let's start her on mannitol, 200 cc's iv.

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,290
Rodney 告诉我发生了什么事
Tell me what's going on, Rodney.

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,790
长话短说 有一堆不需要开的系统
现在还开着
Long story short, there are a bunch of
systems on right now that don't need to be,

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,790
照目前的情况
它们正在消耗这座城市的"生命"
and given our current situation, they're
draining the life out of the city.

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,090
你不能关掉它们吗?
Can you not just shut them off?

71
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,990
等一下...
Yeah, just wait, uh...

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,090
也许 可以
Maybe, yeah.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,890
快点...
Come on...

74
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,990
快点...
Aw, come on...

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
时间?
Time?

76
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,500
心脏停跳已经2分钟了
She's been flat for almost two minutes.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
求你 Elizabeth 我们这里需要你
Come on, we need you here, Elizabeth.

78
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,100
她的心室纤维恢复颤动了
我们再电击一次
She's going back into v-fib.
Let's hit her again.

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,890
清开
Clear.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,200
好了
伙计们 我们来扫描一下
There we go. There we go.
Let's start the scan.

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,590
Keller医生?
Dr.Keller?

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,700
这可不太好
That's not good.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,590
她的大脑肿胀得很厉害
Her brain is swelling quite seriously.

84
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,990
着解释了瞳孔反应迟缓
That would explain the sluggish pupils.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,790
和其他的问题
Yeah, among other things.

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,200
注射30毫克尼莫地平
还有注意一下她的血压
Give her nimodipine, 30 milligrams q four
h, and keep an eye on her blood pressure.

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,200
(尼莫地平是钙通道拮抗剂,用于保护脑神经元)
Nothing.

88
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,390
都没用

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,190
控制板都失灵了
我没法在这关掉系统
The control grid's all out of whack.
I can't shut the systems down from here.

90
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,290
这座城市在"流血"
We're bleeding out.

91
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,990
我们可以手动关闭系统 不是吗?
We can shut down the
systems manually, right?

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,190
我不认为我们有那么多时间
I don't think we have the time.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,990
你连试都不想试一下吗?
You would rather not try?

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,690
好了 你们是对的
Okay, you're right, you're right.

95
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,790
Zelanka? 我需要你部署一些小队
Zelenka...we need to deploy some teams.

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
她没有反映
She's not responding.

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,300
我们要失去她了
We're losing her.

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,490
我正在派一些人和你们一起
以备需要
I'm sending some of my men with
your guys in case they need help.

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,890
预计5分钟内到达 这时间足够吗?
Their eta is under five minutes.Does
that give us enough time?

100
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,090
我不知道
我们剩下的一点点能量快用完了
I don't know.What little power
we had left is almost gone.

101
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,490
如果能撑到晚上就是很幸运的了
We'll be lucky if we can
make it through the night.

102
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,000
星际之门亚特兰蒂斯
第四季 第一集
<font color="#ffff00">stargate.atlantis
Season4 Episode01</font>

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,390
听着...
Listen...

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,290
怎么了?
What?

105
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,190
你在没有询问我的情况下
做了很多决定
You've been making a lot of
decisions without consulting me.

106
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,690
对不起 我这就像在枪口上一样
事情得很快完成
Sorry. We're a little under
the gun here. Things move fast.

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,690
我知道 但是Elizabeth现在...
I understand that, but with Elizabeth...

108
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,990
不能领导...
incapacitated.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,290
我讨厌这么说 但是...
I hate to say it, but, uh...

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,990
你负责 我知道了...
抱歉
You're in charge.I know, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,890
凡事通知我一下就好了
Just keep me in the loop.

112
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,590
(一种加拿大的学生参看资料)

113
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,590
好的 我会给你 Cole Notes
Okay. Okay, well, I'll
give you the coles notes.

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,390
什么?
The what?

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,990
(Cole Notes的美国版)

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,990
嗯 那Cliff Notes呢?
Uh, the cliff notes?

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,190
你直说不就好了吗?
Why didn't you just say that?

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,990
好吧 不管了
Look, never mind.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,790
我们离开Lantia的时候
我们被复制者的卫星击中了
Look, as we were leaving Lantia, we got grazed
by the replicator's satellite beam, right?

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,190
光束打中了塔楼的一侧
据我们所知
It impacted the side of the
tower, and from what we can tell,

121
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,190
它对一些能量管线造成了很大的破怀
it wreaked havoc on a
number of power conduits.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,790
那么 改变接线不就行了
So? Re-route the power then.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,190
没这么简单
Yeah, it's not so easy.

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,590
你看 ZPM室在这个塔的底部
Look, the ZPM room is
at the base of the tower,

125
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,090
也就是说被击中的管线是主要管线
which means the conduits in and around
where the beam hit are primary conduits.

126
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,890
它们无法被替代
They can't be routed around.

127
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,890
那么城市的部分会没有能量供应?
So parts of the city don't have power?

128
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,790
不是 管线没有挂掉
它们只是损坏了
No, no, no, the conduits weren't
severed, they were damaged.

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,190
这个很复杂
但是就把他们想成...
Look, it's complicated,
but imagine them as, uh...

130
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,790
- 漏了的管子 好吗?
- 好吧
- leaky pipes, okay?
- Okay...

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,790
那么你抽水进去它们会漏 对吧?
you pump water through
them, they leak, right?

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,790
你再讲白痴一点 我就打你了
You dumb this down any more,
and you're going to get hit.

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,790
对不起
Sorry.

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,190
城市发现不管因为什么原因
Look, the city realizes
that, for whatever reason,

135
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,090
能量没有到达外围平台
power's not making
it to the outer piers,

136
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,690
所以 因为城市无法自己修复泄漏
so instead of repairing the
leaks, which it can't do,

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,490
它提升了ZMP输出
这样 即使管子是漏的
it increases the ZPM's output so that even
though the pipes are leaky and we lose power,

138
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,090
也有足够的能量可以到达线路的末端
enough energy makes it
to the end of the line.

139
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,490
- 这么说这很糟糕?
- 没有 这是好事
- And that's bad?
- No, that's good.

140
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,390
如果不这样的话 我们会失去护盾
没有大气 我们就会死了
Well, otherwise, we'd lose the shields.We'd
lose atmosphere.We'd all be dead.

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,390
然后?
Okay...

142
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,390
现在有一些不需要的系统开着
Look, there are a number of systems
on right now that don't need to be,

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,990
而且它们在要能量
and they're screaming for power.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,090
我们可能正在失去致命的量的能量
Look, we're going to lose juice,
potentially a fatal amount,

145
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,690
但是如果我们可以关闭
那些非必须的系统
no matter what we do, but if we can get
those nonessential systems shut down,

146
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,490
ZPM就可以输出更少的能量
到泄漏的管道里
then the ZPM will need to pump
less power through the leaky pipes,

147
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,290
我们也许可以多活一个多小时
and we'll put off imminent
death for another hour or so.

148
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,090
那么 我们的进度如何?
So then, where are we at?

149
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,590
看 各个小组的进度不错
Well, the teams are making good time.

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,790
我们已经关闭了60%的非必要系统
那么...
We've got about 60% of the
nonessential systems shut down, so--

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,090
什么? 怎么了?
What? What's happening?

152
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,090
城市的外围建筑正在减压
而且在关闭人工重力
The city's outer buildings are decompressing,
shutting down their artificial gravity.

153
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,190
城市为什么要这么做?
Why would the city do such a thing?

154
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,790
它正在缩小护盾以节约能源
It's going to collapse the shield.
It's trying to save power.

155
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,590
我们有人在那里
We've got guys out there.

156
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,890
Matthews 马上回到塔里来
Matthews, fall back to
the tower immediately.

157
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,990
我们还没有干完 长官
I don't think we're done, Sir.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,290
城市的护盾正在缩小 行动
The city's shield's collapsing. Move.

159
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,690
你们都听到了 快走
You heard the man. Go, go!

160
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,790
他们会来不及的
They're not going to make it.

161
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,990
阻止它 让它停下来
Stop it. Stop it from doing this.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,390
城市认为它无法维持护盾
除非我们让它小一点
The city doesn't think it can maintain
the shield unless we make it smaller.

163
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,490
如果我推迟缩小
护盾可能会整体失效
If we delay its collapse,
it could fail completely.

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,490
我不管 超驰控制
I don't care. Override it.

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,200
他不让我超驰
It's not letting me.

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,190
我们快到了
We're almost there.

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,390
我们会失去他们的 Mckay!
We're going to lose those guys, McKay!

168
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,390
你认为我不知道吗?
You think I don't realize that?

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,690
人工重力刚刚关闭了!
The gravity just shut down!

170
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,590
生命信号终结
bio signatures terminated

171
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,590
叫其他小队快一点
Tell the other teams to hurry.

172
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,500
我不想让他们在外面多呆一秒钟
I don't want them out there
any longer than they need to be.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,090
你有发现U盘数据率不同步的问题吗?
Hey, are you getting the same data rate
inconsistencies off these flash drives?

174
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Bill? Bill?
Bill?Bill?

175
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,190
哦 对不起
Oh, sorry.

176
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,890
哦 天
Oh, boy.

177
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,290
应该是这该死的失重
It's this damn weightlessness.

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,790
也许你应该回地球上去
You know, maybe you
should gate back to earth.

179
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,990
我可以找别人
帮我把空间站运行起来
I can get somebody else to help
me bring the station on-line.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,890
不用 只要我想出办法让重力恢复
就会没事的
No.I'll be fine, as soon as I can figure
out how to get the gravity back on.

181
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,990
你说U盘怎么了?
Uh, what were you saying
about the flash drives?

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,390
就是我没次更新软件的时候
这些驱动器...
Yeah, it's just that every time I
update the software, the drives--

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,990
飞马系那边的星门启动了
The pegasus gate just activated.

184
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,990
我是Abe Ellis上校
Apollo的指挥官
This is colonel abe ellis,
commander of the Apollo.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,890
中途站 请回话
Midway station, please respond.

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,590
Ellis上校 我是Samantha Carter上校
Colonel Ellis, this is
Colonel Samantha Carter.

187
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,890
我在中途站
I am on the midway station.

188
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,490
任务进行的如何?
How did the mission go?

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,290
据我们所知
Atlantis成功逃离了复制者的光束
Well, as far as we can tell, atlantis
successfully evaded the replicator's beam

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,590
并且进入了超空间
and was able to enter hyperspace.

191
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,790
据你们所知?
From what you can tell?

192
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,690
他们没有到达预定的会和地点
Well, they're not at the
predetermined rendezvous point.

193
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,890
真的?
Really?

194
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
他们应该在那迎接你们的
They should have beaten you there.

195
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,390
事实上 你们是怎么拨通的?
Actually, hey, how are you dialing us?

196
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,990
M12-578没有星门 它不在系统内
M12-578 doesn't have a
gate. It's off the grid.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,590
我跳跃到了最近得星门
来看看他们有没有向你们报道
I jumped to the nearest gate to
see if they've checked in with you.

198
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,590
那么 很抱歉 他们没有
Well, I'm sorry to
say that they haven'T.

199
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,290
这可能不是好事
That's probably not good.

200
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,300
是的 不太好
No, probably not.

201
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,690
我马上回头 一小时之内再打给你
如果联系上他们那会提前
I'll head back, dial you again in
an hour, sooner if I hear from them.

202
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,200
- 可以
- Apollo收线
- Sounds good.
- Apollo out.

203
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,090
嗨 你应该在床上
Hey, you should be in bed.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,090
她怎么样?
How's she doing?

205
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,400
她的大脑正在胀大 很严重
Her brain is swelling, drastically,

206
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,690
已经超过了她头部承受的极限
more than her head can handle.

207
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,990
如果不停止的化
他们就得进行减压开颅手术
If it doesn't stop, they're going to have
to perform a decompressive craniectomy.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,690
简单点说 他们切掉一块头骨
Basically, they cut out
a piece of her skull,

209
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,100
然后她的大脑就可以扩展到外面
and the brain is allowed to
expand outside of her head.

210
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,890
有她的消息吗?
Any word on how she's doing?

211
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,490
她还在手术室
还没有什么实质性的消息
She's still in the O.R. No real news yet.

212
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,390
听着 我想我们得把护盾收缩到
塔楼这里来
Listen, I think we should collapse
the shield right to the tower.

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,490
那会使我们完全暴露在太空中
That will leave us
completely exposed to space.

214
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,590
是的没错 但是我们的能量太少了
Yes, it will, but our power
is spread so thin right now,

215
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,690
我没有任何多余的能量来解决
I don't have any extra juice to come
up with the solutions to the hundred

216
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,090
这么多可以宣告我们死亡的问题
or so problems that could lead
to our premature demise today.

217
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,190
好吧 联系一下Zelenka
确定所有的小队都到了
All right, check with Zelenka. Make sure
all the science teams are accounted for.

218
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,690
已经搞懂 我们准备好了
Already done, we're ready.

219
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,290
好吧
All right.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,990
做你该做的
Do what you need to do.

221
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,000
OK 开始吧
Okay, here we go.

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,100
钙通道抗结剂没有什么效果
The calcium channel blockers
aren't having much effect.

223
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,200
- 颅内压多少?
- 35
What's her intracranial pressure?

224
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,300
我不能让它达到40
I can't let her get to 40.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,300
好吧...
Okay...

226
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
准备进行开颅减压手术
Let's prep for a
decompressive craniectomy.

227
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,590
压力下降到29
Pressure down to 29.

228
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,190
幸运的话 我们可以让它降到25
Hopefully, we'll get it under 25.

229
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,790
是的...
Yeah...

230
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,690
好的 两个好消息
all right, two bits of good news.

231
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,590
第一 我计算出了我们的准确位置
One, I've been able to
calculate our exact location.

232
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,090
那就是说我们可以使用星门了?
Does that mean we can use the gate?

233
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,990
很可惜 不行
Sadly, no.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,890
如果要启动星门
我们必须停留在很小的空间范围
To activate the gate, we require that we
stay within a fairly small area of space.

235
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,690
我们现在移动的太快了
We're moving too fast to use it.

236
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,190
我们能用亚光速引擎来减速吗?
Can we use the sub-lights to slow down?

237
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,590
如果它们在工作的话就太好了
Well, it would be great
if they were working,

238
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,990
亚光速引擎和导航系统不能用
but sub-light and navigation are out.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,990
你把这个也算作好消息?
You decided to put this
in the good news category?

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,890
至少我们不在是迷失了 不是吗?
Well, at least we're
not lost anymore, right?

241
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,490
第二 我们的星际引擎没有损坏
Number two, there is nothing
wrong with our hyperdrives.

242
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,790
那么我们为什么提早退出了超空间?
Then why did we fall out
of hyperspace prematurely?

243
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,090
因为能量管线损坏
The damaged power conduits.

244
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,190
这么说吧 我们的油箱里有足够的油
只是我们没法让他们到达引擎
We had plenty of gas in the tank, so to
speak, we just couldn't get it to the engine.

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,890
我们就失速了
Stalled out.

246
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,490
那么如果修理好管线
我们可以超空间吗?
So if we repair the conduits,
can we jump into hyperspace?

247
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,590
我们就是这么想的
在不降落并关闭系统的情况下
That's the idea, yes.I mean, we wouldn't
be able to repair them completely,

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,690
我们不能完全修好它们
但是我们绝对可以打几个补丁
not without landing and shutting down and
such, but we can definitely patch them up.

249
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,590
Zelanka和他的小队正在以
最快的速度工作
Look, Zelenka and his team are
working as fast as they possibly can.

250
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,890
但是我们还在流失大量的能量
The problem is we're still leaking a lot of power.

251
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,190
即使我们已经减少了这么多消耗?
Even with all our reductions?

252
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,090
恐怕 是的
I'm afraid so, yes.

253
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,790
看 这事这座城市进入超空间所需的
最少能量
Look, this is the minimum amount of power the
city requires to execute a jump into hyperspace.

254
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,690
如果我们不在一小时之内修补好
管线 它就会低于这个水平了
If we don't fix the power conduits inside
of an hour, we'll drop below that level.

255
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,190
如果那样 我们就只有坐以待毙
After that, we're stuck.

256
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,300
距护盾失效大概还有30小时
然后我们就会在真空中死去
We'll have maybe 30 hours before the shields
fail, and we all die in the vacuum of space.

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,190
- 你没事吧?
- 我没事
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

258
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,890
- 他们把玻璃都清除了
- 好的
- They got all the glass out.
- Good.

259
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,190
你需要我帮忙?
You need me somewhere?

260
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,690
我需要你在这好好养伤
Right here getting better.

261
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,390
没事的 我可以走了
All right, well, I'm good to go.

262
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,000
中校...
Colonel...

263
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,490
她没事吧?
she okay?

264
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,090
她还活着 但是状况很糟
She's alive, but she's in bad shape.

265
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,390
她断了6根肋骨
其中一根还穿通了肺
She's got six broken ribs,
one of which punctured a lung.

266
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,290
不过她没有任何脊髓损伤
Amazingly, she doesn't
have any spinal damage,

267
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,490
但是她的头部被撞得很严重
but her head got knocked
around pretty good.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,690
她正在遭受脑水肿的煎熬
那可能造成严重的大脑损伤
She's suffering from cerebral oedema, which
may have caused substantial brain damage,

269
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,490
什么意思?
what does that all mean?

270
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,590
现在说还太早 但是...
Well, it's too early
to know for sure, but...

271
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,190
如果她活下来
我是说"如果"...
if she survives, and I
got to stress the "if"...

272
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,490
她再也不会是原来的Elizabeth
she'll never be the
same Elizabeth again.

273
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,100
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,690
我得去拿点东西 然后到手术室
I've got to get some things
and get back in there.

275
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,190
我们人手不足
绝大多数的人员在Apollo上
We're understaffed. Most of
our team's on the Apollo.

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,090
这边进行的怎么样?
How's it going on this end?

277
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,890
事实上 惊人的好
Actually, you know, remarkably well.

278
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,190
- 真的?
- 没错
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes.

279
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,190
拆解备用导管的部件和控制水晶...
Cannibalizing parts and
crystals from secondary conduits

280
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,790
然后接入到主导管上
and interfacing them with
the primary ones is...

281
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,890
这工作进行的十分顺利
is going very smoothly.

282
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,390
好的 如果我们保持目前的速度
Yes, if we keep our current pace,

283
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,490
我们应该可以在能量低于必须值前
we should be done well before we drop
below the necessary power requirements to,

284
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,890
进入超空间并和Apollo会合
you know, jump into hyperspace
and meet up with the Apollo.

285
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,390
- 这太好了
- 是的 我就知道你会很高兴
- Well, that's fantastic.
- Yes.Yeah, I thought you'd be happy.

286
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,490
高兴?
Happy?

287
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,790
真的有机会让我们渡过这件事
我是欣喜若狂
There's actually a chance we might make
it through this thing. I am ecstatic.

288
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,890
我得去做一点...
I am going to
do a little--

289
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,190
Sheppard中校 Mckay博士
请马上到控制室!
Colonel Sheppard, Dr.McKay, please
report to the control room immediately!

290
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,890
那只持续了... 一秒钟?
That lasted what, like, a second?

291
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,090
你们得看看这个
You're going to want to look at this.

292
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,590
- 那是什么?
- 小行星带?!
What is that? An asteroid belt?

293
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,490
亚光速引擎还没有上线吗?
Are the sub-lights
still off-line?

294
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,790
没有
Yup.

295
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,190
你得扩张护盾了
We're going to need
to expand the shields.

296
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,790
我们没有足够的能量
We don't have enough power.

297
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,190
我们要多久才能到那?
要多久才能穿过?
How long till we get there, and
how long till we get through it?

298
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,790
大约10分钟到达 然后也许2分钟穿过
About 10 minutes until we get there. After
that, maybe two minutes to get through.

299
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,490
两分钟就能通过一个小行星区域?
Two minutes to get
through an asteroid field?

300
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,790
我们不是完全通过
Well, we're not passing
all the way through.

301
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,090
只是蹭一下边缘
We're just going to skim the edge.

302
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,890
你连两分钟的护盾都不能给我?
You can't even give me two
minutes of full shields?

303
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,790
我和你一样想把护盾打开
但是我们承受不起能量消耗
I'd like them up as much as you would,
but we just can't afford the power.

304
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,590
Rodney
Rodney--

305
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,090
Zelanka需要45分钟来完成
能量管线的修复
Look, Zelenka needs 45 minutes to
complete the repairs to the power conduits.

306
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,590
即使我们只开1分钟护盾
就能消耗光他全部的时间
If we raise the shields even for one minute,
it'll eat up all his time. We can't do it.

307
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,590
好吧
Okay.

308
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,190
他们有多大?
How big are they?

309
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,490
我们现在在一个很大的太阳系里
Well, we're in the middle of a
pretty big solar system right now,

310
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,190
小行星带可能是以前行星的残骸...
and the asteroid belt's probably made
up of remnants of early failed planets,

311
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,590
那么 你知道...
so, you know...

312
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,490
有楼房那么大 或者更大
building-size and larger.

313
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,090
我可以做到椅子上
用Drone清开一条道路
I could get in the chair, fire drones,
and clear a path to travel through.

314
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,690
好主意 但是放椅子的房间现在在
护盾外面
In principle a good idea, but the chair room's
outside of the shield right now,

315
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,890
我们永远不可能过去
and we'd never get to it.

316
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,090
我们可以...
Look we could, um...

317
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,990
不 这个不行...
no, that's not going to work.

318
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,490
我们可以...
Uh, we could...

319
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,590
在底部的人有多少有古人基因?
how many people on the
base have the ancient gene?

320
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,090
20左右 不 不 这不是一个好主意
20 or so.Look, no, no. No,
no, no, that is a bad idea--

321
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,790
- 你有更好的吗?
- 是的
- Uou have a better idea?
- Yes.

322
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,690
我会的 我只是...
只是需要更多时间
I can.I just--
I need some time.

323
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,990
联系底部所有有古人基因的人
Contact everyone on the base
who has the ancient gene,

324
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,190
叫他们在Jumper bay见我
tell them to meet me
up at the jumper bay.

325
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,000
好吧 快办
Well, do it.

326
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,690
这就是说我们不能开启护盾
因为我们没有足够的能量
Which means we can't raise the shields
because we don't have enough power.

327
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,790
如果我们不为这座城清开一条道路
它会被撞碎
If we don't clear a path for
the city, it'll get ripped apart.

328
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,290
我们得开上我们有的全部Jumper
So, we're going to take
every last jumper we have,

329
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,590
然后用Drone为这座城
开出一条路...
and we're going to clear a path
through the belt by firing our drones.

330
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,790
对不起
Excuse me.

331
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,790
Jumper我只开过两次
I've really only flown a jumper twice,

332
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,290
而且我从未用过Drone 那...
and I've never actually
fired a live drone, so--

333
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,490
你在模拟里试过 不是吗?
you've done it in simulations, right?

334
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,390
是的 但是...
Well, yeah, but--

335
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,190
它们基本上是一样的
It's basically the same thing.

336
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,790
如果McKay能搞定 你也可以
If McKay can do it, you can do it.

337
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,490
没错 关于这个 我...
Yes, about that,
actually, I--

338
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,490
听着 我知道那很危险
Look, I know it's dangerous.

339
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,490
我知道你们很多人
没在这些事上花很多时间
I know a lot of you haven't logged
a lot of hours in these things,

340
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,390
但是现在这是我们唯一的选择
but right now, it's the only
viable option we have, or, um...

341
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,190
要不然就只有等死了
Or die.

342
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,190
我们行动吧
Let's get moving.

343
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,290
好的 我为你们载入了航行信息
All right, I've loaded a
flight formation for all of you.

344
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,890
沿着你们的预定目标
干掉你们航线上的一切障碍
Stay in your designated positions,
take out anything that's in your path.

345
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,090
Drone都已经装满
所以弹药应该不是问题
You've got a full load of drones,
so ammo shouldn't be a problem.

346
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,290
看上去像老的视频游戏 Asteroids
Looks like the old
video game, Asteroids.

347
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,890
随你怎么搞
Whatever works for you.

348
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,490
我 Asteroids 玩得很差
I was terrible at Asteroids.

349
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,490
我想我有一次得了0分
I think I actually scored zero once.

350
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,990
那么只有一条路走了--向上
Then there's only one
way to go, and that's up.

351
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,590
好了 大伙 我们走
All right, everyone. Let's go.

352
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,090
打开Jumper Bay舱门
Open the jumper bay doors.

353
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,190
快点 伙计们 保持队形
Come on, guys, stay in formation.

354
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,690
我们不能留出任何空隙
We can't afford any gaps.

355
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,090
没错 就是这样
看见了 不是很难
Yeah, there you go.
See? Not so hard.

356
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,390
Jumper们 你们应该在3秒内到达
Jumpers, you should
be in range in three...

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,790
2...
two...

358
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,790
1...
one.

359
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,390
随便开火
Fire at will.

360
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,290
打的漂亮 伙计们
Nice shooting, people.

361
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,090
它们的数量太多 速度太快
我们不能全部都打中
There's too many of them and they're coming
in too fast.We're not going to get them all.

362
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,090
加强火力 一次发射4个
Double up, fire four a-piece.

363
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,190
我一次控制不了4枚Drone
I can't control four
drones at the same time.

364
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,290
集中注意力
Just concentrate.

365
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,690
该死!
Damm it!

366
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,590
别担心 你说的没错
Don't worry about it.You were right.

367
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,690
我们没法在第一次穿越的时候
就全部搞定
We can't get everything
on the first pass.

368
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,390
他们有清除足够的小行星吗?
Have they destroyed enough
asteroids to clear a path?

369
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,490
我们就快知道了!
(中国人! 中国人!!)
We're about to find out.

370
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,590
那么 现在做什么?
Well, now what?

371
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,090
按我的指令 Bolton和Levine...
Well,on my mark,you,bolton,and levine

372
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,490
将离开队形掉头回城
are going to break formation
and head back to the city.

373
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,190
打掉我们错过的东西
Take out anything that we missed.

374
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,290
哦 那听上去很重要
也许别人应该去...
Oh, that sounds important.
Maybe someone else should--

375
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,790
脱离!
Break!

376
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,490
McKay...
McKay...

377
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,890
你左边有一个打的
you've a big one on your left.

378
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,590
- 我看见了
- 10秒内冲撞
- I see it.
- Impact in 10 seconds.

379
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,990
那是什么?
What was that?

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,190
小碎片正在通过
Smaller pieces getting through.

381
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,590
其中一些明显不够小
Some of them evidently not so small.

382
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,990
现在破怀被限制在城市边缘
Right now damage is confined
to the outer edge of the city.

383
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,590
希望它保持这样
Let's hope it stays that way.

384
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,990
好了 我们通过了
All right, we're through.

385
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,690
我们现在回头 带上掉队的人
Now we're going to double
back, pick up any stragglers.

386
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,090
好了
That's it.

387
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,790
我们成功了
We made it.

388
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,990
我不敢相信这真的成功了
真是太惊人了
I can't believe that actually
worked. That was amazing.

389
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,090
你干得很不错 Rodney
You did good, Rodney.

390
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,090
Zelenka现在应该修好导管了
Zelenka and his team should
have the conduits repaired now,

391
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,390
那么我想我们终于可以脱身了
so I think we're
finally out of the woods.

392
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,790
Sheppard中校 McKay博士
请立即到控制室
Colonel Sheppard, Dr.McKay, please
report to the control room immediately.

393
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,790
啊 拜托!
Aw, come on!

394
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,990
发生了什么?
What the hell happened?

395
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,490
超空间引擎离线了
The hyperdrive is offline.

396
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,490
我以为它是好的
I thought it was good to go.

397
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,890
原来是 但是有几块大石头
撞击了城市
It was, but a few large pieces
of rock impacted the city,

398
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,190
有一个控制阵列损坏了
and one of the control
arrays was damaged.

399
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,790
在我们修好之前 我们不能跳跃
We can't jump until we fix it.

400
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,390
我告诉过你我对付小行星不行
I told you I was no good at Asteroids.

401
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,090
损坏的管线在城市的外围
The damaged conduits are on
the outer edge of the city,

402
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,090
很遗憾 那里不在护盾的保护之内
which, sadly, is outside of
the protection of the shield.

403
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,190
我们可以用传送机尽可能的靠近
We can use the transporters
to get us very close,

404
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,290
但是还是需要太空行走的
but it will still require a space walk.

405
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,590
这也不是很糟糕
That shouldn't be too bad.

406
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,390
如果不是那些微行星
这就是小菜一碟
It'll be a breeze, with the
exception of the micro-asteroids.

407
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,390
什么东西?
The what?

408
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,790
我们刚刚通过一个小行星带
We just came through an asteroid belt.

409
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,790
主要的部分在我们的后面 但是
还有一些子弹大的小石头在前面
The big stuff's behind is, but there's a
bunch of little bullet-sized rocks out there.

410
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,390
小石子弹
Tiny rock bullets.

411
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,090
太好了
Great.

412
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,090
我确定你们会没事的
I'm sure you'll be fine.

413
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,290
那么 你为什么不去?
Well, then why aren't you going?

414
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,190
因为你已经研究出详细的修复方法了
Well, because you've already worked
out the details of the repair.

415
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,390
如果你要再教我 那就是浪费时间
You know it will be a waste
of time getting me up to speed.

416
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,890
说道时间 我们还有多少?
Speaking of time, how much do we have?

417
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,990
你们穿好宇航服以后 15分钟
Well, once you're suited
up, uh...15 minutes?

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,890
就这么多?
That's it, huh?

419
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,390
嘿 如果不是我们没有对管线的
修复减慢了能量流失
Hey, if the patch-job we did on the
conduits hadn't slowed down the power loss,

420
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
我们早就到死亡线了
we'd have hit the deadline already.

421
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,000
你们可以搞定的
You can do this.

422
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,000
好的
Right.

423
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,790
Mckay! 我一直在找你
McKay! I've been trying to reach you.

424
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,490
你知道 我再拯救城市等等
Elizabeth怎么样了?
Well, you know, trying to save the
city and whatnot. Look, how's elizabeth?

425
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,290
这就是我要和你谈的 她很不好
I need to talk to you. She's really bad.

426
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,790
实际上 她伤的太重
我们已经无能为力了
She's so far gone, I don't think
there's anything we can do to heal her.

427
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,090
我的天 你确定吗?
Oh, my god. Are you sure?

428
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,290
我用尽了所有的医学方法
但是没有一个有效
I've exhausted every medical
possibility, and none of it's worked.

429
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,490
她  她会死吗?
She... she's going to die?

430
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,890
我还有一个想法
但是我需要你的帮助
Well, I do have one more
idea, but I need your help.

431
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,790
我? 你要我干什么?
Me? What do you need me for?

432
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,290
看见这些了吗?
See those?

433
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,390
他们是什么?
What are they?

434
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,190
记得Weir博士被复制者攻击的时候
他使她感染了...
Remember when Dr.Weir was attacked by
that replicator, and he infected her--

435
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,390
纳米机器人
Nanites.

436
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,990
Carson用电磁脉冲使它们失效了
Carson was able to render them inert
using an electro-magnetic pulse.

437
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,090
但是它们还在她的身体里
But they're still in her system.

438
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,000
你真是个天才
You're a genius.

439
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
我就是想拯救一条生命
Well, you know, trying to
save a life and whatnot.

440
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,790
你要什么?
You want to what?

441
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,790
重新激活Wier身上的纳米机器人
Reactivate Weir's nanites.

442
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,690
那是个很恐怖很恐怖的主意
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

443
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,090
什么? 我会重新编程的
What? I'd reprogram them.

444
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,090
不要
No.

445
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,390
John 我们快要失去她了
John, we are losing her here.

446
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,990
Keller和她的小队已经竭尽全力了
Keller and her team have
done everything they can.

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,790
如果我能重新编程这些机器人
让他们修复她的身体...
If I can reprogram the nanites to help repair her body
without trying to take over her brain then--

448
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,190
好大一个"如果" 不是吗?
Well, that's a big "if", isn't it?

449
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,990
我很确信我能重新编程
以达到我们的目的
I'm fairly confident I can reprogram
them to do only what we want.

450
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,990
"很确信"?
"Fairly confident?"

451
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,690
如果它们恢复了并且
和其他复制者通讯 怎么办?
What if they come back online and start
communicating with the other replicators?

452
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,790
我们现在最不需要的就是一堆
机器战舰出现
The last thing we need right now is
a bunch of robot warships showing up.

453
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,690
你在听吗?
Are you listening?

454
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,990
听着 我说了 我可以让他们
变得完全无害
Look, I said I can reprogram
them to be completely harmless.

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,990
在你确定之前
我不会再继续这个谈话
I am not having this
conversation until you're sure.

456
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,600
我和别人一样想救活Elizabeth
I want to save Elizabeth
as much as anyone,

457
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,090
但是她不会想让我们置这座城
于险境 即使是为了救她自己
but she wouldn't want us risking
the city, not even for her.

458
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
顺便说一下 你的决定是对的
That was the right call, by the way.

459
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,000
希望如此
Yeah, let's hope so.

460
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,790
Apollo有来消息吗?
Any word from the Apollo?

461
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,090
没 还没有
No, not yet.

462
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,590
你在干什么?
What you working on?

463
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,490
我正尝试找一个方法
找到或者联系Atlantis
I'm actually trying to figure out
a way to find or contact Atlantis.

464
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,190
他们明显偏离航向了 不是吗?
Well...they've obviously
veered off course, right?

465
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,090
上一次有人用Atlantis的
超空间引擎是什么时候?
Like, when was the last time
Atlantis' hyperdrives were used?

466
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,390
一百万年前?
Like, a million years ago?

467
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,790
我是说 谁知道这样的闲置会
造成什么样的影响?
I mean, who knows what that kind of
inactivity could have done to them.

468
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,390
我想 他们更有可能是脱离
超空间过早了
I think it's more likely that they
jumped out of hyperspace too soon.

469
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,290
他们只有一个ZPM来飞行
They were only flying with one ZPM.

470
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,890
也许McKay低估了飞行所需的能量
Maybe McKay under-estimated
the power requirements.

471
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,100
Mckay? 啊!
McKay? Ah...

472
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,890
不管怎么样 我知道怎么找到他们
Either way, I know how to find them.

473
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,690
真的?
Really?

474
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,690
没错 我们做一个AGB
全星门广播
Yeah, we do an A.G.B.,
An all gates bulletin.

475
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,190
这有点像一个全面通缉(APB)
只是使用了星门
It's like an all points
bulletin, only with stargates.

476
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,490
- 哦 好了...
- 不 是真的
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, really.

477
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,890
我们写一个程序同时
拨打飞马系里所有的星门
We'll create a program, we'll dial all
the gates in the Pegasus Galaxy at once,

478
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,990
然后尝试同Atlantis建立无线电联系
and try to establish radio
contact with Atlantis.

479
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,490
但是Atlantis的星门还不在系统内
But the Atlantis gate is off the grid.

480
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,990
没错 但是如果他们和另一个星门
靠的足够近...
Right, but if they're
close to another gate--

481
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,390
那么他们现在就应该联系上我们了
then they would have
contacted us by now.

482
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,390
没错
Yeah.

483
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,990
那么 你想到了什么?
So, uh, what have you come up with then?

484
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,490
还没有 但是...
Well, nothing yet, but--

485
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,890
至少我在尝试了
well, at least I am trying.

486
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,790
我在想点子 我...
I'm generating ideas here. I...

487
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,900
对不起
Sorry.

488
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,790
我事实上很惊讶
I'm actually surprised.

489
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
这各区域的损伤看上去很小
The damage in this area
seems to be quite minimal.

490
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,100
我猜正好相反
I beg to differ.

491
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
哦 我的天
Oh, my.

492
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,400
让我猜
Let me guess..

493
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,590
控制阵列在那边
the array is over there.

494
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,190
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

495
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,100
太好了
Great.

496
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,600
那该死的是什么?
What the hell was that?

497
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,500
微行星
Micro-asteroid.

498
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,890
好的...
Right...

499
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,890
好
All right.

500
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,990
看上去我们得跳过去
Looks like we're going to have to jump.

501
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,590
但我跳不了100英尺(300米)
But I can't jump 100 feet.

502
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,490
我们在宇宙空间 记得吗?
We're in space, remember?

503
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,890
这不算太远
It's not that far a distance.

504
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,390
我要这个绳索拴住你
Look, I'm going to hook you
up with this tether, okay?

505
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,090
然后我解除你靴子的磁力
Then I'm going to
demagnetize your boots.

506
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,590
- 然后我把你扔出去
- 等等 什么?
- Then I'm going to throw you.
- Wait, what? What?

507
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,990
然后我在绳索拉紧之前
解除我靴子的磁力
Then I'm going to demag my
boots before the tether catches.

508
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,190
你的惯性应该会把我们两个
都拉到走廊的洞里
Your inertia should pull both of us
over the hole and onto the hallway.

509
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
这会很简单的
It'll be a cinch.

510
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,100
但是如果你弄偏了怎么办?
But what if you miss?

511
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,190
你只能相信我了 博士
You're just going to
have to trust me, Doc.

512
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,290
相信我至少可以扔得动你
Trust me as far as I
can throw you, actually.

513
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
- 很好笑
- 好吧 我们干吧
- Very funny.
- All right, let's do this.

514
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,100
那... 太不可置信了
That was... was unbelievable.

515
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,100
开始工作吧
Let's get to work.

516
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,000
好的
All right.

517
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,400
进行的如何?
How's it going?

518
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,100
很慢
Slowly.

519
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,990
你有找到安全激活这些纳米机器
的方法吗?
Have you found a way to
reactivate the nanites safely?

520
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,700
- 简单点说 是的 复杂点说 没有
- 什么?
- Short story, yes.Long story, no.
- What?

521
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,290
我百分之百确定我可以激活它们
I'm 100% certain that I
can reactivate the nanites

522
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,100
而且让它们帮助Elizabeth恢复
and have them help put
Elizabeth back together.

523
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,200
好的...
Okay...

524
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,690
问题是它们会用复制出来的机器
替换损坏的细胞
The problem is, that they would do it by replacing
her damaged cells with replicated nanites,

525
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,990
那么一旦我让他们关闭...
so the moment I tell
them to turn inert again--

526
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,290
这些细胞会停止工作
然后她会死
those cells would stop
functioning, and she'd die.

527
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:51,400
是的
Yeah.

528
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,490
好消息是我可以让他们...
Well, the good news is, I've been
able to program them in such a way

529
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,790
不会伤害她 这一点我很确定
that they would never
harm her, I'm sure of that.

530
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,490
而且我已经关闭了它们的
次空间通讯能力
Plus, I've shut down their ability to
contact the replicators via subspace,

531
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,600
那么她和我们都会很安全
但是她下半辈子就会成为半复制者
so both she and we would be safe, but she'd
be part replicator for the rest of her life.

532
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,690
Sheppard肯定不希望这样
Yeah, Sheppard's not
going to go for that.

533
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,090
也许我可以让它们修复她自身的有机细胞
There's a slight possibility I might be able
to make them help repair her organic cells,

534
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,790
然后在完成之后关掉它们...
and then shut down when
they're done, but...

535
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,290
可我需要更多的时间
I'm going to need more time.

536
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,200
好吧 交给你了 祝好运!
Okay, well, I'll leave
you to it then. Good luck.

537
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,600
谢了
Mm, thanks.

538
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,290
抱歉 我可能需要更多时间
I'm sorry.It's taking
longer than I expected.

539
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,990
手套妨碍了速度
These gloves are making
the work so much slower.

540
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,690
别担心
Don't worry about it.

541
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,700
还剩四分钟我们的能量就不足以
跳入超空间了
We've still got four minutes before the
energy dips too low and we can't make the jump.

542
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,490
所以 也不要有太大压力
So, no pressure then.

543
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Radek!
Radek!

544
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,790
听我说 他们...
Listen, they, uh...

545
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,690
他们说你听不到我说话 可我...
they say you can't
hear me, but I just...

546
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,790
我只想...
I just wanted to, um...

547
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,390
只想说谢谢你
I just wanted to thank you.

548
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,690
谢谢你...
Thanks for letting me...

549
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,990
两年前接纳了我
stay here a couple of years ago.

550
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,690
因为我不知道还能不能...
Because I don't know if
I would still be, um...

551
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,990
谢谢你 Weir博士
Thank you, dr.Weir.

552
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,490
我做错什么了?
What did I do?

553
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,090
没什么 不是你的原因
不过你得离开一下
Nothing, it wasn't you,
but you need to leave.

554
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,390
再挂一袋甘露醇
Hang another bag of manitol.

555
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,990
你被一块小殒石击中了 疼不疼?
You've been hit by a
micro-asteroid. Does it hurt?

556
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,290
不疼
It doesn't.

557
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,090
你在发抖
You're in shock.

558
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,290
我的太空服破了一个洞
There's a hole in my suit.

559
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,990
没关系 我调节了一下上面的按钮
用来增加压力
It's okay. I've dialed up controls
to create positive pressure.

560
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,790
我去叫一艘Jumper飞船
必须马上送你去手术室
I'm calling a jumper. I've
got to get you to the O.R.

561
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,290
我们现在不能走
We can't leave yet.

562
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,490
我必须完成修复工作
I have to finish the repairs.

563
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,690
告诉我怎么做就行了
Just tell me what to do.

564
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,190
这太复杂了
It's too complicated.

565
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,390
我已经快完成了
I'm almost finished.

566
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,990
帮帮忙 帮我转过身去
Please, help me turn around.

567
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,990
Mckay博士?
Dr. McKay?

568
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,090
什么事 Keller?
What is it, Keller?

569
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,590
Elizabeth快要不行了
如果我们再不开始 可能就没机会了
Elizabeth is crashing. If we're going
to do this thing, we need to do it now.

570
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,590
我还需要些时间
I need more time.

571
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,890
我们没有时间了
We don't have more time.

572
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,790
我没法维持她的血压
如果她的颅压还在继续升高
I can't keep her blood pressure up,
and if her ICP continues to climb,

573
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,690
就没办法挽救了
there's no bringing her back.

574
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,990
好吧 我现在就把程序传给你
Okay, I'm transferring
the program to you now.

575
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,000
我这就过来
I'm on my way.

576
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,790
如果他们的确是过早脱离超空间
那么最简单的方法就是
You know, the easiest thing to do if they
really did fall out of hyperspace early

577
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,190
沿着去往M12-578的路线原路返回
is to fly back over the path
between M12-578 and Atlantis.

578
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,890
可这要花费上百万年
Well, that would take
over a million years.

579
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,390
这也就是我们使用超空间的原因
That's why we have hyperspace.

580
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,590
我们可以使用Apollo号上的
远程探测器
We could use the Apollo's
long-range sensors.

581
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,290
可那些远程探测器
不能在超空间中工作
Those long-range sensors,
they don't work in hyperspace.

582
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,390
这我知道 可我们可以在超空间中
跳跃一小段  然后出来看看
I know, but we could make
a little jump, look around,

583
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,090
然后再跳一小段 再出来看看...
make another little
jump, look around, and...

584
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,090
直到找到他们
until we find them.

585
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,290
这个办法好
Yeah, that's good.

586
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,790
好吧 如果合理的安排跳跃
我们需要跳跃...
Uh, so using those sensors,
conservatively, we'd have to make...

587
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,990
180,000次
180,000 little jumps.

588
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,890
这需要好几年
It'd take a few years.

589
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,390
除非他们大幅增加
远程探测器的探测距离
Unless they seriously augment
the long-range sensors.

590
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,790
好啊 可谁能办到呢?
Oh, yeah, who's going to do that?

591
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,590
他们的飞船上又没有Asgard
It's not like they
have an Asgard on board.

592
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,100
去一趟飞马星系如何?
Feel like taking a little
trip to the Pegasus Galaxy?

593
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,290
还剩最后几个调整
Just some final adjustments.

594
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,890
你干得很棒 Radek
You're doing a great job, Radek.

595
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,990
我已经叫了一艘Jumper
I've called a jumper.

596
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,290
好了 完成了
There. I'm done.

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,090
控制室 我是Sheppard
Control room, this is Sheppard.

598
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,090
等我们回到护盾区域之后
马上进行超空间跳跃
As soon as we get inside the
shield, activate the hyperspace jump.

599
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,890
抱歉 John 我们办不到
I'm sorry, John, but we can't.

600
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,490
为什么? Zelenka已经修好了
Why not? Zelenka just finished repairs.

601
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,790
是的 这我知道
可我们的能量刚刚跌入警戒线以下
Yes, I know, but we've
just dropped below the line.

602
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,400
没有足够的能量了
We don't have enough power.

603
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,790
他没什么事吧?
Is she going to be okay?

604
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
我想是的 还好没有击中大动脉
I think so. It didn't
hit any major arteries.

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,000
真走运
Lucky.

606
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,390
我可不这么认为 现在他跟我们一样
被困在这里了
I wouldn't say that. He's still
stuck here just like the rest of us.

607
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,890
是啊
So it's true.

608
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,690
终于修复了超空间引擎
可我们又没有足够的能量发动
Finally fixed the hyperdrive, now we
don't have enough juice to go anywhere.

609
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,890
在护盾失效之前 我们还有28个小时
We've only got 28 hours
before the shields fail.

610
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,890
有什么计划?
So, what's the plan?

611
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,590
不知道 我要去找Mckay
I don't know, I got to find McKay.

612
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,790
他来了
He's in there.

613
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,090
什么?
What?

614
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,690
嘿!
Hey!

615
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,490
我听说了 我们没有及时修好阵列
I heard we didn't get
the array fixed in time.

616
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,190
你刚才在干什么?
What were you doing in there?

617
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,790
听着 她就要死了 知道么?
Look, she was dying, okay?

618
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,890
Rodney...
Rodney...

619
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,090
她的心脏快不行了
神经系统也濒临崩溃
look, her heart was weak,
her nervous system was fried.

620
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,390
你干什么了?
What did you do?

621
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,290
我重新激活了那些纳米机器人
I reactivated the nanites.

622
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,390
真该死 Mckay!
Damn it, McKay!

623
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,890
你当时很忙! 在这生死攸关的时刻
如果我不采取行动的话...
Look, you were busy! It was
life or death. If I didn't act--

624
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,290
是的  她会死的 我知道!
Yes, she would have died, I know!

625
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,690
我知道你在想什么 可是救了Elizabeth
并不一定就等于将我们置于危险境地
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but
helping Elizabeth is not putting us at risk.

626
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,490
你刚刚激活了复制者的纳米病毒
You just reactivated
the replicator nanites.

627
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,690
它们是无害的
They're harmless.

628
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,090
我可以百分之百肯定 它们不会控制她
并跟其他复制者联系!
Look, I am 100% certain they're not going to
try to take her over her, or contact the others!

629
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,090
不 不 你永远都不能肯定
No, no, you can't know that for sure.

630
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,190
不 我可以
Yes. Yes, I can.

631
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,090
关掉它们
Shut it down.

632
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,490
可...这会害死她
But...that would kill her.

633
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,690
如果是Elizabeth 她会怎样做?
你认为她愿意看到这种结局?
What would Elizabeth want?
Do you think she'd want this?

634
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,790
是的 她肯定会跟你一样
Yes. She'd sure as hell
do the same for you.

635
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,590
那很显然 你还不是很了解她
Then you obviously
didn't know her very well.

636
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,490
好吧 也许吧 再等些时候
你自己去问她吧...
Well, maybe not, but you know what, give
it some time, you can ask her, herself--

637
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,090
不行! 这样太危险了
立刻把它们关掉
No! It's too dangerous.
Shut it down right now.

638
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,090
不 我不去
No. No, I'm not going to.

639
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,890
Meyers...
Meyers...

640
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,290
拿一台EMP(电磁脉冲)发生器到手术室来
bring an EMP generator to the O.R.

641
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,090
你能不能听我一句话?
Would you please just listen to me?

642
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,090
Keller医生!
Dr. Keller!

643
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,390
John...
John...

644
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,790
Rodney...
Rodney...

645
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,290
发生什么了?
What's going on?

646
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,390
没必要进行隔离
The quarantine is unnecessary.

647
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,490
如果发生意外 我看你怎么交待
Well, you'll excuse me if
I wait for a second opinion.

648
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,490
这太荒谬了
Okay, this is stupid.

649
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,290
- 什么?
- 我们之间吵架
- What is?
- Us fighting.

650
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,790
我知道你对我有些不满
也许你有一些借口
Look, I know you're not happy with
me, and you may have some cause.

651
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,090
可不管怎么样 如果我们想不出
一个脱身的办法 这又有什么用呢?
Anyway, it's not going to matter much if
we don't figure a way out of this, right?

652
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,090
我们必须相互协作 所以...
Look, we have to work together, so...

653
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,090
我...我很抱歉
so, so I'm...I'm sorry.

654
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,300
接受你的道歉
Apology accepted.

655
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,000
好吧
All right.

656
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,390
该有人去跟她说说话
Well, someone should talk to her.

657
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Teyla在里面
Well, Teyla's in there.

658
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,290
好的
All right.

659
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,490
他们不该这样做的
They shouldn't have done this.

660
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,390
我们都不想失去你 Elizabeth
None of us wanted to
lose you, Elizabeth.

661
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,190
可要是那些纳米机器人
联络其他复制者呢?
And what happens if the nanites are
able to contact the other replicators?

662
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,790
Rodney相信这是不可能的
Rodney does not believe
that is possible.

663
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,790
不行 不值得冒这个险
No, it's reckless.

664
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,990
照我来看...
In my opinion...

665
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,890
很值得冒这个险
it is well worth the risk.

666
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,890
你根本不知道我上次经历了什么
You have no idea what I
went through the last time.

667
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,590
相信我
Believe me...

668
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,900
这是个很糟糕的主意
this is a very bad idea.

669
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,990
你们在这里干什么?
What the hell are you doing up here?

670
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,890
总比在医务室无聊的等死强吧?
Well, there's not much point sitting in
the infirmary waiting to die, is there?

671
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,690
好吧 现在是什么状况?
All right, where do we stand?

672
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,690
次空间通讯我们是不用考虑了
Well, we can pretty much forget
about subspace communications.

673
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,290
主控制阵列差不多完全被光束摧毁了
The main control array was almost
completely damaged by the beam.

674
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,190
不过 我还有一个主意
I do, however, have another idea.

675
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,890
说说看
Let's hear it.

676
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,390
我们之所以不能利用剩余的能量
跃入超空间
Well, the reason why
we cannot use the power

677
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,490
是因为城市不让我们这样干
we have left to execute a short jump into
hyperspace is that the city will not let us.

678
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,390
这是一个安全措施
不过我有办法绕开它
It's a safety protocol, but
I might be able to bypass it.

679
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,590
然后呢 有什么好处?
What does that give us?

680
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,290
不是很好
Not much.

681
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,090
是的 我们还是无法跟Apollo回合
Well, we wouldn't be
able to get to the Apollo,

682
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,690
无法到达最近的星门
and we wouldn't be able to
get to the nearest stargate,

683
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,790
不过也许我们可以在附近
找到一个适于居住的星球
but we might be able to find a
habitable planet within range.

684
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,890
我现在已经派人
去用探测器进行扫描了
I have my team running
sensor sweeps right now.

685
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,090
他没有讲那个安全措施
He's conveniently leaving out the reason

686
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,190
不让我们这样干的原因
why those safety protocols are
in place in the first place.

687
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,790
好吧 如果能量不足
Yes, well, with insufficient power,

688
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,790
那么城市在进入超空间之前
就有可能被撕裂
there is a chance that the city could be ripped
apart as we try to enter the hyperspace window.

689
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,090
几率有多大?
What kind of chance?

690
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,090
50%
50-50.

691
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,590
那我得说 Radek 这不是个好点子
Well, I got to tell you,
Radek, I'm not loving that idea.

692
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,290
那艘试验Jumper
Experimental jumper.

693
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,190
还记得不 几个月前
我被那台机器打中 然后就...
Remember when I was zapped by that
machine a few months ago, and I got...

694
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,190
一下子变得聪明多了?
well, even smarter than I normally am?

695
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,990
差点害死你的那次? 记得
The one that almost killed you? Yeah.

696
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,890
在我恢复原形之前
Well, before I was reset,

697
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,690
我已经完成给一艘Puddle Jumper
装上超空间引擎了
I was very close to giving one of
our puddle jumpers a hyperdrive.

698
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,390
- 你能完成么?
- 当然
- Can you finish it?
- Yeah.

699
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,490
也许吧
Yes, I probably can.

700
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,490
那我们可以飞到Appolo那里
告诉我们现在的位置
All right, great. We'll make a jump
to the Apollo, tell them where we are.

701
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,290
- 不行
- 为什么?
- No.
- Why no?

702
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,890
Jumper上的超空间引擎能力有限
The jumper's hyperdrive
would be limited.

703
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,090
没法飞那么远
Wae wouldn't be able to jump that far.

704
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,890
那可以飞多远?
How far then?

705
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,090
你觉得呢 大概是 二?
What do you think, like, two?

706
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,390
大概吧?
Yeah. Two and change maybe?

707
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,190
保守估计 大概有两千光年
Conservatively, maybe 2000 light years.

708
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,390
这是在此范围内的星门地址
This is a list of addresses
that are within range.

709
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,690
那我们多飞几次 把队员们都
转送到其中的一颗星球上
All right, we'll make a bunch of trips
and ferry the crew to one of the planets.

710
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,090
这个也不行
Again, no.

711
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,990
为什么?
Why not?

712
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,190
那个引擎从来没有测试过
Well, the drive's never been tested.

713
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,190
幸运的话 可以飞个一两次
Yeah, we'd be lucky if we get two jumps.

714
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,890
这样可以到某地飞一个来回
We'll make a return trip somewhere.

715
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,690
是的 理想的话 还可以找到几个ZPM
Yeah, ideally, somewhere
with a few ZPMs to spare.

716
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,290
给Atlantis提供能量
We come back, we get
atlantis fully powered.

717
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,290
那就太好了
Yeah, that'd be great.

718
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,890
M7R-227
M7r-227.

719
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,690
那是什么?
What's that?

720
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,390
这个...
Well...

721
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,290
那里有ZPM?
there's a planet out there with ZPMs?

722
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,690
是的 我们知道他们有几个ZPM
Yeah... yeah, we know
they have a few ZPMs.

723
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,390
那是哪里?
And who would that be?

724
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,990
那儿? 那儿是复制者的母星
That? That would be the
replicator homeworld.

725
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,390
敢去么?
You feel up to a heist?
