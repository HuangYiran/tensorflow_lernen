每一天 世界上令我们惊奇的动物都在消失
every day,natural wonders of our world disappear.

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,610
有些是慢慢死亡的
some slip away quietly,

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,811
没人注意
without notice,

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,346
没人宣告
without fanfare.

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,220
一只再也不能在野外飞翔的鹦鹉
a parrot that no longer flies in the wild,

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,623
地球上同类乌龟中的 最后一个幸存者
a turtle that is the last of his kind on earth,

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,291
自相残杀的幼兽
and babies that are killing each other

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,461
科学家正努力地 挽救这些动物
as scientists struggle to bring them back to life.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,864
多姿多彩、魅力非凡的动物
colorful and charismatic,

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,100
这些受困的动物面临着 一个未知的未来
these embattled creatures face an uncertain future.

在未来20年的生死存亡
live or die in the next 20 years,

13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,808
归因于人类及其行为
because of humans and human actions.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,878
如果人类让非凡的动物灭绝
and I think it would be reprehensible if humans

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,900
我认为这是应该受谴责的事情
allowed such a magnificent animal to go extinct.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,216
如果我们不能成功地 繁殖这些动物
man: if we cannot succeed with breeding them,

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,386
那么它们就会灭绝
then these animals will be doomed,

18
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,021
因为它们都死掉了
because there are no more.

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,190
在实验室中圈养动物
but will protecting animals in captivity

20
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,859
并繁殖后代
and breeding generations in a lab

21
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,895
这样能阻止动物灭绝吗？
stem the extinction tide?

22
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,864
你不能把这些动物
man: you can't return something like

23
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,733
例如苏门答腊犀牛
a sumatran rhino

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,234
或者伊比利亚猞猁
or an iberian lynx

25
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,703
再放回旧环境中
to just any old environment.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,800
它们真的需要回到 自己进化的环境中
it really needs to be returned to the environment that it evolved in.

27
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,575
我们不想动物都被囚禁在监笼
woman: we don't want them in jail --

28
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,777
我们要让动物回到野外
we want them out in the wild

29
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,145
自由奔跑
and free-roaming.

30
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,247
这些是在死亡边缘的幸存者
these are the survivors on the edge,

31
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,200
地球上极度濒危的动物
the most endangered species on the planet,

32
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,300
世界上最孤独的动物

你醒过来 孤单一人

你有90岁了

乔治

我们认为90岁很长寿
90 years is a long life for us,

00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,968
但是乌龟在90岁 处于中年期

斑鳖

她要开始一趟旅程

00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,342
这关乎斑鳖物种的命运
that will determine the fate of her species.

73
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,100
斑鳖曾经活跃在长江流域
rafetus turtles once flourished throughout the yangtze river valley.

最后一个地球上 已知的雌性斑鳖

斑鳖是将要消失的 又一个中国自然奇观
will be the next of china's natural wonders to disappear...

90
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:03,929
因为在600里外的苏州

91
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,465
生活着她的同类

92
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,704
中国最后一个 已知的雄性斑鳖
the last known male rafetus in china.

93
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,000
坦白说 我们要抓住这个最后的机会
man: it's basically the last chance we have

94
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,446
来挽救这种特殊的动物
to keep this particular species on our planet.

95
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,283
如果我们不能成功地繁殖斑鳖
if we cannot succeed with breeding them,

96
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,118
那么斑鳖就完蛋了
then these animals will be doomed

97
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:30,656
因为再也没有斑鳖了
because there are no more.

98
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,990
一般来说
man: so,normally,

99
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,026
斑鳖每年产卵两次 每次两个
they lay eggs two -- twice in one year.

100
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,394
每年夏天
abraham: every summer,

101
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,263
雌性斑鳖产两次卵
the female lays two clutches of eggs.

102
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,900
一般卵的大小都一样吗？
man: are they usually all about the same size?

103
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,770
但是 缺了雄性斑鳖
abraham: but without a mate,

104
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,505
卵无法受精
they remain unfertilized.

105
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,108
今年 小组有两个星期的时间
this year,the team has a two-week window

106
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,378
来促成斑鳖交配
to encourage her to mate with the male

107
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,513
因此她能注入卵子
so he can inject her yearly eggs

108
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,749
为斑鳖的未来带来希望
with hope for the future of their kind.

109

雌性斑鳖是珍贵的货物

刚好度过冬眠
have just come out of hibernation,

116
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,305
这是介绍他们认识的最佳时机
and so it's the perfect time to introduce them

117
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,974
希望他们能自然交配
and hopefully they'll mate naturally

118
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,443
她能产下可受精的卵
and she'll lay fertile eggs.

119
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,111
她知道我们在谈论她
she knew we were talking about her.

120
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,880
呀 是的 她的私事
ah,yeah,yeah.her private business.

她想说再见
she wants to say goodbye.

计划很简单
abraham: the set-up is simple,

123
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,252
但是风险很大
but the plan is fraught with risks.

124
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,456
两个斑鳖都差不多100岁了
both animals are nearly 100 years old,

125
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,659
在他们的长久独处生活中
and in their lg,solitary lives,

126
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,863
有可能他们从没遇到过异性
it's possible they've never met a member of the opposite sex.

127
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:50,202
上一次雄性斑鳖遇到同类时
the last time the male encountered another turtle,

128
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,705
他杀了别人
he killed him.

129
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:59,311
雌性斑鳖的安全 握在科学家的手里
the safety of the female is in the scientists' hands.

130
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,348
好的
okay.

131
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,749
放开她
leave it.

132
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,285

大约8个星期后 就能产下来了
ready to lay in about eight weeks.

她的状态很好
she is in perfect condition.

140
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,808
放到这里 盖住她
davis: set her up here with her head covered.

141
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,877
现在要抓紧赶路
abraham: it's now urgent to get on the road

142
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,345
尽可能快
as quickly as possible.

143
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,686
她滑下来了
man: she's slipping...

144
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,823
安置好她
davis: there she goes.

145
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,091
我们办好了 噢 啊
we got her.oh,whoa,mama,

146
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,893
噢 放松点
whoa,whoa,easy,easy,easy.

147
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,800
小组还要赶路17个小时
abraham: ahead,the team faces a 17 hour drive,

148
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,313
路途遥远
and it will be a long one.

149
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,548
递水给我
davis: give me that water!

150
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,950
水来了！
water!

151
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,186
不要 甜心 不要！
no,sweetheart,no!

152
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,587
不要！
don't!

153
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,557
小组要保持乌龟潮湿
abraham: the team has to wrestle with keeping the turtle wet

154
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,000
防止乌龟受伤
and preventing her from hurting herself.

155
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,195
她不开心
she is unhappy.

156
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,366
谢天谢地 几个小时后
thankfully,after a few hours,

157
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,401
她在路途上放弃挣扎了
she gives in to the journey.

158
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,170
进展很顺利
davis: it's going very well.

159
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,938
她舒服地安顿下来了
we've got her comfortably settled

160
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,306
安详地睡觉
and she's peacefully asleep.

161
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,508
我想她一路上都会睡觉
I think she'll sleep all the way there.

162
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,600
让这些最后的古老动物配对的尝试
abraham: the attempt to pair the last of these ancient turtles

163
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:48,100
让我们认识到 我们对这些动物的了解是少之又少
confronts us with how little we know about our fellow creatures.

164
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:57,000
现在 在我们发现这些动物的生存状况之前 有很多要灭亡了
now,many are poised to disapar before we discover why they were here.

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,498
我想我们要竭尽全力
man: I think we have to put effort into saving

166
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,233
力所能及地挽救这些动物
whatever we can save,and even if this is

167
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,469
即使濒危动物被圈养
apparently doomed species being maintained in captivity

168
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,671
他们很快被放回野外的 希望不大
with no immediate prospect for going back to the wild,

169
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,106
我们必须这样做
we have to do this.

170
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,300
人类也是动物 生存也要依靠其他动物
we as living creatures ourselves depend on other forms of life for our own survival

171
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,381
生态系统也需要这些动物
and for the ecological processes that they generate.

172
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,517
只有还有幸存的个体动物
as long as there's some individuals left of a species,

173
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,585
我们就不应该放弃
we should not give up.

174
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,853
我们应该竭尽所能
we should make every effort possible

175
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,800
挽救这些濒临灭绝的动物
to bring them back from the brink.

176
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,726
虽然繁殖爬行动物相对容易
abraham: but breeding reptiles is relatively easy.

177
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,431
雄性和雌性能在适当的季节交配
a male and female in the right season should mate.

178
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:37,000
性别的社交性很复杂
with other species,the social side of sex reaches a complexity

179
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,239
我们才刚开始了解
we are just beginning to understand.

180
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,647
在印度尼西亚的苏门答腊岛南部
in southern sumatra,indonesia,

181
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,750
森林巡逻队忠于职守
a forest patrol unit reports for duty.

182
00:10:54,654 --> 00:11:00,000
Way Kambas国家公园的 水陆警察分队
the squad polices the jungles and waterways of way kambas national park,

183
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,496
公园是海岸森林带
a sliver of coastal forest.

184
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,432
每天24小时
24 hours a day,

185
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,435
分队保护树木 防止伐木者砍伐
the unit safeguards the trees from loggers

186
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,000
解除偷猎者设置的陷阱
and dismantles the deadly traps set by poachers.

187
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,843
他们的目标是
their goal --

188
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,180
保护这些稀有动物
to protect an animal so rare,they only see it

189
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,449
他们一年才遇到这些动物两三次
two or three times a year --

190
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:33,292
苏门答腊犀牛
the sumatran rhinoceros.

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,596
苏门答腊犀牛是 已经灭绝的披毛犀的后代
sumatran rhinos are descendents of the extinct woolly rhino,

192
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,934
他们至今还保留了 祖先的蓬松皮毛
and they still bear their ancestor's shaggy coat.

193
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:47,000
他们是唯一一种用歌唱发声 来交流的犀牛
they're the only rhino species that communicates in song-like vocalizations --

194
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:52,011
鲸鱼和海豚也用这种方式交流
a trait they share with whales and dolphins.

195
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,981
在五种犀牛中 他们的体型最小
they're the smallest of the five rhino species

196
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,649
也最濒临灭绝
and also the most endangered.

197
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,453
过去20年来
in the last 20 years,poaching has slashed

198
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,557
偷猎者令他们的数降低了70%多
their population by more than 70%.

199
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,028
苏门答腊犀牛在过去也受到威胁
man: the sumatran rhino historically has been threatened

200
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,397
因为有人偷猎犀牛角
because of poaching for their horn.

201
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:16,400
这种犀牛角比非洲犀牛角还珍贵
this small horn is even more valuable than the african rhino horns.

202
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,340
每公斤2.5-3万美元
it sells for between $25,000 and $30,000 a kilogram.

203
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,881
现在 更大的威胁是 森林砍伐
today,an even bigger danger is deforestation.

204
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,016
过去5年来
in the last five years,

205
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,951
印度尼西亚的森林
indonesia's forests

206
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:40,000
每分钟就减少 相当于5个足球场的面积
have lost the equivalent of five football fields per minute.

207
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:45,297
现在 在剩下的森林里
now,fewer than 200 sumatran rhinos

208
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:50,502
只有不到200个犀牛挣扎在死亡线上
are hanging onto survival in what little remains.

209
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,008
Robin radcliffe博士的任务是
dr.robin radcliffe is on a mission

210
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,643
拯救全球的犀牛
to save the world's rhinos.

211
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,082
他一年来Way kambas公园两次
twice a year,he comes to way kambas

212
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,784
在苏门答腊犀牛保护区工作
to work at the sumatran rhino sanctuary.

213
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,319
好 结实的脚部
good,solid sole.

214
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,756
你很好 Rosa
you're okay,rosa.

215
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,024
好女孩
good girl.

216
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,194
他们是奇妙的动物
radcliffe: they're incredibly amazing creatures.

217
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,562
史前动物
they're prehistoric.

218
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,831
看看这片下部胸肉
look at these armor plates.

219
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,301
他们是非常原始的动物
these guys are very primitive --

220
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,269
过去四五千万年
in the past 40 to 50 million years,

221
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,000
他们都没有任何改变
they haven't changed at all.

222
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:40,152
保护区有250亩的森林
abraham: the sanctuary encloses 250 acres of protected forest

223
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,723
少数几个犀牛生活在不同的领地
where a handful of rhinos live in divided territories.

224
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,461
10年前
ten years ago,

225
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,897
他们发起了一个圈养繁殖计划
they launched a captive breeding program

226
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,401
来增加不断减少的野外犀牛数量
to bolster the dwindling wild population.

227
00:13:55,468 --> 00:14:01,507
但是养殖这些原始动物 并不容易
but breeding these primeval creatures hasn't proved easy.

228
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,110
他们原始的求爱行为 依然是个谜
their wild courtship behavior remains a mystery,

229
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,980
保护区的雄性犀牛 越来越老了
and the one male at the sanctuary was aging

230
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,749
可能已经不能受精
and possibly infertile.

231
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,685
5年后
after five years,

232
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:17,690
保护区没有犀牛成功繁殖
the sanctuary had failed to produce a single baby rhino.

233
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,560
焦急的小组人员寻求突破
the anxious team needed a breakthrough,

234
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,629
重振这个计划
something to jump-start the program.

235
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,572
1万里外的辛辛那提动物园
then,10,000 miles away at the cincinnati zoo,

236
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,407
Andalas出生了
andalas was born.

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,400
Andalas是100多年来因圈养繁殖而出生的 首个苏门答腊犀牛
andalas was the first captive-born sumatran rhino in more than 100 years,

238
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:54,026
他花了6年时间在动物园长大
and he spent six years growing up at the zoo.

239
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:07,106
2007年 他回到了家乡 一次历史性的旅程
in 2007,he made a historic journey to his ancestral home.

240
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,907
旅途花了63个小时
man: the trip took about 63 hours.

241
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:12,400
他一直在板条箱里
he was in a crate the entire time.

242
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,347
他首先坐飞机 然后改乘卡车
he first traveled by airplane,then by truck,

243
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,083
接着乘船渡过Sunda海峡 来到苏门答腊岛
then by ferry across the sunda strait to sumatra,

244
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,120
然后再乘卡车到达保护区
then by truck again finally to the sanctuary.

245
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,189
虽然现在他还年轻 他将是未来的
even though he's young,he will be the future

246
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,800
苏门答腊犀牛保护区的 繁殖父亲 即公牛
breeding sire,or bull,here at the sumatran rhino sanctuary.

247
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,067
现在Andalas六岁了
abraham: now six years old,

248
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,671
正值青年
andalas is just reaching adolescence.

249
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:45,500
要让他发育成超级公牛 小组正在决定该做些什么
the team is trying to determine what he may need to develop into a top bull.

250
00:15:54,254 --> 00:16:00,500
苏门答腊犀牛可能是 最难圈养繁殖的犀牛
radcliffe: sumatran rhinos are probably the most difficult rhinoceros species to breed in captivity.

251
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,261
在过去 部分原因是
part of it,historically,

252
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,396
我们不知道他们如何成长
was we just didn't know how they worked.

253
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,932
好孩子 Andalas.
good boy,andalas.

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
好了
over.

255
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,736
目前我们只希望他们健全正常
right now we just want to get normals.

256
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,472
鉴于苏门答腊犀牛的数量非常少
because sumatran rhinos are so rare,

257
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,775
我们甚至不知道 正常值是多少
we don't even know what normal values are.

258
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,412
好孩子 Aandalas.
good boy,andalas.

259
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,950
Andalas的首次候选的交配
abraham: andalas' first potential mate

260
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,086
是和年轻美丽的Rosa
is a young beauty named rosa.

261
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,888
[ Rosa发出歌唱呼唤 ]
[ rosa makes song-like call ]

262
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,658
Radcliffe及其同事正在研究Rosa
dr.radcliffe and his colleagues are studying rosa

263
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,394
找到她准备当妈妈的时间
to find out when she'll be ready for motherhood.

264
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,499
现在 结果令人鼓舞
and today,the results bring good news.

265
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,335
Rosa刚到这里的时候
radcliffe: when rosa first came here,

266
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,304
她的卵巢活动非常少
she had very little activity on her ovaries.

267
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:49,000
换句话说 我们没在超声波上看到小囊
in other words,we didn't see on the ultrasound,we didn't see these follicles.

268
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,900
这意味着她正在开始循环
this means that she's starting to cycle,

269
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,781
她很快有希望进行繁殖了
and hopefully she'll be able to breed soon.

270
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,050
这是个好兆头
this is a really good sign.

271
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:06,458
Andalas和Rosa是保护区的希望
abraham: andalas and rosa are the hope of the sanctuary.

272
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,794
但是即使他们孕育了孩子
but even if they achieve a baby,

273
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,497
显而易见 只有圈养繁殖
it's clear that captive breeding alone

274
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,066
并不能阻止犀牛灭绝
is not going to prevent their extinction.

275
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:18,700
我认为不能采用圈养繁殖 来挽救苏门答腊犀牛
radcliffe: I don't believe that the sumatran rhino can be saved in captivity.

276
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,806
支持这个计划的捐款人
clearly,the donors who support this place

277
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,475
希望看到一些犀牛后代 这是很重要的
want to see some offspring,and I think that's important,

278
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,644
但是这个工作的实质
but the bulk of the work has to be done

279
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,613
是要在野外挽救犀牛
in saving the animals in the wild,

280
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:30,315
保护公园 教育人民
protecting the national parks and educating people,

281
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,719
确保很好地实施法律
and making sure we have good law enforcement.

282
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,593
?

283
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:51,800
虽然让Andalas和Rosa繁殖后代 有很大压力
abraham: while the pressure is on andalas and rosa to produce some offspring,

284
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,000
保护区召集新一代的孩子
the sanctuary is reaching out to a new generation of children

285
00:17:55,108 --> 00:18:00,713
这些孩子会保护这些奇妙的动物
who will protect and preserve these enigmatic animals.

286
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,247
[ 孩子发出笑声 ]
[ children laughing ]

287
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,587
苏门答腊犀牛 未来20年的生死存亡
radcliffe: the sumatran rhino is going to live or die

288
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:12,558
都取决于人类及其行为
in the next 20 years because of humans and human actions,

289
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,260
如果人类让非凡的动物灭绝
and I think it would be reprehensible

290
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,300
我认为这是应该受谴责的事情
if humans allowed such a magnificent animal to go extinct.

291
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:24,076
“苏门答腊犀牛是世界的遗产”

292
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,805
苏门答腊犀牛保护区
abraham: the sumatran rhino sanctuary

293
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,874
是在多个前线战斗
is fighting a battle on several fronts --

294
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,212
致力于圈养繁殖动物
pioneering efforts to breed the animals in captivity,

295
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,582
保护森林栖息地
but also defending their forest habitat

296
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,686
防止野生犀牛灭绝
and the last rhinos left in the wild.

297
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,821
和其它动物一样
with other species,

298
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:47,259
再也没有野生动物保护了
there are no wild animals left to protect.

299
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:01,500
在波斯湾的卡塔尔中心
secluded in the heart of the persian gulf nation of qatar,

300
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:07,046
沙漠隐藏着一片绿洲
the desert obscures an unlikely oasis.

301
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,818
濒危的非洲羚羊
endangered african antelopes,

302
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,754
它们和野生驴 还有沙漠猫科动物
wild asses,and sand cats

303
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,892
一起生活
live side by side.

304
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:26,932
中心还有不可能存在的
and in its center stands the impossible --

305
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,902
热带森林
a rain forest

306
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:35,507
坐落在灼热的沙漠中心
in the middle of the scorching desert.

307
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:40,279
这是由Sheikh saoud mohammed bin al thani建造的
built by sheikh saoud mohammed bin al thani,

308
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,783
Al Wabra野生动物保护中心
the al wabra wildlife preservation center shelters

309
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,900
有超过2000种稀有而极度濒危动物
over 2,000 rare and critically endangered animals.

310
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,624
在这离家7000里的地方
and here,7,000 miles from home,

311
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,500
一种巴西鸟获得了 生命的最后机会
a brazilian bird is getting a last chance at life --

312
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,666
斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉
the spix's macaw.

313
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,470
斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉一度在巴西北部
spix's macaws once thrived

314
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,840
荒芜、干燥的森林中繁衍
in the harsh,dry forest of northeastern brazil.

315
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,776
直至1995年
by 1995,

316
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,945
捕获鹦鹉作为宠物的交易
trapping for the exotic pet trade

317
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,080
以及森林的毁坏
and the destruction of the forest

318
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,483
使这种野生鸟类的数量下降
had reduced the wild bird's population

319
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,818
现在只剩下唯一一个顽强的鹦鹉了
to a single tenacious parrot.

320
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,422
2000年
then,in 2000,

321
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,225
最后一个野生鹦鹉死亡了
the last wild bird disappeared.

322
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,193
随着最后一只野生鹦鹉的死亡
man: the extinction of the spix's macaw

323
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,300
斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉灭绝
with the disappearance of that last bird,

324
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,564
真的令人深思
I think,was a really remarkable moment.

325
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,600
没有公众关注
it attracted almost no publicity,however -- despite the fact

326
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,604
虽然我们损失了地球上 无法替代的动物
that we'd lost an irreplaceable piece of life on earth,

327
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,239
几乎没有头条新闻
there were almost no headlines.

328
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,378
这个消息传给了Sheikh saoud博士
abraham: the news did reach sheikh saoud,

329
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,900
他在Al Wabra的小组养殖了 很多快绝种的鸟类
and his team at al wabra bought up many of the last birds in captivity.

330
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,785
这些鸟类的来源 远至瑞士
from as far away as switzerland

331
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,253
还有菲律宾
and the philippines,

332
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,589
这些鸟被带回 沙漠的独立笼子里
they've come to this isolated ark in the desert.

333
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,059
这个地方的主要目标
man: the special focus of this place

334
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,296
是增加极度濒危动物的数量
is to increase the number of highly endangered animals.

335
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,700
保护区的一些动物
and we have some animals here in this preservation

336
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,402
没有其他人圈养繁殖他们
nobody else have them in captivity.

337
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,500
我们试图增加这些极度濒危的动物的数量
we try to increase the number of these highly endangered animals,

338
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,712
例如斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉 希望某一天
like the spix's macaw,and hopefully one day

339
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,380
我们可以把这些动物放回大自然
we can bring them back to the nature,

340
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,015
或者 像斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉
or,in this case of the spix's macaw,

341
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,885
把他找回来 让他再次飞翔
to bring him back and let him fly again.

342
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,900
Ryan Watson的工作时间都花在稀有鸟类上
abraham: ryan watson has spent his lifeworking with rare birds,

343
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,662
5年前 这种最稀有的鹦鹉
and five years ago,the rarest of all

344
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,931
吸引他来到Al Wabra保护区
lured him to al wabra.

345
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,500
Al wabra保护区有 49只斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉
man: at al wabra,we have 49 spix's macaws

346
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,170
而全世界已登记的有77只
of the 77 in the international managed studbook.

347
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:48,040
所以这里的斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉 占了世界数量的大多数
so we have a very significant portion of the world population.

348
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,000
这里的工作非常重要
so the work we're doing here is very important in the attempts

349
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,581
争取某一天重新把它们放回野外
to one day re-establish the species in the wild

350
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,917
那才是真正属于它们的地方
where they truly belong.

351
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,287
不
no.

352
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:05,958
Al wabra极度偏僻
abraham: al wabra's extreme isolation

353
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,660
后勤服务面临很大的挑战
presents enormous logistical challenges --

354
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,731
包括维持一个训练良好的小组
from maintaining a well-trained staff

355
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,900
供应新鲜水、食物、药物
to supplying fresh water,food,and medicine

356
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,937
这里是最贫瘠的地方
in the most barren of landscapes.

357
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,572
我们有100种动物
we have 100 different species.

358
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,077
最小的重4公斤
my smallest patient is four grams

359
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,780
最大的重400公斤
and my biggest is 400 kilos.

360
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,782
面对100种动物
if you have 100 different animals,

361
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,584
你需要100种不同的食物
you need 100 different kind of food mixture.

362
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:37,122
许多食物来自欧洲
and we supply a lot of the food we need from europe,

363
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,259
每6个月用食物集装箱运一次
with food container which comes in every six months.

364
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,961
因此 我们就像在一座荒岛上
so,we are like on an island.

365
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,002
孤立的小岛也有一个好处
abraham: the isolation does have a benefit --

366
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,970
可以自然隔离
it creates a natural quarantine...

367
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,741
防止疾病传染进来
preventing the influx of disease

368
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,810
保护珍贵的动物
and protecting priceless creatures

369
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,079
他们是同类中的幸存者
that are among the last of their kind.

370
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,547
来吧!
come on!

371
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,820
这些笼子里的天蓝色鹦鹉
the sky-blue macaws in these cages

372
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,822
从没在世界的森林里飞翔
fly in no forest in the world.

373
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,759
如果它们生活在野外 我们该称呼它们？
who were they when they lived in the wild?

374
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:17,262
这些鹦鹉自己还记得吗？
do the birds themselves even remember?

375
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,232
Ryan认为 知识匮乏
for ryan,the lack of knowledge

376
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,335
在其它无数的问题上 雪上加霜
added to countless other problems.

377
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:28,107
很多鸟类来到这里时 健康状况非常差
most of the birds arrived in extremely poor health

378
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:32,411
很多鸟类的亲缘关系很近 就像双胞胎一样
and many are as closely related as identical twins.

379
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:38,000
我们处理了很多斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉的问题
watson: we adopted a lot of problems with the spix's macaws,and this year,

380
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,753
今年我们才真正认识到
what we've really learnt is that they're not

381
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,889
它们不像我们想象的那样 容易配对
as easy to put together as a pair

382
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:48,193
以及和谐相处
and be compatible as what we initially thought they were.

383
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,029
好的 好孩子
all right,good girl.

384
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,500
小组绘制了每种鸟的基因蓝图
abraham: the team creates a precise map of each bird's dna,

385
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,500
然后把基因最相近的鹦鹉配对
and the macaws are then paired up with their most genetically suitable partners.

386
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,541
嗯?
hmm?

387
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,176
你认为呢?
what do you think?

388
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,811
这个好吗?
is that good here?

389
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,380
噢？你喜欢吗?
yeah? you like it?

390
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,682
好的
good.

391
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,785
基因相近并不一定会产生浪漫
abraham: compatible genes don't always create romance.

392
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,925
运气好的话
but with luck,some of these birds

393
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:27,000
这些鸟5年后能够历史性地 回到巴西的家乡
could make the historic journey home to brazil in just five years.

394
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,904
如果这种世界上最稀有的鸟类
juniper: if the spix's macaw can come back

395
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,572
斯皮克斯金刚鹦鹉能够回家
from being the world's rarest bird

396
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,141
再次在野外生活
to once more being established in the wild,

397
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,243
我认为这将是一个启示
I think it would be an inspiration

398
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,113
希望的标志 以及我们有能力做一些事情
and a signal of hope and our ability to do things

399
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,549
获得一些成果
that would have ramifications well beyond

400
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,818
意义远胜于挽救天蓝色鹦鹉
the fortunes of that one blue parrot.

401
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:49,054
这些顽皮的鹦鹉的未来
abraham: the future of the playful parrots

402
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:52,157
在于这些最后幸存者的成功
hangs on the success of these last captive birds.

403
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,960
对于其他一些动物
with other species,

404
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:58,163
养殖相对容易
breeding the animals is the easy part.

405
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:02,601
新生儿来了就麻烦了
it's once they're born that the trouble begins.

406
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,677
在西班牙南部的Dona国家公园
in dona national park,in southern spain,

407
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:13,545
生物学家穿好实验衣服
a biologist suits up for an encounter

408
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:14,847
去看一个国家级珍宝
with a national treasure.

409
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,487
非常珍贵
something so precious,

410
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:26,925
它受到最严格的生物保护
he's protected behind the strictest biosecurity.

411
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,299
它叫ECO
his name is eco,

412
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:39,338
它是伊比利亚猞猁 有6个星期大了
and he's a six-week old iberian lynx.

413
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:50,700
ECO是地球上仅存的 少数几个伊比利亚猞猁之一
eco is one of just a handful of iberian lynx cubs on the planet.

414
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:02,227
它也是双胞胎
he's also a twin,

415
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,630
但他的兄弟被关在隔壁的围栏里
but his brother is kept in a pen next door,

416
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:08,534
这是有原因的
and for good reason.

417
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,270
如果兄弟俩在一起
if they were put together,

418
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:13,906
ECO可能会杀死兄弟
eco would probably kill him.

419
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,580
100年前
a century ago,

420
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:25,800
超过10万只猞猁生活在 西班牙和葡萄牙的灌木丛林
over 100,000 lynxes stalked the scrubland of spain and portugal.

421
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:29,688
作为夜间活动的肉食动物
nocturnal carnivores,

422
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:34,460
它们几乎以兔子为食
they feed almost exclusively on rabbits.

423
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,929
20世纪50年代
in the 1950s,

424
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:40,833
人类引入了一种 叫做多发粘液瘤病的病毒
humans introduced a viral disease called myxomatosis

425
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,602
来控制兔子的数量
to control the rabbit population.

426
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,340
兔子死光后 猞猁挨饿了
as the rabbits disappeared,the lynxes starved.

427
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:51,343
2007年  商场、公路
by 2007,shopping malls,highways,

428
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:54,213
和新公寓都占据了 猞猁的栖息地
and new apartments had stolen their land.

429
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,250
现在 只有100多只猞猁
now,just over 100 lynxes are making

430
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:02,221
在最后栖息地Andalucia生活
their last stand here in andalucia.

431
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,655
[ 鸟歌唱 ]
[ birds singing ]

432
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,627
4年前
four years ago,

433
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,996
Astrid vargas博士及其同事
dr.astrid vargas and her colleagues

434
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,197
开始不断地努力
began a tireless effort

435
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:15,734
挽救世界上最濒危的猫科动物
to save the world's most endangered cat.

436
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:22,400
但他们很快发现 这些山猫有一个秘密
but they would soon discover that these cats had a dark secret.

437
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,976
繁殖猞猁
woman: breeding lynxes

438
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:26,912
通常来说比较容易
in captivity in general should be easy,

439
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,614
同欧亚猞猁
like eurasian lynxes,

440
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,883
以及美洲野猫一样 容易繁殖
bobcats,are easy to breed.

441
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,200
我就想圈养繁殖伊比利亚猞猁也很容易
and I thought it was going to be very easy to breed iberian lynxes in captivity,

442
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,889
但伊比利亚猞猁是复杂的动物
but they are complicated animals.

443
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,360
开始成功地获得三胞胎
abraham: the first success was a set of triplets --

444
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,229
一个雄性和两个雌性猞猁
a male and two females --

445
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:49,234
分别叫做brezo, brezina和brisa.
brezo,brezina,and brisa.

446
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:53,739
1个月以来 幼猞猁在一起开心玩耍
for a month,the cubs played happily together

447
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,974
直到 没有任何预兆
until,without warning,

448
00:27:56,042 --> 00:28:01,647
brezo狠毒地杀死了brezina
brezo turned on brezina and viciously killed her.

449
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:03,916
我们第一次发现这种情况时
vargas: the first time that it happened to us,

450
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,284
它在我们的第一个猞猁窝里
it was with our first litter

451
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,820
发生这样的事情 我们完全没有预料
and we were completely unaware that this could happen

452
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,889
我们对这种残忍的攻击 感到很震惊
and we were shocked about the brutality of the attacks.

453
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:16,462
更多的幼猞猁表现出 烦扰的行为模式
abraham: more cubs revealed a disturbing pattern.

454
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,098
在第二个月
in their second month,

455
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,367
它们进入“打斗期”
they enter "fighting season."

456
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:26,238
兄弟姐妹互相搏斗 直到死亡
siblings turn on one another and fight to the death.

457
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,910
我们记录的最早打斗时间是 第37天
vargas: the earliest fight we've ever had was at day 37

458
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:35,481
就是这个毛茸茸的可爱小猞猁
which is this really lovely fuzzball

459
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,449
看上去完全无害
that looks completely harmless

460
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:40,085
它会用残忍方式 杀死另外一个幼猞猁
and its capable of killing another cub

461
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:43,355
例如咬断喉咙
with brutal aggression,like severing the throat.

462
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:47,593
它们就像着了魔 只想打斗
they become,like,possessed,and they just want to fight.

463
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,295
更糟糕的是 打斗期持续很长时间
and the worst is that it lasts for a very long time.

464
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,734
令人讽刺的是 这个进化策略
abraham: ironically,an evolutionary strategy

465
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,937
强者生存
to ensure that only the strongest survive

466
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:02,474
突然威胁整个物种的未来
suddenly threatened the future of the entire species.

467
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:05,310
Vargas博士及其同事
dr.vargas and her crew

468
00:29:05,378 --> 00:29:07,646
建立一个系统
set up a system

469
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:09,548
24小时监视这些猞猁
to monitor the cats 24 hours a day.

470
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:17,400
使用遥控摄像机 志愿者可以盯着幼猞猁
remote cameras allow volunteers to keep a watchful eye on the cubs.

471
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:21,700
打斗发生时 如果猞猁母亲无法阻止
when a fight breaks out,if the mother can't separate them,the researchers have to

472
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,431
研究人员就要扳开猞猁 干涉打斗
brave the claws and step into the fray.

473
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:35,274
像ECO一样  幼猞猁就是这样分开的
cubs like eco are separated from their siblings

474
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:36,842
直到打斗期结束
until the fighting period passes.

475
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:44,983
最后它被重新放进成年猞猁围栏里
eventually,he'll be reintroduced to the adult pens

476
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:48,954
它在那里学习猞猁之道
where he'll learn what it means to be a lynx.

477
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:55,060
4年来 中心养殖了24只幼猞猁
in only four years,the center has produced 24 cubs.

478
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,062
到这个水平
at this rate,

479
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,900
研究人员最快到明年 就可以把猞猁放回野外
they could begin returning animals to the wild as soon as next year.

480
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:05,037
但是Vargas博士警告说
but dr.vargas cautions that without a serious effort

481
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,673
不保护灌木丛林地的话
to protect the mediterranean scrubland,

482
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,174
单单这个繁殖计划
the program on its own

483
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,777
并不能挽救伊比利亚猞猁
is not going to save the iberian lynx.

484
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:15,080
我认为 其实这个繁殖计划
vargas: I see that the breeding program is actually

485
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,616
只是保护猞猁的一个辅助方式
a support tool for lynx conservation.

486
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:20,319
我们不能把猞猁关在牢笼里
we don't want them in jail,we want them

487
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,321
我们希望猞猁在野外自由奔跑
out in the wild and free-roaming,

488
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:26,025
如果西班牙的猞猁灭绝了
so if the lynx were to go extinct in spain,

489
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:29,194
这是可耻的事情 连西班牙这样的发达国家
it would be a complete shame that a rich country like spain

490
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,363
也不能保护野生动物
could not maintain its wild population.

491
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,365
非常令人难堪
it would be completely embarrassing,

492
00:30:33,433 --> 00:30:34,767
我们也没有权利
and we would have no right

493
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,970
叫其他人来保护野生动物了
to tell anybody about conserving their wildlife,definitely.

494
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,740
我们依靠圈养繁殖
when we depend upon captive breeding

495
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,444
大自然是动物生活的地方 丢下大自然不管的话
and let the environment where the species came from go,

496
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,147
动物就没有地方可去了
so -- well,they don't have a place to go back to.

497
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:53,352
你不能把动物 例如苏门答腊犀牛
you can't return something like a sumatran rhino

498
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,457
或者伊比利亚鹦鹉 放回旧环境中
or an iberian lynx to just any old environment.

499
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,460
动物真的需要回到
it really needs to be returned to the environment

500
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,868
它们演变了几千年的环境中
that it evolved in over hundreds of thousands of years in many cases.

501
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:12,000
保护野生动物是 需要政府努力去做的事情
abraham: conserving wildlife is a struggle all governments face,

502
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,075
尤其是中国政府
but nowhere more so than in china,

503
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:19,800
在中国 世界上最后一个雌性斑鳖
where the world's last female rafetus turtle

504
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,448
将要被带到新家
is about to be introduced to her new home.

505
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:31,700
旅行了600里 花了17小时
600 miles and 17 hours into the journey,

506
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,893
小组到达苏州公园
the team arrives at the suzhou zoo.

507
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:42,401
公园专门建造了独立的池塘
the zoo has constructed a divided breeding pond

508
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:45,337
池塘一边给雌性斑鳖
for the occasion -- one side for the female,

509
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,440
另一边给雄性斑鳖
one for the male.

510
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:49,875
几天后
in a few days,

511
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:52,311
如果斑鳖没有攻击行为
if the turtles don't show any aggression,

512
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:56,081
中间的门会被打开
the gate will be opened.

513
00:31:58,451 --> 00:31:59,585
这里聚集了很多人
crowds have gathered

514
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,854
见证著名的雌性斑鳖的光临
to witness the arrival of the famous female.

515
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,690
今天很特别
davis: this is special because it is

516
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,058
它是中国最大的乌龟
the largest turtle in china,

517
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:09,800
是中国最后几个斑鳖之一
it is one of the most revered turtles in china,

518
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:14,600
这是生活在中国的 已知的最后的雄性和雌性斑鳖
and this is the last male and the last female known in china,

519
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:18,837
所以无论是对我们生物保护学家 还是对中国人民
so it's important not just to us as conservation biologists

520
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,072
这都是很重要的事情
but to the chinese people,

521
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,940
这是非常重要的时刻
this is an extremely important event.

522
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:24,276
如果你移向一边
man: if you just move aside,

523
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:26,378
我也跟着移动 明白
we're going to come right by.I understand.

524
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,014
不要放到水里
man: do not put in the water.

525
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,953
放松点
davis: easy.

526
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,789
放松点 放松点
easy,easy,easy,easy.

527
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:39,324
我抓到它了
I've got her.

528
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,493
走吧
here we go.

529
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,028
走吧
here we go.

530
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:45,030
好的 把它放在台阶上
all right,set her on the step.

531
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:48,801
放松点 它走了
easy,baby,easy -- there she goes.

532
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,537
哇！
whoa!

533
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:54,073
与雌性斑鳖的老家相比
abraham: the new pond is a paradise

534
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,608
新池塘是天堂 它很开心
compared to her old home,and the female is happy

535
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,644
正从板条箱出来
just to be out of the crate.

536
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:00,546
很好 它来了
excellent.there she is.

537
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,885
第一阶段的成功了 小组成员兴高采烈
team turtle is elated with the success of phase one.

538
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:11,300
它是地球上同类中 最后一个雌性斑鳖
man: this is the last female on the planet of this species of turtle.

539
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,192
从某种意义上说
and this is literally

540
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,861
这是挽救斑鳖的最后一次机会
the last chance we have to save this species.

541
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:20,699
第二阶段是诱哄雄性斑鳖
abraham: phase two is to coax the male

542
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:25,604
要通过池塘中间的围栏来完成
through a connecting tunnel into his half of the pond.

543
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,375
围栏是有原因的
but the fence is there for a reason.

544
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:33,579
雄性的体型是雌性的三倍
the male is nearly three times the size of the female,

545
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:38,884
雄性斑鳖已经杀了另外一只龟
and he has already killed another turtle.

546
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:42,988
他攻击雌性 而不是与雌性交配
instead of mating with her,he could attack her.

547
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,323
如果我们引见它们
davis: if we introduce them

548
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,593
雄性斑鳖没认出雌性斑鳖
and he does not recognize the female as a female,

549
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,927
就会发生打斗
then there will be a fight.

550
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,996
我们担心
we are concerned,

551
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:53,065
我希望池塘弥漫爱情
but I'm hoping love is in the air,

552
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,167
下午就会知道结果
and I believe we'll know this afternoon

553
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:59,600
当雄雌看到 护栏另一边的雌性
when we see the male and the female on opposite sides of the protective barrier

554
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,640
它们会相互对望、相互嗅探
able to see each other and smell each other

555
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,910
相互抚摸 双方都是第一次
and touch each other for the first time.

556
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:09,481
意想不到的雌性气味
abraham: the unexpected scent of a female

557
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,985
引诱雄性斑鳖来到池塘中
lures the male into his half of the pond.

558
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:17,823
好奇的不止他一个
and he's not the only one whose interest is piqued.

559
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:26,932
现在两个斑鳖有一夜的时间
now the two will have the night to get acquainted

560
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,804
隔着门互相认识
through the dividing gate.

561
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:34,273
[ 雷声 ]
[ thunder crashes ]

562
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:38,143
第二天 苏州下了雷雨
the next day,a rainstorm inundates suzhou,

563
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:41,046
对两个斑鳖来说
but for the turtles,

564
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,849
天气使心情更愉快
the weather is just setting the mood.

565
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:49,722
雄性和雌性在护栏两边度过一晚
the male and female have spent the night pacing the fence,

566
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:55,600
Kuchling博士认为 开门时机已经成熟
and dr.kuchling insists the time is right to open the gate.

567
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:59,000
雌性斑鳖美极了
kuchling: the female definitely is a very good-looking girl,

568
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,668
我希望雌性斑鳖也认为
and the male,I hope the female

569
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:06,672
雄性斑鳖也帅呆了
thinks the same of the male,that he is a good-looking guy.

570
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,407
我认为
from what I can tell,

571
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:11,343
雌性斑鳖明显对隔壁的
she's obviously interested of what's next door

572
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,679
雄性斑鳖感兴趣
and that this is a male.

573
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,881
因此我们认为
this is also one reason why we are confident

574
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,983
现在可以打开门了
that we should open the gate now.

575
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:21,854
[ 说中文 ]
[ speaking chinese language ]

576
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,158
动物园同意了
abraham: the zoo gives the team the final go-ahead.

577
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,027
重要的引见时刻
it's time for the big introduction.

578
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:51,050
雄性斑鳖有点犹豫
the male hesitates to approach the open gate

579
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:55,700
小组时刻准备紧急拆散
and the team gets ready for an emergency separation.

580
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,791
最后
finally,

581
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,460
他游过去了
he makes his move.

582
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,096
他来了
man: there he goes.

583
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:40,666
他直奔雌性斑鳖
he's headed right towards her.

584
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:45,404
两只斑鳖消失于碧波中
abraham: and the two disappear into a swirl of bubbles.

585
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:47,873
池塘中正在发生某些事
there's something going on in the middle of the pond here.

586
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:52,378
水下求爱开始了
abraham: the underwater courtship begins

587
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:56,849
小组密切地查看是否有 任何攻击的迹象
as the team closely watches for any signs of aggression.

588
00:36:56,916 --> 00:37:01,754
迄今所有迹象表明 撮合成功
but so far,all signs point to a successful match.

589
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:02,955
噢 她来了
davis: oh,there she goes!

590
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:05,657
几个月后
abraham: in a few months,

591
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,626
雌性斑鳖会产下卵
the female will lay her eggs,

592
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:11,797
那时小组会知道 这个计划是否可行
and they'll know for certain if the plan has worked.

593
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:15,901
雌性斑鳖能产下20-80个卵
calle: she can lay anywhere from 20 to 80 eggs

594
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:18,070
只要一两个能受精
and so one or two fertile clutches

595
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:22,500
地球上斑鳖的数量 就会增加一个数量级
would by an order of magnitude increase the number of this species on earth.

596
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:25,177
如果计划不成功
if this effort is not successful,

597
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,613
斑鳖就会灭绝
the species will become extinct.

598
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:31,650
斑鳖的未来就依靠这些
the future of the rafetus turtle now depends upon

599
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:35,721
危险、有限的基因了
a dangerously limited gene pool.

600
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,791
但生物学家一致同意
but biologists agree,

601
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:42,127
没有任何借口 让这些动物灭绝
this is no reason to let the animals die out.

602
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:43,796
有时候 有人说
mittermeier: sometimes people say,

603
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:45,764
如果某个物种低于一定数量
"if a species gets below a certain number,

604
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:48,534
从基因上说 该物种就无法维持了
it's no longer viable genetically."

605
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,169
这不可信
I don't believe it.

606
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:53,472
我认为 只要还有一个能怀孕的雌性
I think that if there's a pregnant female remaining,

607
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,275
你就要努力挽救该物种
you should make the effort to try to bring that species back

608
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:59,345
防止灭绝
from the brink of extinction.

609
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:02,548
如此严峻的圈养繁殖
abraham: captive breeding in such extreme cases

610
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,983
能使物种生存下去
can keep a species alive.

611
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:08,000
到了数量足够多
but by the time the captive population is big enough

612
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,655
能够放回野外的时候
to return to the wild,

613
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,123
问题就会变成
the question will be,

614
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:13,892
还有野外栖息地吗？
are there any wild places left?

615
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,702

环尾冕狐猴
ringtailed and crowned lemurs,

寻找新鲜树叶
set out to forage for fresh leaves.

620
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:44,690
但这些狐猴的家乡 马达加斯加离这里很远
but these lemurs are a long way from their native madagascar.

621
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:47,860
它们生活在美国南部
they're living in the southern united states,

622
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:52,131
杜克大学的狐猴中心
at the duke university lemur center,

623
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:55,400
狐猴中心繁殖了 来自世界各地的灵长类动物
the largest collection of endangered primates in the world.

624
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:05,277
虽然狐猴的品种出奇地多
though amazingly diverse,

625
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:09,348
它们都是一种灵长类祖先的后代
all lemurs are descended from a single primate ancestor

从单一的种类
from that one source,

628
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:19,491
进化成至少70个品种
at least 70 different kinds evolved.

629
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,700
我总认为 狐猴是进化的最佳典范
woman: I mean,I always think of lemurs as being evolution's finest moment.

630
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,600
它们是非常壮观的动物群落
they're just a spectacular array of animals in and of themselves.

漂亮、魅力非凡
they're beautiful,they're charismatic,

小狐猴只有老鼠那么大
they go from a tiny mouse-lemur-sized

633
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:41,600
而大狐猴比得上大猩猩
all the way up -- at one point,there were giant lemurs that were the size of gorillas.

634

马达加斯加是世界的第四大岛

狐猴也跟着灭亡
so too have the lemurs.

mittermeier: madagascar is one of the most striking examples

641
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,449
马达加斯加是一个极端的例子
of large-scale extinctions in recent times.

642

I would say is lonely.

一般来说 灵长类是群居动物
I mean,in general,primates are gregarious.

如果他有雌性狐猴
and so I definitely think he'd be happier

667
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,728
他一定会更快乐
if he had a female companion,

但我们尽可能丰富他的生活
but we try to enrich him as much as possible,

我们也一直这么做
so we try and do that as well

uncovering the mysteries of their biology

675
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:59,051
揭开狐猴的生理谜团
through trial and error.

676
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,123
今天 科学家希望
today,they're hoping for another successful pregnancy

677
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,992
红狐猴Carina再次怀孕成功
with a red-ruffed lemur named carina.

678
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,928
Carina两个月前怀孕
woman: she bred about two months ago.

679
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,364
我们先要做触诊
so we're going to do a palpation,initially,

680
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:14,166
看看能否触摸到胎儿
to see if we can feel fetuses.

681
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,535
然后再做超声波
and after that we're going to do an ultrasound

682
00:42:16,603 --> 00:42:18,871
确定肚子是否有胎儿
just to verify that if there are fetuses there,

683
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:20,539
一个 或者两个
one,and then two,

684
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:23,442
如果胎儿发育了 它们在哪里呢
if they're viable and what their position is.

685
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,345
我们要搜索子宫
and what we're going to do is start looking for the uterus

686
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,514
和可能的胎儿
and possible fetuses,so what I'm going to do

687
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:29,748
我从这里着手
is come around this way...

688
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,817
好 这里有一个胎儿
okay,so we have a fetus right here,

689
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,018
就在这里
right in that region.

690
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:35,387
这里是胎儿的脊骨
so this is the spine of the fetus right there.

691
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:40,392
这里是跳动的心脏
this is actually the beating heart right there.

692
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,000
我想是三胞胎 Nicki
I think you may even have a threesome here,nicki.

693
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,365
三胞胎!
you may have triplets!

694
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:47,366
振奋人心!
how exciting!

695
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,834
[ 笑声 ]
[ laughter ]

696
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:54,000
这里是狐猴的安全避难所
yoder: we see ourselves as a safe-haven for lemurs,

697
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:55,941
最终目标是
with the ultimate goal

698
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:58,877
一旦环境条件稳定下来
of reintroducing species to madagascar

699
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:02,448
重新把狐猴放回马达加斯加
once the environmental situation is stabilized.

700
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:07,119
我们希望狐猴繁殖下去
the hope is that we can keep the species going,

701
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:08,821
基因不断发育
keep them genetically viable,

702
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:11,800
通过自由繁殖环境的实验
and by virtue of having the experience of the free-ranging environment

703
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:15,494
狐猴以前遇到过这些环境
that they are already sort of predisposed

704
00:43:15,562 --> 00:43:20,000
它们就会知道 如何在马达加斯加的森林中生存
to know how to survive in the jungles of madagascar when they get there.

705
00:43:22,535 --> 00:43:25,804
马达加斯加的总统承诺
abraham: madagascar's president has promised to triple

706
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:28,374
把国家保护区的面积增加至三倍
the country's protected areas,

707
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:31,010
自然资源保护学家表示乐观
and conservationists are optimistic

708
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:34,200
至少一些狐猴的栖息地 能够保存下来
that at least some of the lemur's habitat will survive.

709
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:37,750
也有人争辩说
but others argue

710
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:44,500
圈养的动物 失去了野生祖先拥有的生存技能
that captive-born animals have lost the survival skills of their wild ancestors.

711
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:47,126
随着越来越多的物种
with more and more species

712
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:50,362
降低到少数的圈养数量
reduced to small,captive populations,

713
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,563
很多人怀疑
many wonder

714
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:54,767
这些动物是否还有 野外生存的未来
if they really have any future in the wild.

715
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,252
科罗拉多北部的平原
on the rolling plains of northern colorado,

716
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,190
一个仓库的科学家获得 极大的科学成就
a warehouse conceals a towering scientific achievement --

717
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:23,000
一种动物从死亡中复活了
a species resurrected from the dead.

718
00:44:23,963 --> 00:44:26,265
27年前
27 years ago,

719
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:27,766
黑足貂
the black-footed ferret --

720
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:30,636
北美唯一的本地貂
the only ferret native to north america --

721
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,471
曾被认为灭绝
was considered extinct.

722
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,606
直到一个叫Shep的农场狗
man: it wasn't until a ranch dog named shep

723
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:39,200
发现了已知的 最后的黑足貂群
actually found the last known wild population of black-footed ferrets.

724
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:43,115
狗带回了一只死掉的黑足貂 到农场主的家门前
he brought a dead black-footed ferret to his owner's door.

725
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:46,647
自然保护界发生了 翻天覆地的反应
it turned the conservation world upside-down.

726
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:49,521
美国鱼类及野生动物服务部门
abraham: the u.s.fish and wildlife service

727
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:55,000
派出一支搜寻对 找到少量的黑足貂
sent out a search party and found a small population of ferrets.

728
00:44:55,628 --> 00:44:58,931
18个顽强的幸存者
with 18 of these hardy survivors,

729
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:00,899
美国发起了圈养繁殖计划
a captive breeding program was launched

730
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:03,635
目标是把新一代的黑足貂
with the aim of returning a new generation

731
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:04,837
放回美国平原
to the american plains.

732
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,110
Paul marinari是黑足貂保护中心的领队
paul marinari directs the black-footed ferret

733
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:14,079
中心位于科罗拉多州和怀俄明州的边界
conservation center on the colorado-wyoming border.

734
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,684
中心的每一只黑足貂
every ferret at the center

735
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:23,922
都可以追溯到原来的18个幸存者
can trace its lineage to those original 18 animals.

736
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,325
数量非常少
population,

737
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:30,129
小组必须小心地挑选每一个配对
the team has to carefully orchestrate each pairing,

738
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:32,631
根据基因蓝图配对
matching up mates based on genetic makeup.

739
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,200
我们要把雄性放到 雌性的笼子里
marinari: what we do is bring the male to the female's cage,

740
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,237
就像野外一样
just like it would be in the wild.

741
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:41,140
使雌性上前 展示她的脸蛋
get her to come up and show her face.

742
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:46,745
这种方式 雌性感到毫不奇怪
that way she's not totally surprised.

743
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:48,414
就像快速约会
it's kind of like fast-track dating.

744
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,948
现在 它们首次约会
right now,they're on the first date.

745
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:51,417
大概10分钟
hopefully in about ten minutes

746
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:54,486
它们可能会第二次约会 大概15分钟
they'll be on the second date,and maybe in about 15 minutes,

747
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:56,755
第三次约会 来个大满贯
they'll be third base,and then grand slam.

748
00:45:56,823 --> 00:46:00,000
中心每年繁殖400个黑足貂
abraham: the center produces up to 400 kits a year.

749
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:01,927
我们从这里看过去
marinari: so we'll peek in here

750
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:05,500
这一小窝有5个 生活舒适
on clover,her litter of five,

751
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,534
至于小黑足貂的性别
and determine what sex those kits are.

752
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:11,837
这个是小男孩
that's a little boy.

753
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:16,241
这个是小女孩
here's a little girl.

754
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,610
几个月后
abraham: after a few months,

755
00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:21,180
小黑足貂来到户外的营地
the kits are placed in an outdoor boot camp

756
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:23,582
它们在那里学习各种技能
where they learn the skills they'll need

757
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,751
以适应在大平原的生存
to survive on the open plains.

758
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,953
这是从头开始的计划
marinari: it's kind of like a head-start program

759
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:30,500
在围栏里呆两个月
where they spend about two months in the pens

760
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,291
以草原狗为食
getting fed live prairie dogs

761
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,860
经历自然的洞穴生活
and experiencing a natural burrow system.

762
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:37,463
我们发现 黑足貂经过这种训练
we find that the animals that go through preconditioning

763
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,000
与那些没有经历从头开始计划的的黑足貂相比
have a much greater survivorship then those just released

764
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:43,369
生存机会更大
without any prior head-start program.

765
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:46,572
1991年以来
abraham: since 1991,

766
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,608
中心在美国和墨西哥的18个地点
over 2,400 ferrets have been released

767
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:52,644
放生了2400个黑足貂
at 18 different sites throughout the u.s.and mexico.

768
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:58,751
现在大约有1000个黑足貂生活在野外
today,about 1,000 animals survive in the wild,

769
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:02,287
20年前 这些地方一个黑足貂也没有
where just two decades ago,there were none.

770
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:07,860
但Paul警告说 黑足貂面临着疾病问题
but paul warns that the ferrets now face problems with disease

771
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:10,729
大草原也被开发成农场
and the conversion of the prairies to farmland,

772
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:15,134
还不能确定黑足貂已经安全
and it's too soon to consider the black-footed ferret safe.

773
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:17,700
这是成功的计划
marinari: it is considered a successful program,

774
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:20,806
但是 一转眼的功夫
but it can all be taken away,

775
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:22,341
这个计划就会被毁掉
you know,in the blink of an eye.

776
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,777
确实很成功
truly successful

777
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:28,313
这意味着关掉圈养繁殖中心
would mean shutting down the captive-breeding facilities

778
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,482
让黑足貂回到野外
and having the species back in the wild

779
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,918
自生自灭
through self-sustaining populations.

780
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,421
但我们决不能离开树林
but we are by no means out of the woods yet.

781
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:42,600
黑足貂不确定的放生计划 不能只依靠圈养繁殖
abraham: the black-footed ferret's precarious return depends not only on captive breeding

782
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:47,100
还要依靠草原生态系统的 所有动植物
but on all of the organisms that make up its prairie ecosystem.

783
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,302
这是地球上的一个小宇宙
it's a microcosm of the planet,

784
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,700
在生态链中 每种动物都相互关联
where every animal is another link in the chain of life.

785
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:58,000
我们知道某个物种的死亡
wilson: we know that the death of any species is highly likely

786
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:01,480
会大大地影响其他的物种
to influence other species around it.

787
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:05,284
当你除掉了一个物种
but then there's the matter of what does it mean

788
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:09,221
它灭绝了 这才是关键
when you pull a species out,you extinguish it,

789
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,624
你只是在生态系统中除掉了它？
you just eliminate it within the eco-system?

790
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:14,226
我很大程度上不了解
well,we don't know in most cases.

791
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:16,028
这会导致灾难性的后果
it could be catastrophic there.

792
00:48:19,165 --> 00:48:21,600
以寂寞乔治为例
abraham: in the case of lonesome george,

793
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,203
乔治同类的死亡
the loss of his species left pinta island

794
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,505
使平塔岛再也没有草食动物
without a large herbivore.

795
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,842
那里过度生长的植物
the vegetation,now overgrown,is pushing native birds

796
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:33,379
使当地鸟类无法建巢
from their nesting sites.

797
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:35,814
在印度尼西亚
in indonesia,

798
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:38,584
森林里没有苏门答腊犀牛
the forests have lost the sumatran rhino

799
00:48:38,651 --> 00:48:41,220
犀牛曾经造就了这里的环境
which once shaped their environment,

800
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:44,189
其他有机物需要犀牛的水坑繁殖
creating wallows where other organisms thrived

801
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:49,828
犀牛还能散布植物的种子
and dispersing the seeds of the plants they eat.

802
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:52,698
中国的江河
china's rivers have lost

803
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,801
失去了主要的乌龟：斑鳖
their dominant turtle,the rafetus,

804
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:59,171
江河污染严重
but the rivers are so polluted,

805
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,307
物种挣扎生存
everything is struggling to survive.

806
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:07,079
西班牙失去了顶级食肉动物 伊比利亚猞猁
spain has lost its top predator,the iberian lynx,

807
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:12,600
海岸低地的食物链 失去了平衡
and the food chain of the coastal mediterranean has tumbled out of balance.

808
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,200
每种动物都挣扎在生存的边缘
each animal,teetering on the edge of existence,

809
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:19,692
这是对我们生态系统的威胁
is a living thread in our life-support system --

810
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:22,561
地球
earth.

811
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,631
地球表面是生存之地
wilson: the surface of the earth is a living layer.

812
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,967
洁净的水
the purity of the water,

813
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:32,037
是食物的基础
the foundation for the food we eat,

814
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:34,340
清新的空气
to the very air we breathe.

815
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:37,910
这是我们的世界
that is our world.

816
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:40,079
我们生活的唯一地方
that's the only world we can live in.

817
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:45,300
我们需要各种各样的生物 生活在我们周围
we have to have an enormous variety of other organisms around us

818
00:49:45,418 --> 00:49:46,819
使我们的生活成为可能
to make our life possible.

819
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,025
生物学家警告说
abraham: biologists rn tha

820
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:56,800
这些最后的孤独动物 在脆弱的生物大家庭中
these last,lonely animals are each a tenuous support

821
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:59,298
每一种动物都有自己的贡献
in a fragile house of cards.

822
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:03,068
没人知道 我们还能失去多少生物
no one knows how many more we can afford to lose.

823
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:06,271
我相信 目前我们走的路
juniper: I'm convinced that the road we're on

824
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:07,272
将通向灾难
will lead us to disaster,

825
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,807
不止是生物
not only for life on the planet,

826
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,310
也是人类的灾难
but also for humankind.

827
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:13,800
不止关系到 猴子和鹦鹉的灭绝
this isn't just about the extinction

828
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,603
也关系到人类的福利
of monkeys and parrots,this is about human welfare.

829
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:19,885
保护动物 我满怀希望
vargas: I definitely have hope for conserving species,

830
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:22,621
虽然我是一个乐观主义者
but even though I'm an optimistic person,

831
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:24,223
长远来说
in the long run,

832
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,891
我看到一个非常黑暗的未来
I see a pretty black future.

833
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:30,329
我认为 我们的社会还没认识到
I don't think we as a society are conscious

834
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:33,465
我们对地球的破坏的严重性
of how aggressive we are being to the planet,

835
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:35,467
虽然我们逐渐关注
and even though we're more and more aware

836
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,469
气候变化和其他的事情
of climatic change and all these things,

837
00:50:37,537 --> 00:50:40,639
社会却没有变化
I don't see a society change.

838
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:43,042
我们对灭绝的恐龙着迷
we're so fascinated with the dinosaurs that disappeared

839
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,877
我们花了很多时间研究恐龙
and we spend a lot of time studying them

840
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:47,400
我们试图重建恐龙模型
and trying to re-create what dinosaurs were all about.

841
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:50,349
噢 我们还有像恐龙一样的 美好生物
well,we've got wonderful creatures like the dinosaurs

842
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,583
和我们一起生活在地球上
sharing the planet with us.

843
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,118
我们不想失去犀牛
we don't want to lose the rhinos

844
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,653
大象、老虎
or the elephants or the tigers.

845
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,789
如果我们失去这些动物 这肯定是灾难
if we lost them,it would be absolutely tragic.

846
00:50:56,856 --> 00:50:59,024
我们完全有能力
and we have entirely within our power,

847
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,093
只需要很少的钱
for very little money,the ability

848
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,629
就能防止这些动物灭绝
to prevent these animals from going extinct.

849
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:04,797
我必须重复这句话
I have to repeat the phrase,

850
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,398
有生命就有希望
"where there's life,there's hope,"

851
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:08,000
我们要时刻努力
and we have to always put the effort

852
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,290
力所能及地保护这些动物
into keeping these things while we still can.

853
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,884
Carina健康地生了三胞胎

854
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:21,433
辛辛那提动物园有繁殖了两个苏门答腊犀牛

855
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:28,083
2008年 研究人员发现 寂寞乔治有可能与另外一个亲缘相近的乌龟繁殖

856
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:34,595
2008年6月 雌性斑鳖产了大约50个受精卵

857
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,535
无一幸存

858
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,875
小组希望 下一年再次尝试
