1
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:04,753
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

2
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:06,380
他们要拨号了
They're preparing to dial the Gate.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,425
快好了
Yeah, almost finished.

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,095
我知道 我很不会打包
I know, I'm terrible at packing.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,930
我永远不知道该带多少东西
I never know how much to bring.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,640
我们只是去过一个晚上
We are only going overnight.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,975
我确定你带的足够了
I'm sure you have enough.

8
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:21,603
你觉得够了 但是...
Well, you'd think so, but...

9
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,897
你看上去很紧张
You seem nervous.

10
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:26,567
哦 不 我没有
Oh, no, I'm fine.

11
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:29,361
也许有一点点
Well, maybe a little.

12
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:32,906
到外星球对我来说还有点新奇
Going off-world
is still kind of new to me.

13
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:36,785
到完全不同的一个星系
还要接触新的文明...
Whole other galaxy
and meeting new civilizations...

14
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:39,621
我的族人非常的好客
他们很急切地想见到你
My people are very welcoming
and they're eager to meet you.

15
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:43,917
我也很像见到他们
学习学习他们的文化和历史
Well, I'm eager to meet them, too, learn about their culture
and their history.

16
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,712
他们会很欣赏你这样的态度的
A gesture for which
they will be most grateful.

17
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,630
只是...
It's just...

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,884
我知道他们很喜欢Carson
I know they were very fond of Carson.

19
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:55,095
我只希望他们觉得
我能有他一半好就够了
I only hope to make
half the impression he did.

20
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,513
这些是什么?
What are those?

21
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,515
棒棒糖
Oh, lollipops.

22
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,933
给小孩子吃的
For the kids.

23
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,353
这样检查可以轻松一点
Makes the check-ups go easier.

24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,607
你肯定会给他们留下很好的印象的
You will make a wonderful impression.

25
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:12,696
喔 看看你
Look at you.

26
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,365
有约会吗?
Got a date?

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,741
好啦
Please.

28
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,951
如果有需要 就连系我们
You will contact us if you need us?

29
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:18,827
我们不会有事的
Oh, we'll be fine.

30
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,287
你们好好玩
You kids have fun.

31
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:21,789
你会爱死Athosian人的
You're gonna love the Athosians.

32
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,249
我要体验我的第一个Tandul盛宴
I'm going to experience
my first tandul feast.

33
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,920
那个很不错的 但是你得当心...
Oh, those are good, but watch out for the...

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,004
你们叫那个什么来这?
- What do you call it?

35
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:30,214
Roos酒
- Roos wine.

36
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,256
Roos酒
Roos wine.

37
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,925
味道很好 但是后劲很强
Tasty stuff, but a hell of a kick.

38
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,135
我们真的要走了
We really should be going.

39
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:38,138
好好玩 孩子们
Have fun, kids.

40
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,982
穿过森林就是定居点了
- The settlement is through the woods.

41
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:49,983
你带路
- Lead the way.

42
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:52,569
路程有点长 我来帮你拿这些吧
It is some distance.
Let me help you with those.

43
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,154
不用 没关系的
Oh no, no, it's okay.

44
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:55,531
是我自己白痴 打了这么多东西
I'm the idiot who over-packed.

45
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,033
我就应该自己拿
I should be the idiot carrying them.

46
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,161
看来Sheppard对于今晚的
So Sheppard was right, huh?

47
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:04,581
激情约会说得没错啊?
About that hot date tonight?

48
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:09,086
我真没想到会有这么远
I didn't think it would be this far.

49
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,052
这里一直是这么安静吗?
Is it always this quiet?

50
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:19,513
出事了
Something is wrong.

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,353
有人吗?
Hello?

52
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:33,360
有人吗!
Hello!

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,820
有人在吗?
Is anybody here?

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,989
大家都到哪去了?
Where is everyone?

55
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,910
我不知道 但是他们不是自愿离开的
I do not know, but they did not leave
of their own accord.

56
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,706
你是说他们被攻击了?
Are you saying they were attacked?

57
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,085
或者是被洗劫了
Or culled.

58
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:53,023
Stargate Atlantis
《星际之门：亚特兰提斯》
第四季 第7集
Season 4 Episode 07
Missing (v. 1.01)

59
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,781
我以为Wraith不知道这个星球
I thought the Wraith
didn't know about this planet.

60
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:05,494
我也是这么想的
That was my understanding as well.

61
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:08,497
那么 他们怎么会...
Well then, how could they just...

62
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,291
怎么了?
What is it?

63
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,474
你认识他们?
You know them?

64
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,477
我们必须离开
We must leave.

65
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:42,614
好的 到这里来


Over here.

66
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,203
放武器的地方太远了
The weapons cache is too far.

67
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:49,429
什么?
- What?

68
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,365
我们最好逃到星门那边去
- Better to make a run for the gate.

69
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,919
你在找什么?
What are you looking for?

70
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,496
你有带武器吗?
Did you bring a weapon?

71
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,440
没有 只有医疗用品
No, it's just medical supplies.

72
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,593
你没有带武器?
Don't you have a weapon?

73
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,636
只有一把刀
Just a knife.

74
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:05,679
我本来是来看望我的人民的
I was coming to visit my people.

75
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,557
我没想到我会需要枪
I did not believe I would need a gun.

76
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,975
那些是什么人?
- Who are those men?

77
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,018
Bola kai
- Bola Kai.

78
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:12,019
你认识他们?
- You know them?

79
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,479
我知道他们
- I know of them.

80
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,273
他们脸上的标记是他们部落特有的
The markings on their faces
are distinctive to their tribe,

81
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,359
但是我从没和他们交过锋...
but I have never
crossed paths with them...

82
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,778
直到现在
Until now.

83
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,531
他们危险吗?
Are they dangerous?

84
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,285
远远超过那个等级
Beyond dangerous.

85
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,412
我们走
Let's go.

86
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,485
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

87
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,154
我扭到了脚踝
I twisted my ankle.

88
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,447
我们得继续走
We have to keep moving.

89
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,324
等一下
Just hang on a sec.

90
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,702
骨折了吗?
Is it broken?

91
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,537
没有 我不觉得
No, I don't think so.

92
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,456
可能只是扭伤
It's probably just sprained.

93
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,086
把包丢在这 它太重了
Leave the bag. It's too heavy.

94
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,901
上帝 现在我们怎么办
Oh, God, what do we do?

95
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,362
要返回放武器的地方太危险了
It is too risky to return
to the weapons cache.

96
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,989
什么地方?
What weapons cache?

97
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:52,619
我们给了我的族人一些枪
以让他们自卫
We gave my people guns to protect themselves
in the event they were raided.

98
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:54,788
你...你为什么觉得
那些枪还会在那?
What makes you think
that the guns would still there?

99
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:56,957
那些人不会首先就把他们偷走吗?
Wouldn't that be the first thing
those guys would steal?

100
00:06:56,957 --> 00:07:00,878
如果Bola kai偷了枪
他们就会用的
If the Bola Kai stole them,
they would be using them.

101
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,423
但是放武器的地方太远了
尤其是在你这种情况下
But the weapons cache is too far, especially in your condition,

102
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,844
而且我们不知道
还有多少Bola kai在这
and we have no idea how many
more Bola Kai are out there.

103
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,476
我们最好的选择
是自己干掉这些守卫
Our best option is to take out
these guards by ourselves.

104
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,977
干掉他们? 你在说什么啊?
Take them out?
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,063
我们怎么干掉他们?
How are we going to do that?

106
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,565
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

107
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,150
嘿 我和你不一样
Hey, listen,
I am not like you.

108
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,112
我完全不会战斗
I don't know anything about fighting.

109
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:29,615
按我说的做就好了
Just do what I say.

110
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,992
相信我 我也想 但是...
I want to, believe me, but I...

111
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,410
我不认为我可以
I don't think I can.

112
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,079
你一定不能这么想
You must think otherwise.

113
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,956
我们首先得创造一个...
What we first need to do is create a...

114
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,785
他们走了
They're gone.

115
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,621
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

116
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,540
抱歉
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,875
我知道你对这种事没有准备
I know this is something
for which you are unprepared.

118
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,837
我知道我应该有准备的
I should be prepared, I know.

119
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,383
不幸的是 我恐怕
事情暂时只会变得更糟
Unfortunately, I'm afraid things may
get worse before they get better.

120
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:36,181
那些守卫会向其他人发出警示
他们会追捕我们
Those guards will alert and they will hunt us.
the others to our situation,

121
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:40,185
我们躲得时间越长
生存的机率就越大
The longer we avoid capture,
the better our chances.

122
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:43,355
他们会继续把守星门 但是时间一长
They will continue
to guard the Gate, yes,

123
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:46,942
Atlantis会发现我们迟到了
然后派出救援队
but in time,
Atlantis will realize we are late,
and they will send a rescue team.

124
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:50,029
但是我们应该是明天才回去的
But we're not due back till tomorrow.

125
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,575
所以在那之前我们必须逃避捕捉
It is therefore critical that
we elude capture until then.

126
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,077
你的伤要怎么处理?
What do you need to help your injury?

127
00:08:57,077 --> 00:09:03,625
我应该包扎一下
但是绷带在医疗包里
Well, I should probably wrap it, but the ace bandages
are in the medical kit.

128
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,339
那包在到武器库的路上
The kit is on the way
to the weapons cache.

129
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,134
希望它还在我们放....
Hopefully, it'll still be where we...

130
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,055
那是什么?
What is that?

131
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:21,143
他们在召集其他人了
They are summoning the others, gathering them.

132
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,855
追捕已经开始了
The hunt is beginning.

133
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,402
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

134
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:41,945
你动作得快一点
- You must move quickly.

135
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,031
我会的
- I will.

136
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,911
布洛芬(Ibuprofen)
Ibuprofen.

137
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:50,788
可以缓解疼痛和消肿
- Helps with the pain and swelling.

138
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:54,249
没错 McKay博士常用这个药
- Yes. Dr. Mckay uses them frequently,

139
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,711
还有抗组织胺药 抗酸药 晕车药...
along with antihistamines, antacids, motion-sickness pills...

140
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:02,549
你忘了说我刚开给他的
治疗不安跟综合症状药
You forgot the prescription I just
wrote him for restless leg syndrome.

141
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,718
我一直是一个很软弱的人
I've always been a wimp.

142
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,429
很不能忍受疼痛
I've got a low threshold for pain.

143
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:12,476
人们总是低估他们能忍受的不适
People often underestimate they are capable of enduring.
the level of discomfort

144
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:17,398
小时候 我和几个同伴一起
被送到森林里独自呆了10天
When I was a child, several of us were
sent into the woods for 10 days alone.

145
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,108
独自呆了10天?
10 days alone?

146
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,402
这是我们民族的一种考验仪式
It is a rite of passage among my people.

147
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,445
没有食物 也没有水
No food, no water.

148
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:25,489
被迫自己求生
Forced to survive on our own.

149
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:29,868
我们都不相信我们可以坚持
但是我们都做到了
None of us believed we could endure it,
but all of us did.

150
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:32,579
我去过一个夏令营
I went to summer camp.

151
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,207
那里还有其他的小孩
There were other kids.

152
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,292
我们住在小木屋里
We had cabins.

153
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:40,295
还有床睡
With beds.

154
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:43,048
有电有水
And electricity, and food.

155
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:45,092
我懂了
I see.

156
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:47,136
我连3天都没有坚持下来
I didn't even make it three days.

157
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:52,015
我想家了 于是打电话
叫我父母把我接回去了
I got homesick, called my parents to come and get me.

158
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,868
这是放武器的地方?
The weapons cache?

159
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:11,577
那么武器去哪了?
Well, where are the weapons?

160
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,704
很明显Bola kai没有拿走它们
Obviously, the Bola Kai don't have them.

161
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:17,041
我的族人肯定需要它们来反击
My people must have need them
to fight off the attack,

162
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,418
但是为什么他们没有成功呢?
but then why were they not successful?

163
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:23,380
Bola kai的武器跟这些肯定没法比
The Bola Kai's weapons
would have been no match against these.

164
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,136
- 那里
- 什么?
- Over there.
- What?

165
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,637
过了河有一个掩体
- There is a blind across the river.

166
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:31,513
掩体?
- A blind?

167
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:33,265
为了打猎用的 隐蔽性很好
For hunting.  It is well hidden.

168
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:36,518
可以用来做过夜的地方
It will provide shelter for the night.

169
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:49,364
我们得过那个?
We're going to cross that?

170
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:52,743
这是过河的最快的方法
It is the quickest way across.

171
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:56,080
你肯定是在开玩笑吧
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

172
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,083
这是我的族人架的
My people built it.

173
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,167
很安全的
It is quite safe.

174
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,668
哦...
I'm...

175
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,671
我也是这么觉得 只是...
I'm sure it is. It-it's just...

176
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:05,881
我...
Well, my...

177
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:11,595
我的脚踝 还有我内耳有病
my ankle, and I've also got this... inner ear thing.

178
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,390
我们叫它眩晕症 然后...
We call it vertigo, and...

179
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,060
上帝呀 你看看吧
God, look at it!

180
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:23,607
当不幸到达一定程度的时候
恐惧会消失 只留下求生的意念
There comes a point in adversity - leaving only the will to survive.
when fear disappears,

181
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:30,614
我知道 只是我不觉得
我和那有一点点接近
- I know, it's just, I don't think I'm even remotely close to that point.

182
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,116
好吧
Fine.

183
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,492
那就呆在这
Stay here then.

184
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,077
哦 好啦 等等
Oh, well, wait! I mean, I...

185
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:36,912
我是说...
I'm sure I could...

186
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:41,041
我确定我可以爬下山然后找一处...
I could climb down and find a...

187
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,419
水中的浅滩过河
Shallow spot in the river to cross.

188
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:48,424
那可能会多花一点时间... Teyla?
I mean, it might take me
a little longer but...

189
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,428
Teyla!

190
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:55,222
上帝呀
Oh, God...

191
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,767
开始了
Here we go.

192
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:03,021
这个非常的安全
It's perfectly safe...

193
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:06,525
非常安全
Perfectly safe.

194
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:07,943
有点晃
Wobbly...

195
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:11,405
很晃
Too wobbly...

196
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,094
快到了...
Almost there...

197
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,849
谢谢你
Thank you.

198
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:23,185
我们走
Come on.

199
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:34,071
也许你的人撑到了星门然后逃走了
Maybe your people managed to make it to the Gate and escape.

200
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,823
全部吗?
All of them?

201
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,908
我不知道 也许吧
Well, I don't know, maybe.

202
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:42,287
我们没有找到任何尸体 对吧?
I mean, we haven't found
any bodies, right?

203
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:49,002
据你说的 我觉得Bola kai
不会花时间来埋他们的食物的
From what you've said, take the time to bury their victims.
I doubt the Bola Kai would...

204
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:57,428
他们不会 因为他们吃完以后
通常也就不剩下什么了
No, they do not... because when they are done with their
victims, usually very little remains.

205
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,889
你说什么? 他们是吃人的吗?
What are you telling me,
they're cannibals?

206
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,101
Teyla?
Teyla?

207
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:51,899
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

208
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,733
没事
- Yeah.

209
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,650
呆在这
- Stay here.

210
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,360
怎么了 Teyla?
What? Teyla!

211
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,654
Teyla!
Teyla!

212
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,060
那个死了
That's one's dead, but...

213
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,312
但是这个还活着
He's still alive.

214
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,990
我们不能收囚犯
We cannot afford to take prisoners.

215
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,824
我们可以...
Well, we could...

216
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:26,160
把他们绑起来 然后遗弃在丛林里
We could have tied
him up and left him in the woods.

217
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,498
这样别人会发现他
然后释放他重新加入追捕
Then the others would have found him
and released him to rejoin the hunt.

218
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:38,881
我知道这个很难接受 但是他们
的数量越少我们存活的几率就越大
I know it is difficult to accept, but the fewer of them,
the better our chances at survival.

219
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:02,738
他的手被绑起来了
His hands are tied.

220
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,031
他肯定是一个...
He must have been a...

221
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:06,658
一个囚犯
a prisoner.

222
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:10,204
他的腹部有一个刺伤
He's got a stab wound to his abdomen.

223
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,373
你能把我的医疗包递给我吗?
Will you get me my medical kit?

224
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,166
我们得把他留在这
We have to leave him.

225
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,000
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,460
他是你的族人
He's one of your people.

227
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,130
他不是Athosian
He is not Athosian.

228
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,049
但是他的衣服...
But his... his clothes...

229
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,842
我从没见过他
I have never seen him before.

230
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,260
但明显他不是Bola kai
He's obviously not one of them,

231
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,430
如果我不缝合他的伤口
他会流血而死的
and if I don't suture his wound, he's going to bleed to death.

232
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,058
很快会有更多的Bola kai出现
More Bola Kai will be here very soon.

233
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:33,018
我知道 但这不会花很久的 好吗?
I know, but this won't take long, okay?
Please?

234
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,813
请你
Well...

235
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:55,332
我已经止住血了
I got the bleeding under control.

236
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:59,211
如果伤口不感染 他就会没事的
If the wound doesn't get infected,
he should be okay.

237
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,088
很快就要天黑了
It will be dark soon.

238
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,298
你和他呆在一起 我去找掩体
Stay here with him.
I will find the blind.

239
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:05,134
会很远吗?
- Is it far?

240
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,469
不远
- No.

241
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,680
找到了吗?
- Did you find it?

242
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,140
是的
- Yes.

243
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,600
他怎么样?
How is he?

244
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,894
还在昏迷状态 但是已经稳定了
Unconscious, but stable.

245
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:58,437
可以移动他吗?
Can he be moved?

246
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,813
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

247
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,065
应该不行
He shouldn't be.

248
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,859
他的情形很危险 我不愿意..
His condition's precarious. I would hate to...

249
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:06,653
好吧 可以移动他
Yes, he can be moved.

250
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,622
从河里打来的水
- Water from the river.

251
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,791
谢谢你
- Thank you.

252
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,795
我已经在周围布了陷阱
I have laid traps around the perimeter.

253
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:26,965
如果有Bola kai接近 幸运的话
我们能在他找到我们之前听到他
If any Bola Kai come near, hopefully, we will hear them
before they discover us.

254
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:29,343
好的
Good.

255
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:32,096
你的脚踝怎么样了?
How's your ankle?

256
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,848
肿得不是很厉害
The swelling's not too bad...

257
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:37,935
多亏了止痛药 疼痛也好多了
And the pain's eased up,
thanks to the painkillers.

258
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,145
如果你想睡觉 我可以...
If you wish to sleep, I can...

259
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:44,358
什么?
What?

260
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:18,142
那是什么?
What is that?

261
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:19,935
晚餐
Dinner.

262
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:23,939
他们被我们的体热吸引
They are attracted
to the warmth of our bodies.

263
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:34,950
味道不太好 但是可以维持生命
The taste leaves much to be desired,
but it will sustain you.

264
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:38,620
不用了 谢谢 我不饿
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

265
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,372
你应该吃一点
You should eat.

266
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:44,710
这是我对求生最讨厌的一部分
This was my least
favorite part of survivor.

267
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:54,011
他清醒过来了
He's regaining consciousness.

268
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:59,391
没事的
It's okay.

269
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,435
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

270
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,353
你是谁?
Who are you?

271
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:07,649
Nabel Golan...Genii
Nabel Golan... of the Genii.

272
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,276
Genii?
The Genii?

273
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:10,652
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

274
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:16,200
我被被安插进Athosian中间...
I was planted
to work inside the Athosian community...

275
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,619
收集情报
To gather intel.

276
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,246
他们发生了什么事?
What happened to them?

277
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:22,956
死了
Dead.

278
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:25,834
全部都死了
All of them.

279
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,757
谁杀了他们?
Who killed my people?

280
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:35,134
Wraith
Wraith.

281
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:37,803
洗劫了整个定居点
A culling. Entire settlement.

282
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:40,389
不是Bola kai?
Not the Bola Kai?

283
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:44,602
Bola kai把他们的事告诉了Wraith
Bola Kai were the ones
who told the Wraith about them.

284
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:48,063
Bola kai是Wraith崇拜者?
The Bola Kai are Wraith worshipers?

285
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:55,613
我逃过了攻击但是没法到达星门
I was able to... escape during the attack, but I was cut off from the Gate.

286
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:58,991
Bola kai在把守
Bola Kai were guarding it.

287
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,743
他们抓住了我
They captured me.

288
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:02,369
我从没见过你
I have never seen you before.

289
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,580
你在我的族人间生活了多久了?
How long have you lived among my people?

290
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,500
我是几天之前才到的
I only arrived a few days ago.

291
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:18,177
你们从哪来?
Where are you from?

292
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:20,554
她是我从另一个星球来的朋友
She is a friend of mine
from another world.

293
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:23,349
你的一起 看上去像是古人的
Your equipment, it looks ancestral.

294
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,351
我们在旅行途中发现的
We discovered it in our travels.

295
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,478
我们离开了一段时间去做交易
We have been away
for some time, trading.

296
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:29,396
交易?
Trading?

297
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:31,857
和谁交易?
With who?

298
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:35,778
如果你还在刺探情报
If you are still seeking intel,

299
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:39,198
你就是在浪费你仅剩的一点力气了
then you are wasting
what few breaths you have remaining.

300
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:42,618
说"谢谢你们救了我"
So say, "thank you for saving me",

301
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:46,121
然后我们的谈话就此结束
and be done with this discussion.

302
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:49,124
谢谢...
Thank you...

303
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:52,336
你们救了我
for saving me.

304
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:09,645
你一个晚上都没睡
You have not slept all night.

305
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:15,776
有人在追杀我们 附近还有
会遁地的动物 我怎么睡得着?
With people trying to kill us and... creatures crawling around
under the ground?

306
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:21,240
更不用说我是多么饿
Not to mention I'm starving.

307
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,162
不是这种饿
Not that starving.

308
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,330
这个能给你力量
- It will give you strength.

309
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,542
这个会使我呕吐
- It'll make me puke.

310
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:36,714
你不相信你有能力吃下它
所以你不吃
You do not believe and so you do not.
you are capable of eating it,

311
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:42,344
不 我认为它很恶心 所以才不吃
No, I think it's disgusting, and so I do not.

312
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:48,809
我有一个朋友和你很像
害怕挑战自己
I have a friend like you, afraid to challenge himself.

313
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,730
我不是害怕挑战
I'm not afraid of challenges.

314
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,276
我报名做了一个
跨星系探险队的首席医生
I signed up to be chief of medicine on an expedition
in a whole other galaxy.

315
00:24:57,276 --> 00:25:02,573
这是最具有挑战性的事了
但是吃这么粗劣的食物?
That's about as challenging as it gets, but eating gross food?

316
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:06,911
对不起 我绝对是要区别对待的
Sorry, but that's where I draw the line.

317
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,955
很好
Fair enough.

318
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:40,319
看见了
See?

319
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,696
没有吐哦
No puking.

320
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:45,532
嗯
Yet.

321
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,331
那么你的这个朋友...
So this... friend of yours...

322
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:54,750
是你队里的成员吗?
One of your team members?

323
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,004
也许是某个保守的天体物理学家?
A certain uptight astrophysicist maybe?

324
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:00,756
不是
No.

325
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:03,425
是一个Athosian
Athosian.

326
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:05,970
他叫Kanan
His name is Kanan.

327
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,306
一个天生的领袖
但是被天生的过虑所累
A natural leader,
but he is unaware of it,

328
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:14,061
自己不觉得(自己是个领袖)
burdened by an overly cautious nature.

329
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,315
他不仅仅是一个朋友吧?
He's more than a friend, isn't he?

330
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,943
他就是你要见的人
He's the one you were coming to see.

331
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:23,988
那个"激情约会"
The hot date.

332
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,614
抱歉
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:26,907
这不关我的事
It's none of my business.

334
00:26:26,907 --> 00:26:29,994
我应该学者闭嘴的
I should just learn to shut up.

335
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:32,788
我们从小就认识
We have known each other
since childhood,

336
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:37,793
但是最近才发展到超越友谊的程度
but only recently kindled
more than a friendship.

337
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:46,427
我还没有告诉任何人呢
I have not told anyone yet.

338
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:50,931
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

339
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:54,935
我们需要更多的水
We need more water.

340
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:20,085
我们得走了
We have to leave.

341
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:21,754
发生了什么?
- What happened?

342
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:23,422
你可以走路吗?
- Can you walk?

343
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:25,299
我认为他站都站不起来
I don't even think he can stand.

344
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:27,259
很快 很多Bola kai就会到达这里
Very soon, many more
Bola Kai will be here.

345
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,469
没事的
It's all right.

346
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:30,554
我可以走
I can walk.

347
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,519
Mr. Freeze 不对 是King Tut
(以下五人皆是蝙蝠侠电视剧中人物)
Mr. Freeze, no, King Tut.

348
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,313
两个都错了
Otto Breminger演的是Mr. Freeze
Wrong on both.
Otto Preminger was Mr. Freeze.

349
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:41,232
Victor Buono是King Tut
Victor Buono was King Tut.

350
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,441
Vincent Price是Egghead
- Vincent Price was Egghead.

351
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,026
Egghead 没错
- Egghead, right.

352
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,486
那好 Cliff Robertson是?
Okay, so, Cliff Robertson?

353
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:47,488
我我知道这个 他演牛仔的对吧?
Oh, I know this one.
Played the cowboy, right?

354
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,156
嘿
Hey.

355
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:50,824
Teyla和Keller回来了吗?
Teyla and Keller get back?

356
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:51,992
我还没有听到他们的消息呢
- I haven't heard from them yet.

357
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:53,369
他们迟到了
- They're late.

358
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,620
这听上去不像Teyla的作风
- That doesn't sound like Teyla.

359
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,579
一点也不像
- No, it doesn't.

360
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,623
她昨晚吃了个大餐
Well, she had that big feast last night.

361
00:27:57,623 --> 00:28:00,709
也许她玩过头了 需要多睡点觉
Maybe she did too much celebrating,
and needs to sleep it off.

362
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,962
嗯 这听上去很像Teyla
Yeah, that sounds like Teyla.

363
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,464
我们呼叫她一下
Let's give her a call.

364
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:07,716
Shame
- Shame.

365
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:08,968
- 什么东西?
- Cliff Robertson
- What is? Cliff Robertson.

366
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:10,135
他扮演的那个反派 Shame
The villain he played, Shame.

367
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,263
很好 Shelley Winters
Very good. Shelley Winters.

368
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:15,391
你们两个在说什么啊?
What the hell are you talking about?

369
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:19,895
我得休息一下
I need to rest.

370
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:34,285
他在拖累我们
而且使你的脚伤更严重了
He is slowing us down, and he is making
your ankle injury worse.

371
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,079
如果我们把他丢在这
Bola kai会抓住他的
Well, if we leave him behind,
the Bola Kai are going to capture him.

372
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,375
如果继续这样 我们都会被抓住的
If we continue this way,
we will all be captured.

373
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:52,845
我承认我对某些事不太在行
Look, I'm the first to admit I'm not very good at certain things.

374
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:59,226
我不会运动 我不能烧饭
你都不会愿意听我弹钢琴
I'm not athletic, I can't cook, and you don't even want to hear me
try to play the piano,

375
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:02,730
但是我想我很会看人
but I do think I'm a pretty good
judge of character,

376
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,734
我知道你绝对不会为了就自己
and I know that you would never sacrifice an innocent man,

377
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:11,530
牺牲一个无辜的人
即使他是一个陌生人
not even if he was a complete stranger, to save yourself,

378
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,659
也就是说你提出这个意见
完全是为了我
which means the only reason you would
even suggest it would be because of me.

379
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:16,911
我带你来的
I brought you here.

380
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:18,454
这是我的责任
This is my responsibility.

381
00:29:18,454 --> 00:29:19,496
如果你有什么不测...
If anything should happen to you...

382
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:22,458
我自己报名的 对吧?
I signed up for this, all right?

383
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,210
全部的这些事
All of it.

384
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,630
我也许本来没有
任何概念我会面对什么
I may not have had any idea
what I was getting into,

385
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,718
但是这不会使我
区别于Atlantis上的任何人
but... that makes me no different
from anybody else on Atlantis.

386
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:33,928
我很高兴你这么想
- I'm glad you feel that way...

387
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,679
我知道...
- Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

388
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,850
但在事情结束之前
我要尽量鼓足勇气
Before this is all over, I'm gonna have
to find all the courage I can muster.

389
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:42,102
事实上
Actually...

390
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,439
你现在就要
You're going to need
to find it right now.

391
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:48,192
哦 上帝
Oh, God.

392
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:16,595
Teyla!
Teyla!

393
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:32,861
Teyla Atlantis呼叫 收到吗?
Teyla? This is Atlantis, do you read?

394
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:37,866
Teyla 我是Sheppard 回话
Teyla, this is Sheppard, come in.

395
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,618
她绝不会关掉对讲机的
She wouldn't turn off her radio.

396
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:42,121
她不会的
No, she wouldn't.

397
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:46,333
呼叫Athosian定居点的任何人
这是John Sheppard中校
Calling anyone this is Lieutenant Colonel
in the Athosian settlement, John Sheppard.

398
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,878
收到吗?
Do you copy?

399
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:53,257
Teyla 这是Sheppard 请回话...
Teyla, this is Sheppard,
please respond...

400
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,065
他们要对我们怎么样?
What are they going to do to us?

401
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:13,110
我们会试着获取信息
They will try to extricate information.

402
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,071
我们什么都不能说
We must tell them nothing.

403
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:22,494
Keller医生 Atlantis里的
每一个人都有生命危险
Dr. Keller, the lives of everyone
in Atlantis are at stake.

404
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:25,206
我知道

405
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,294
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

406
00:31:32,713 --> 00:31:34,798
你从哪来?
Where are you from?

407
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:36,300
什么?
What?

408
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,636
你的家在那?
Your home?

409
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,766
Chippewa Falls 威斯康星州
Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

410
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,602
一个小镇
A little town.

411
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:48,687
你有家人吗?
Do you have any family?

412
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:50,648

我是他仅剩的东西了
I'm all he's got left.

417
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:06,830
那么你必须要尽可能去求生
去返回家园
Then you must do to return home.
everything you can to survive,

418
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,125
你必须...
You must...

419
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,129
你会活下来的
You will survive.

420
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:17,841
你会活着回家的 你听懂了嘛?
You will return home.
Do you understand?

421
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:38,195
你们是谁?
Who are you?

422
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:41,156
我是Athosian
I am Athosian.

423
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:49,164
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

424
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:52,501
我不管你相信什么
I do not care what you believe.

425
00:32:56,088 --> 00:33:00,426
你越不讲话 就会越惨
The longer you are silent,
the worse it will be for you.

426
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:02,052
我告诉过你
I told you.

427
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:07,391
我们是Athosian 你会为你对
我的人民所做的一切付出代价
We are Athosian, and you will suffer for what
you have done to our people.

428
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:08,767
我们做的一切?
What we've done?

429
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,854
你谋杀了他们 一整个村庄
You murdered them, an entire village.

430
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:14,231
我们到的时候那个村庄已经没人了
That village was deserted
when we arrived.

431
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:19,403
没人了是因为那里被
你们带来的Wraith洗劫了
Deserted because Wraith who were brought here by you.
it was culled by the Wraith,

432
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:20,988
你知道我们是谁吗?
Do you know who we are?

433
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:22,573
你们是Bola kai
You are Bola Kai.

434
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:25,367
那你知道我们像
其他人一样都被Wraith捕杀
Then you know we are hunted
by the Wraith like everyone else.

435
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:29,330
除非你们是Wraith崇拜者
Unless you are Wraith worshipers.

436
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:34,418
把她带出去
Get her out of here!

437
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:50,476
我会饶了她一命
如果你告诉我你是谁
I'm willing to spare her life if you tell me who you are.

438
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,412
你有告诉他们什么吗?
Did you tell them anything?

439
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:12,206
他们说他们会杀了你的
They said they would kill you.

440
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,708
你和他们说了Atlantis的事?
You told them about Atlantis?

441
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,544
没有
No.

442
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:18,045
我...
I...

443
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:21,215
我给了他们一个无人的星球的地址
I gave them a Gate address,

444
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:26,929
只是调虎离山 就像你说的
为我们赢得一些时间
an uninhabited planet, buy us more time, like you said.
just to throw them off,

445
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:34,728
我不觉得他们是Wraith崇拜者
I don't think they're Wraith worshipers.

446
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:39,483
那个人被你指控帮助Wraith
的时候真的很惊讶
That guy in there, he seemed surprised when you accused him
of working with the Wraith.

447
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:43,112
如果这是实情 他为什么会否认?
Why would he deny it if it was true?

448
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:47,491
我认为他承认以后就可以
更好地威胁我们讲出实情
I would think that would provide to get us to talk.
an even more effective threat

449
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:52,037
那难道他们正好就在
定居点刚被洗劫以后来到了这里?
So they just happened to arrive here moments after the settlement was culled?

450
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:55,040
我觉得这太巧合了
I find that a coincidence.

451
00:34:57,376 --> 00:35:00,504
有东西刚从大门里通过
是一种飞船
Something just came through the portal,
a flying ship of some kind, but

452
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:02,590
但是在我们能反应之前就消失了
it disappeared before
we could do anything.

453
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,134
你们两个 看住他们
You two, watch them.

454
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:08,429
剩下的人 拿上武器跟我来
The rest of you,
get your weapons and come with me!

455
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,224
我们不用等多久了
Not much longer.

456
00:35:15,728 --> 00:35:18,564
把守星门的人看上去
肯定不是Athosian
Those guys guarding the Gates
certainly don't look Athosian.

457
00:35:18,564 --> 00:35:19,732
他们是Bola kai
- They're Bola Kai.

458
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:21,358
- 什么人?
- 是一个武士部落
- What? It a warrior tribe. Ruthless.

459
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:23,360
很残忍 喜欢挑起战争
They like picking fights,

460
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,195
尤其是对和平的部落
especially with tribes who are peaceful.

461
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:27,031
太好了 正是我们需要的
另一帮坏蛋
Great, just what we need,
another bad guy.

462
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:28,115
别担心
Don't worry.

463
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:29,533
他们很原始 我们可以搞定他们的
They're primitive.
We can handle them.

464
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,160
定义一下"原始"
Define primitive.

465
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,286
木棍和弓箭
- Clubs and arrows.

466
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:33,704
嘿 弓箭是可以伤人的
- Hey, arrows can hurt.

467
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:36,457
只有在你笨到
可以让屁股中箭的时候
Only if you're stupid enough
to get hit in the ass with one.

468
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:37,750
生命信号?
- Life signs?

469
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,960
到处都是 绝大多数在森林里
- All over the place. Mostly in the woods.

470
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,629
这里很难看得清楚
It's hard to get a visual from up here.

471
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,297
好吧 我们得徒步行进
All right, we'll have to go
on foot then.

472
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,965
带上装备 伙计们
Gear up, boys.

473
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:48,552
如果这些家伙想要战斗
就好好地和他们干一架
If these guys want a fight, happy to give it to 'em.

474
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:05,569
John?
John?

475
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:08,822
Nabel...
Nabel...

476
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:11,242
后退
Move back.

477
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:16,956
你的枪是从哪来的?
Where did you get the gun?

478
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:21,001
Athosian不是唯一会藏武器的民族
The Athosians were not the only ones
with a hidden cache of weapons.

479
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,630
Bola kai在我到达我
放武器的地方之前把我抓住了
The Bola Kai captured me
before I could get to mine.

480
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:30,427
我们得快点走
We need to get moving.

481
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:33,097
他们肯定听到了枪声
They no doubt heard the gunfire.

482
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,318
他们追来了吗?
They coming?

483
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:47,820
看上去没有
It does not appear so.

484
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,406
我觉得可以安全的休息了
I believe it is safe to rest.

485
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:55,703
谢谢你来救我们
Thank you for coming for us.

486
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:57,371
你们救了我
You saved my life.

487
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:59,832
我觉得我应该还你们人情
I figured I'd return the favor.

488
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,333
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

489
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,918
我还不能死呢
Well, I can't die yet.

490
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:06,130
我有太多的问题需要求解
I have far too many questions
I need answers to first.

491
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:12,261
我们可以从你告诉我
Atlantis的星门地址开始
We can start with you giving me
the Gate address to Atlantis.

492
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:20,352
我检测到生命信号
这边 这边 这边 还有这边
I've got lifesigns, there, there, there, and there.

493
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:22,313
这真是缩小范围了
- That really narrows it down.

494
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:23,689
这边走
- That way.

495
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:24,899
真的? 为什么?
Really? Why?

496
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:26,442
没有理由
No reason.

497
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:28,235
对我来说足够了
Good enough for me.

498
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:30,154
我们走
Let's go.

499
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,073
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

500
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:35,701
告诉我地址 我就放你们走
Just give me the address
and I'll let you go.

501
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:38,120
我保证
I promise.

502
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,123
看来你的伤没有我想象的那么严重
I see you're not
as badly wounded as I thought.

503
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:42,583
哦 伤很严重
Oh, it's bad.

504
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,960
只是我很能忍受疼痛
I just have a high tolerance for pain.

505
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,673
告诉我地址 然后我就让你们走
The address, and I'll let you go, both of you.

506
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:51,759
你在骗人
You're lying.

507
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:54,136
你不是Genii 对吧?
You're not Genii, are you?

508
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:56,347
我们和他们有共识
We have an understanding with them.

509
00:37:56,347 --> 00:38:01,185
他们不会依靠这种手段来联系我们
They wouldn't need to resort
to these tactics in order to contact us.

510
00:38:01,185 --> 00:38:06,607
好吧 那一部分不是真的
但我确实被Bola kai抓住了
All right, so that part wasn't true, but I was captured by the Bola Kai.

511
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:09,568
你是Wraith崇拜者
You're the Wraith worshiper.

512
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:14,240
是你造成了那些Athosian的死
You're the one responsible
for the death of the Athosians.

513
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,868
除非...我在这个上面撒谎了
Unless I lied about that as well.

514
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,787
你什么意思? 他们没有死?
What do you mean, they're not dead?

515
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:24,458
告诉我地址 然后我会
很乐意地告诉你一切
Give me the Gate address, and I'll gladly tell you everything.

516
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,358
别动
- Don't move.

517
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,403
解开我
- Untie me.

518
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,489
让开
- Get out of the way.

519
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,199
把枪给我
- Give me the gun.

520
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,326
我会开枪的
I'll shoot you.

521
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:00,953
你不会的
No, you won't.

522
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:02,705
你的本性不是这样的
You don't have it in you.

523
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:06,500
你是一个医生 一个治疗者
You're a doctor, a healer...

524
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,253
不是一个杀手
Not a killer.

525
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:12,339
你说的没错 我是一个治疗者
You're right, I am a healer,

526
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:16,260
但是首先我得有东西治
but first I need something to heal.

527
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:33,235
我的人怎么了?
What happened to my people?

528
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:37,239
他们怎么了?
What happened to them?

529
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:06,018
你没事吧?
- You okay?

530
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:06,810
没事
- Yeah.

531
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,145
发生了什么?
What happened?

532
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:11,106
我的人 他们不见了
My people, they are gone.

533
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:14,485
你说什么? 都不见了? 怎么回事?
What are you talking about?
All of them? What happened?

534
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,947
Nabel!
Nabel!

535
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:21,700
他去哪了?
- Where did he go?

536
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,826
我没看见
- I didn't see.

537
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:24,995
你们在说谁啊?
Who are you talking about?

538
00:40:25,704 --> 00:40:26,705
是箭!
Not arrows!

539
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:27,373
我们得离开了!
We need to move!

540
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:29,833
快点 我们走!
Come on, let's go! Well...

541
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,772
你感觉怎么样?
How you feeling?

542
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:53,857
我没事
I am fine.

543
00:40:53,857 --> 00:40:55,651
Keller医生坚持让我卧床
Dr. Keller insists I remain in bed.

544
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:57,820
她害怕我有脑震荡
She fears I have a concussion.

545
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,406
你应该听她的
Well, you should listen to her.

546
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,450
我们刚从New Athos回来
We just got back from New Athos.

547
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,286
Bola kai都走了
The Bola Kai are all gone.

548
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,705
我们肯定把他们吓怕了
Must have scared them off.

549
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:12,126
Rodney已经带人去搜集
你的族人的线索
Rodney's got teams going out there to collect clues about
what happened to your people.

550
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:14,628
你们有找到Nabel 吗?
Did you find Nabel?

551
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:17,548
搜遍了整个星球 没有生命信号
Searched the entire planet,
no life signs.

552
00:41:17,548 --> 00:41:19,508
他肯定是从星门逃走了
He must have escaped through the Gate.

553
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:22,511
或者更有可能的是 他暴尸荒野了
Or, more likely,
he's lying dead somewhere.

554
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:26,015
他知道我的族人发生了什么
He knows what happened to my people.

555
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:27,850
我会找到他们的
I will find them.

556
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,476
我知道你会的 而且我们会帮助你
I know you will,
and we're going to help you,

557
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:32,313
但是你现在得休息 恢复体力
but you've got to rest
and get your strength back.

558
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:35,024
不管这是谁做的 他都要复出代价
Whoever did this will pay.

559
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:38,235
我保证
I will make certain of it.

560
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:43,198
你感觉怎么样 医生
Hey, Doc, how you feeling?

561
00:41:43,198 --> 00:41:46,911
只是扭伤 我会没事的
Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.

562
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:50,456
为什么你可以恢复工作
但是我不行?
Why is it that you are allowed
to resume working, and I am not?

563
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:53,459
因为我没参与那么多打斗
Because I didn't take
half the beating you did.

564
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,627
我经历过更糟糕的情况
- I have suffered worse.

565
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:57,254
我相信你 但是你在我的地盘上
- Yeah, well, I believe you, but you're on my turf now,

566
00:41:57,254 --> 00:41:59,423
你就得听我的
so you have to listen to me.

567
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:02,426
我晚些再来看你
I'll check in on you later.

568
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:06,472
那么...
So...

569
00:42:06,472 --> 00:42:10,100
我得到许可回家休几天假
(R&R=美国军队每年5天之假期)
I got permission to go home
for a few days of R&R.

570
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,729
上帝保佑那个跨星系星门桥能用
God bless that
intergalactic gate bridge, huh?

571
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:16,523
不管怎么样
Anyway...

572
00:42:16,523 --> 00:42:19,985
我得去看看我爸爸
I get to see my dad...

573
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:24,448
为这个我得谢谢你
And I have you to thank for that.

574
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:30,454
我在这要住多久?
How long must I stay here?

575
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:33,666
再有一两天吧
About another day or so.

576
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:36,085
我告诉过你了 我没事
I told you, I feel fine.

577
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,003
我没有脑震荡
I do not have a concussion.

578
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:40,005
没错
You're right.

579
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:41,966
你没有
You don't.

580
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:46,929
Teyla 我看过你的检测结果了
Teyla, I've looked over
your test results.

581
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:50,891
我有件事要和你谈谈...
There's something we need to talk about.
