砸砸店铺 吓吓人什么的

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,590

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,660
过了一阵子 他就不来找我了
After a while he just stopped checking in.

115
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,380
我要求全面监控还有支援

结果什么都没有
I get nothing.

117
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,870
我全靠我自己
I was completely on my own.

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,850
杰克斯先生 我们能为你做什么?
So, what can we do for you, Mr. Jakes?

119
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,420
我的加齐宝贝 野心勃勃
My boy Gazi, he's got ambitions.

他打算做掉雷曼 计划找杀手来做
He's wants to take out Raman. He's planning a hit.

121

You are going to be my old friend John the hit-man.

124

我会把你介绍给加齐
I'm going to introduce you to Gazi.

125
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,240
你会去见他 和他聊聊 和他达成协议
You're gonna meet him, you're gonna talk to him, you're gonna take the contract.

126
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,680
然后我就可以抓他了  
And then we pick him up.

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,890
意图谋杀 罪名不小
Conspiracy to murder, that's big.

128
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,340
是的 我不想让他耽误我的案子
Yeah, I need him out of the way.

129
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,370
我要抓的是他的老板
 I need a clear shot at his boss.

130
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,140
我想雷曼进监狱 不是要他死
I want Raman in prison, not dead.

131
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
好了 听着 我们第一步
Alright, listen up. Our first step...

132
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,160
稍等一下
 Just wait a second.

133
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,990
你怎么知道这次暗杀是他策划的?
How do you know about this hit he's got planned?

134
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,360
他告诉我的
He told me.

135
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,970
所以你没有建议他这样做
So you didn't offer?

136
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,090
没有 当然没有
No, of course not.

137
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,400
你想说什么?
What's your point?

138
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,100
我想说 我想知道我到底
My point is, is just I want to know

139
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,460
走进的是个什么样的局
 what I'm walking myself into here.

140
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,080
要确保这次会面没有问题

142
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,550
这次行动没问题
The job is solid.

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,690
杰西 你从内部接应

我需要给你装上监听装置
I'm going to have to wire you.

147

看你的衣服 我只能把东西安在你的前胸上了
With what you're wearing, I'm gonna have to do your chest.

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,580
- 能吧衣服脱了吗? - 好的
- Can you take your shirt off? - Yeah.

149
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,910
开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

150
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,910
怎么了?
What?

151
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,230

一旦加齐让约翰达成协议 我们就抓到他了
As soon as Gazi offers John the contract, we got him.

157
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,470
好的 他们刚进来
Alright, they just came in.

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,790
杰西 一定要盯住他们
Jesse, make sure you keep them in sight.

159
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,720
收到
Copy that.

160
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,470
表面看来一切都合法
On the face of it is completely legit,

161
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,540
但是几个小时之后一切就完全变样了
but after hours it's a whole different thing.

162
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,430
不戴手套 赤拳搏击 赌注很大 代价惨重
The gloves come off, bare knuckle fights. A lot of gambling, a lot of blood.

163
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,780
就没有被关停过吗? 
They never get shut down?

164
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,760
没有 从来没有
No, never.

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,990
雷曼知道买通谁 花多少钱
Raman knows exactly who to pay off, and exactly how much.

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,230
那边的那个家伙 
The guy in there right now,

167
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,530
我后面的家伙 绿T恤
the guy behind me, green shirt,

168
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,910
是教练达菲  伊莱・达菲
that's the trainer Duffy, Eli Duff.

169
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,560
拳手都是由他负责
He runs all the fighters.

170
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,750
每个拳手还是俱乐部的保镖
Every single one of them does double duty as enforcers.

171
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,570
和他在一起的那个孩子 是加文
The kid in there with him, that's Gavin.

172
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,750
如果你不还钱 他就会来 打断你的胳膊
If you don't pay your debt, he comes by, he breaks your arms.

173
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,460
好的
Ok.

174
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,910
那边的那位 就是加齐
So, over there. That's my guy Gazi,

175
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,270
雷曼的副手
Raman's second in command.

176
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,620
他想除掉雷曼这样可以接管整个组织
He wants Raman gone so he can take over the whole operation.

177
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,180
他疑心很重 所以别介意
He's a little paranoid, so don't take it personally.

178
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,590
他在计划除掉老板 
Well, he's planning to kill his boss,

179
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,300
我要是他我也会疑心重重的
 I'd be paranoid too.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
他们在接近加齐
They're approaching Gazi.

181
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,790
他来了
There he is.

182
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,060
怎么 喔 等等 等等 等一下
What... whoa, wait, wait, wait for it, wait.

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,480
那家伙说对不起 以后不会晚了
Chewy says he's sorry, won't be late again.

184
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
别说我没给你钱
Don't say I never gave you nothing.

185
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,010
哦 这位是我朋友 就是那个人
Oh, this is my friend. This is the guy.

186
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,070
我跟你说过的那个 
The guy I told you about.

187
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,300
你好 我是约翰
How you doing? John.

188
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,200
他很有两下子 参过军
He does the thing, the service.

189
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,010
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

190
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,800
我怎么跟你说的?他不喜欢新面孔就是他
What did I tell you? He hates new people, this guy.

191
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,210
加齐 我么谈过的 你需要一个人
Gazi, we had the conversation, you wanted to meet a guy,

192
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,860
你眼前的就是
now you're meeting him.

193
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,750
什么情况? 
What's happening?

194
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,510
我不知道 好像被耍了
I don't know. Looks like a stand off.

195
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,430
朋友 你想多了吧
You're imagining things, my friend.

196
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,740
马上走人吧
You need to walk away right now.

197
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
我告诉过他这不是个好主意
I told him this was a bad idea.

198
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,880
这家伙 根本听不懂话 
He's got zero judgment, this guy.

199
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,040
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

200
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,840
你觉得他会在众目睽睽之下说这事 得了吧
You think he's going to discuss business in front of all these people? Come on.

201
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,570
抱歉 快点 我们走吧
Apologize. Come on, let's go.

202
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,230
你玩死我了 你知道吗?
You're killing me here, you know that?

203
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,530
告诉他我们换个地方再见 砖厂 北面
Tell him we're gonna meet somewhere else. Brickworks, north side.

204
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,970
- 好的 - 停车场那儿
- Yes. - In the parking lot.

205
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,540
好的 好办法
Alright that'll work, that's good.

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,050
我会去问他的
I'll ask him.

207
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,300
砖厂 北面 停车场
Brickworks, north side, parking lot.

208
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,300
二十分钟后见 最后机会
Be there in twenty minutes, your last chance.

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
好的 他们要出来了
Alright, they're on their way out.

210
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,530
我们在车里等 让加齐来找我们
We're going to wait here in the car. Let Gazi come to us.

211
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,940
等他坐进来了 让他主导谈话
When he comes in, let him drive the conversation.

212
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,050
- 别引导他 好吗? - 好的
- Don't lead him, alright? - All right.

213
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,140
玛利亚和丹尼会在两点钟方向待命
Maria and Danny are going to be at 2 o'clock running spin.

214
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,380
他们怎么想的弄个车窗贴膜的车
What's he thinking with these tinted windows,

215
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,520
加齐坐到后排我们怎么能看得见
how are we going to see Gazi when he's in the backseat?

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,090
丽贝卡停在我们后面她会看着入口的
Rebecca will be in the lot behind us. She'll have eyes on the entrance.

217
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,610
丽贝卡来了
 Here's Rebecca.

218
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,810
好了 她就位了
Ok, she's in position.

219
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,900
看到丽贝卡真好 她看起来好极了
It's good to see Rebecca, she looks good.

220
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,420
你们合作还好吗?
You two getting along?

221
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,820
大多数时间还行
Most of the time.

222
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,880
是的 她是需要时间适应一下
Yeah, she takes a while that one.

223
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,260
你们会好起来的
You two will be fine.

224
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,770
她绝对值得合作
She's worth it.

225
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,910
她是最好的 真的
She's one of a kind, seriously.

226
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,190
我认识的最好的警察
The best cop I've ever known.

227
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,550
约翰 加齐进入大门
John, Gazi's approaching the entrance.

228
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,870
准备
 Get ready.

229
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,190
我们看见了
 We got eyes.

230
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,800
好的 他来了
 OK, here he is.

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,530
不错 加齐是一个人来的
 We're good, Gazi's alone.

232
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,170
约翰 你能看清楚吗? 
John, do you have a clear view?

233
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,430
是的 没问题
 Yeah, we're good.

234
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,630
- 他干嘛呢? - 他是要出来吗?
- What is he doing? - Is he gonna get out?

235
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,380
放心 他只是比较小心而已
Relax. He's just being cautious.

236
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,250
快点啊 加齐
Come on, Gazi.

237
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,160
好了 我们开始了
 Alright, here we go.

238
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,770
丽贝卡 有人开枪
Shots fired, Rebecca

239
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,500
枪手在哪?
Where's... where's the shooter?

240
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,360
在那 货仓那边
There he is, by the warehouse.

241
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,870
丹尼尔 盯住他
Daniel, stay with him.

242
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,230
我看见他了 看见了 
I got him. I got him,

243
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,690
朝南逃去 我们正在追捕
he's headed south. We're in pursuit.

244
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,720
有枪击发生 砖厂北面停车场
Shots fired. Brickworks, north side parking lot,

245
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
马上派救护车
send an ambulance.

246
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,710
好了 坚持住
Alright, hold on.

247
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,840
我想说的是这一切都仅仅依靠杰克斯的消息
All I'm saying is this whole thing is based on Jakes' information.

248
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,240
杰克斯的判断 对吧?
Jakes' judgment, all right?

249
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,270
如果他干得好 他应该知道暗杀的事
If he was doing his job, he would have known about the hit.

250
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,460
但是你不是在指责他 
But you're not placing blame.

251
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,520
不 我没有在指责他
No I'm not placing blame.

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,160
丽贝卡 等一下好吗?
Rebecca, wait, okay?

253
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,520
我以前和这样的人合作过好吗?
I've worked with guys like this before, all right?

254
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,380
- 他们独断专行 - 你不是?
- They fly by the seat of their pants. - And you don't?

255
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,520
如果加齐被做掉 他就会做到
If Gazi was exposed... he should have been on top of that...

256
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,210
他不知道会这样 约翰
He didn't know it was going to happen, John.

257
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,500
要是你 你也会做这样的决定
You would have made the same call.

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,060
我知道这家伙是你朋友 好吗
I know this guy's a friend of yours, all right,

259
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,910
但是也许你对他有盲区 这点你想过吗?
but maybe you've got a blind spot for this guy. Do you ever think of that?

260
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,910
他是个好警察 你说话小心点
He's a good cop, you need to back off.

261
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,940
瑞克・加齐在西奈医院死亡
 Ric Gazi was DOA at Mount Sinai.

262
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,550
凶杀组要你打电话
Homicide wants you to call.

263
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,390
这还用说
I'm sure they do.

264
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,410
你需要作出全面报告 我们都需要
You're gonna have to give a full statement. We all are.

265
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,960
- 凶手呢? - 跑了
- Shooter? - He got away.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,990
伙计们 我不知道 我发誓
I had no idea guys, I swear to God.

267
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,020
那么到底怎么回事 雷曼收到风声了?
So, what happened. Raman caught wind of the hit?

268
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,180
知道他的手下要杀他 就先下手了?
Found out his boy's coming after him, got there first?

269
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,490
是的 一定是这样的 
Yeah, must have been.

270
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,450
也许是先发制人
Could have been a pre-emptive strike.

271
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,120
杰克斯 意味着你也完了
It means you might be done, Jakes.

272
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,340
太糟糕了 八个月的努力就这么泡汤了
Too bad. That's eight months work down the drain.

273
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,510
或者这对我有利
Or maybe it works in my favor.

274
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,490
这是个机会 往上走的好机会
It's an opportunity, maybe it's a chance to move up.

275
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,590
怎么说?
How do you figure that?

276
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,580
你是加齐的人 怎么能逃的过雷曼的眼睛
You're one of Gazi's boys, Raman's going to smell you a mile away.

277
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,950
伙计们 我现在需要做的事就是行动
All I gotta do is make a move, guys.

278
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,220
我传出消息 向雷曼表示衷心 
I just gotta send a message.

279
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,820
让他知道我没参与这事
Show Raman that I'm loyal, that I wasn't involved.

280
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,780
约翰说的对 你可能就是下一个目标
John could be right. You could be next in line for a bullet.

281
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,070
如果我的人和你一起 我的人也有危险
And if my guys are with you, they're in danger too.

282
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,290
我们需要确保杰克斯的安全
We need to make sure Jakes is safe.

283
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,600
这是我们下一步要做的
That's our next move.

284
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,600
我们可以安插杰西进去
We could put Jesse in

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,940
充当拳手和保镖 也许?
 as a fighter slash enforcer, maybe?

286
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,300
他已经加入俱乐部了 有掩护的身份了
He's already been in the club. He's established.

287
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,770
约翰?
 John?

288
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,380
是的 他也许想挣点钱
Yeah, he could be looking for extra cash.

289
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,360
杰克斯 你可以带他进去 介绍一下
Jakes, you can walk him in, make the intro.

290
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,270
他可以充当你的手下
He could be one of your boys.

291
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,800
这样看起来行得通
It'll give us a sense.

292
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,490
如果有人打你的主意 杰克斯
If anyone looks at you sideways, Jakes,

293
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,040
任务结束 我们立刻撤出
 that's it, we're out.

294
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,980
收到
Copy that.

295
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
小子 我希望你知道怎么打拳
 Kid, I hope you know how to fight.

296
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,010
天才少年 速成选手
Raw talent, quick learner.

297
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,400
你需要人帮你收钱 他也可以
You need a guy to do collections, he can do that too.

298
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,920
你说你在找新人
You said you were looking for new people.

299
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,730
你好?
How you doing?

300
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,540
你在哪认识他的?
Where'd you find him?

301
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,780
我认识的以女孩儿 他是她弟弟
This girl I know, he's her kid brother.

302
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,200
她都快疯了 她觉得他是下一个巨星
She's insane, she thinks he's the next big thing.

303
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,770
也许她是对的
Maybe she's right.

304
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,640
是的 听着 小子 这个是达菲 
Yeah, listen kid, this is Duffy,

305
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,060
他让你做什么你就做什么 明白了吗?
 you do exactly what he says, all right?

306
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,580
是的
Yeah.

307
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,490
让他和加文试试 看他怎么样
Throw him in there with Gavin, see what he does.

308
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,790
我的手下不和新来的打
First spar doesn't go to one of my boys.

309
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,390
新来的和我打
It goes to me.

310
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,840
祝你好运
 Good luck, kid.

311
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,120
好了 我们开始吧
Alright, here we go.

312
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,010
达菲 悠着点
Take it easy on him, Duff.

313
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,930
加油 杰西 好了 别浪费机会
 Come on, Jesse, here we go, make this count.

314
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,280
顶住 跟上 跟上
 Keep it together. Let's go, let's go.

315
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,740
注意他的脚步 加油
Watch his feet, c'mon.

316
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,820
就这样 就这样 等待机会
That's it, that's it, wait for an opening.

317
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,060
没事 你行的 加油
That's alright, you got this, c'mon!

318
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,770
没事
 Shake it off.

319
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,690
加油 跟上他 行的行的
Come on, stay on him. Let's go, let's go.

320
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,910
好了 达菲 我想差不多了
Alright, Duffy, I think you made your point.

321
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,830
好了 我想你可以让他起来了
Alright, you can let him up I think.

322
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,990
他都喘不了气了
 He can't breathe.

323
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,550
哥们 让他起来吧 你在干什么?
Let him up, man. What are you doing?

324
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,130
这小子没事 让他过后来找我
Your boy's okay. Tell him to come see me later.

325
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,570
顺便说一句 你战术对了
You made the right choice, by the way.

326
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,680
他有个前交叉步 你看到了只是没抓到机会
You had a front cross. You saw it, but you didn't take it.

327
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
你让达菲骗了
You let Duffy smoke you.

328
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,060
你看到了?
You noticed?

329
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,770
我第一次也这样
I did the same thing, my first time.

330
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,940
你在这没问题
You're gonna do just fine here.

331
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,640
走吧
Come on.

332
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,040
我不是告诉你了吗?我很安全 我们没事
What'd I tell you? I'm safe, we're good to go.

333
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,720
你有什么消息了? 
 What have you got?

334
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
好的 稍安勿躁
All right. Bear with me.

335
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,400
雷曼除了收保护费还要其他的生意对吧?
Raman is in the business, among other things, of collecting debts, right?

336
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,190
有时他从别人那买来债权
And sometimes he buys a debt from someone else.

337
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,590
比如 你是个赌徒 你是赌徒丹
For example, you're a gambler. You're Gambler Dan.

338
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,880
你欠约翰二十五万 三十万 你没还上
And you owe John here, two-fifty, three hundred grand. You're not paying.

339
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,220
约翰是我的一老朋友
And Gentleman John here is an old friend of mine

340
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,530
很早就认识 你知道的 他不是十分暴力
from way back, you know, he's not a violent man.

341
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,460
他不能到处打断别人的手指
He can't go around breaking people's fingers,

342
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,840
实在是没那胆量
he doesn't have the stomach for it.

343
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,390
所以把债权转给雷曼 他也许花五万买下
So I bring Raman the debt, and he buys it for, say, I don't know, 50 grand.

344
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,870
他就是个收账公司
He's like a collection agent.

345
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,690
现在赌徒丹就是欠他钱了 
Now Gambler Dan owes him.

346
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,630
如果他不付钱 他的腿就废了
And if he doesn't pay, his legs get broken.

347
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,030
但是我们已经有身份了 约翰是个杀手
 But we've already established, John as a hit-man.

348
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,500
但是没人知道啊
But no one knows that.

349
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
他们只是看见他进俱乐部了
They only saw him in the club.

350
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,500
那他为什么进去呢?
So why was he in the club?

351
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,740
- 你当时把他介绍给加齐 - 没错
- You were introducing him to Gazi. - Right.

352
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,150
是因为加齐要买下的债权
Because of the debt Gazi was going to buy.

353
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,460
但是现在加齐死了
And now that Gazi's dead...

354
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,770
你就需要找雷曼谈谈
You're going to take it all the way up to Raman.

355
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,140
是的 这就是我一直在说的行动
Yes... This is the move I've been waiting to make.

356
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,950
雷曼去找赌徒丹
Raman goes after gambler Dan...

357
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,950
就在他要打断丹的手指时
And just as he's about to break some fingers...

358
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,820
我们的梦幻小组出现 全副武装 实施抓捕
In comes the dream team. Guns a'blazin. Ready to make some arrests.

359
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,250
放高利贷 敲诈勒索 袭击他人
Loan sharking, extortion, assault.

360
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,000
伙计们 你们怎么想?
Guys, what do you think?

361
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,170
不错啊
It's not terrible.

362
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,760
有什么意见?
Thoughts?

363
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,760
我们行动吧 看看效果
Let's do it. Let's take it for a spin.

364
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,300
谁啊?
Yes?

365
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,330
马库斯
Marcus.

366
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,040
这位是约翰・贝恩
This is John Bain.

367
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,350
很荣幸 请坐
Pleasure. Please sit.

368
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,900
马库斯告诉我你的小状况
Marcus, has told me about your predicament.

369
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,170
我爱我的妹妹
I love my sister.

370
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,670
只是她选男人的眼光实在是不怎么样
Only she has terrible taste in men.

371
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,600
他是个赌徒 他们一起两年了
He's a gambler, they were together for two years.

372
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,040
他从她那儿偷了三十万
He stole three hundred thousand from her.

373
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,570
当她发现的时候 他就对她拳脚相加
And when she found out, he became very violent.

374
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,580
他差一点要了她的命
He almost killed her.

375
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,750
你现在想把自己的钱要回来
And now you want your money back.

376
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,280
我想要他付出代价
I want him to pay.

377
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,420
我希望你能亲自处理这事 我听说你是最好的
I want your personal attention on this. I hear you're the best.

378
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,420
可以吗?
Can you do it?

379
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,490
也许
Possibly.

380
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,180
我需要时间让加文查一下他
I'll need time to have Gavin check him out.

381
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,660
你随意
Whatever you need.

382
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,700
他住在西艾尔姆大街十九号
He lives at 19 West Elm Street.

383
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,330
约翰有个特别的请求
John has a special request.

384
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,970
说
Go ahead.

385
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,740
当你做的时候我要在场
I want to be there when you do it.

386
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,140
你收钱的时候
When you collect.

387
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,740
当你收拾他的时候 我想看着他的眼睛
I want to look into his eyes, when you're making him pay.

388
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,230
嘿 约翰让我查一下杰克斯的档案
Hey. John asked me to check into Jakes' files.

389
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,800
真的?
 Really?

390
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,900
是的 而且我觉得我们可能有麻烦了
Yeah, and I think we might have a problem.

391
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,520
我把杰克斯过去八个月的
So I've been pulling all of Jakes' case work

392
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,070
案子都调了出来 各种问题
from the last eight months. And it's full of holes.

393
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,620
我一点都不吃惊 他的管理员消失了
I'm not surprised, the handler was AWOL...

394
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,390
是的 我不确定是管理员的问题
Yeah, I'm not so sure it's just the handler.

395
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,200
我是说 他有很多的书面东西 但是没有证据
I mean, he's got paper, just not a lot of evidence.

396
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,900
没有视频 没有音频
There's no video, there's no audio.

397
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,380
他手写的报告也十分简略
His hand-written notes are sketchy at best.

398
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,660
这里没有能在法庭上站得住脚的东西
There's nothing here that would stand up in court.

399
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,630
还有一个女人 艾比・兰德
And there's this woman, Abi Rand.

400
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,170
杰克斯拿她当线人
Jakes has been using her as a CI.

401
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,940
曾是海洛因成瘾者
Former heroin addict.

402
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,240
她的线索没有导致任何抓捕 
Her information hasn't led to a single arrest,

403
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,810
但是他还一直给她钱
 and yet he keeps paying her.

404
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,010
好几千块白花了
Thousands of dollars for nothing.

405
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,890
听着 这一切一定能解释的通的
Look, this all could have an explanation,

406
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,070
但是如果杰克斯对我们撒谎
but if Jakes is lying to us,

407
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,700
如果他已经失控了
 if he's out of control...

408
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,840
你是说他和自己的线人上床
So he's sleeping with his C.I.

409
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
可能是的
Probably, yeah.

410
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,330
我去把她带过来 和她谈谈
I'm going to bring her in, talk to her.

411
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,100
- 你看卷宗了吗? - 一团乱麻
- Have you looked at the case work? - It's a mess.

412
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,420
也许是管理员
It could be the handler.

413
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,140
你把这些推到管理员头上?
You're going to blame the handler on this one?

414
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,840
我了解杰克斯 他不会像这样搞砸一个案子的
I know Jakes, he would never jeopardize a case like this.

415
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,160
丽贝卡那是十五年前的事了
Rebecca, you knew him fifteen years ago.

416
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,650
如果你问我 我觉得你应该现在就取消行动
If you ask me, I think you should shut down this whole thing right now.

417
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,770
也许他卧底太久
Maybe he's been in too long...

418
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,340
丽贝卡
Rebecca?

419
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,080
约翰 他相信我
He believed in me, John.

420
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,080
他曾是第一个
He was the first.

421
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,550
他过去总说 
He use to say,

422
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,390
你去哪 我去哪
"I'd follow you anywhere."

423
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,260
不论有多危险
"I'd walk off a cliff for you."

424
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,300
这件事上有证据前我相信他是无罪的
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on this.

425
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,940
- 那个线人叫什么名字? - 艾比
- What's the C.I.'s name? - Abi.

426
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,260
好吧 等她来了 让玛利亚和她谈
Alright, when she comes in, Maria should talk to her,

427
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,530
你不行
not you.

428
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,140
我们得确定我们可以相信杰克斯
We need to know we can trust Jakes.

429
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,770
在那之前 案子由我自己负责 行吗
Until then, I'll look after things myself, all right?

430
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,740
我会在临时房子那帮杰西 
I'll cover Jesse at the set-up house.

431
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,980
丹尼尔那边演完了 我们就行动
Soon as Daniel checks out Raman, we move.

432
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,780
按照杰克斯的安排做 赌徒丹
Put Jakes' play in action, Gambler Dan.

433
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,700
你要进去 到里面看一下吗?
You want to head over, take a look inside?

434
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,280
暂时不用 我们老实坐在这
Not yet. We're gonna sit tight.

435
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,830
看看都什么人进出这里
See who comes and goes.

436
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,000
如果他不给钱怎么办?
So what happens if he won't pay?

437
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,930
收拾一下?
Rough him up a little?

438
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,870
我们就是做监视的 就这些
We're just doing research, that's all.

439
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,840
好了 他们就位了
Alright, they're in place.

440
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,700
我们等几分钟
Let's give it a few minutes.

441
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,870
我好了 等你指令了
I'm ready. Just say the word.

442
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,140
我这儿努力想搞清楚状况
I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out.

443
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,010
老板是雷曼
So, the boss is Raman.

444
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,490
和加齐 他被开枪击中 死了
And Gazi, he got shot, he's dead.

445
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,560
但是之后是达菲 他变成了下命令的 对吧?
But then, Duffy, he's the one who gives you the orders, right?

446
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,900
你问题问的有点多
You ask a lot of questions.

447
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,690
无所谓了 我们也不是非得聊天
Whatever, we don't have to talk.

448
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,220
好了 丹尼尔 随时开始
Okay, Daniel. Any time.

449
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,470
他来了
Here he is.

450
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,830
车不错啊
 Sweet car.

451
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,840
至少十万啊 没错吧
That's a hundred grand easy, right there.

452
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,480
是的 就是他 是我们要找的人 毫无疑问呢
Yeah, that's him, that's our guy. No question

453
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,010
- 开什么玩笑? - 怎么?
- Are you kidding me? - What?

454
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,450
稍等一下
Hang on a sec.

455
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,620
怎么了?
 What's wrong?

456
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,780
我不敢相信
I don't believe it.

457
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,670
- 就是他逮捕的我 - 什么?
- That guy arrested me. - What?

458
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,100
七八年前吧 这家伙是警察
Like seven, eight years ago. That guy's a cop!

459
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,770
什么?你确定?
What? You're sure?

460
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,720
哥们那是我第一次被抓 
My first bust, man.

461
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,460
我永远都忘不了那张脸
 I'll never forget his face.

462
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,230
丹尼尔 你被认出来了 
 Daniel, you just got made.

463
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,210
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding me.

464
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,710
你暴露了 待在房子里面 别让人看见
You're busted. Stay in the house, stay out of sight.

465
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,220
天啊 这机会有多大?
Man, what are the friggin' odds?

466
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,620
那么我们怎么办?
So what are we gonna do?

467
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,730
你觉得我们能怎么办? 我们得告诉老板
What do you think we're gonna do? We're going to tell the boss.

468
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,890
真他妈的
Son of a...

469
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,400
啊 不是吧
Ah, come on...

470
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,670
你在干吗呢?
What are you doing?

471
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,470
你打算告诉我我这是在哪吗?
You want to tell me where I am?

472
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,900
艾比 我是侦探警员科尔特兹
Abi, I'm Detective Constable Cortez.

473
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,110
我被捕了?
Am I under arrest?

474
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,770
你是马库斯・杰克斯的线人吗?
Are you a confidential informant for Marcus Jakes?

475
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,390
这是你的线人编号吗?
Is this your C.I. number?

476
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,060
这东西我应该记下来吗?
Was I supposed to memorize it?

477
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,360
那这个呢 是你的签名吗?
What about this, is that your signature?

478
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,390
嗯
Mm-Hmm.

479
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,830
马库斯在哪?
Where's Marcus?

480
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,030
有很多钱是付给你的
These are all payments made to you,

481
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,400
换取信息的 现在看来都是假消息
in exchange for information. False information by the looks of it.

482
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,040
但是他一直给你钱
 But he kept paying you.

483
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,170
艾比 你和他上床了吗?
 Are you sleeping with him, Abi?

484
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,540
他不是花钱买我
He's not paying me for sex.

485
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,190
马库斯・杰克斯是你男朋友? 
Is Marcus Jakes your boyfriend?

486
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,230
如果他是会怎样?
So what if he is?

487
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,770
我懂了 艾比 你可能以为
I get it, Abi. You probably thought

488
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,050
这事不会给你带来麻烦的
you'd never get in trouble for this.

489
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,980
我是说他可是个警察啊 对吧?
I mean he's a cop, right?

490
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,230
但 事实是 情报是假的
Here's the thing, though, it's bogus information.

491
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,490
法庭上是不承认的 你们俩都知道
It won't hold up in court. You both knew it.

492
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,120
是违法的
That's an offence.

493
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,710
我现在就应该拘捕你
I should arrest you, right now.

494
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,530
- 我想和马库斯谈一下 - 不可能
- I want to talk to Marcus. - That's not happening.

495
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,110
我不能进监狱 好吗?  
I can't go to jail, okay?

496
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,030
我不能 我不可以的
I can't. I can't do that.

497
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,500
我给你看点东西
I need to show you something.

498
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,850
知道这个人是谁吗?
Do you know who this man is?

499
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,340
艾比?
Abi?

500
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,540
能告诉我他的名字吗
Can you tell me his name.

501
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,280
是奇普
That's Chip.

502
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,290
- 我前男友 - 你知道谁干的吗?
- That's my ex. - Do you know who did this to him?

503
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,480
他跟踪我 老来烦我
He was stalking me, he wouldn't leave me alone.

504
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,550
艾比 他差点没命了
Abi. He almost died.

505
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,780
谁干的? 是谁?
 Who did this? Who was it?

506
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,630
是马库斯 马库斯干的
It was Marcus. Marcus did it.

507
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,210
奇普来我家 马库斯发疯了
 Chip came by my apartment and Marcus just lost it.

508
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,380
我以为他要杀了他
 I thought he was gonna kill him.

509
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,620
哥们 你怎么来了 来干吗?
What are you doing man, what are you doing here?

510
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,580
- 嘿 我能进来吗? - 是的 请进
- Hey, can I come in? - Yeah, come on in.

511
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,950
哦 等你一会儿
Uh... Give me a minute.

512
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,660
- 好的 - 好的
- Alright. - Yeah.

513
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,860
地方不错 
Nice digs.

514
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,140
是的 不会引人怀疑 是吧?
Yeah, it does the job, right?

515
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,550
这地方有监控吗?
This place wired?

516
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,650
卧室的坏了 但是你知道的
Bedroom's on the fritz, but you know...

517
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,120
是的
Yeah.

518
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,700
- 给你 - 谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

519
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,100
昨天熬得挺晚啊?
So you had a late night last night?

520
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,640
你来这干吗 怎么了?
What are we doing here, what's going on?

521
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,580
丽贝卡担心这个案子
Rebecca's worried about the case.

522
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,000
她想让你去趟总部
She wants you to come in.

523
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,220
还有什么新情况? 她爱操心 女人啊
What else is new? She loves to worry, that girl.

524
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,390
你来就是为了告诉我这个? 打个电话就行了
That what you came by, to tell me? Could've just called.

525
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,500
- 你电话打不通 - 语音留言啊
- Your phone's off. - I would've got the message.

526
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,070
丹尼那边怎么样?  
So how's Danny-boy?

527
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,820
我们设的局进行的如何?
How's our play shaking out?

528
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,710
丹尼尔
Daniel...

529
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,800
被认出来了
got made.

530
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,000
- 他 什么? - 是的

531
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,230
- 他做什么了? - 加文  那个打手
- What did he do? - The muscle guy, Gavin.

532
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,610
很久以前丹尼尔抓过他
Turns out Daniel arrested him back in the day.

533
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,170
- 你开玩笑吧 - 不是
- You're kidding me. - Nope.

534
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,610
运气不好 没办法
That's just bad luck, that's what that is.

535
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,290
这案子好像一直这样
Seems to happen a lot on this case.

536
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,070
问你点事
Let me ask you something.

537
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,610
如果我检查整个地方 
If I were to go through this whole place,

538
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,810
我会发现哪些非法的东西?
 what kind of contraband would I find?

539
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,930
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

540
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,610
杰克斯 我也做过卧底 
Jakes, I've been here.

541
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,690
这事我也干过
 I've done all this.

542
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,520
好吗 我知道诱惑
Okay? I know the temptations.

543
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,230
我想骗你 我得相当的厉害
I must be good if I'm fooling you.

544
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,770
哥们 你被外表骗了 都是道具
You're falling for the look, man. The props.

545
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,700
我很清白
I'm squeaky clean.

546
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,190
知道吗 约翰?
You know what, John?

547
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,850
我原以为在所有人中你是最了解我的
I would have thought you of all people would know what I'm doing here.

548
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,780
除了我是谁之外其他的都得忘记
I had to forget everything, but who I was.

549
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,910
就当这个人
Just to be this guy.

550
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,820
我每天看见有人被打 而我就站在那
I watch guys get beaten every day and I just gotta stand there.

551
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,590
你觉得我喜欢?
You think that's fun for me?

552
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,990
我在尽一个警察的职责 你帮还是不帮我?
I'm doing police work, are you going to help me or what?

553
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,020
我们和艾比谈过了 我们请她过去的
We talked to Abi. We brought her in.

554
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,530
她什么都说了
She told us the full extent.

555
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,110
她准备作证了
She's prepared to testify.

556
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,740
- 全说什么了?  - 你一直在收账
- The full extent of what? - You've been collecting debts.

557
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,510
那些人被打的时候你就在场
You've been there when guys have gotten beaten.

558
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,250
你不仅仅是在那看 而且你也参与其中了
And you haven't just been watching, you've been doing it yourself.

559
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,480
不不不 只是为了掩护 不是真的 她不明白
No no no, that's the cover, it's not real, she doesn't understand

560
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,890
- 伙计们 - 你一直在给你线人钱
- Guys... - You've funneling cash to your C.I.

561
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,950
你在挣钱但是却不上报
You've been making money and not reporting it.

562
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,180
不是真的 - 你了解我的 
That's not true. - You know me,

563
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,000
你知道我是什么样的人
you know what I'm like.

564
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,770
如果是真的 我会查出来的
If it's true, I'm gonna find out.

565
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,500
我跟这个案子已经八个月了
I've been working this case for eight months.

566
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,440
这是我的梦想啊 我怎么会毁了这个案子呢?
I dream of this, why would I put that in jeopardy?

567
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,190
你喜欢上这种生活 你喜欢现在的角色
You like the lifestyle you like playing the part.

568
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,240
你离不开了
You don't want to leave it.

569
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,070
丽贝卡 你就是这么想的?
Is that what you think, Rebecca?

570
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,870
这家伙就是这么告诉你的?
Is that what this guy's telling you?

571
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,200
我对天起誓 马库斯 我不知道该怎么想
I swear to God, Marcus, I don't know what to think.

572
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,810
好吧 这个约翰什么 我也听说过他的好多事
Okay, this guy John-boy, I've heard a lot of stories.

573
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,960
你不会认为他有时也违反点规定?
You don't think he bent the rules sometimes?

574
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,370
好吧 听着 这家伙是个施虐狂
Okay look, this guy was abusive.

575
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,760
他老是来骚扰她 我担心她 
He wouldn't leave her alone, I was worried for her.

576
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,100
案子没问题
The case is good.

577
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,490
这么说他们知道丹尼尔是个警察? 这也可行
So what they know Daniel's a cop? That's workable.

578
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,380
我们可以利用一下 他不是第一个欠债的警察
We could use that, he's not the first cop to owe a debt.

579
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,390
他们不会知道他是我们的人
They'll never guess that's our cover.

580
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,990
丽贝卡 看着我
Rebecca, look at me.

581
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,210
得了吧 你知道我的 你知道我不会这样做的
Come on, you know me, you know I wouldn't do this.

582
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,140
我了解曾经的你
I know who you were.

583
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,340
我需要
I need it.

584
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,610
我需要抓住这个雷曼 他是个人渣
I need this Raman guy, he is a scumbag.

585
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,350
他践踏人们的生活
And he ruins people's lives.

586
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,250
经历这一切之后 我需要一个好结果
I need something good to come out of all this.

587
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,830
别把我变成一个
Don't turn me into the guy...

588
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,540
一个没管好自己 搞砸了大案子的警察
The cop who goes off the rails, and blows the big case.

589
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,690
别这样对我
Don't do it to me.

590
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
能让我们谈一下吗?
Can you give us a minute?

591
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,800
好的 好的
Yeah, yeah.

592
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,130
这个雷曼 手段残忍 他靠打人为生
This guy Raman, he's vicious, he beats people up for a living.

593
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,570
他就在我眼前杀了一个人
He killed someone right in front of us.

594
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,400
丽贝卡 我们得抓他
We need to get him, Rebecca.

595
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,450
听着 杰克斯走在边缘 
Look, Jakes is on the edge,

596
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,340
他必须如此 这样才能接近雷曼
he has to be, it's what got him close to Raman.

597
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,880
我觉得杰克斯能行
I think Jakes can do it.

598
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,480
是吗? 经过这一切之后?
Really? After all this?

599
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,120
你要拿命来赌吗?
You're going to put your life in his hands?

600
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,860
你和我都清楚 现在站在门外的可能是我
You know as well as I do, that could be me outside that door right now..

601
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
你相信这个人 
You believed in this guy.

602
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,060
我们给他个机会将功补过
Let's give him a chance to redeem himself.

603
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,310
我们扳倒雷曼
Let's take Raman down.

604
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,590
好消息是 加文不记得你的名字 只是你的脸
So the good news is, Gavin doesn't remember your name, just your face.

605
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,220
跟丹尼尔・温拿考特打个招呼
Say hello to Daniel Winacott.

606
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,920
你是反黑组的 就和真的丹尼尔一样
You're part of Guns and Gangs, just like the real Daniel.

607
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,270
两年前 你状况不断 违反纪律 表现不佳
And after a couple years, you blew it. Infractions, bad performance reports,

608
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,410
在赌桌上被抓 之后被降职做文员
caught in a few gambling dens and then down-graded to a desk job.

609
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,430
- 这么说我就是文职警员 - 脾气很大
- So, I'm a file-clerk. - With a temper.

610
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,970
还有赌博的嗜好 凡有重要比赛一定下注
 And a gambling problem, you just can't resist a big fight.

611
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,430
听着 你觉得这能行?
Listen, you think this is going to work?

612
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,410
雷曼一直和警察打交道 
Raman deals with cops all the time,

613
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,480
也许其中还有他最重要的客户
probably some of his best clients.

614
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,270
好了  今晚是雷曼俱乐部的拳击之夜
OK, It's fight night at Raman's club.

615
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,260
丹尼尔 你今晚去下注 
Daniel, you're there to bet on the fight,

616
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,060
玛利亚你是她的新女友
 and Maria, you're his new girlfriend.

617
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,450
杰克斯和约翰 你们联系雷曼
Jakes and John, you're gonna make contact with Raman,

618
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,110
把赌徒丹送给他
and deliver Gambler Dan right to him.

619
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,270
雷曼要做的就是试图收账
All Raman has to do is try and collect

620
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,050
我们就抓到他了 当场逮捕
and we got him, we'll take him down.

621
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,740
嘿 注意了 我要你看这
Yo, focus man, I need you here.

622
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,200
那小子表现怎么样? 
How's our boy doing?

623
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,050
说实话 有点不靠谱
To be honest, a bit shaky.

624
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,320
但是他一定要拿下雷曼 他会撑下去的
But he's obsessed with Raman. He'll get through it.

625
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,300
- 是丽贝卡吗? 她担心我? - 她没事
- That Rebecca? She worried about me? - She's fine.

626
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,250
你这水平不行啊  得了吧 说吧
Is that the best you can do?  Come on, tell me.

627
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,840
杰克斯 我们身上有监听 
Jakes, we're wired.

628
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,100
我才不管什么监听呢
I don't care about the wire.

629
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,170
跟我直说 约翰 这是我最后一天吗?
Give it to me straight, brother John. Is this my last day on the job?

630
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,040
这是我们搞定这个案子的最后一次机会
This is our last chance at this case.

631
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,130
我的意思是作为警察
I mean as a cop.

632
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,840
她要拿走我的警徽 是吗?
She's gonna take my badge, isn't she?

633
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,780
这由你来决定 听着 我们明天再谈
That's up to you. Look, we'll talk about that tomorrow.

634
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,550
今晚 我们把注意力放到抓坏人上 好吗?
Tonight, let's just focus on getting the bad guys, all right?

635
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,450
丽贝卡如果不是相信你 今晚是不会让你来的
Rebecca wouldn't put you in play if she didn't think you could do this.

636
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,520
你并不像我那么了解贝卡
You don't know Becks like I do.

637
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,250
一旦失去她的信任 就完了 是吧 丽贝卡?
Once you lose her trust, it's over. Right, Rebecca?

638
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,920
那么我们就重新赢得她的信任 
Well you're going to have to earn it back.

639
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,810
杰克斯 你是个好警察
Jakes, you are good at this job.

640
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,520
你需要的就是不断提醒她 对吧?
You just got to remind her that, alright?

641
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,370
好吗? 好吗?
Okay? Okay?

642
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,030
好的 好的 好的
Yeah, yeah, okay.

643
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,060
注意了 目标出现
Heads up. Here comes the target.

644
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,650
想象一下我当时多么惊讶 当我发现
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the man

645
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,550
你让我收账的那个人居然是个警察
you asked me to collect from is a cop.

646
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,000
他是 我本应告诉你的 但不想被拒绝
He is, I should have mentioned that to you. I didn't want you to say no.

647
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,800
马库斯 这事你知道吗? 你知道吗?
Did you know about this, Marcus? Did you know?

648
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,410
是我的错 我根本没告诉他
It's my fault I didn't even tell him.

649
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,140
听着 这个警察就是渣滓 他没有朋友
Look, this cop a screw-up. He has no friends.

650
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,070
没人会帮他报仇的 这点我保证
There will be no payback. You have my guarantee.

651
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,580
他现在就在吧台那边
He's over there at the bar right now.

652
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,010
带着他的新女友
He's with his new girlfriend.

653
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,520
你把他带到这了
You brought him here.

654
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,600
我带他来看拳赛向他示好
I brought him to the fight as a peace offering.

655
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,900
相信我 他完全不知道你要向他收账
Trust me, he has absolutely no idea you're about to collect on his debt.

656
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,470
听着 朋友 你今晚要赚大钱
Look, you're going to make a lot of money tonight, my friend.

657
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,510
到时候你再谢谢我吧
And you're going to have me to thank for that.

658
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,730
我们现在就开始吧 我叫他过来
Let's do it right now, I'll call him over.

659
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,030
不 让他在那待一会儿 没事的
No, leave him there for a minute, he's fine.

660
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,800
他玩的挺好的 我的问题是
He's enjoying himself. My problem is this.

661
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,290
我不喜欢警察
I don't like police.

662
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,770
而且和你实话实说
And to be perfectly honest,

663
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,710
我开始对你有点不放心了 杰克斯
I'm starting to have an uneasy feeling about you, Jakes.

664
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,200
你在说什么? 
What are you talking about?

665
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,530
而我一直跟着感觉走的
And I always listen to that feeling.

666
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,250
他在做什么?
What's he doing?

667
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,420
打住 你为什么不做这一票呢?
Stop, why are you killing this?

668
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,960
不可能了 杰克斯 对不起
This is not happening. I'm sorry, Jakes.

669
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,120
今晚不行 好好看比赛吧
Not tonight. Enjoy the fight.

670
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,830
你还有你朋友
You and your friend.

671
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,920
就这样了? 他可以就这么走了  
That's it? He can't just walk away.

672
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,530
他可以而且就这么走了
He can and he just did.

673
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,100
丽贝卡 我想我们只能这样了
Rebecca, I think we're done here.

674
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,230
你想再给他点时间 再回来?
You want to give him some time, circle back?

675
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,640
不 没用了 完了 没机会了
No, there's no point. It's over. He just closed the door.

676
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,240
不是吧 开设么玩笑? 你们就这么放弃了?
Come on, are you kidding me? You're just giving up?

677
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,410
淡定 杰克斯 我们没戏了
Calm down Jakes, we're done.

678
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,900
那又怎样? 我们就这样放弃?
So what? We're just shutting down?

679
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,350
我们收拾一下吧
Let's pack it up.

680
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,410
伙计们 开始了
 Here we go, boys.

681
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,140
不能打头 打眼睛 腹股沟
 No head butts, eye gouging, groin attacks,

682
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,610
或者用脚踢头部来压制对手
or head kicking to a grounded opponent.

683
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,920
- 好吧 我们开始吧 - 下一次 好吗?
- Alright, so that's it I guess. - Next time, right?

684
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,150
我们回去见
I'll see you back at the shop.

685
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,150
好的 但是我今晚在这看比赛
Okay, but I'm staying for the fight.

686
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,810
要干吗啊 想看拳赛?
What do you wanna do, wanna watch the fight?

687
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,510
这事没完
It's not over.

688
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,110
杰克斯
Jakes!

689
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,980
你以为你就可以这么大摇大摆走了?
You think you can just walk away?

690
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,540
你以为我们就这么完了?
 You think we're done?

691
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,920
回来
Come here!

692
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,240
你去哪?
Where do you go?

693
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,270
杰克斯
Jakes.

694
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,110
你要干吗?
What are you doing?

695
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,810
他没带枪
He's unarmed.

696
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
他必须告诉我们一切
He's going to tell us everything.

697
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,380
每一起罪行 每一个细节
Every crime, every detail.

698
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,710
要不然我就一枪崩了他
Or I'm going to put a bullet in him.

699
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,350
嘿 约翰哪去了? 你看见他了吗?
 Hey, where's John? Have you seen him?

700
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,010
没有 也没看见杰克斯
No, and no Jakes.

701
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,800
- 你觉得这样会好用? - 他会说的
- You think this is gonna work? - He's gonna confess.

702
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,190
他会说的 我么们打到他说为止
He's gonna say we beat it out of him.

703
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,570
然后我们不承认就行了
And then we're gonna deny it.

704
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,040
你说我们是什么意思?
What do you mean "we"?

705
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,870
我是说你和我 你会支持我的
I, mean you and me. You're gonna get my back.

706
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,780
- 你想让我替你说谎? -  是的
- You want me to lie for you? - Yes.

707
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,270
约翰 八个月 我追踪这个家伙已经八个月了
Eight months, John, I've been after this guy for eight months.

708
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,920
我不能就这么放他走 
I'm not just gonna let him go.

709
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,910
如果你干不了 你就给我走
 If you're not up for it, you leave.

710
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,530
醒醒 
Wake up!

711
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,900
醒醒
Wake up!

712
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,870
好了 杰克斯
Alright, Jakes.

713
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,250
别这样 别这么做
Come on, don't do this.

714
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,850
这次我会支持你的 好吗?
I'm gonna back you up on this one, okay?

715
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,260
我们说是他来追杀你的 是自卫
We'll say he came after you, it was self-defense.

716
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,660
你不会被起诉的
You will not be charged.

717
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,130
但是这之后 杰克斯 你不要再做下去了
But after that, Jakes, you've got to walk away from this one.

718
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,930
现在 你需要马上离开
Right now, you need to walk away.

719
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,190
醒醒
Wake up!

720
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,820
玛利亚 怎么了?
Maria, what's going on in there?

721
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,570
杰克斯和约翰哪去了? 
Jakes and John, where are they?

722
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,330
我们留他们在那看拳赛了
We left them watching the fight.

723
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,800
- 那雷曼呢? - 他也不在
- What about Raman? - He's not here either.

724
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
找到他们
 Find them.

725
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,680
我们分开行动
We gotta split up.

726
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,070
我也经历过这种情况好吗?
I've been where you are. All right?

727
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,320
多谢这份工作 我离婚了
Thanks to this job... I've racked up a divorce,

728
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,550
住在一个阴冷的公寓里 我都懒得打开行李
I got a bleak apartment I can barely unpack,

729
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,970
我晚上躺在床上睡不着 
I lie awake in my bed at night

730
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,360
一肚子怨气 一肚子怒火
full of anger, full of this constant rage.

731
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,960
不错啊
Good for you.

732
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,360
哦 他醒了
Awww, there he is!

733
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,590
等一下 杰克斯 我懂 好吗?
Wait, Jakes, I get it, all right?

734
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,900
哦 不 你不懂
Oh no, you don't get it.

735
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,480
这家伙虐打好人 以此为乐
This guy tortures people, and takes pleasure from doing it!

736
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,240
他会交代的 对着电话 否则我就崩了他
And he's gonna say it, into the phone or I'm gonna put a bullet in his brain.

737
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,280
说啊 说啊 告诉我你怎么虐打别人的
Talk, tell it! Tell me how you torture people!

738
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,820
你说的对 这家伙是个人渣
You're right. This guy is scum.

739
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,240
- 说啊 - 他是个畜生 他活该
- Talk! - He's an animal, he deserves it.

740
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,320
好吧 你可以现在就杀了他 
Okay, you could kill him right now,

741
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,820
没人会为他难过的
no one would shed a tear.

742
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,720
我得告诉你
Let me tell you something...

743
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,490
如果你这么做了 你杀了他
if you do that, if you shoot him,

744
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,260
你也会迷失的 朋友
you will be lost, my friend.

745
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,600
你就完了
You are done.

746
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,630
你永远不会恢复过来 永远
You will never come back from that, ever again.

747
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,840
你懂我的意思吗?
You understand me?

748
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,440
杰克斯
Jakes,

749
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,440
现在你就在边缘上徘徊
right now you are standing on the edge.

750
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,650
你需要退一步
You need to step back now.

751
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,510
就一步
Just one step back.

752
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,950
好吗 我就在这
Come on, I'm right here.

753
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,260
我不逼你
I'm not forcing you.

754
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,220
好吗
Come on.

755
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,290
你必须退一步
You gotta step back.

756
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,170
- 你会起诉他吗? - 我会尽力的
- You're gonna charge him? - I'm gonna try.

757
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,640
- 杰克斯 - 你得逮捕我
- Jakes. - You need to arrest me.

758
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,860
- 你得把我抓起来 - 对不起
- You need to take me in. - I'm sorry.

759
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,150
我们走吧
Let's go.

760
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,060
听起来很奇怪
This is gonna sound strange.

761
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,270
我很高兴是你
I'm glad it was you.

762
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,330
丹尼尔
Daniel.

763
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,530
想过来帮我打开行李吗?
Want to come and help me unpack?

764
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,280
这有两瓶啤酒
There's a couple beer in it for you.

765
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,290
挺有吸引力的 但是我今晚有事
 Tempting, but I got a thing tonight.

766
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,450
伙计 那就是你的损失了
Well, that's your loss, pal.

767
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,870
好吧 给我留瓶冰的
Tell you what, save me a cold one.

768
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,740
地方不错啊
Nice place.

769
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,550
但是 要开始锁门了
You need to start locking your door, though.

770
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,110
什么都没打开
Everything's unpacked.

771
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,880
你们为我这么做的?
You did this all for me?

772
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,850
有些人需要承担责任
Someone needed to take responsibility.

773
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,240
我会给你们准备钥匙的 好吗?
I'm gonna get you all keys, alright?

774
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,970
伙计们
Guys...

775
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,570
嘿
Hey...

776
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,040
嘿
Hey.

777
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,880
好吧 猛男 如果我这么做你做什么
Okay, tough guy. What would you do if I did this...

778
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,180
不错啊
Not bad.

779
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,610
像丛林猫一样
It's the reflexes of a jungle cat.

780
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,110
是吗?
Is that right?

781
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,880
- 是的 - 是吗
- Yeah... - Yeah?

782
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,590

嗨
Hi.

784
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,360
我还记得他刚穿上警服是瘦弱的样子
I can still see that skinny kid in his uniform.

785
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,200
总觉得不合适
Never really fit him.

786
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,570
我们都不合适
Didn't fit any of us.

787
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,210
他想要的就是抓住坏蛋
All he wanted was to catch the bad guy.

788
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,340
我本应该看出来的
I should've seen it.

789
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,410
你看出来了 是我逼的
You did. I pushed.

790
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:47,180
是我让你的
I let you.

791
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,850
你担心这样的事会发生在你身上吗?
You ever worry it'll happen to you?

792
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,860
每一天
Every day.
