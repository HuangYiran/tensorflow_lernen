00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a tale about an unprejudiced heart...

3
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and how it changed our valley forever.

4
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a time not so long ago...

5
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when pigs were afforded no respect except by other pigs.

6
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world.

7
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In those days, pigs believed

8
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the sooner they grew large and fat,

9
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the sooner they'd be taken into pig paradise.

10
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haa! Haa! Get up!

11
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A place so wonderful...

12
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that no pig had ever thought to come back.

13
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo. Yeah!

14
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good-bye, Mom.

15
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when the day came for their parents

16
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to go to that other world of endless pleasures,

17
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it was not a time for young pigs to be sad.

18
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just another step towards the day when they, too,

19
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would make the journey.

20
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,290


21
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}perhaps it was because he was alone.

22
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps his sadness made him easier to catch.

23
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever the reason, of the thousands of animals

24
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the piggery that day... only one was chosen.

25
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's this one, Harry?

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just right for the purpose. How much do I owe you?

27
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a runt Harry. A worthless, little runt.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.

29
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nine out of 10 first prizes forjams and jellies... .

30
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is more than a matter of luck

31
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luck still plays its part.

32
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our berries were wickedly good this year.

33
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And our water is very tasty too.

34
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, we don't use the town water.

35
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur Hoggett! How's it going, Arthur?

36
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are those sheep of yours?

37
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, try your luck.

38
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about taking a guess, Arthur?

39
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All for a good cause.

40
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't keep pigs.

41
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!

42
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do, Pig.

43
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pig and the farmer regarded each other.

44
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And fora fleeting moment, something passed between them.

45
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A faint sense of some common destiny.

46
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hah. Strange.

47
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First time the little thing hasn't screamed its head off.

48
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you'll have to have a guess.

49
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sixteen pounds, five...

50
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eew.

51
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two ounces.

52
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooey! Hoggett!

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Arthur.

54
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be weighing the little pig tomorrow.

55
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll phone you if you win.

56
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you win, Arthur. When you win!

57
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Care to guess the pig's weight, Sir?

58
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Support the Lion's Club.

59
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,620


60
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What could we do with a pig, eh, Duchess?

61
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just think. Two nice hams. Two sides of bacon.

62
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and pork chops, kidney, liver,

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}chitlins, pickle his feet.

64
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Save his blood for bLack puddin.

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's the telephone. Hoggett!

66
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoggett! Good news, Arthur. You've won the pig.

67
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

68
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pigs Are Definitely Stupid.

69
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, Mom?

70
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a pig.

71
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll eat him when he's big.

72
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will they eat us?

73
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good heavens, no!

74
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bosses only eat stupid animals...

75
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like sheep and ducks and chickens.

76
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yea!

77
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It does look stupid, Mom.

78
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not as stupidas sheep, mind you.

79
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But pigs are definitely stupid.

80
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. No, we're not.

81
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good heavens! Who are you?

82
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a Large White.

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, that's your breed, dear.

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

85
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

86
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did your mother call you to tell you apart

87
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from your brothers and sisters?

88
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our mom called us all the same.

89
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what was that, dear?

90
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She called us all Babe.

91
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps we shouldn't talk too much about,

92
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}uh, family.

93
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want my mom.

94
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there.

95
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to be a brave boy now.

96
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I left my mother when I was your age,

97
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and my pups will have to leave me soon.

98
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'll keep an eye on you, if you like,

99
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just 'til you find your feet.

100
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The little pig's a bit low.

101
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going to sleep with us...

102
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just 'til he finds his feet.

103
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until he finds his feet.

104
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Mom, he'll wet the bed!

105
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,670

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the pig promised himself that

209
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a duck needs a willing accomplice.

210
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A creature who is reliable, beyond suspicion,

211
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and above all... extremely gullible.

212
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey! Psst!  - Wha... what?

213
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look like an intelligent, sophisticated,

214
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- discerning young fella?  - Who, me?

215
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Follow me.

216
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy! Are you in for some fun!

217
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we doin'?  Where are we goin'?

218
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now the duck knew exactly what he had to do.

219
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The alarm clock had to go.

220
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His very life depended on it.

221
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see it?

222
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes

223
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

224
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I go through the kitchen, across the living room...

225
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good, good.  - into the bedroom.

226
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the mechanical rooster

227
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and bring it out to you.

228
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about that cat?

229
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But quietly bring it out to you.

230
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent.

231
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I can do it.

232
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's against the rules.

233
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only dogs and cats allowed in the house.

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a good rule, but this is bigger than rules.

235
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is life and death.

236
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is?

237
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm-hmm. Follow me.

238
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

239
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, there's something you should know.

240
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Humans eat ducks!

241
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg your pardon?

242
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most ducks prefer to forget it,

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks

244
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so. Not the boss. Not the boss's wife.

245
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Humans don't eat cats. Why?

246
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, they're...  - They're indispensable.

247
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They catch mice. Humans don't eat roosters. Why?

248
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They make eggs with the hens and wake everyone up in the morning.

249
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried it with the hens.

250
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't work. So I turned to crowing,

251
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Lo! I discover my gift.

252
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no sooner do I become indispensable then

253
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they bring in a machine to do the job!

254
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, the treachery of it!  A mechanical rooster!

255
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear me.

256
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear you?

257
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose the life of an anorexic duck...

258
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't amount to much in the broad scheme of things.

259
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, pig, I'm all I've got.

260
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you need me to do it?

261
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm allergic to cats.  - Oh.

262
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They make me sneeze.

263
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahh.

264
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.

265
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My life is in your hands.

266
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

267
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

268
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, boy.

269
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no!

270
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your foot, your foot! Take the string off your foot.

271
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait. Let me put it this way.

272
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop. Turn around...

273
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh.

274
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! The otherway! Turn...

275
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, stop! Oh! Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

276
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't, don't, stupid. Go outside... now.

277
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you said you can't do without me.

278
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can. Trust me, I can.

279
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

280
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes!  - You're positive?

281
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go outside andstand guard.

282
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Good idea.

283
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy. Want something done, you gotta do it yourself.

284
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hmm. - Guard against what?

285
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahh! Ahh! Don't worry

286
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick with me and please,

287
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg you, not one more word.

288
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all right.

289
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't sneeze, Ferdie.

290
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just hold your breath.

291
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my mistake.

292
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was trying to loosen things up a little.

293
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, no. Today proves that it doesn't work.

294
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on, we'll all respect the rules.

295
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To each creature its own destiny.

296
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every animal in its proper place.

297
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a pig's proper place is under the old cart,

298
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not in the barn.

299
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And absolutely never in the house.

300
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that understood?

301
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

302
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Pig, regarding the company you keep.

303
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being young, it's hard to discriminate,

304
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'll make it easy for you.

305
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I forbid you to talk to or consort with...

306
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that duck... ever.

307
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have I made myself clear?

308
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... what's " consort" ?

309
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means, young man, that you must not go

310
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}anywhere near that duck.

311
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As for the fugitive duck,

312
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he shows himself, let him know this

313
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being a duck he must behave like a duck.

314
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more of this crowing and nonsense.

315
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He should accept what he is and be thankful for it.

316
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That goes for all of us.  - Here, here!

317
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex continued long into the night.

318
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elsewhere, there was more talk.

319
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The subject was christmas dinner...

320
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and whether that year the main course would be roast pork.

321
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or duck a l'orange.

322
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And pork is a nice, sweet meat.

323
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

324
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the pig! Get the pig! Get the pig!

325
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,960


326
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- psst! -  Ferdinand! Everyone's been looking for you.

327
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

328
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happenin' out there?

329
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex isn't very happy. Boy, all these new rules!

330
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not allowed to... oops.

331
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not allowed to what?

332
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

333
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pig pig pig piggy!

334
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't see me, all right?

335
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I didn't see you. all right? Oops.

336
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680


337
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,910


338
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The time comes forall creatures... when childhood ends...

339
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the doorway opens to life as an adult.

340
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,060


341
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it was with Fly's pups.

342
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though that time was all too soon for Fly.

343
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puppy, puppy, puppy. Come on.

344
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly?

345
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I call you Mom?

346
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it was that the pig...

347
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}found his place in the world of the farm.

348
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he was happy, even in his dreams.

349
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,210


350
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello!  - Folks, how are you?. Merry Christmas!

351
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's my favorite girl?

352
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nanny's got a jelly bean.

353
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess what we're having for Christmas dinner?

354
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roast pork.

355
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate pork.

356
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darn silly carry-on, if you ask me.

357
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cats says they call it Christmas.

358
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas! Christmas dinner, yeah.

359
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner means death. Death means carnage!

360
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christmas means carnage!

361
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eatin' pigs! Blaah! Barbarians!

362
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're goin' back to the fields, Maa.

363
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, young'un, tragic there ain't more of your kind.

364
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be thinkin' of ya always.

365
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could come visit you. Maa

366
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like that, but...

367
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we shouldn't hope for too much. Ooh!

368
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, it was christmas Eve.

369
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And time had run out for the pig.

370
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you doing him tonight then?.

371
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mmm.  - Good. The blood'll drain by morning.

372
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pity

373
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

374
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothin'.

375
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What on earth are you babbling on about?.

376
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shame to miss out on the best ham prize at next year's fair, is all

377
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice plump haunches he's gettin'. Beautiful.

378
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still... silly to wait, I suppose.

379
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is!

380
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bird. Yuck. Chicken?

381
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's duck a l'orange.

382
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Mother, it looks absolutely superb.

383
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not going to eat any of it!  - This is fabulous.

384
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ferdinand!

385
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're out here, who's that in there?

386
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her name's Rosanna.

387
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why Rosanna? She had such a beautiful nature.

388
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Ferdinand.

389
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take it anymore.

390
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really!

391
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fear's too much for a duck.

392
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It eats away at the soul.

393
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must be kinder dispositions

394
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in far-off gentler lands.

395
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way you'll find happiness is to accept...

396
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the way things are is the way things are.

397
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way things are stinks!

398
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.

399
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish all of you the best of luck.

400
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where will you go?

401
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No idea. But I'm a clever duck.

402
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could do with an adventure.

403
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll miss you, Ferdie.

404
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ferdie? No one's ever called me that before.

405
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, good luck, Pig. Huh?. I am outta here.

406
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, bye.

407
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow! Would you do me a favor, Pig?

408
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything.

409
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the gate, huh?

410
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pig knew it was against

411
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the rules to leave the farm.

412
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But something was definitely wrong.

413
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How lovely, darling. What is it?.

414
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a fax machine.

415
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can send us letters by phone.

416
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At any other time,the pig would've been tickled pink...

417
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by his first visit to the sheep fields

418
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now there was fear in the air.

419
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa and her kind were under threat.

420
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Frank, feel like pork for dinner tonight?

421
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young'un, you're alive!

422
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?. Who are these men?

423
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!

424
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's our boss?. It doesn't seem right

425
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong, dear?. It's the wrong one!

426
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want the house I saw on the television!

427
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, there, there.

428
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get! Quick! Get the dog in.

429
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of the sheep! come on!

430
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go!

431
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good dog.

432
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good pig.

433
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Dad says his little porker's a watch pig.

434
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dearie me! If it's not a duck

435
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that thinks it's a rooster,

436
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's a pig that thinks it's a dog!

437
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pig that thinks it's a dog!

438
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:05,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# BLue Moon You saw me standing alone #

439
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pig that thinks it's a dog!

440
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A washing machine, a radio, a new alarm clock.

441
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's a lovely fax machine, darling,

442
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but can't you use it?

443
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We already have one, Mom. That's the whole idea.

444
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can send faxes to each other.

445
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be afraid of it just because it's new.

446
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These accounts are a real worry, Arthur.

447
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every month your expenditure is greater than your income.

448
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's eating up your reserves.

449
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to modernize, get some sort of cash rlow going.

450
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're still using a horse and cart,for God's sakes.

451
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

452
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny, that.

453
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

454
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those chickens, that pig.

455
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the pig got to do with anything?

456
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

457
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just look at them. The browns and the whites.

458
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Rex. Come, Fly

459
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Pig.

460
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Pig!

461
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps he's pleased with you

462
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- for what you did yesterday.  - I didn't do much

463
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well if it wasn't for you, dear,

464
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they could've stolen the whole rlock.

465
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Rex unhappy with me?

466
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he'll be all right.

467
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just stay out of his way today.

468
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to be, Fly. Rex, come by.

469
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do.

470
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so quick.

471
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd never be able to rly like you can.

472
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pigs aren't built to rly, dear.

473
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But speed isn't the thing. It's attitude.

474
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just have to know who's boss.

475
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out you go.

476
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm!

477
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get 'em up, Pig.

478
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants you to drive them out of the yard.

479
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Away to me, Pig.

480
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, you have to dominate them.

481
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do that and they'll do any thing you want. Go.

482
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woof! Woof, woof, woof!

483
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woof, woof, woof!

484
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is ridiculous, Mom.

485
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nonsense. It's only your first try.

486
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're treating them like equals.

487
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're sheep. They're inferior.

488
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, no they're not.

489
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course they are!

490
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are their masters.

491
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let them doubt it for a second and they'll walk all over you.

492
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly, get that pig out of there.

493
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make them feel inferior. Abuse them. Insult them.

494
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they'll laugh at me.

495
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then bite them. Be ruthless.

496
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever it takes. Bend them to your will.

497
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Enough! - Go on! Go!

498
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}move along there, you... You, uh, big butt heads!

499
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young'un, stop this nonsense. What's got into you?

500
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just finished tellin' what a nice young pig you be.

501
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa, I was just trying to be a sheep dog.

502
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hah! Enough wolves in the world already...

503
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without a nice lad like you turnin' nasty.

504
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't got it in ya, young'un.

505
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and I are descended from the great sheepdogs.

506
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We carry the bloodline of the Ancient Bahou.

507
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We stand for something.

508
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And today I watched in shame as all that was betrayed.

509
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex, he's just a little pig.

510
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all the greater the insult.

511
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I bit you. Are you all right?.

512
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't call that a bite, myself.

513
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got teeth in that rloppy mouth or just gums?

514
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, ladies, a heart of gold.

515
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahh. Heart of gold.

516
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No need for all this wolf nonsense, young'un.

517
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all a nice pig like you need do is ask.

518
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks very much. It was very kind of you.

519
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pleasure. What a nice little pig!

520
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all right, how did you do it?

521
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked them, and they did it. I asked them nicely.

522
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't ask sheep, dear. We tell them what to do.

523
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did, Mom. They were really friendly.

524
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Rex might be a little more friendly if l had a talk with him.

525
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. You better leave that to me.

526
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex?

527
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knowit was hard for you today...

528
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}watching all that happening.

529
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But surely it's not worth all this misery.

530
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, dear, not on such a beautiful night.

531
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You put these ideas into his head!

532
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two-faced traitorous wret...

533
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down! Down, Rex. Fly!

534
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dark cloud had descended on the valley.

535
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the pig felt that the troubles were all his fault.

536
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he was certain

537
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that he knew how to put things right again.

538
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, uh, e... excuse me, Sir.

539
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I... I... I think all this trouble...

540
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not distemper. can't be rabies.

541
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be the hormones.

542
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous of the wee pig?

543
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see that myself.

544
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. So what should we do?

545
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can keep him locked up or... snip, snip.

546
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can do it Tuesday.

547
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

548
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or Wednesday.

549
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoggett doesn't want the dog operated on.

550
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a breeding dog.

551
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can sedate him, of course, but

552
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll be useless as a working dog.

553
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you pills to put in his food.

554
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good dog.

555
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Sheep Pig.

556
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?

557
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With Rex out of action and Fly injured from the fight,

558
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farmer Hoggett had no choice.

559
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa! Maa! The boss has to give you some medicine.

560
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear, I thought so! It's horrible stuff, that.

561
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, but it's for the best.

562
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Young'un, if you say so.

563
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the thought first came to him,

564
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farmer Hoggett dismissed it as mere whimsy.

565
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, like most of his harebrained ideas,

566
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it wouldn't go away.

567
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they doing?

568
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a sheepdog trial.

569
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it's like a competition for sheepdogs?

570
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And their bosses. It's like an obstacle course.

571
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do they decide who wins?

572
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time and mistakes.

573
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get points for how quick you are.

574
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they take points off for every mistake.

575
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everytime a sheep goes the wrong way,

576
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's a mistake and you lose points.

577
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like fun!

578
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.

579
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex and I used to...

580
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind.

581
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was Rex a champion?

582
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had the makings of the greatest champion there ever was,

583
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it wasn't to be.

584
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

585
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A while back when Rex was in his prime,

586
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the winterrains brought a great flood to the valley.

587
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex and the boss got most of the flock

588
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}onto the high ground.

589
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then Rex went back to look for the strays.

590
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He found them.

591
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'd been stranded by the rising water.

592
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to herd them across to safety,

593
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they wouldn 't budge.

594
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too afraid and too stupid to save their own skins.

595
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was freezing cold and the water kept rising.

596
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex stayed with them right through the night.

597
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By morning, the sheep were drowned.

598
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.

599
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, mom!

600
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two weeks rest in front of the fire

601
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}saw him back on his feet.

602
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But his hearing was never the same again.

603
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd never want anyone to know, but

604
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's almost totally deaf.

605
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:21,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that why he's so, you know, angry?

606
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:22,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not the half of it.

607
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all this was barely a month before

608
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Grand National Challenge.

609
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He triedhis best, but he couldn't hear the boss's calls,

610
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it slowed him up.

611
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cold truth is that, but for the stupidity of sheep,

612
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rex would've been the champion of champions.

613
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good dog.

614
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, through here like this.

615
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, big hook to the left. Big hook. Big hook.

616
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through this gate here.

617
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was at that time that

618
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs.Hoggett began to worry about her husband.

619
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Farmer Hoggett knew that little ideas...

620
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that tickled and nagged and refused to go away...

621
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should never be ignored...

622
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for in them lie the seeds of destiny.

623
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the gate like that, and you're done.

624
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Tragic Day.

625
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:14,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom. Mom! Can we start work early today?.

626
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear, it's not even dawn yet.

627
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can go to work when the rooster crows.

628
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, go back to sleep.

629
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahem. Um, excuse me. Hello, Sir.

630
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, but it's nearly dawn, and...

631
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry to disturb you.

632
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind

633
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}crowing just a few minutes early this morning.

634
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

635
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get lost  - o ok..

636
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

637
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now the pig understood why the sheep

638
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}called all dogs wolves.

639
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he was filled with a deep and terrible rage.

640
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa! Maa! Are you all right?

641
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, young'un.

642
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Maa, can you get up?

643
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't reckon.

644
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's over, Maa. The wolves have gone far away.

645
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get the boss up here to look after you.

646
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be all right. You'll be all right!

647
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Maa! Maa!

648
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa! Maa!

649
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:54,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa!

650
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Home, Pig.

651
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly knew that there was only one fate for any creature...

652
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that took the life of a sheep on Hoggett Farm.

653
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Fly could never believe that

654
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe was a sheep killer,

655
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so she remained in the field to do something

656
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she 'd never done before: talk to the sheep.

657
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me. Who killed the old one?

658
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:00,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf!

659
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf. is that the only words you half-wits know?

660
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you saying it was a dog?

661
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe

662
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Babe?

663
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it wolf or Babe

664
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf!

665
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

666
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farmer Hoggett was carrying something

667
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the crook of one arm.

668
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A kind of black, shiny tube.

669
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Pig.

670
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pig had a vague memory

671
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that shiny tubes produced food...

672
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and guessed that some quite unexpected surprise...

673
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would come out of two small round mouths.

674
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

675
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:44,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf!

676
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet!

677
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly decided to speak very slowly,

678
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for it was a cold fact of nature

679
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that sheep were stupid...

680
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and no one would ever persuade her otherwise.

681
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, please would you be...

682
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so kind as to tell me what happened?

683
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:06,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet!

684
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, tell me what happened this morning.

685
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sheep spoke very slowly...

686
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for it was a cold fact ofnature

687
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that wolves were ignorant...

688
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and nothing would convince them otherwise.

689
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe came! He saved us!

690
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wolves killed Maa.

691
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Babe drove the wolves away!

692
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you! Thank you! Thank you all very much!

693
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pleasure talkin' to ya.

694
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooey! Hoggett!

695
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooey! Arthur!

696
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, there you are! Well, what do you think?

697
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was the police on the telephone.

698
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Said there are wild dogs about.

699
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently the Mitchells lost six lambs this morning.

700
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What on earth are you doing with that gun?.

701
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I... nothing.

702
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pig of destiny!

703
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all very simple. Halfan hour at 350 degrees.

704
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've given you rabbit casserole for Friday.

705
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, for Duchess,

706
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's liver in the morning, heart for the evening.

707
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except Fridays, when it's steak in the morning

708
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and cooked liver at night.

709
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warm it up a bit

710
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:16,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but test it, because she bites into it before she knows what's what.

711
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll be the bus.

712
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, bye-bye. Have a good time. Bye.

713
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, everyone!

714
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dearie me, Valda.

715
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I have to be at the NationaL Conference.

716
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am the Assistant General Secretary

717
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the Northeast Region after all,

718
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I do worry about leaving that man alone.

719
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still acting a bit strange?

720
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just silly things.

721
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Odd little things only a wife would notice.

722
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still he can't get up to too much mischiefin three days.

723
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

724
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

725
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on!

726
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Good evening. Shame about the weather.

727
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nasty cough!

728
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It had been a long time since Arthur Hoggett...

729
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had had an animal in whose abilities he had so much faith.

730
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,020


731
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And with the National Grand challenge

732
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheepdog Trials only two days away,

733
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he wasn 't going to let the fact that his animal was a pig deter him.

734
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,710


735
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had been worried, for he was a truthful man,

736
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the heading might say "Name of dog. "

737
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then whatever he put would be a lie.

738
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But as it happened,

739
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}luck, for the moment, was running with him.

740
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,090


741
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,230


742
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's allright, really! I'm just, well... bless you.

743
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa! Uh, easy, whoa! Ah.

744
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, ah... what's happening?.

745
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

746
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh. Easy, easy.

747
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold still. Hold still.

748
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:50,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are many perfectly nice cats in the world.

749
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But every barrel has its bad apples.

750
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it is well to heed the old adage,

751
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:59,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge. "

752
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,830


753
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:23,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you feeling?

754
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bit tired.

755
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll need a good sleep to put you in top condition tomorrow.

756
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't stay up too late. Good night.

757
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Mom.

758
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:47,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, do forgive me for scratching you, dear.

759
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a bit carried away.

760
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a cat thing.

761
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Well... But, oh...

762
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feeling good about tomorrow, are you?

763
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm-hmm. It should be all right, I think.

764
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I probably shouldn't say this, .

765
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm not sure if you realize..

766
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how much the other animals

767
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are laughing at you for this sheepdog business.

768
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would they do that?

769
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:16,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they say that you've forgotten that you're a pig.

770
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that silly?

771
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They even say that you don't know what pigs are for.

772
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? What pigs are for.

773
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know... why pigs are here.

774
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are any of us here?

775
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the cow's here to be milked.

776
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dogs are here to help the boss's husband with the sheep.

777
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:38,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm here to be beautiful and affectionate to the boss.

778
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?.

779
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:45,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact is that pigs don't have a purpose.

780
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just like ducks don't have a purpose.

781
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:50,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't...

782
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all right, for your own sake, I'll be blunt.

783
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do the bosses keep ducks?. To eat them

784
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why do the bosses keep a pig?.

785
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact is that animals that don't seem

786
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to have a purpose really do have a purpose.

787
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bosses have to eat.

788
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's probably the most noble purpose of all...

789
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you come to think about it.

790
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They eat pigs?

791
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pork, they call it. Or bacon.

792
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:22,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They only call them pigs when they're alive.

793
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, uh, I'm a sheep pig!

794
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boss's husband's just playing a little game with you.

795
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:33,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me, sooner or later, every pig gets eaten.

796
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the way the world works.

797
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! I haven't upset you, have I?

798
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:13,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom? Mom!

799
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:16,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good heavens!

800
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What on earth are you doing out in the rain in the middle of the night.

801
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be looking after yourself with such a big day ahead of you.

802
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are pigs for eatin'?

803
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who told you that?

804
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cat told me.

805
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pigs don't have a purpose except to be eaten.

806
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it true?

807
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's true. For many pigs, it's true.

808
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So my mother, my father,

809
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my brothers and my sisters, all...

810
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably, dear.

811
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to talk about it?

812
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's all right. I understand.

813
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be all right.

814
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even... the boss?

815
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, dear.

816
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe?.

817
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

818
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

819
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

820
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe!

821
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe's run away. Rex?

822
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please?

823
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call the boss.

824
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's over here.

825
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, Pig, you'll be home soon.

826
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a cold, but

827
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that doesn't explain a pig not eating.

828
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got me stonkered, Arthur.

829
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can tell you this.

830
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't get fluids into him soon,

831
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're gonna lose him.

832
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}C'mon, son. Pull yourself together.

833
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boss needs you.

834
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go. Come on, Pig. Ah, come on.

835
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's my boy. Come on, then. Come on.

836
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# If I had words to make a day for you #

837
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:43,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I'd sing you a morning golden and true #

838
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I would make this day last for all time  #

839
01:10:54,150 --> 01:11:00,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# Then fill the night deep in moonshine  #

840
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:08,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# If I had words to make a day for you #

841
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:15,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I'd giveyou a morning golden and true #

842
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}# I would make this day last for all time #

843
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Arthur, I'll tell you what we can do.

844
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're listed third, but we can put you last in the program.

845
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However, you must be here by 3:30

846
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}otherwise you'll be disqualified.

847
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

848
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And welcome back

849
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the National Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials...

850
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}coming today from the Kingsmith Show Ground in the heart of sheep country.

851
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The weather's been patchy,

852
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:27,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we've already seen some wonderful work by these talented dogs.

853
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay there.

854
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, sheep. Hello! Hello! Good morning to you all!

855
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never met a sheep with such a strong, dark face.

856
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they feeding you well?

857
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babe, I'll try.

858
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, blockheads! Pay attention over here!

859
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you pay attention to what this pig has to say...

860
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I'll come in there and rip you to shreds!

861
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hadn't thought of this. Keep talking to them.

862
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see what I can do.

863
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't it look a picture?.

864
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our show ground on the telly!

865
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apart from the weather.

866
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! There's your Bert!

867
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.

868
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweep's having a little trouble with this gate, clive.

869
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of trouble actually.

870
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Valda. just a little slip up.

871
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, he's doing much better now.

872
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too many loose sheep.

873
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Sweep's usually such a reliable dog.

874
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, whoa. Stop!

875
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If those sheep won't talk to Babe,

876
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the boss is going to look like an idiot.

877
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to do.

878
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is one thing. I gotta go!

879
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll try to be back in time.

880
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahem. It must've been terrible weather for you,

881
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out in the field with all this rain we've been having.

882
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, that dog's in a hurry.

883
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Nick, I got a beer and a TV waiting.

884
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The last entry is pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.

885
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Hoggett?

886
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it was!

887
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? He said Hoggett. It was clear as a bell.

888
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be another Hoggett.

889
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We only have the two dogs, and they certainly...

890
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}aren't...

891
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

892
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:31,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up, you morons! The little pig's in trouble.

893
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What trouble has come to our Babe, wolf?.

894
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sheep at the trials won't talk to the little fellow.

895
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:40,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They won't listen. He doesn't know what to do.

896
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't know what we could do to help.

897
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not right to give help to a wolf.

898
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wait here, wolf.

899
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have to speak up. I'm a...

900
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}little hard of hearing.

901
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked you to wait here, wolf.

902
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do what you're told by an old sheep for a change.

903
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see what we can do for you

904
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:06,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Work completed. Restore power.

905
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very frustrating to be sitting up here...

906
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wondering what's causing the delay.

907
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have someone on their way to the judges' rooms now.

908
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll tell you what's causing the problem as soon as we find out.

909
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}perhaps it's a drug test, Eric? Yeah, it could be.

910
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never heard ofa drug test at a sheepdog contest before.

911
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither am I

912
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:29,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got somethin' here that might be of use to our pig.

913
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Password! Password!

914
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before we gives you anythin',

915
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll be makin'us a solemn promise.

916
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes?  - Treat us civil!

917
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! You gotta treat us nice-like.

918
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:45,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll try.

919
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bitin'!

920
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Wolf must avoid bitin' us sheep... at all costs!

921
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all right! I'll try that too.

922
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'spreposterous!

923
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd be the laughing stock of every sheepdog organization...

924
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in every civilized country in the world!

925
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no rule...

926
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see about that when the adjudication committee

927
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have finished their meeting

928
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean What will we have nextyear,

929
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:09,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a Laughing hyena doing show jumping? I suppose.

930
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the most important of all,

931
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you must promise...

932
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never ever to let this password we be about to give...

933
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to be used against any sheep anywhere.

934
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you that. I'll make sure the pig knows it too.

935
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have the promise!

936
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Tis for Babe.

937
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maa would have wanted it.

938
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe.

939
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To your breed, your rleece,

940
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your clan be true. Sheep be true.

941
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baa, ram, ewe.

942
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that it?. Is that the password?.

943
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,920


944
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Hoggett,

945
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the judges would like me to convey to you...

946
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}their disappointment

947
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that a man such as yourself,

948
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a long and honorable association with the work

949
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of National Sheepdog Association,

950
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should see fit to rlout...

951
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the historic conventions which have long ruled our sport.

952
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}However we find there is no rule, as such,

953
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which would prevent your... animal... being entered.

954
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The committee has ruled that

955
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you wish to proceed,

956
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:50,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is nothing we can do to stop you.

957
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you wish to do?.

958
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There appears to be some movement down there now.

959
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I expect if there are no further problems,

960
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we shall see Hoggett and his dog pig.

961
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}U nusual name. Strange name, isn't it?. Pig.

962
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:17,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone for a game of cards?.

963
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, good grief! Look!

964
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:44,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Entry number 23, mr. A. Hoggett with pig.

965
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just too crazy to believe.

966
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:16,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if that isn't enough.

967
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a stray dog on the field.

968
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They trying to round him up?

969
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dog's gonna give a few tips on how to be a sheep pig.

970
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's up to him now.

971
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Away to me, Pig.

972
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe!

973
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To your breed, your rleece,

974
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your clan be true. Sheep be true.

975
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baa, ram, ewe.

976
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What... what did you say?

977
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.

978
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there, Esme. It's not the end of the world.

979
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:48,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is hejust going to stand there until his time runs out?

980
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or could this be some sort of protest?

981
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}may be we should line up an interview with the sheep pig?

982
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or the sheep pig's trainer.

983
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a lively sort of fellow by the looks of things.

984
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good heavens!

985
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Babe!

986
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, beautifully done!

987
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you how grateful I am to y'all.

988
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, for one last favor.

989
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the three ladies with collars

990
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:00,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would kindly walk out of the ring,

991
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be very much obliged.

992
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so it was that in all the celebration,

993
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in all the hubbub of noise and excitement,

994
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there were two figures who stood silent and still...

995
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}side by side.

996
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The pig did it! The perfect score!

997
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yippee! Yippee!

998
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And though everysingle human in the stands

999
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or in the commentary boxes...

01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was at a complete loss for words,

1001
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the man, who in his life

01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had uttered fewer words than any of them...

1003
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knew exactly what to say.

01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do, Pig.

1005

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do.
