00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's for my office. It's fragile.

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, dude, headphones.

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An autograph?

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I just thought that... - Are you kidding me?

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sheriff. - Your husband around?

12
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ashley?

13
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ashley?

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart.

16
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - Painting.

17
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. I think your mom wants your help unpacking.

18
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

19
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why don't you come outside with me. You can finish your painting later.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I didn't wanna move here.

21
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

22
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had to move here

23
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we all have to help carry boxes.

24
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-uh. You wanted to move here.

25
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I had to move here.

26
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The new story I'm writing is here.

27
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you just keep writing in the old house?

28
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause I was gonna have to write college textbooks

29
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to pay for that old house.

30
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And I can't do that. - Why not?

31
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- 'Cause I just can't. - But I miss my school.

32
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know what?

33
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The school here is supposed to be pretty great.

34
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I want my old one.

35
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. How about this, all right? I'll tell you what.

36
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't like it here,

37
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once I sell my book, we'll move back.

38
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But only if we don't like it here.

39
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - Really.

40
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promise?

41
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise. But you have to promise to try to like it here.

42
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

43
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do? Now, my little artist.

44
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the number one rule?

45
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paint only goes in the bedroom.

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And where doesn't it go?

47
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anywhere else in the house.

48
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. OK, now, come with me. Move some boxes.

49
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheriff's here.

50
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Already? - Play nice this time.

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm always nice. - I'm not kidding.

52
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tired of driving five miles under the speed limit

53
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}only to get ticketed anyway.

54
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be nice.

55
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afternoon. Is there a problem?

56
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sir. Just a friendly visit.

57
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate that. Ellison Oswalt.

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who you are.

59
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So you're not a fan. - No.

60
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what can I do for you?

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, not much, I expect, unless I can convince you

62
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to load those boxes back on that truck

63
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and leave as soon as you're able.

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't think so, but, you know what,

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do have a couple of extra copies of Kentucky Blood in my office.

66
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you want me to get one out and sign it for you.

67
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, thank you, sir.

68
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it the writing?

69
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More a matter of content.

70
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't seem to care much for our profession.

71
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not everybody in your profession gets it right.

72
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've read your books. Neither do you.

73
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look... - You got it right in Kentucky Blood.

74
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you that. It's a fine piece of writing.

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Cold Denver Morning, you got it wrong.

76
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Blood Diner... - Look, that wasn't my fauIt. All right?

77
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your bad theory helped a killer go free.

78
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've ruined people's lives.

79
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this town doesn't need that.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It needs to heal. It needs to forget.

81
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We sure don't want that circus that you bring with you.

82
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's a missing girl involved here.

83
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She ain't missing. She's dead.

84
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. You don't know that.

85
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that girl is still alive, then it ain't no miracle

86
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we ain't ever gonna find her.

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I guess we should just let it go, huh?

88
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think the town deserves an explanation?

89
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something like this... You can never explain something like this.

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you were able to,

91
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the odds are you wouldn't much care for the answer.

92
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we did our job. You'll see that.

93
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is just another waste of your time

94
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like your last two books.

95
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If writing true crime has taught me one thing,

96
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's that whenever an officer of the law tells me that I'm wasting my time,

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it just means he thinks he's wasting his.

98
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's clever. You ought to write that down.

99
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb

100
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and assume your department is not at my disposal?

101
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what do you know?

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can still get things right on occasion.

103
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and...

104
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find this to be in extremely bad taste.

105
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was all that about? - The usual.

106
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wanted an autograph, but he left his copy at home.

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He'll be back later. - That bad?

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why was he pointing at the house?

109
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ellison, we didn't move in

110
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a few houses down from a crime scene again, did we?

111
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tracy... - No, just don't say anything.

112
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we did, I don't wanna know about it.

113
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We didn't. - You promise?

114
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

115
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Make yourself useful. Kitchen.

116
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be good here, OK? You'll see.

117
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

118
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

119
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be kidding me.

120
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family Hanging Out, '11 ?

121
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barbeque, '79?

122
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've also got noodles and fortune cookies.

123
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy, kids.

124
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not likely to be able to eat out much this time.

125
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

126
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know why. - I don't.

127
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't sold the old house yet.

128
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once it's gone, we'll be able to afford a few extra things.

129
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then sell it already. Lower the price if you have to.

130
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've already lowered it as much as we can without losing our money.

131
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The market's terrible.

132
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we're not paying two mortgages,

133
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll be fine.

134
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And once I sell my new book,

135
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll be on Easy Street.

136
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the story a good one this time?

137
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's good. Of course it is.

138
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you take me and show me where it happened? - Trevor.

139
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm old enough to know about this stuff.

140
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not. Even I'm not old enough to know about this stuff.

141
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father writes about terrible, terrible things and I don't even know...

142
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,110


143
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I shouldn't be writing about it? - That's not what I meant.

144
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the way you said it.

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna hear about it at school anyway.

146
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids'll all hate me again

147
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tell me nonstop what happened.

148
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, nobody hates you. - I might as well hear it from you.

149
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you listening to this? - Yes, I'm listening.

150
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's at least make sure your office stays locked.

151
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's one thing to hear about it, another to see it.

152
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want him walking in again. He's 12 years old.

153
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom, he knows how old I am. - Hey, stop it.

154
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the first rule?

155
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never go in Dad's office.

156
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's the rule?

157
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Always lock Dad's office. - That's right.

158
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't wanna hear another thing

159
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about why we're here, from anybody.

160
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

161
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't brush your teeth.

162
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, not yet. - You're not coming to bed?

163
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I thought I'd set up my office first and get started.

164
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How long is it gonna be? - Just an hour or two.

165
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean... how long are we here for this time?

166
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God, I don't know. It could be a long one.

167
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I liked it better when you were writing fiction.

168
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody likes my fiction.

169
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should try again.

170
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracy, I can't do this without you by my side.

171
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm on your side.

172
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna see you enjoying your work again.

173
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you're happy... we're all happy.

174
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need another hit, that's all.

175
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just one more. - I just...

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

177
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know I'm behind you on this. - I know.

178
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's not what you were gonna say. What were you gonna say?

179
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kentucky Blood was ten years ago.

180
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

181
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... what if that was your 15 minutes?

182
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, what if it was?

183
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it was, you can't just

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}spend the rest of your life chasing after it.

185
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you miss out on these years with the kids,

186
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you won't get them back.

187
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need one more chance, that's all, one more.

188
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK, good. - I got a good feeling about this. I really do.

189
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Ell, I don't think I can do this again.

190
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honey, you're not gonna have to. - No, I mean it.

191
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this goes sour like last time,

192
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take Trevor and Ashley and go back home to my sister's.

193
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that fair? - Yes.

194
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's not gonna go sour.

195
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Now go kick some arse.

196
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,050


197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000


198
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell? Let's do this.

199
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

200
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,910


201
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,770


202
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you film it?

203
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, I can't find the bathroom.

204
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. Come on. Come on. We'll get you...

205
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Daddy.

310
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I drew a picture.

311
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He drew a picture with a permanent marker on the classroom whiteboard.

312
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. Trevor?

313
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him what you drew.

314
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I drew a tree.

315
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With four people hanging from it.

316
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to your room, Trevor.

317
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to speak to your father.

318
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His first day at school, Ellison,

319
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he's already hearing the grisly details of your mystery?

320
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did he hear? - Exactly what he drew.

321
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That your book is about a family that was hung.

322
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christ, Ellison.

323
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's all he heard?

324
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not enough?

325
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm sorry he had to find out like this, all right? I am.

326
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, come on, it was bound to happen.

327
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? That's your response?

328
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that makes it OK?

329
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it doesn't make it OK, all right?

330
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing about what happened to these people is OK.

331
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But bad things happen to good people

332
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they still need to have their story told.

333
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They deserve that much. - You're a real man of the people.

334
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come...

335
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm putting the kids to bed.

336
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kiss them good night for me.

337
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're getting good work done? - Yeah.

338
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Please keep the door closed.

339
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,130


340
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,350


341
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, 1998. St. Louis murders.

342
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New details today in the grisly murders

343
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of a local family found earlier this week.

344
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police have released this photo of Christopher Miller,

345
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the missing 13-year-old son of William and Penny Miller.

346
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Millers, along with their younger son,

347
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were found stabbed inside their home,

348
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and police now are asking for any information

349
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that could lead to Christopher's return,

350
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the apprehension of any suspects

351
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}involved in this vicious muItiple murder and child abduction.

352
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family Hanging Out.

353
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pool Party.

354
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barbecue.

355
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleepy Time.

356
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, I'm fine.

357
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd prefer to take you down to the hospital to have this checked out.

358
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you should get stitches.

359
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can't force you, though. - Yeah, and I'm not gonna go.

360
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the bleeding's stopped for now, but if it starts again

361
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or if there's any more swelling, call a doctor immediately.

362
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. Appreciate it. - OK.

363
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way.

364
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... let's go see this hole.

365
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you say you heard a loud thump and footsteps in the attic

366
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after the power went out?

367
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

368
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But the ladder wasn't down? - No, it wasn't.

369
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not possible to close it from inside the attic?

370
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

371
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how would an intruder get up there?

372
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say anyone was up there.

373
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just said it sounded like there was an intruder.

374
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I did see a small snake, though. - Snakes don't have feet.

375
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm... I'm guessing that you got squirrels.

376
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With, you know, way in and out up there

377
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all the power gone off in the neighbourhood,

378
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet they got spooked from the sound of

379
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything shutting down at once.

380
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know how they are. - Not really.

381
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not really a squirrel guy. - Really?

382
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did kill a scorpion when we first moved in here, though,

383
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so maybe I should get an exterminator.

384
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scorpions have feet, but you wouldn't hear 'em

385
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like you would squirrels.

386
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Officer, thank you very much.

387
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's... I will... If there's anything else I can do for you...

388
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, there is.

389
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I left my copy of Kentucky Blood down at the station.

390
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'd really mean a lot to me if you signed a copy.

391
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. I got a few extra copies in my office.

392
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much. That's so great.

393
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Do you know what?

394
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is like one of them FBI profiler's offices.

395
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,170


396
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a map with pictures connected with yarn and everything.

397
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deputy, I need you to step outside.

398
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No no no, this is my private office. I'm serious.

399
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just wait outside. - Mr Oswalt, listen.

400
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know there's a page in your books where you always say

401
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nice things about all the people that helped you out?

402
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The acknowledgements? - Yeah, well...

403
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and in each one

404
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's always like a line that says, you know,

405
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I couldn't have done this without the tireless efforts

406
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of Deputy So And So from the local police department."

407
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

408
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, I could be like...

409
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, your Deputy So And So,

410
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, if you don't already have one.

411
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there are a few things you could do for me, actually.

412
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - Yeah, this could be perfect.

413
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a notepad?

414
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - Do you need a pen?

415
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

416
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need the street address of a crime.

417
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 1998, St. Louis,

418
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a family was stabbed to death.

419
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually they had their throats cut. It was a pretty ugly affair.

420
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also need any details you can get me on another murder.

421
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}1979, a family was burned alive,

422
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}parked inside their own car, in their own garage.

423
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What city? - I don't know.

424
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I have is the year and the method of execution.

425
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm. You think that the two cases are related?

426
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no. I'm just doing research.

427
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. I can definitely get this for you.

428
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta wait till the sheriff leaves the office,

429
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I will get it.

430
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very much, Deputy So And So.

431
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm sorry. - For what?

432
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was angry at Trevor today and I took it out on you.

433
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't be sorry. I know the move's been hard for you.

434
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm trying, Ell. I really am. - I know.

435
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want you here with me, that's all.

436
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always been with you. And I'm with you now.

437
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pleased to have Ellison Oswalt on our programme.

438
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His new book is called Kentucky Blood.

439
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oswalt, good to have you on.

440
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for having me. It's a real pleasure.

441
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, I got into this. This is pretty graphic stuff.

442
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let me start by asking why you spend so much time

443
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}investigating such grisly content?

444
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fame and money? No, I'm just kidding.

445
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The honest answer is that

446
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really driven by a sense of injustice.

447
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know when I think about the awful things

448
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that happened to these people and that those responsible

449
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were never even identified, let alone caught.

450
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I knew when I started this particular case

451
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I might stumble on a few things

452
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that maybe somebody'd overlooked.

453
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might stumble? No, you in fact did uncover

454
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some additional information that the cops had overlooked.

455
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, look, first of all I wanna say that

456
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there are a lot of good police officers out there

457
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I don't wanna in any way disparage what they do, right?

458
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in police work getting something wrong

459
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}means ruining people's lives.

460
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good crime writing can set things right.

461
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, ultimately, what feels better?

462
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seeing justice done or seeing your book, Kentucky Blood,

463
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}number one on the New York Times bestseller list?

464
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The justice, without question.

465
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather cut my hands off than write a book for fame or money.

466
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,350


467
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you making Daddy his coffee? - Yes.

468
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help? I wanna bring it to him.

469
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, honey, but we have to make it just right.

470
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's very particular about his coffee.

471
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Brought you your coffee, Daddy. - Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

472
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, hello. - Hey, Mr Oswalt.

473
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Deputy So And So.

474
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry to get back to you so late in the day.

475
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't make the call from the office.

476
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the sheriff.

477
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, I understand. - But I got what you asked about.

478
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a Martinez family in Sacramento, California,

479
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that died in their garage in 1979,

480
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}their car was set on fire.

481
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of their sons, nine years old, they never found him.

482
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have the street address?

483
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah yes. 8224 Billington, Sacramento.

484
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what about St. Louis?

485
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The address of the house where the Miller murders occurred is

486
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}2976 Piedmont Way, St. Louis.

487
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is excellent. 29... Wait,

488
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}did you say 2976, like 29-76?

489
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Does that mean something to you?

490
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, it doesn't. No. Thank you. Thank you, Deputy.

491
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before the Stevensons moved here,

492
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they lived where the Miller family murders happened?

493
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

494
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ashley?

495
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trevor?

496
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Is he OK?

497
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found him outside.

498
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to put a lock on his door.

499
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's way worse than it was.

500
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call the doctor in the morning.

501
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay with him. I left something outside.

502
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good dog. Good dog.

503
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna hurt you.

504
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna get my bat...

505
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so if you come at me, I can bash your head in, OK?

506
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's fine. You keep it.

507
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You OK? - Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

508
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trevor's too old to still be having these.

509
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was supposed to have outgrown them by now.

510
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's all right. He's OK. - Just stop.

511
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,420

512
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can pack up,

513
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get out of town and never look back.

514
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, 'cause he's having some night terrors?

515
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No no. It's more than that. He's never been this bad.

516
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You've never been this bad. - What are you talking about?

517
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been at this book less than a week

518
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're already a mess.

519
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never crack into the whisky this early and this often.

520
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're saying I'm a drunk? - No.

521
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saying there's something you aren't telling me,

522
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}something that's eating you up, and whatever it is,

523
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it seems to be getting to Trevor as well.

524
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's different this time.

525
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, something is different.

526
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you wanna know what it is?

527
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much do you wanna know?

528
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna know why you're different.

529
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm different because

530
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:19,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never been onto something this big before.

531
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember how it was when I was writing Kentucky?

532
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember that?

533
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember.

534
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is much bigger than that! Much!

535
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am talking about a potentially important work here.

536
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking about a mega hit.

537
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This could be my In Cold Blood.

538
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,800


539
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A movie deal, talk show circuit, right?

540
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A national book award.

541
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More money than we could... We could live wherever we wanted to.

542
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care about any of that.

543
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do. Everybody does.

544
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm just... - This is my shot, Tracy.

545
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just what?

546
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just worried about you.

547
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:54,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't be. Nothing is wrong.

548
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why did you come in white as a ghost?

549
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I saw a dog, OK?

550
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dog?

551
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A very big dog,

552
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like Cujo big.

553
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,020


554
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I'd never seen him before. He's like...

555
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you get rid of him? - Yeah, he's gone.

556
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I just need a little more time, OK?

557
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise it's worth it.

558
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every minute that we're here,

559
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:21,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're a minute closer to that happy ending that we always dreamed of.

560
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're almost there.

561
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deputy.

562
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Oswalt, these came in this morning.

563
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a few of the pertinent files pulled for you

564
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and had 'em faxed over.

565
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - Yeah.

566
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - No problem.

567
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think I could come in for a second?

568
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Yeah, sure.

569
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - Come on, just...

570
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I... I know what you must think of me.

571
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some small-town deputy that's starstruck with the famous writer.

572
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not some local moron.

573
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say you were a... you know.

574
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a degree in criminology.

575
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've taken my fair share of forensic science courses.

576
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also know a series of connected murders

577
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I see one, Mr. Oswalt.

578
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look... -Listen, we missed something. I get that.

579
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you want me to run interference for you

580
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while you get this worked out,

581
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta be in the loop just a little bit.

582
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really wanna help?

583
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my home, Mr Oswalt.

584
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened here happened to all of us.

585
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Come here.

586
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that?

587
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. That's what I'm hoping to find out.

588
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You think these are serial murders? - Maybe.

589
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More ritualised than necessarily serial. But really spread out.

590
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not just regionally but over time.

591
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first one dates back to the '60s.

592
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The 1960s? - Yeah.

593
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would put the guy, what, in his 70s?

594
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, or his 60s. - Yeah, I...

595
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't know. - Well, look at the methodology.

596
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toxicology reports, some cases the killer drugged his victims.

597
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- With what? - Well, they couldn't tell for sure.

598
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But by drugging them,

599
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the killer removes his need to overpower them.

600
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here he used a tree branch to do the heavy lifting.

601
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Sacramento he lit a family on fire.

602
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In St. Louis he slit their throats.

603
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The first family he drowned. - Drowning?

604
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never said anything about anyone being drowned.

605
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only other significant link between the murder cases

606
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that in each instance

607
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the killer murdered the entire family except one,

608
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a child which he took with him.

609
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That and this symbol appears in several of the crime scenes.

610
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That looks like something from out of the occult.

611
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you might wanna call the university.

612
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a professor over there. Professor Jonas.

613
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an occult crime expert

614
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the state police bring him in

615
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on some of the... the weirder stuff.

616
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this qualifies.

617
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where do you think that drowning happened?

618
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I need you to find out.

619
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok.

620
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Professor Jonas? - Yes.

621
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Hey, thank you for getting back to me so quickly.

622
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate that.

623
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, I'm a really big fan.

624
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm flattered that you emailed.  - Thank you.

625
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once I saw the photos that you sent,

626
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew exactly what cases you were studying.

627
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. How would you know what cases I was looking at?

628
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:03,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The symbol that you sent me is... isn't a pentagram.

629
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not something that you would see teenagers

630
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or a Norwegian black metal band

631
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}paint on a wall in goat's blood to be edgy.

632
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right. - Or to piss off the Christians.

633
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this is a little bit more obscure than that.

634
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I know the one in the hallway,

635
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's from the late '90s in St. Louis.

636
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other one, the... the car hood,

637
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that is from Sacramento, that's about 30 years ago.

638
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

639
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a symbol associated with the worship of a pagan deity.

640
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A deity? What kind of deity?

641
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A very obscure one, dating back to Babylonian times.

642
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:45,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Named Bughuul, the Eater of Children.

643
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say eater?

644
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, of children. Thank you, Jessica.

645
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The crimes that you're dealing with,

646
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they all have the element of a missing child, correct?

647
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:58,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yeah. That's correct.

648
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Bughuul eats children.

649
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the fragments of stories that have survived,

650
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they all revolve around him

651
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}needing the souls of human children to survive.

652
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, each story involves a different way

653
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that he lures or tricks these children

654
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}away from the physical world

655
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and traps them in his own netherworld

656
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he consumes their souls over time.

657
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, any worship of this deity would include a blood sacrifice

658
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the wholesale eating of a child.

659
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're saying the person that made this symbol

660
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is... is eating children?

661
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that would fit the stories.

662
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, the few times that this symbol has shown up,

663
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}none of the crimes have been related in any way to any of this.

664
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this might be more of a cult initiation

665
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rather than, you know, the actual actions of any one man.

666
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been another one, hasn't there?

667
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think so, yes.

668
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me everything you can.

669
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate you coming by, officer.

670
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, it's not a problem at all.

671
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we're becoming friends, right?

672
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I suppose, yeah.

673
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I mean, I can trust you, right? - Yeah, absolutely.

674
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if I were to ask you something in earnest,

675
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you wouldn't read too much into it?

676
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... All right.

677
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was there anything... weird about the Stevensons?

678
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No complaints from them about anything... strange?

679
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not to my knowledge.

680
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The investigators,

681
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}did they notice anything odd or inexplicable

682
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:45,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about the house, any... any weird stories?

683
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

684
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Oswalt, is there something that you wanna tell me?

685
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Look, clearly something happened

686
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you wanna talk to somebody about it, right?

687
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

688
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, well, does your wife know about it?

689
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

690
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does she know whose house this is... was?

691
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man, oh.

692
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is a conversation that I would not wanna be around for.

693
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, me neither. - I'm sorry.

694
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So... So, what, you saw something weird,

695
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}heard something spooky in the house?

696
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. Precisely. - What exactly?

697
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now...

698
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe in any, you know, stuff.

699
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuff? You mean the supernatural, the metaphysical, the paranormal.

700
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That type of stuff? - Right.

701
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Of course you don't.

702
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never would have moved into a crime scene if you did.

703
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But here we are having this conversation.

704
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but... but there was...

705
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was none of that, you know,

706
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}none of that with the Stevensons, huh?

707
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. In the short amount of time

708
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the Stevensons lived here,

709
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they never called the police,

710
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they never had the police called on them

711
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or reported anything bizarre that came up in the investigation.

712
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you wanna know what I think? - Yes.

713
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that you moved yourself into the house of murder victims

714
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and immediately set about

715
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to put yourself in their head space.

716
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also think that you've begun discovering things about this case

717
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that go to darker places than you were prepared for.

718
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also think that every time that I've been to your house,

719
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a whisky bottle in your office that doesn't appear to be neglected.

720
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no, no. I... - Mr Oswalt, listen,

721
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't, I don't...

722
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not saying that you

723
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have a drinking problem. I don't think that.

724
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nor do I think that you're making any of this up

725
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No!  - to get attention.

726
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think that. What I do think is that...

727
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you are under so much stress,

728
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've put yourself under so much stress,

729
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that your mind is trying to process all of it at once.

730
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't believe any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

731
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? I believe in all that stuff.

732
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I wouldn't sleep one night in this place. Are you nuts?

733
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four people were hung by their necks in the tree in your backyard

734
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that little girl is probably God knows wherever.

735
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. - I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what?

736
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should try and get out more,

737
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Oswalt, try to clear your head.

738
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Total honesty?

739
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night I thought something was in the house

740
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I woke up on the couch holding a baseball bat.

741
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well... I guess if I thought something was in my home at night,

742
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be a little bit freaked out too.

743
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, listen, Mr Oswalt,

744
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you sleep in this house,

745
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's just gonna do terrible things to your head.

746
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ellison!

747
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ellison! - What's going on?

748
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your daughter apparently thought

749
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there wasn't room on her walls for her new painting.

750
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ashley! - No, that's not it.

751
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did we talk about? We only gave you one rule.

752
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a big deal for us

753
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to let you paint on your walls.

754
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the rule, Ashley?

755
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paint only goes in the bedroom.

756
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what makes you think you can paint out here?

757
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to paint her picture, but she didn't want it in my room

758
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because that used to be her brother's room.

759
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Who are you talking about?

760
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stephanie. - Who's Stephanie?

761
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:44,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She used to live here.

762
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's the one Daddy's writing his book about.

763
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ashley, go to your room and shut the door.

764
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell were you thinking?

765
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you think I wouldn't find out?

766
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh. Of course I knew you were gonna find out eventually, OK?

767
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But don't blame me for not telling you.Because you never wanted to know.

768
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't try and pin this on me. I asked you!

769
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked you if we were living near the house!

770
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said no!

771
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You asked me if we were

772
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}living two houses down from a crime scene.

773
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't you dare! - I said no.

774
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never should have come here!

775
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracy, nobody died here.

776
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like we're sleeping where somebody was killed

777
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or they had to wipe blood off the walls for the open house.

778
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're saying it didn't happen here?

779
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It happened in the backyard.

780
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that is so sick! God, you think that makes a difference?

781
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It does. - No, Ellison. It doesn't.

782
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have done some crazy shit in the past,

783
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this definitely takes the cake.

784
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God, what on earth possessed you to move here?

785
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've never been this broke before.

786
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no excuse.

787
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place came on the market. It was a steal.

788
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, I wonder why.

789
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what Trevor drew last week, that happened here?

790
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

791
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The previous owners of this home

792
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:05,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were hung from a tree in our backyard?

793
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - That is so sick, Ellison.

794
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you let our little girl play back there?

795
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why shouldn't I?

796
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our son is having night terrors

797
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and drawing pictures of this crime at school.

798
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And our daughter just painted a dead girl on our wall.

799
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:19,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's missing.

800
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Technically she's missing. You don't know...

801
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna hear about technicalities.

802
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand what you've done this time,

803
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the kind of jeopardy you've put your children in, your marriage?

804
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do!

805
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anything you won't do for your goddamn book?

806
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently not. I guess this is all worth it to you.

807
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's worth it. - Putting your family at risk.

808
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Risk of what? Of more paintings?

809
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't. Your daughter...

810
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My daughter has a father who loves her,

811
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:50,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who is always around, who encourages her to be herself.

812
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The worst thing that has ever happened to her

813
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is one time she moved into a house where a family was killed,

814
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she found out about the murders,

815
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so she felt sorry for the little girl,

816
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so she painted a fucking picture!

817
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what she does. It's what she always has done.

818
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it? That's all you have to say?

819
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else do you want from me?

820
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:11,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a home where we feel safe, Ellison?

821
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about neighbours that don't hate us

822
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a town where I can buy groceries

823
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without getting strange looks?

824
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a life that doesn't involve our kids

825
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}drawing and painting the sick details of some horrific tragedy

826
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:27,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or working out their deep-seated anxieties

827
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by doing bizarre shit in the night?

828
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:31,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about that? Would that be OK?

829
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can give all that to you, I can!

830
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just when I finish the book!

831
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This book isn't for us. It's for you.

832
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracy, don't say that. That's not true.

833
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is true. There are plenty of other ways

834
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can provide for this family.

835
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doing what? Teaching?

836
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Editing journalism textbooks?

837
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you understand

838
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that writing is what gives my life meaning?

839
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These books are my legacy.

840
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:04,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have always supported you doing what you love, Ellison.

841
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But writing isn't the meaning of your life.

842
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and me, right here, this marriage,

843
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's the meaning of your life.

844
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your legacy, that's Ashley and Trevor.

845
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your kids are your legacy.

846
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I get Daddy in trouble?

847
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sweetie.

848
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Daddy got Daddy in trouble.

849
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm sorry I painted on the wall. - I know.

850
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get a good night's sleep.

851
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So here's the book I wrote proving it, right?

852
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:56,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

853
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kidding aside, would you want a family? Is that in the cards?

854
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

855
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you'd asked me a year ago,

856
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might have said no, never, I'm a career man.

857
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know how it goes.

858
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:09,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You meet someone, you get a little older.

859
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of a sudden, your career doesn't seem to matter so much.

860
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want kids, you start to see

861
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}other people with kids and think "I want that"

862
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then you wonder "Is he gonna look like me?

863
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she gonna look like her?"

864
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You paint rooms in your head and...

865
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time for bed.

866
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is happening?

867
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:19,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

868
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What the hell are you doing? - We have to leave here.

869
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter? What's happened?

870
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right.

871
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made a mistake. We should have never come to this house.

872
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to leave now.

873
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ell, you're freaking me out here.

874
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:35,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the kids, pack the car. We have to leave.

875
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

876
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honey, slow down. - I just wanna get on the highway.

877
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna put as much road between us and this town as we can, OK?

878
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

879
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:33,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going, Daddy?

880
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going home, honey.

881
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Home, home, like you promised?

882
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Home, like I promised.

883
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about our stuff?

884
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna call the movers in the morning, all right?

885
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK.

886
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Evening, Oswalts. - Sheriff.

887
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:19,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Licence and registration. - Oh, God.

888
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Driving pretty fast for this time of night, don't you think?

889
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything I ought to know about?

890
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just trying to take your advice, that's all.

891
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Which advice would that be? - Leave town and never look back.

892
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You weren't bullied away or anything? - I'm sorry?

893
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I mean is, I don't wanna be reading in your book

894
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that angry town folks chased you out of here.

895
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you've been mistreated, I wanna know about it.

896
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There isn't gonna be any book.

897
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No book?

898
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sir.

899
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, I don't see any reason for me to have your autograph.

900
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:13,450


901
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just one more favour.

902
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold it under 60 till you cross the county line.

903
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until you're somebody else's problem.

904
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

905
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you mean that?

906
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About the book? Yeah.

907
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promise?

908
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

909
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go home.

910
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This goes in the office, right in there on the right.

911
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:04,690


912
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Ell, 10 bucks says

913
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trevor sleeps through the night.

914
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not taking that bet.

915
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Oswalt, sorry it took so long to get back to you.

916
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been so little written on Bughuul

917
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:07,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that no one has actually

918
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}bothered to scan any of this material before.

919
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, what am I looking at? - You're looking at an engraving.

920
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An old sketch from the Dark Ages.

921
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And fragments of a deteriorated fresco.

922
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There isn't a lot left. Everything else has been destroyed.

923
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - Well, superstition.

924
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Early Christians believed that

925
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bughuul actually lived in the images themselves

926
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that they were gateways into his realm.

927
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gateways? - Yes.

928
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ancient Church believed that he would take possession

929
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of those who saw the images

930
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and cause them to do terrible things,

931
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or in some cases he could even

932
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}abduct the viewer into the images themselves.

933
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children exposed to the images were especially vulnerable

934
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Bughuul's possession and/or abduction.

935
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What if you destroyed 'em? - Sorry, I don't follow.

936
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you destroyed the images with a fire, what would happen then?

937
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, do you mean literally or in the stories?

938
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:04,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the stories if an image was destroyed,

939
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then the gateway would be closed

940
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:10,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Bughuul would no longer have access to this world, right?

941
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Oswalt, what kind of book are you writing exactly?

942
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I'm not even sure I have a book any more.

943
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But thank you for your time. - Anytime.

944
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,220


945
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,020


946
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

947
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know what time it is? - I know, I'm sorry.

948
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've been trying to call you all day.

949
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's the problem? - OK, the problem is that you moved.

950
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is that a problem?

951
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was compiling all of the data that you had me collecting

952
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and once I started putting it together into a nice readable package,

953
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw the connection, it was obvious.

954
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was it? - The dates, the addresses.

955
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each family that you had me look up

956
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}had previously lived in the house

957
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where one of the earlier murders took place.

958
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each family? All five of them?

959
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, and when you put them in chronological order,

960
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can actually draw a line from murder to murder to murder.

961
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, we knew that the Stevensons previously lived

962
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the same St. Louis house

963
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where the Millers had their throats cut.

964
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before the Miller family was killed,

965
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:22,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Millers lived in the same house in Orange County

966
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:25,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where the De Luzios lawn massacre occurred.

967
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess where the De Luzios

968
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lived before they moved to Orange County?

969
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:30,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sacramento where

970
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Martinez family was burned in their garage?

971
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly. The pattern goes back

972
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the 1966 Oregon drownings.

973
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Mr Oswalt,

974
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you just moved out of the last house in line.

975
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this guy is still out there,

976
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you not only just sped up his timeline,

977
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you put yourself in it.

978
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Deputy.

980
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the missing kids.

981
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,410


982
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like that you made the movies longer. They're better this way.

983
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Daddy. I'll make you famous again.

984
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:30,510
