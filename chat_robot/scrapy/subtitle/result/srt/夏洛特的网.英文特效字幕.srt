00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was nothing special about Somerset County.

3
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a deeply ordinary place.

4
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No astonishing thing ever happened there.

5
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people who lived there were just regular people.

6
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the animals... Well, they were just plain old animals.

7
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't question the order of things.

8
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, the days passed, one very much like the other.

9
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, one spring, on a small farm,

10
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a little girl did something,

11
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}something that would change everything.

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,008


13
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

14
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, go back to bed.

15
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not going to kill it, are you?

16
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a runt. Now, go back to bed.

17
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not fair! It can't help being born small.

18
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful.

19
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If l'd been born small, would you have killed me?

20
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

21
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little girl is one thing. A runty pig is another.

22
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no difference! This is unfair and unjust.

23
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could you be so heartless?

24
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. I want to show you something.

25
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see that? You see?

26
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's 11 pigs and only 10 teats.

27
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sow can't feed it, honey.

28
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then l will.

29
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll feed you and take care of you and...

30
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...absolutely will not let you kill him.

31
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey! When did Fern get a pig? - Avery, it's rude to point. Give me that.

32
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, sit, eat your breakfast. The bus will be here any minute.

33
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning.

34
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Pop, can l have a pig, too?

35
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I only give pigs to early risers.

36
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern was up before dawn, ridding the world of injustice.

37
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, put that pig down and get to school.

38
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avery.

39
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- See ya. - Bye, Pop.

40
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a good one, buddy.

41
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says here we're gonna get a lot of rain this month.

42
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern! Your books!

43
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye.

44
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Class, these are some of the questions

45
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're likely to be asked in the exam this week.

46
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, please take particular note of every one.

47
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to be quiet, okay? You're gonna get me in trouble.

48
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drink that.

49
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, it's just a matter of following these questions

50
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and learning the answers.

51
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, what's going on?

52
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

53
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, what's in your desk?

54
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nothing. - Open it.

55
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Mrs. Arable.

56
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, you know better.

57
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:38,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a pig, okay? It's not a toy, not a doll, not a baby.

58
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pig.

59
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you need to start treating it like one.

60
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is going too far.

61
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know she loves animals, but you have to tell her.

62
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know. She's just so happy with it. - I know.

63
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't that feel good?

64
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, l'm really sorry, honey, but it's been long enough.

65
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

66
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, he's not a baby anymore.

67
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't have you keeping what will soon be a 300-pound pet around the house.

68
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

69
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't he stay in the barn? Please, Dad?

70
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - Please?

71
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Fern, look. You know l've been selling the animals

72
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get the new harvesting equipment.

73
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty soon there's gonna be no place in the barn for a pig.

74
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promised l'd take care of him.

75
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l'm letting you out of your promise.

76
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't promise you. I promised Wilbur.

77
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Homer?

78
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has animals.

79
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uncle Homer?

80
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure he could make room for a pig.

81
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

82
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd be right across the road.

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to sleep, my little one

84
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sun has said goodbye for now

85
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:38,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The moon shines on your beautiful face

86
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom used to sing that to me to make me feel safe.

87
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night,

88
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur.

89
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern had walked across the road to her uncle's barn hundreds of times before,

90
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it had never felt so far away.

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a big red barn full of typical stuff.

92
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come to think of it, it couldn't have been more ordinary.

93
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But sometimes, when you take two ordinary things

94
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and put them together at just the right time,

95
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a chance they'll become two less ordinary things.

96
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That runty pig, for instance, and that big old smelly barn.

97
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One sniff, and you knew it was a place full of living things.

98
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that didn't necessarily mean it was full of life.

99
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

100
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. For that, this barn needed a pig.

101
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't so bad.

102
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only no one knew it yet.

103
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be afraid.

104

113
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently, they're as intelligent as dolphins.

114

00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times is he going to try that?

117
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pig's out! - L told you pigs are smart.

118
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's going to leave a mark.

119
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, look, Bits. Pig's out. - Sure is out.

124
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How about you walk a little faster? - Wait your turn!

125
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,501

130
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,848

131
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is he looking? - Yeah, he's seen it.

132
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Think he knows what it is? - Of course not.

133
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a spring pig. He doesn't know anything.

134
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, pig, pig, pig!

139
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sold out for slop. I'd have been to the county line by now.

140
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd have made it if you'd have just let me talk.

141
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,522

142
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry l made such a fuss. Your suggestions were really good,

143
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but l think l'd better stay here. Fern's going to be back soon, anyway.

144
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just stupid as a stick, poor thing.

145
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Should we speak to him? - Certainly not!

146
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly not.

148
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd run and be free if you could.

149
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant if l were a pig.

150
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what happens to pigs around here.

151

00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because we're sheep, it doesn't mean we have to follow.

171
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think for yourselves.

186
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really slippery. That's the fun part!

187
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little itty-bitty pig, could you come here, please?

188
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said your name is Wilbur, right?

189
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. What's your name?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you're so cute and pink, but you're wasting your time.

193
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These animals won't play.

194
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about you? - Me?

195
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l have to stay on my eggs.

196
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wow! Look at that!

00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, why can't you play?

199
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

200
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the rest of you? Don't any of you like to play?

201
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't play on three empty stomachs.

202
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, for us there's this whole smell-of-wet-wool business. Ghastly!

203
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? L'm afraid it's just not a play kind of place.

204
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're all friends, right?

205
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. We've been here together our whole lives.

206
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not so sure being in the same place is the same as being friends.

207
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not hungry. I just wanted someone to play with me.

208
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

209
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is...

210
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could it be?

211
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slops!

212
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:26,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, joy. It seems the pig slop has brought out the rodent.

213
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Moldy cheese. Oh, yeah.

214
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did l have salami last night?

215
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep. I guess l did.

216
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, charming. - Disgusting creature!

217
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, there.

218
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you're a pig.

219
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a pig.

220
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pig equals slop.

221
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is happy.

222
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's Wilbur.

223
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a name? Or is it just "the rat"?

224
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say "just the rat"?

225
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For your information, pig, the rat rules.

226
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were here long before your kind, and we'll be here long after.

227
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you just keep that in mind

228
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}next time you feel like reducing me to "just the rat."

229
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You called yourself "the rat."

230
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can call me that. You can't.

231
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't have a name?

232
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course l do. It's Templeton.

233
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton? Great name!

234
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, gee, thanks. - Hey! You want to play, Templeton?

235
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For so many reasons, no.

236
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, l don't play.

237
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gnaw, l spy, l eat, l hide. Me in a nutshell.

238
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't you just stay and chat?

239
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chat? Let me see.

240
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gnaw, spy, eat, hide.

241
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope, "chat" ain't on the list.

242
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is handsome.

243
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight l dream of slop!

244
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, you are not going to see that pig again. It's too late.

245
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's expecting me!

246
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And l'm expecting you to finish your homework and go straight to bed.

247
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Mom, l always tell him good night!

248
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not tonight. - He can't sleep if l don't.

249
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

250
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

251
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night!

252
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

253
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? Who said that?

254
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

255
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you? Are you invisible?

256
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, l'm nocturnal,

257
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which means l work at night, when you should be sleeping.

258
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, l need to concentrate, so, good night.

259
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But l can't sleep now! Please, tell me who you are.

260
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just really lonely.

261
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So l've seen.

262
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you seem like a very nice pig, so l'll tell you what.

263
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you go to sleep right now and let me work,

264
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we can converse tomorrow.

265
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Converse? - I think your word was "chat."

266
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Great! All right.

267
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night. Good night. Good night.

268
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

269
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, he still hasn't moved.

270
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been here one, wait, two...

271
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been here a long time, Elwyn, and that guy ain't moving!

272
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's like a freak of nature.

273
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm dying, man. I've got to get some corn!

274
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, Brooksie. Just be patient.

275
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

276
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

277
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a little further.

278
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, it's morning!

279
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Bits, l wasn't drooling, was I? - Suck it up, Bets.

280
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would whoever addressed me last night kindly make yourself known?

281
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What luck! An early riser, and he has things he needs to say.

282
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, loud things.

283
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm speaking to whoever spoke to me last night.

284
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose that would be me.

285
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

286
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- L can't see you. - Up here, in the corner.

287
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other corner.

288
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. L still can't see you.

289
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move a little closer. L'll come down.

290
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:26,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. You're a...

291
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, l've got a long day ahead of me and l'm trying to get a little...

292
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spider! Spider! Get it away from me!

293
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it away! Get it away!

294
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:34,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, keep your distance there.

295
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That thing is creepy. - Golly! You're not being rude, are you?

296
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:43,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. L meant "creepy" in a nice way. You know, creepy good.

297
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Disgusting!

298
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They eat their menfolk, you know. - I know!

299
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well? Still want to chat, or are you gonna join them?

300
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never met a spider before.

301
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you make that?

302
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:57,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you were concentrating on last night?

303
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - It's amazing.

304
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think you could teach me how to make one of those?

305
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold that thought, please.

306
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:14,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - Making breakfast.

307
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, boy. - Relax.

308
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, l give him a little nip to anesthetize him,

309
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he'll be more comfortable.

310
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little service l throw in.

311
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then l wrap him up.

312
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then l just say grace because, well, that's always nice,

313
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he'll make a perfectly delicious meal.

314
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you eat flies?

315
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

316
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I drink their blood.

317
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lying down on the job, eh? - Fainted like a girl.

318
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's disgusting.

319
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:47,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's easy for you to say.

320
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:51,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have all your meals brought to you in a pail.

321
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get that kind of royal treatment.

322
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am a trapper.

323
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:58,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to catch my food. Which is why l make my home near you.

324
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:02,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please don't hurt me. - Well, since you said "please."

325
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And just imagine how many bugs there would be in this barn,

326
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no, actually, in the world,

327
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if spiders didn't catch them.

328
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insects would take over the planet!

329
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:15,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way l see it, l'm doing everyone a favor.

330
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for the fly.

331
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Except for the fly.

332
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think now is the time for me to say salutations.

333
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:30,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

334
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salutations.

335
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'll leave.

336
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Wilbur.

337
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Salutations" is just a fancy way of saying hello.

338
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Hello.

339
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you know my name! What's yours?

340
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name?

341
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:53,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Charlotte. Charlotte A. Cavatica.

342
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte. Great name!

343
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. L've always thought so.

344
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, since you've said...

345
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, that word,

346
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}does that mean we're friends?

347
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose it does.

348
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

349
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Golly, go see what's going-oing on over there.

350
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:21,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going-oing... Hey, kid, what's going on over here?

351
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sorry. I just made a new friend, that's all.

352
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The spider. Oh, yeah. Good choice.

353
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, perfect.

354
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You picked someone even more despised than me.

355
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would anyone despise Charlotte?

356
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She made that amazing web, and she keeps bugs out of the barn.

357
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at her. I mean, don't you think she's a little...

358
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the word?

359
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's beautiful.

360
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg your pardon. She is hideous!

361
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we even seeing the same ruddy creature?

362
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess not.

363
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hopeless.

364
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a sorry little friendship that's going to be.

365
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:16,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's an old expression that says that ignorance is bliss,

366
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and l'm inclined to believe it's true,

367
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because, on that late spring day,

368
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur was as happy as a pig could be.

369
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those spring days rolled into summer days,

370
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}days filled with endless conversation

371
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}between the two unlikeliest of friends.

372
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, what's a spring pig?

373
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pig who was born in the spring.

374
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. And l thought it meant bouncy.

375
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would be a springy pig.

376
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"After Mrs. Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest,

377
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"she couldn't go to visit Michael anymore,

378
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:53,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"because she had to sit on the eggs to keep them warm.

379
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:57,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"She moved off the nest only to get a drink of water, or to have her lunch,

380
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there.

381
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:05,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"One day, the ducklings hatched out. First came Jack, then Kack..."

382
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Yeah! This is going to be great!

383
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:10,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wilbur, what on earth are you doing? - You'll see.

384
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That feels marvelous!

385
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, over to the left a bit. Ah, yes.

386
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a breeze l feel? L'm 10 pounds lighter!

387
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm next! - I'm next!

388
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:22,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm next! - I'm next, too!

389
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Looking pretty good, huh? - Sure is.

390
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, there. Are you new to the barn? I'm Wilbur.

391
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, it's me.

392
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? Great name!

393
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:36,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, me. Me! Samuel! The sheep!

394
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:39,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! What happened to you?

395
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world's first pig web! Ta-da!

396
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,773
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you'd better leave the web-spinning to me.

397
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After weeks and weeks,

398
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and l'm talking about some long weeks of waiting and expecting,

399
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:02,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all the hard work has finally paid off.

400
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Look at them! They were eggs,

401
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now they're... They're just... Look at them!

402
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:11,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, Gussy, you did a really terrific job!

403
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't call me Mother Goose for nothing.

404
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:14,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations.

405
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you look at that!

406
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, thank you, thank you!

407
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lt wasn't easy, but l managed.

408
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You managed?

409
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kidding, honey. We managed.

410
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six, seven. Weren't there eight eggs?

411
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could this be a dud?

412
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Golly! Golly!

413
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Golly! - Whoa!

414
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:40,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, there, Father Goose! I'm just trying to help the happy couple.

415
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want with a rotten egg, anyway?

416
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want a rotten egg

417
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the simple reason that... You never know.

418
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one didn't make it.

419
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L think we have to let it go.

420
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, take it!

421
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:59,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And add it to that nasty-asty collection of yours.

422
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:01,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last one out is a rotten egg!

423
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:05,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, l thought it was funny. - I should have pecked him!

424
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you break that egg, rat.

425
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A broken rotten egg would make this barn stink to high heaven.

426
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would be a change.

427
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you laughing, Bits? He just said we stink.

428
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. This is good. This will come in handy.

429
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really are a handsome devil.

430
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:29,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy.

431
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Egg-xactly!

432
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Saw a big old spider in the doorway! Gonna go catch it!

433
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Avery! Come back here!

434
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here, spidey-spidey. - You can't do that!

435
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

436
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gotcha! - No, no, Avery!

437
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, no! Come on, Wilbur, get off!

438
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, Wilbur, why did you do that?

439
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:28,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avery! No!

440
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That stinks!

441
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that is gross.

442
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, is that you?

443
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I smell a smell, though. Think it's scary guy?

444
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's trying to stink us away from the... - Corn!

445
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess the yolk's on me.

446
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is one ripe egg.

447
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That stinks good!

448
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is disgusting!

449
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:17,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We told you not to break that egg. - Now look what you've done, rat!

450
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It saved Charlotte, didn't it?

451
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:22,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, ingrates. I saved the leggy lady's life.

452
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You mean that as a good thing, right? - Of course.

453
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do have a few eyes, you know,

454
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and l think Wilbur did most of the saving.

455
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Ironic, isn't it?

456
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:36,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's saving you, and they're saving him for Christmas.

457
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton!

458
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's Christmas?

459
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The day you'll be cured.

460
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But l'm not sick.

461
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say you were sick.

462
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Uh-oh. That was a mistake. - Yep. Typical rat.

463
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:54,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You're going to lie to the future football here? Okay.

464
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:58,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's a sad statement when l'm the most honest guy in the place.

465
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton, what are you talking about?

466
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come winter, the farmer will be checking you

467
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into the old smokehouse hotel.

468
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:11,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the only checking out that happens is when people gather around and say,

469
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Check out that yummy sausage.

470
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Check out that sizzling bacon."

471
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that's what that is for.

472
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:26,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't for roasting chestnuts.

473
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:31,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wouldn't. Humans love pigs.

474
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:34,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they love pork.

475
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is awkward, isn't it?

476
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:40,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte!

477
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, is it true?

478
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, few spring pigs get to see the snows of winter.

479
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! L can't believe this. L won't believe it.

480
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, Wilbur. - It isn't fair!

481
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:55,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I want to live! L want to see the snow! - And you will.

482
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm making you a promise right now. I am not going to let them kill you.

483
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a spider. You're little. They're huge!

484
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you going to stop them?

485
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L have no idea. But it's a promise,

486
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and promises are something l never break.

487
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't you worry about it, Wilbur.

488
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, it's a long time until Christmas.

489
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Charlotte. If you say so.

490
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad? - Yeah.

491
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:36,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can l walk home? L promised Wilbur l'd be there right away.

492
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sure. That's fine with me. - Thanks.

493
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern, wait!

494
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:44,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go to the Whites' or the Sergeants' today and play?

495
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:46,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Or you could have someone over. - Why?

496
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you're spending too much time in that barn.

497
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It isn't good for you to be alone so much.

498
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alone? All my best friends are there.

499
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Except the rat. - The rat?

500
00:32:57,574 --> 00:33:00,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't call him my friend, but the rest of them are.

501
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They tell the greatest stories. They make me laugh.

502
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And l promised them l'd read 'em this book, so l got to go. Bye!

503
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Dorian, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

504
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To think that animals can actually talk?

505
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Maybe an animal said something to me and l didn't hear it

506
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because l wasn't paying attention.

507
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:24,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe children are just better listeners than we are.

508
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it worries me to no end.

509
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:33,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's got you worried is that her only friends are pigs, sheep, geese and rats.

510
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, not rats.

511
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

512
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Does she look well? - Yes.

513
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Appetite's good?

514
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Does she sleep well at night? - Yes.

515
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, she's right as rain in that way.

516
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there is a name for her condition.

517
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called a childhood phase.

518
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, sadly, it's something she'll grow out of.

519
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, what are you doing?

520
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thinking.

521
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do my best thinking upside down.

522
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blood goes to my head and perks me up.

523
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:18,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L've been thinking, too, you know, about Christmas.

524
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:22,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Wilbur. We'll figure something out.

525
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, lke. Come on.

526
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to be too much trouble,

527
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but have you figured something out?

528
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet, but it's like a web.

529
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make it, you wait, and something always comes.

530
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Charlotte.

531
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Wilbur.

532
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And swing.

533
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And stick.

534
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And loop.

535
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And back up, stick, and...

536
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:47,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Zuckerman!

537
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you gotta come see this.

538
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Homer!

539
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:03,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

540
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's a "so me pig"? - It's "some pig."

541
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a miracle.

542
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing short of a bona fide miracle.

543
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Minister Beecher?

544
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Homer. Edith.

545
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What brings you here?

546
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:13,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Divinity?

547
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We think so.

548
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:36,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd better keep this quiet until l address it in my sermon.

549
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't tell a soul, but you gotta come up to the barn.

550
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:39,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it between me and you.

551
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Swing by the farm. - Okay. Goodbye.

552
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, don't tell nobody. Shouldn't get around.

553
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a word in a spider web at Zuckerman's barn.

554
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:22,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, what does a "some pig" do?

555
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't for what you do. It's for what you are.

556
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:27,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some pigs might smile a bit.

557
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lifting of the head, nice touch!

558
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:02,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As ugly as that spider is, we should have known she was smart.

559
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you don't believe that someone might be smart and pretty?

560
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:08,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Yes! L mean, yes, because you are.

561
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clever little spider, isn't she?

562
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the spider who did this?

563
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:17,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we looked all over and couldn't find one.

564
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks pretty good.

565
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still ain't gonna change anything. He's a goner.

566
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Glad nobody eats cows.

567
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:34,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Got to admit, that's a fine-looking pig. - Yep, that's some pig, all right.

568
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After a few weeks, the phenomenon of the web wore off.

569
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody cared anymore,

570
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and what was amazing yesterday was suddenly ordinary again today.

571
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:58,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looked like Wilbur might not see snow after all.

572
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, but why are we here?

573
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:09,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, yes, barn meeting and so on and so forth. L understand that.

574
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:14,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But must this concern us? And at such an ungodly hour!

575
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:16,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Wilbur's not the only one

576
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:19,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who could end up being Christmas dinner with an apple in his mouth.

577
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good point. Yes. Carry on, then.

578
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:25,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ike, this involves every one of us.

579
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:29,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just have trouble looking at you. That's all.

580
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't about me. It's about Wilbur.

581
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:35,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, for the record, my view of you is not exactly a treat, either.

582
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:40,057
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As we have all seen, humans have very short attention spans,

583
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there's just too much time between now and Christmas.

584
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly enough time for Zuckerman to find his affection for a pig

585
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:47,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}losing out to his hunger for ham.

586
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That spider can talk! - Yeah.

587
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did she say, exactly?

588
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:54,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said the farmer might possibly still slaughter the pig.

589
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, old chap, but it is a common fate for your ilk.

590
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:00,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could just bust through the fence again.

591
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Once was enough for that.

592
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just have to get the right word written.

593
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something that makes Wilbur so special

594
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Zuckerman will never think about killing him again.

595
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need something snappy, like "pig supreme."

596
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds like a dessert.

597
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's the point, anyway? It won't work.

598
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:20,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you please, just once, say something-omething positive?

599
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'm positive it won't work.

600
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about "harmoniously proportioned"?

601
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:30,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Harmoniously proportioned, yes! - Stop that! You're following again.

602
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:33,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, all of you! What's the perfect word for Wilbur?

603
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about "delicious"?

604
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or "nutritious"? Or "extra crispy"?

605
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about...

606
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:44,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you get him? - Yep. Bull's-eye.

607
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about "terrific, terrific, terrific"?

608
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:49,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Much too long, though. L've only got so much web.

609
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But one "terrific" might work.

610
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:56,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It simply isn't true. The pig is not terrific.

611
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at him! He's absolutely average.

612
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:03,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wish to be truthful, then that is the word you should write.

613
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Average."

614
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:08,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, this only works if the word l write is true.

615
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And only you can tell us which word that is.

616
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So look around.

617
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've all gathered around to help you.

618
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now tell everyone how you feel.

619
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:30,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, there's a red one! And a blue one!

620
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avery! You'll never catch me!

621
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to get you!

622
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the fireworks, Mom!

623
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Avery, come on if you ever want to catch me!

624
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:00,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This web thing is really paying off.

625
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Zuckerman!

626
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is, side to side, right in the same place. "Terrific."

627
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:11,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the most amazing thing!

628
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:15,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last time we had hundreds of people. This time it's going to be thousands!

629
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says "terrific" just as clear as day.

630
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}T-E-double-R-l-F-l-C.

631
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:22,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, can you imagine a spider being able to spell that word?

632
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:24,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think l could spell that word till the 10th grade.

633
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fifty cents. - Do you like that one, sir?

634
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's going to be $1.

635
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow! - Gather 'round, folks!

636
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, you saw it right here at Zuckerman's.

637
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, before you leave, don't forget to take some of our berries home with you!

638
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, you think this might work? - Nope.

639
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dare l say it? He looks "terrific."

640
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at them all!

641
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:01,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Smile pretty. I wish geese had teeth.

642
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Been down here since dawn...

643
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you suggesting? That Fern has something to do with all this?

644
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:14,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How else could those words have gotten into that web?

645
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know everyone is saying it's some kind of miracle, but...

646
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what? You don't think it is?

647
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:23,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you?

648
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The web itself is a miracle.

649
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wouldn't you agree?

650
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, can you spin one?

651
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:36,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can crochet a doily. - Because someone taught you how.

652
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody teaches a spider. They just know how to spin a web.

653
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you think that's a miracle?

654
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As summer ended, so did the excitement about the web.

655
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte needed to think of something special.

656
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Special enough to change the way people saw the world,

657
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or at least one pig in the world, anyway.

658
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:06,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truth is, Charlotte feared she would never find a word that could do all that.

659
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she had to hurry. Time was running out for her.

660
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But once a promise is made, it needs to be kept.

661
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Still no web, huh? - Nope.

662
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen one in, l'd say, at least a month.

663
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny how you get used to all those people being around the place.

664
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kind of quiet without them, isn't it?

665
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I noticed the hinge pin's busted on the damper in the smokehouse.

666
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want me to order a new one?

667
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suppose you better. That's a special order.

668
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better get a jump on that if we're going to smoke any ham before the holidays.

669
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We may need another cord of wood, too.

670
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just going to throw this out here one more time. "Pig supreme."

671
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Golly! Now you're just beating a dead horse.

672
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey! - Sorry.

673
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, l don't come across many words in the field,

674
00:46:59,915 --> 00:47:01,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}other than "Hyah!" or "Giddyup!"

675
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that rat's always dragging in trash with writing on it.

676
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L agree.

677
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about time Templeton started pulling his weight around here

678
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}instead of just eating it.

679
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet he could bring us some choice words.

680
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:16,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a choice word for you. A little word called, "Uh-uh."

681
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's two words.

682
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And here's a few more. Negative. No way. Nothing doing.

683
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:24,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't breaking my back to try and save "some pig,"

684
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no matter how "terrific" you think the little lunch meat is.

685
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll sing a different tune when he's gone

686
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and nobody brings around those scrumptious buckets of slop.

687
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And three, two...

688
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cue the rat!

689
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get one thing straight.

690
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care about the pig.

691
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:54,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What l care about is the slop. - Of course.

692
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:58,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And since l'll be at the dump anyway, and it won't take any extra effort,

693
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe, maybe l'll pick something up.

694
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're very kind.

695
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go spreading it around.

696
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What do you want?

697
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll need your strength.

698
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

699
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Dad, l heard them.

700
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard them talking about the smokehouse!

701
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not your pig anymore.

702
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l wouldn't have sold him in the first place

703
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if l knew this is what they were gonna do to him.

707
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got maybe two, three years before she can out-argue me.

708
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then l'm doomed.

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Lewis, can l bring my chickens?

716
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:19,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You certainly can, and l hope you win first prize.

717
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:35,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can he be in every cornfield?

718
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't be the same guy. It can't be!

719
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's wearing the same hat.

720
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:42,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, he is following us!

721
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate that guy.

722
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have got to get some corn, Elwyn!

723
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! All right! All right! This is crazy.

724
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,510

00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:54,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, there's two of us, and there's only one of him.

726
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:57,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, man. He scares me. He really does.

727
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just think about that corn. Corn. - Yeah.

00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, he is good! I bet he's laughing at us.

732
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look at him! Don't even give him the satisfaction.

733
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just think about something else.

734
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Think about something else. - Anything.

735
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think l see a rat.

736
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:29,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's good. - No, really, l see a rat.

737
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:34,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is stealthy. The rat is nimble. The rat is on the... whoa!

738
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is losing his touch.

739
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You want to go mess with him? - Oh, yeah! I've got to peck something.

740
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rat on three.

742
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:57,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat has been spotted!

743
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is not

744
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,253

745
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this for slop?

746
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat is desperate. The rat is trapped.

747
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat needs to stop calling himself "the rat."

748
00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:25,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Find some words." Yeah, right, the rat will never find words!

749
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look. Words.

750
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, is he still in the can? - He's in the can?

751
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:35,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should give him some privacy. Always helps me out.

752
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, genius, not that can.

00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did he go? I can't see him.

754
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All l see is that fruit moving.

00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:44,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What fruit? - The fruit with the tail!

756
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll never get me now.

00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:51,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go get him! - Go get him!

758
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rat rules!

00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're pink! - Hey, what the... Pink?

760
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:18,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's all right, isn't it? I mean, black pretty much goes with everything.

761
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:22,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not all right. That rat is going to pay!

762

00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This might just work. - Might?

764
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, for the love of Lucy!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why not? - Because l'm expecting.

805
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Expecting what?

806
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Expecting" means...

807
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l'm expecting you to do fine without me.

808
00:55:50,412 --> 00:55:54,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're getting to be a big pig, and you'll do just great on your own.

809
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:56,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. L'll miss you.

810
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Homer, up and at 'em.

811
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:08,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the big day.

812
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:13,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fern? - Mom!

813
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:16,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not wearing that.

814
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck is she doing?

815
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:35,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bathed in buttermilk.

816
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had this dream.

817
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got to say he really is some pig.

818
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my buttermilk working.

819
00:56:56,145 --> 00:56:58,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you want to go through with this, Homer?

820
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:00,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you lose, you're out your entry fee.

821
00:57:00,649 --> 00:57:01,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He could win, though.

822
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stranger things have been happening around here.

823
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:05,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he doesn't win, though?

824
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:08,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the way l figure it, even if he does lose,

825
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:11,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}l can make it all back on the bacon alone.

826
00:57:14,196 --> 00:57:15,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur! Wilbur!

827
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:17,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do something, Homer.

828
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened? - I don't know. He just fainted.

829
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:21,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right, hon.

830
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:22,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lurvy, get some water! - It's okay, Wilbur.

831
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:26,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, are you feeling-eeling okay?

832
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:31,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it so hard for that farmer to see what is right in front of his face?

833
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what Wilbur has done for this farm. Isn't that better than ham?

834
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:37,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's only one thing to do, and l have to be there to do it.

835
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:40,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, you have your babies to think about now.

836
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:43,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, l know. But l made a promise to my friend.

837
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:47,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A big blue ribbon ought to finally get the point through that farmer's head.

838
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:49,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Easy, Lurvy. Easy. - Coming through! Coming through!

839
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:51,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go!

840
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There we go. - He's up.

841
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's see if he'll get in the crate.

842
00:57:56,772 --> 00:57:58,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Buttermilk. - Templeton?

843
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to go with me. We'll have to find another word,

844
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a really good one.

845
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, lady.

846
00:58:05,948 --> 00:58:09,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Comes a time when the rat's got to ask himself, "What's in it for the rat?"

847
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's right. We've been to the fair. - We have?

848
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:14,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember? All that garbage there?

849
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:17,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah! Lt's littered with hunks of chewed-on funnel cakes...

850
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that?

851
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:22,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And dribs of ice cream going sour in the sun.

852
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:26,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And spitty little cotton candy bits ground into the mud.

853
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Popcorn, moldy cheese, half-eaten sandwiches

854
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:31,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and sticky-icky-icky candy apples.

855
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Go back to the moldy cheese thing.

856
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:36,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen so much disgusting trash!

857
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

858
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:39,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hurt him, Dad!

859
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nearly made me gag, the stink of it, especially that deviled egg.

860
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:44,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better hurry up, rat. They're gonna leave you!

861
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait for me!

862
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:47,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice and easy. - Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

863
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:50,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More food than you'll see in a lifetime!

864
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye, Aunt Edith! - Bye.

865
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Fern! Bye, Avery! See you at the fair, guys!

866
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:57,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it worked!

867
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we milked it a little there at the end, though.

868
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right, John, l'll see you over there!

869
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:06,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, you're coming with me!

870
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:08,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't miss it for the world.

871
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:09,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for coming.

872
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good luck, Wilbur! Win that ribbon! - Go get 'em, Wilbur!

873
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:17,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to the fair!

874
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going to the fair! Going to the fair!

875
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm going on the bumper cars. - So fun!

876
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sign looks good, Homer. Nice and even.

877
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:46,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, there we go.

878
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go, Wilbur.

879
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, where's the filth?

880
00:59:56,191 --> 00:59:58,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you heard that good things come to those who wait?

881
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, good things come to those who find it and shove it in their mouth.

882
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:11,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't think l don't know, Fern,

883
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we're all here because a determined little girl

884
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:17,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}made a promise to a pig.

885
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wilbur. - Sorry.

886
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean Wilbur.

887
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm proud of you, honey.

888
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

889
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fern? Avery?

890
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to give you each 10 tickets to do as you like out there.

891
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:44,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you have to make them last all day,

892
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so don't go spending them all at once. Okay?

893
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:48,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow! - All right!

894
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll be right back. Okay. - Come on!

895
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to win the prize tomorrow. I know it.

896
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everything will be all right. - Fern, let's go!

897
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

898
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:04,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

899
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:06,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what we're up against?

900
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:18,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. What is your name?

901
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:24,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When someone wants to get your attention,

902
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what is it they call out?

903
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:27,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uncle.

904
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:31,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me, Uncle, what is the date of your birth?

905
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your birthday?

906
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:43,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For heaven's sake, all l want to know is if you're a spring pig.

907
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. What did you think l was? A spring chicken?

908
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:53,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huge and humorous. Aren't we talented!

909
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spring chicken.

910
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:05,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, who are you talking to?

911
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:08,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The pig next door. - Should l be worried?

912
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not. What good would that do?

913
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Have you seen the beast next door?

914
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think his mama was part hippo.

915
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If l had to name five of the fattest pigs l've ever seen,

916
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'd be three of them. He's a shoo-in.

917
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:25,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. That pig is not nearly as handsome as Wilbur,

918
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or as harmoniously proportioned,

919
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and not nearly as clean. - There's a real tiebreaker.

920
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:35,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just have to prove that the finest pig is not necessarily the fattest.

921
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can do your part, Wilbur, by getting some rest.

922
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not tired, Charlotte. - Okay.

923
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, could you excuse me for just a minute, please?

924
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:50,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Templeton, you're right. That pig over there is a shoo-in.

925
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, l need words that are even better than that pig is fat.

926
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Special words, and lots of them.

927
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about "pushy" and "demanding"?

928
01:02:57,906 --> 01:02:59,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton, please!

929
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is our last chance to save Wilbur's life.

930
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do realize l'm just here for the food, right?

931
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

932
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the ride.

933
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, please.

934
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:27,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be in the other pocket. Sorry.

935
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:29,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One second. - All right.

936
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two, please.

937
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that Fern up there?

938
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l'll be.

939
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:07,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's with a boy. - She is! She's with a boy!

940
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:11,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

941
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:14,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's with a boy.

942
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:17,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Manna from heaven!

943
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:27,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what this is, but l love it!

944
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One-stop slopping.

945
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:51,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's go get the spider off my back.

946
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come l'm not in a cornfield, Elwyn? How come?

947
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:58,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. They got all kinds of corn right here.

948
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got your popcorn, caramel corn, candy corn.

949
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop torturing me!

950
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm starving here, and now l'm cross-eyed because of this pink stuff.

951
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If l ever see that rat again...

952
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Words, words, words.

953
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:14,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Pork rinds."

954
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:16,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll draw a crowd.

955
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This looks promising.

956
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! That rat!

957
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:30,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to get me some rat!

958
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:33,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, not these birdbrains.

01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and everything. Rat on three! Three!

961
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait up, Brooksie! L'm coming with you!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come and get me!

964
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:55,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's scary guy! - Abort! Abort!

965
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:58,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peck him! Peck him, Elwyn!

01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:05,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. His eyes are buttons, and his hair is straw.

967
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy ain't real!

01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what this means?

971
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - What?

972
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could've had corn!

973
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:21,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Your Highness, you satisfied or what?

01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:23,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause l've got a spitty hunk of pineapple upside-down cake out there

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did our best.

1006
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get the truck and take him home.

1007
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really thought we had a shot.

1008
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:55,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It'll be okay.

1009
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you. There it is! The web!

1010
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom...

1011
01:09:07,175 --> 01:09:08,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

1012
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:20,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like it's "humble."

1013
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:36,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Thank you. Coming through. Excuse me.

1014
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:39,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Zuckerman! Could you come with me, please?

1015
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, and bring the pig, too.

1016
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Homer.

1017
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:19,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the state of Maine,

1018
01:10:19,681 --> 01:10:22,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it gives us great pleasure to present

1019
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zuckerman's famous pig!

1020
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Folks! Folks!

1021
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:36,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we all remember the start of summer,

1022
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:40,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the writing appeared on the web in Mr. Zuckerman's barn.

1023
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:43,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now it has happened yet again!

1024
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why the governors of the fair

1025
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are honored to present

1026
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this handsome medal.

1027
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A token of our amazement and our appreciation.

1028
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Wilbur.

1029
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what can l say about this pig that hasn't already been said?

1030
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know a lot of you folks have come out to the farm,

1031
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:22,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you've seen the words.

1032
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:26,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of you have asked me, "How could this have happened?"

1033
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1034
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:30,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it has happened

1035
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:36,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a time when we really don't see many miraculous things.

1036
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:38,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or maybe we do.

1037
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:42,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they're all right there around us, every day,

1038
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we just don't know where to look.

1039
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:51,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no denying that our own little Wilbur,

1040
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:55,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's part of something that's bigger than all of us.

1041
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:01,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And life on that farm

1042
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is just a whole lot better with him in it.

1043
01:12:06,254 --> 01:12:09,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He really is some pig.

1044
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:11,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to go, Wilbur!

1045
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte, look how happy she is!

1046
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that great?

1047
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it's wonderful.

1048
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's that?

1049
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my magnum opus.

1050
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a magnet opus?

1051
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:47,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Magnum opus.

1052
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:51,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means "great work." It's a nutrient-filled, waterproof egg sac.

1053
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? There's eggs in there?

1054
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:57,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My babies, 514 of them.

1055
01:12:57,839 --> 01:13:01,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! With 514 baby spiders all over the place,

1056
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's going to be really radiant in the barn!

1057
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, l'm afraid they're not going to make it back to the barn.

1058
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:09,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1059
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

1060
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not going to leave them here alone, are you?

1061
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:16,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no choice. L'm languishing.

1062
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:18,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does that mean?

1063
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means l'm dying.

1064
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:22,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1065
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't die!

1066
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:27,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur, we're born, we live,

1067
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, when our time comes, we die.

1068
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just the natural cycle of life.

1069
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No, just climb down.

1070
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:38,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll carry you the rest of the way.

1071
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:41,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll go back to the barn, and l'll take care of you.

1072
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Wilbur.

1073
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:45,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even have the strength to climb down.

1074
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to.

1075
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:49,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've done so much for me!

1076
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:52,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it was my great pleasure.

1077
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please come down, Charlotte.

1078
01:13:55,029 --> 01:13:57,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. There must be something l can do.

1079
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Wilbur.

1080
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you know what you've already done?

1081
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:02,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made me your friend,

1082
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:07,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, in doing so, you made a spider beautiful to everyone in that barn.

1083
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:12,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do anything, Charlotte. You did it all.

1084
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:16,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. My webs were no miracle, Wilbur.

1085
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:19,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was only describing what l saw.

1086
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The miracle is you.

1087
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton!

1088
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:45,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte is very sick.

1089
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and twisted.

1090
01:14:48,082 --> 01:14:50,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's dying! She can't go home with us.

1091
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:53,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, l need you to help me take her egg sac with us.

1092
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say eggs?

1093
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:57,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an egg sac. And it's right up there,

1094
01:14:57,158 --> 01:14:58,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it has her children in it.

1095
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:02,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And l can't just leave it here. What if something happened to them?

1096
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, l can't reach it, so l need you to get it for me.

1097
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And l need you to do it now.

1098
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think l like your tone.

1099
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:12,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't you just once in your life think of someone other than yourself?

1100
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,931


1101
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1102
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:18,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you come on!

1103
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:21,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who got his hindquarters pecked to make you "radiant," huh?

1104
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:22,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton, that's who.

1105
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:26,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who interrupted the gorging of a lifetime so you could be "humble"?

1106
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, l think it was Templeton!

1107
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:33,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton! Templeton! Templeton!

1108
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And do l get thanked?

1109
01:15:36,664 --> 01:15:37,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1110
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:39,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, has it ever occurred to you

1111
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that even a rat might like a little appreciation?

1112
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:46,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little, dare l say, love?

1113
01:15:46,674 --> 01:15:49,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it and you'll get dibs on my slop for the rest of my life.

1114
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done.

1115
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,044
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry! Up in the corner on the ledge.

1116
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:07,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Templeton!

1117
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:15,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1118
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Templeton,

1119
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:29,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for everything.

1120
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, just drop it. Hurry!

1121
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:47,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go. Here's your medal.

1122
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- In you go. - Time to go home, Wilbur.

1123
01:16:50,938 --> 01:16:53,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Close her up, Lurvy.

1124
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:56,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, easy now.

1125
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:11,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye,

1126
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:14,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my sweet, sweet Wilbur.

1127
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:19,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Charlotte.

1128
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

1129
01:18:08,883 --> 01:18:12,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that our lovely-ovely-ovely little Wilbur?

1130
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:14,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And he's got a medal! - Strong work, kid.

1131
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He looks so grown up.

1132
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I always knew he could do it. - Never had a doubt.

1133
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome home, Wilbur.

1134
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:24,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilbur?

1135
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Charlotte?

1136
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a bad feeling, Bits.

1137
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:29,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me, too.

1138
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:30,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that isn't to say Charlotte was gone forever.

1139
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She lived on in the hearts of those that knew her,

1140
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and even those that didn't.

1141
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something had changed in Somerset County.

1142
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:44,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was as if people knew they lived in a special place now.

1143
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, in small ways, they started being special people,

1144
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a little bit kinder,

1145
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a bit more understanding.

1146
01:19:55,122 --> 01:19:57,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the animals felt different, too.

1147
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Closer.

1148
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:04,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warmth of their friendship carried them through the long, cold months.

1149
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They showed it in little gestures of kindness,

1150
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unusual patience,

1151
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and promises kept.

1152
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:18,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the hardest of hearts found themselves rising to the occasion.

1153
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:30,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, finally, the greatest promise of all,

1154
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:34,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a spring pig saw his first snowfall.

1155
01:20:36,297 --> 01:20:39,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was as though Charlotte herself had shaken it out of the sky.

1156
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:15,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The stillness of winter continued to the first thaw, like it always does.

1157
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:19,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, the first buds of spring.

1158
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:26,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, before you knew it, life had come full circle.

1159
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:43,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're here! They're here!

1160
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're here, everybody!

1161
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, there. L'm Wilbur. L'm a friend of your mom's.

1162
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:52,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy, are we glad to see you!

1163
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:58,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So creepy!

1164
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:00,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And cute! Just like their mother.

1165
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:02,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're so, so beautiful.

1166
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:07,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to scoop them up and hug them all.

1167
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, you can fly!

1168
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:11,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you go!

1169
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that is something to follow.

1170
01:22:31,946 --> 01:22:35,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, little spiders! Be free! L wish l could.

1171
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:39,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kidding, honey. I think l got one inside my beak.

1172
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:43,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks, baby. - That's my Golly-olly-olly.

1173
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:45,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

1174
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:47,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L can't believe they're really here.

1175
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:50,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So pretty. - Yeah, Bits.

1176
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:53,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You doing okay over there, lke?

1177
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay with it. L'm okay with it, Bets.

1178
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay with it.

1179
01:22:59,373 --> 01:23:02,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spiders are nice. Spiders are my friend.

1180
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spiders won't hurt me.

1181
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:17,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! What's happening? What are you doing?

1182
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye! - Bye!

1183
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:20,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't go.

1184
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Goodbye! Bye! - Wait! Wait!

1185
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye!

1186
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:29,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

1187
01:23:30,137 --> 01:23:31,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're setting forth.

1188
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:35,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We take to the breeze. We go as we please.

1189
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:37,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We take to the breeze!

1190
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:38,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye!

1191
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:40,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can't go!

1192
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had so much l wanted to tell you!

1193
01:23:45,219 --> 01:23:47,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And someone l wanted to tell you about.

1194
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salutations!

1195
01:23:58,032 --> 01:23:59,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who said that? - I'm up here.

1196
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So am I. - Me, too.

1197
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:05,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'd like to stay. - We like it here.

1198
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we like you, too.

1199
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:12,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're staying? Oh, that's great! That's really, really great!

1200
01:24:12,913 --> 01:24:15,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three friends! What are your names?

1201
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:19,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you my name if you'll tell me why you're trembling.

1202
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, l think l'm trembling with joy.

1203
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:25,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Then my name is Joy. - Joy? Perfect.

1204
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was my mom's middle initial? - A.

1205
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:30,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then my name is Aranea.

1208
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something sensible. Not too long, not too fancy.

1209
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:41,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And not too dumb.

1210
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:43,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tricky. How about

1211
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:45,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nellie?

1212

1214

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have chosen a hallowed doorway in which to spin your webs.

1215
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was your mother's doorway.

1216
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:01,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was loyal, brilliant, beautiful,

1217
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:03,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she was my friend.

1218
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:06,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will treasure her memory forever.

1219
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, to you, her daughters, l pledge my friendship.

1220
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:12,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pledge mine!

1221
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I do, too! - So do I!

1222
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:28,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, l'd like to make a couple of announcements.

1223
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First of all,

1224
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:31,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you gals are word-lovers,

1225
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:34,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you need a few scraps of paper for inspiration,

1226
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't look at me.

1227
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My word-fetching days are over.

1228
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:44,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not the rat l used to be. L'm at least twice that.

1229
01:25:45,105 --> 01:25:48,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, if you need something to write, try this,

1230
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:51,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Some rat." Some rat.

1231
01:25:51,478 --> 01:25:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about it.

1232
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slops! Oh, yeah!

1233
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:02,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, in an ordinary barn,

1234
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an ordinary pig, a runt no less,

1235
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:09,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stood surrounded by friends,

1236
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}welcoming his second spring.

1237
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:19,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that spring was followed by many, many more.

1238
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All because someone stopped to see the grace

1239
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:27,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and beauty and nobility of the humblest creature.

1240
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the miracle of friendship.

1241
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:35,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is not often that someone comes along

1242
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who is a true friend and a good writer.

1243
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charlotte was both.
