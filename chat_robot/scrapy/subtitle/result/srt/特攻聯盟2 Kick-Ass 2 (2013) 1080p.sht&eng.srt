1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A handgun bullet travels at more than 700 miles per hour.

2
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, whoa. Absolutely not. No.

3
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, if you don't wanna do it, you don't have to do it.

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. Good, I don't wanna do it.

5
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fine.

6
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Goddamn! I'm alive.

7
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh!

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, that's amazing!

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know, right. So...

10
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hmm.

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ready to go again?

12
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Absolutely not.

13
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fine.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't just say "fine" and then shoot me in the chest.

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}'Cause it's not cool.

16
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Like at all.

17
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. Jeez.

18
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I always wondered why no one tried to be a superhero before me.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It turns out somebody had. Mindy Macready.

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}After her dad died,

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}his old partner on the force, Marcus, became her guardian.

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing?     -Nice backpack.

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Thanks.

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Steal it from a six year old?

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Marcus dropped her off every day.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But as soon as he was gone, so was she.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No one at school found out

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}because she hacked into the server

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and gave herself the award for perfect attendance.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hit Girl and Big Daddy had been the real deal.

31
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy was gonna keep wearing the mask

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}as long as there were criminals to take down.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But no matter how many drug dealers she stopped,

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}she couldn't stop feeling alone.

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Me? I'd given up being a superhero

36
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}because it was way too dangerous.

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Only problem, I was dying of boredom.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Like most high school seniors,

39
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hell, I didn't know what channel I wanted to watch.

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's just TV, Dave, not peace in the Middle East.

42
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My best friends Todd and Marty

43
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}had no clue I was the first superhero to go public.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You guys watch Spider-Man last night?

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is it weird that Aunt May gets me kinda hard?

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not if you're a granny-slammer.

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They may wear costumes, but it isn't Halloween.

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They're real life superheroes,

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and in the two years since the first ordinary citizens

50
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}donned capes and masks,

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}the movement has started to spread.

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I became a superhero because of Kick-Ass.

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, you just come home from work,

54
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you grab your gear and you go out on patrol.

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Help us make the streets safe.

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I inspired all those people to get off their asses,

57
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and now I was stuck on mine.

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So that night after dinner,

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,390
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I decided to get my old costume out.

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Sorry.     -Whoa! Can't you knock?

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You know, buddy, it's perfectly normal for you to touch yourself...

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, Jesus, Dad. Get out!

63
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If I was even thinking about a Kick-Ass sequel,

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I had to get serious.

65
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey. Hey, can we chat?

66
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Please, Mindy?

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get in the cab. Meter's running.

68
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wanna team up like Batman and Robin.

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Nobody wants to be Robin.

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's wrong with Robin?

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Weren't you like Big Daddy's Robin?

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Robin wishes he was me.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What I'm trying to say is we should be partners,

74
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you and me, like the dynamic duo.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm in the NFL, Dave. You play pee-wee.

76
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So? Train me.

77
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wanna walk the walk,

78
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and you're the closest thing I know to a real superhero.

79
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Aren't you tired of being on your own?

80
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't you wanna know someone's there for you?

81
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Someone who's got your back?

82
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And you'll do anything I say?

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Anything.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hit me.

85
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're a 15-year-old girl.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell?

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Act like a bitch, get slapped like a bitch.

88
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, goddamn.

89
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy beat me like morning wood

90
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}every day for three weeks.

91
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on. Guard up! Left, right, guard up!

92
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Even with my damaged nerve endings,

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}it hurt like hell.

94
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But, in a weird way, I kinda liked it.

95
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It gave me a sense of purpose.

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-What happened to your face?     -Nothing.

97
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Like we were driving towards something.

98
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Goddamn!

99
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh! Oh, that's amazing!

100
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All the other people putting on masks were just playing superhero.

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We were training to really do it.

102
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I couldn't tell my girlfriend Katie, or Marty and Todd.

103
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But I didn't care. We were having too much fun.

104
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Left, right, left!

105
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Our own superhero team.

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It was gonna be balls.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell, Mom? Did you delete the news off the DVR?

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yes. Yes, I did, Christopher.

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That was the one with Kick-Ass.

110
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, Christopher, you've gotta stop obsessing over this superhero.

111
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He is not a superhero, Mom, he's a murderer.

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He blew up Dad with a bazooka, for fuck's sake!

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your father died in a fire.

114
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A fire? What is your problem?

115
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You! You are my problem!

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I am trying to raise you to be a normal boy!

117
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's why we moved to Long Island after your father's accident.

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A bazooka is not an accident,

119
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you delusional bitch!

120
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This conversation is over.

121
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Great. Then I'm leaving.

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, Javier, be cool.

123
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Sorry, Chris, but your mom pays me not to be cool.

124
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I hate you! You home-school me like I'm a prisoner!

125
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You threw away my Red Mist costume.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}God! I am not the problem! You are!

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wish you were dead!

128
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mommy?

129
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't touch that.

130
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, I'm sorry. What is it?

131
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's a last resort. Like if all else fails and you're about to die.

132
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you not scared to die?

133
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you scared you're never gonna grow into your big boy pants?

134
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm serious.

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What if Spider-Man or Batman got killed one night? It could happen.

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If you're scared of dying, one thing is certain,

137
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you are going to die.

138
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My daddy was never afraid of dying.

139
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look where that got him.

140
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He knew he might have to make the ultimate sacrifice one day.

141
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And that's why he made me promise

142
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'd never stop defending this city.

143
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Cross my heart,

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}hope to die.

145
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your dad was insane. You know that, right?

146
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're wrong, Dave.

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My daddy was the first real superhero,

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}not you or Red Mist. It was my daddy,

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and it was an honor to serve by his side.

150
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, Min, how was school?

151
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Super crazy.

152
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Miss Mullins was out today, so we had Mr. Cooper teaching us biology,

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}such a grump.

154
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, really? That's weird because Principal Himoff called me yesterday.

155
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You were supposed to get an award for perfect attendance,

156
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but you didn't attend.

157
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I followed you this morning. Saw you get into a cab with some boy,

158
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and I lost you guys over the bridge.

159
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So now you wanna tell me where you really were today?

160
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm really sorry, Marcus. I didn't wanna make you mad.

161
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Cut the waterworks, Min. You're 15, not five.

162
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay.

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, he asked me to cut class and go to the mall.

164
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So, yeah, yeah, I did.

165
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This has nothing to do with you being Hit Girl?

166
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not gonna find any ninja blades or throwing stars under your bed?

167
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No. I just wanted him to like me. Okay?

168
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Sweetie, no skipping school's not away to get boys to like you.

169
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-I'm so stupid.     -Hey, hey.

170
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're one of the smartest little girls I know. Let's go get some pizza.

171
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What, you mean I'm not grounded?

172
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, just consider this awarning.

173
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, you sure you wanna give all your mom's things away?

174
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell am I supposed to do with all her stuff?

175
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Damn, she had a nice pair of guns.

176
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dude, she's dead! Don't talk about her tits.

177
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I was talking about these.

178
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, those. Those were my dad's.

179
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why don't you keep them?

180
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you sure?

181
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah. I mean, they belong to you, right?

182
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, Chris. You're your own man now.

183
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Just be careful, all right?     -Yeah.

184
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa!

185
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Definitely don't wanna keep those!

186
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll take care of it.

187
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You take the day off. Later.

188
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey.

189
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So, are you ready for your first field test?

190
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What am I supposed to do with these?

191
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Put them on and, uh, go fishing.

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm the whitest pimp ever.

193
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's the idea. Take the next right.

194
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Comes out on Flatbush.

195
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You sure I should be doing this without my gear?

196
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's the point.

197
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Kick-Ass isn't a costume. Kick-Ass is who you really are.

198
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave Lizewski is the mask.

199
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, my "mask" is about to get his teeth kicked in.

200
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, queer bait, where are you going with those bags, man?

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Tell him you're on your way to fuck his mother with a 12-inch strap on.

202
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm just taking a walk.

203
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This really isn't what I do. I usually just call the cops.

204
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who are you talking to, man?

205
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh, I'm just on a call. It was...

206
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You know, service round here, it sucks, man.

207
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now give me the bags, faggot,

208
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}before I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

209
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, Okay.

211
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can you believe I let Mindy beat the snot out of me for weeks

212
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}just so I could get my ass kicked again?

213
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So much for a team.

214
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You ready to die? You faggot!

215
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You know, all that homophobic shit makes you sound super gay.

216
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, man. Come on.

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If I ever catch you robbing again, shit-burger,

218
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on your ass and cut your hand off.

219
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Promise me you're done with your life of crime.

220
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I promise.

221
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pants on fire.

222
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-What do you think?     -I think you almost got me killed!

223
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No. What do you think of my line?

224
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"Pants on fire." I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Run! I'll tell them you saved me. Go!

226
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Female suspect fleeing Flatbush.

227
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Under 5 feet. Masked. Armed with nunchucks and a sword.

228
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Hey, Min.     -Hey, Marcus. What's up?

229
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I see you answered your phone.

230
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That means you're not in school.

231
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I was,

232
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but I wasn't feeling so good, and so the nurse decided to send me home.

233
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Poor thing. Well, I'm almost home.

234
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll make soup and we can watch Jeopardy!

235
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All righty. I'll see you soon, okay?

236
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right.

237
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shit!

238
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You got my soup?

239
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let me take your temperature first.

240
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, you're really clammy.

241
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll feel better after a nap-nap.

242
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Close your eyes. I'm gonna get you that soup.

243
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is that blood?

244
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Damn it, Mindy. I can't do this anymore.

245
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your father was like a brother to me.

246
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He was a great cop and a hero.

247
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But Big Daddy? That was not your father, okay?

248
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That was someone who robbed you of your childhood.

249
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And this?

250
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hit Girl? That's not who you are.

251
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You are Mindy Macready and you're just starting high school.

252
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I understand that you don't know who that person is yet,

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but you will, you've just gotta try.

254
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't want to.

255
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You don't know what you want.

256
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can't. You're not an adult, not yet.

257
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years than most adults have in their lifetime.

258
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That note that your father gave you,

259
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}the one that you were supposed to open if anything ever happened.

260
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What did it say?

261
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That you would take care of me.

262
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And that you were supposed to listen to me, right?

263
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, listen up.

264
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I want you in school. I want you to stop talking to that boy.

265
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And I want you to promise me

266
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}that this is never gonna happen again.

267
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Cross my heart,

268
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}hope to die.

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good.

270
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy!

271
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell?

272
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}First you almost get me killed, then you stand me up.

273
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, I'm sorry.

274
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, I... you are?

275
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I am.

276
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}For everything.

277
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, okay, great.

278
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, "apologetic" isn't a word I'd use to describe you.

279
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}How many times do I have to say it?

280
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, let's get out of here.

281
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You gotta ease up. I think I might have broken a rib.

282
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, I'm done.

283
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}With training?

284
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}With everything.

285
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wait, you mean everything?

286
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can't. You're Hit Girl.

287
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We were gonna start a team, you can't just quit.

288
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is who you are.

289
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not anymore, Dave.

290
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry, but it's over. I'm done.

291
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She just broke up with him?

292
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just leave me alone.

293
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Will you stop apologizing?

294
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know what's worse, that you're fucking a 9th-grader

295
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-or that you just got dumped by one.     -Whoa, whoa!

296
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pedophile freak.

297
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's not like that.

298
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Then what is it like? Please, tell me.

299
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I can't. It's to do with the Kick-Ass thing.

300
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I've got a secret for you. You remember Malik?

301
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dude who volunteers at your needle exchange?

302
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}His baton is so much bigger than Kick-Ass'.

303
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-No.     -Yeah.

304
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And by "baton," I mean penis.

305
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

306
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

307
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A freshman, Dave? You old, salty dog.

308
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's the problem? Grass on the field, play ball. Right?

309
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, Todd.

310
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, your tutor's here.

311
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris!

312
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, your...

313
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Holy shit. What the hell is that?

314
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My destiny.

315
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, just because your mom liked to get a little freaky now.

316
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know what my role is in this, Javier.

317
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My dad was a crime boss, so it just makes sense.

318
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm a supervillain. It's evolution.

319
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, come on.

320
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just put those things down before you hurt somebody, Chris.

321
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's not my name.

322
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, okay. Uh, Red Mist...

323
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Red Mist was my superhero name.

324
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Henceforth I'll be known as

325
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The Motherfucker.

326
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}After Mindy quit,

327
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I decided to stop hitting the heavy bag and start hitting the streets.

328
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, Kick-Ass, welcome back!

329
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Yeah!     -Whoo!

330
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're the best, man!

331
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Only problem, I was still on my own.

332
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So I went online and found a physics professor

333
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}calling himself "Dr. Gravity."

334
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl, but I had to start somewhere.

335
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is the zero G device that I invented.

336
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can levitate any object up to a ton.

337
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}For real?

338
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hell, no, man. This is a baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

339
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But it fooled you.

340
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, could I get a Diet Mountain Dew, please?

341
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not even a physics professor.

342
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just a copywriter for an ad agency.

343
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But that's why I love this stuff.

344
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can be anyone you want!

345
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You done many team-ups before?

346
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Kind of. Yeah. No, not really.

347
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I was getting kinda nervous about being on my own, you know?

348
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, me, too. I never even been in a fight.

349
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, hopefully you won't have to.

350
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I friended a guy talking about forming a team, if you're interested.

351
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know how serious he is,

352
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but his picture was pretty hard core.

353
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you kidding me? That's why I contacted you.

354
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I didn't wanna freak you out by bringing it up too soon.

355
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll show you his profile after I hit the men's room.

356
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your Uncle Ralph's not gonna be happy about this, Chris.

357
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's not my name.

358
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not calling you that, forget it.

359
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Javier, you worked for my dad.

360
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Then you worked for my mom. Now you work for me.

361
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm probably the richest kid in New York City.

362
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But if you don't like that, find yourself another motherfucking job, okay?

363
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yo, Kick-Ass!

364
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Man, am I glad to see you.

365
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is there anything I can do to help, sir?

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah. I was hoping you can help me get a million hits on YouTube.

367
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on. Come on.

368
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Run, Kick-Ass, run!

369
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Jersey Shore motherfucker!

370
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, what, you not interested in a fair fight?

371
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That is no fair fight. Team meeting tomorrow.

372
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll e-mail you the address.

373
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Beware Dr. Gravity!

374
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You had to admire the Doctor's enthusiasm.

375
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I couldn't wait to meet his friends.

376
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

377
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,270

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shut up and just get on the ground!

383
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And you'd better tell people The Motherfucker was here.

384
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's wrong with you, boy?

385

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get on the floor, too, Gandalf,

386
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}or I will bust a cap in your ass.

387
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're gonna bust your own face when that gun kicks if you don't hold it properly.

388
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just get on the ground!

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I told you.

391
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Go! Go, go, go!

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They will know The Motherfucker's name!

398

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You've gotta find me some bad-ass MMA types to train me, okay?

399

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Like a Chuck Liddell or whoever.

400

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fuck, I don't care how much it costs.

401

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I just wanna be able to kill Kick-Ass with my bare hands.

402

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I gotta tweet about this.

403
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right. Are you ready?

404
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Um, I don't know. Am I?

405
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yes, you are. You look great.

406
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And Barbara's daughter, Brooke, is really nice.

407
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What am I supposed to talk to them about?

408
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'd rather be water-boarded than listen to Justin Bieber.

409
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-You're gonna be fine.     -I'm gonna be a disaster.

410
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}How do you know that?

411
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because it's a slumber party, for fuck's sake.

412
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dollar. Jar.

413
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're gonna need a bigger jar.

414
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pretty cool, huh? This is how the beer gets delivered.

415
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dude. You got a secret elevator to your underground headquarters.

416

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's like a real-life bat-cave.

418
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-I know, right.     -Oh, yeah.

419

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Say "hey" to Mindy, ladies.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're that freshman who took a ride on Dave Lizewski's disco stick.

431
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I did not ride his...

432
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If you just blew him, you're totes a virgin, right?

433
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She didn't blow him, look at her.

434
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Then what? Rim job? Hand job? Fingerbang?

435
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Sweet-Ryan-Seacrest, you at least kissed him, right?

436
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Totes.

437
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You've never kissed a boy, have you?

438
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God, that is so adorable.

439
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe she's a dyke.

440
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe I'll jam my foot up your snatch.

441
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, she's super bitchy, I likes.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Then what's the big deal anyway?

443
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What could be so great about gagging on some douche-bag's tongue?

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Twilight. Channing Tatum. Union J.

470
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's biology, bitch. Don't fight it.

471
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I, um...

472
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I gotta go.

473
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But we were gonna go and get high on bath salts at Logan's house.

474
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:52,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy, I wanna give you a chance that the rest of the girls in our class would kill for.

475
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't you wanna walk out the door every day in skin-tight clothes

476
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}knowing that everyone worships you?

477
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't you wanna sneak out at night, raise a little hell,

478
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and show the world what a strong,

479
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}independent woman is capable of?

480
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't you wanna belong?

481
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,330
{\fn微軟正黑體\fs12\1c&H000000&\3c&HFFAAFF&\4c&HFF00FF&\blur3}♬ So you know that I'll carry you ♬

482
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can I wear this to Logan's?

483
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yay!

484
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's gonna be so much fun.

485
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So we tried the cops and tried the newspapers,

486
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and even set up a, you know, a thing on the Internet

487
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}for people to help us find Tommy.

488
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Um...

489
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But we got nothing. We never saw our son again.

490
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I came up with the name Remembering Tommy,

491
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and, uh, we've been doing this three nights a week. So...

492
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Colonel Stars and Stripes found us online.

493
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's terrible, guys. I'm real sorry.

494
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I became Night Bitch after my sister was murdered

495
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and found in a dumpster.

496
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Holy shit.

497
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Doesn't bring her back,

498
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but at least I'm doing something positive about it.

499
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Insect Man.     -Yeah, um...

500
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I've been bullied my whole life for being gay,

501
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}so now I stand up for the defenseless.

502
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's why I don't wear a mask.

503
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Too much like being back in the closet.

504
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Long as your heart's in the right place,

505
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}we don't care what you put in your mouth.

506
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Fist bump.     -Thank you. Thank you, sir.

507
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, I became Battle Guy,

508
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}after my parents were mugged and killed coming home from the opera.

509
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did I tell you that sick bastard,

510
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}maxed out their credit cards on porno sites?

511
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I hope we get the chance to say hello to this guy someday,

512
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}so I can personally levitate his soul from his body.

513
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God. Marty?

514
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I knew I recognized your voice.

515
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, I don't know what you're talking about.

516
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know no Marty. New guy.

517
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, asshole, it's me, Dave.

518
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave? Why are you dressed like Kick-Ass?

519
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because I'm Kick-Ass.

520
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You two know each other?

521
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, like since we were five.

522
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's all this bullshit about your parents getting killed?

523
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Yeesh, language.     -What?

524
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Battle Guy, care to update your resume?

525
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh...

526
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm trying to figure out how to explain this,

527
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}without sounding like a complete idiot right now.

528
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I'm not sure that's possible, Batman.

529
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not, either.

530
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Um...

531
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. Well, when I found you guys online,

532
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you were all swapping these awesome origin stories.

533
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, Colonel, you're ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.

534
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yo. Don't take the Lord's name in vain.

535
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry.

536
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I didn't think you'd let me join the team,

537
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}unless I had a good story, too.

538
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right, we'll let you off the hook this time, Battle Guy.

539
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Wanna see something cool?     -Yeah.

540
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I thought this could be our meeting room.

541
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, this is so cool.

542
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now this little renovation was totally clandestine,

543
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}which means nobody knew about it.

544
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now, I know it's not much, but this is just the beginning.

545
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Together we can make a real difference.

546
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa!

547
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If you'd consider it, Kick-Ass,

548
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}we'd be honored to have you join us.

549
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hell, yeah!

550
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's what I like to hear.

551
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Right, time for initiation.

552
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Turn around and I'll unzip you.

553
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry, what?

554
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just joking. Let's get down to business.

555
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Gotcha.

556
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There you are.

557
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We saved you a seat in the caf,

558
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but you never showed.

559
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I usually head over to the Olive Garden to carb load.

560
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I haven't had white sugar since my first birthday.

561
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do we need a thintervention?

562
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,010

568
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Nothing.

569
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Nothing?     -Yeah, Todd, nothing.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just one of the dickheads that follows The Motherfucker on Twitter.

575
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,780

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wouldn't take his money if I didn't.

584
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}MMA is like chess.

585
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's all about the moves.

586
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And your boy really knows his stuff.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Time to die, asshole.

588
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-You all right?     -I'm cool. Ow!

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, yeah, let's take a break, guys. Come on.

595
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Street rules, bitch!

596
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chuck! Get this girl off me!

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing, man?

598
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You all right, Chris? You all right, buddy?

599
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get off me! I was winning.

600
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, you were crying.

601
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You know what? Screw this. My super power

602
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}is that I'm rich as shit.

603
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, you wanna work for me, huh?

604
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna beat people up for me?

605
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Sure.     -All right!

606
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's get you a mask and a costume,

607
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and we will call you Black Death.

608
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, whoa, you don't think that's just a little bit incredibly racist?

609
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't give a shit.

610
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I want you to put the word out,

611
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}that I'm willing to pay top dollar, for every hired hitter in town.

612
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, come on. Just talk about it first.

613
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Money talks.

614
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanted me to be my own man.

615
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is what it looks like.

616
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-All right, all right, I'll make some calls.     -Yes!

617
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Anybody else wanna be a supervillain?

618
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Promise I pay better than Chuck-little-dick-Liddell.

619
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}- What did you call me?  - No, no, man.

620
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He took a hit to the head. Doesn't know what he's saying.

621
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I've been studying privately with Coach Podell.

622
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And by studying,

623
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean my mom paid her off to make me varsity.

624
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So, if you're half decent, I'll make sure she puts you on the team.

625
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}At least as an alternate.

626
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You'd do that for me?

627
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Besties stick together.

628
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If Brooke wants a pet, she should just get a dog.

629
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She's just trying to recreate Mindy in her own image.

630
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right, ladies, have a seat. Let's get started.

631
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy Macready?

632
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chill. As long as you don't fall on your face, you're in.

633
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Go.

634
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Four attackers.

635
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No escape.

636
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God. You could totally make captain.

637
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That was so much better than Brooke's.

638
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God.

639
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Brooke doesn't stand a chance for captain after that.

640
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A bunch of people with made-up names,

641
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}standing around in homemade costumes,

642
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}searching the web for unsolved crimes.

643
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The comic book heroes all have billion-dollar bases

644
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and headquarters on the moon, but this is the real world.

645
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Scales, like a red, white and blue.     -It's awesome.

646
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}- What's that?  - Brick.

647
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Right.

648
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-What do you think?     -I think it does the job.

649
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}People should get what they deserve.

650
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Family living in the street deserves a hot meal.

651
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}An inebriated college girl deserves to make it home safe at night.

652
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And a pervert, pedophile,

653
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}deserves a visit from Eisenhower.

654

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Schwantz!

655

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ouch.

656
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You don't wanna hit with your closed fist.

657
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You might break your hand, then you're defenseless.

658
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna hit with open palm and pivot. Open palm and pivot.

659
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Grab the back...

660
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I never made varsity football,

661
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}or got cast in the school play.

662
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hell, I never even made honor roll.

663
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Knock out, bitch!

664
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But if I had,

665
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I gotta believe it would've felt a lot like this.

666
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}When the cops can no longer protect and serve,

667
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}be warned, mugger, heads up, perv.

668
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We got the strength, we got the nerve,

669
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}to give those in need what they deserve!

670
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Justice Forever!

671
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We were in the ultimate clique.

672
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It didn't matter that no one else knew.

673
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We knew. And we felt like rock stars.

674
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Good night, guys.     -Nice job. Battle Guy.

675
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Night, Colonel. Thanks for everything.

676
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, son, thank you.

677
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You showed us that every man can make a difference.

678
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Without Kick-Ass, none of us would be here.

679
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's from the heart. Don't let it go to your head.

680
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So...

681
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not really that tired.

682
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mmm.

683
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mmm-mmm?

684
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mmm. Okay.

685
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's leave the masks on.

686
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Yeah?     -Yeah.

687
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah!

688
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}First big mission's tonight,

689
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and it's not community service.

690
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're taking on some real bad guys.

691
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What, can't your team handle it?

692
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They're not you, Mindy.

693
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Remembering Tommy owns a dry fruit business.

694
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Night Bitch teaches ballet.

695
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Night Bitch? What is she?

696
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A superhero or a soft core porno?

697
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe a little bit of both.

698
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, God, you're plugging her?

699
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm gonna vom.

700
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're like a ninja.

701
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can't you just sneak out after Marcus goes to sleep?

702
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You don't get it, Dave.

703
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I made a promise to Marcus.

704
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So break it. You're a superhero, remember?

705
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy Macready's just a disguise.

706
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, well, I don't know what kind of superhero Night Whore is,

707
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but if you really think I'd ever break my word,

708
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you obviously have no idea who I am.

709
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know that making dance team doesn't make you stop being who you are.

710
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know Hit Girl couldn't give a shit,

711
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}about what high school girls are into.

712
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know that you wouldn't go on a date if your life depended on it.

713
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Go to hell, Dave.

714
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What? You know I'm right.

715
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey! Roid Rage.

716
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Me?     -Yeah.

717
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna take me on a date sometime?

718
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh, yeah. Sure. Um...

719
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My name's, um, Simon.

720
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Great, um, Simon.

721
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's a date.

722
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy, I'm sorry.

723
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is there a problem, Min?

724
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Zero.

725
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good. Because I don't like problems.

726
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, you been sneaking out at night?

727
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mrs. Neipert said, she thought she saw you leaving at 2:00 in the morning.

728
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

729
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She tried to teach her dog Spanish.

730
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you on drugs?

731
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Seriously?

732
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I gotta ask.

733
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're my best bud and you're growing up so fast.

734
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Promise me you're not doing anything foolish?

735
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I promise.

736
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good enough for me, pal.

737
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're too smart to do anything stupid.

738
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Justice Forever!

739
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm glad you got that out of your system.

740
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, Todd texted me. Again. What a loser.

741
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dude, how bad-ass is Colonel Stars and Stripes?

742
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I still can't believe he's an ex-mob enforcer.

743
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, how do you go from that to being a superhero?

744
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He's a born-again Christian.

745
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Shut up.     -Yeah.

746
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's hope he can handle tonight.

747
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I guess we're about to find out.

748
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey. Where's the rest of the team?

749
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dr. Gravity has the flu,

750
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and Remembering Tommy got Book of Mormon tickets, so...

751
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's okay.

752
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Five of us should do.

753
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}How did you say this guy made his money, sir? Prostitution?

754
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not just girls. Kids. Ships them in from villages back home.

755
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Boneheads in blue take a blind eye.

756
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}How do you know he's here tonight?

757
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because Thursday night is poker night.

758
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Same five low-lifes every week.

759
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Man with a habit ain't hard to find.

760
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So what's the plan? Are we sneaking in?

761
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I thought we'd knock. It's more polite.

762
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What?

763
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Stay frosty, team.

764
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I used to eat punks like this for breakfast.

765
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Jehovah's witness!

766
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry, I just zoned out for a second.

767
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did you say that we're going up against five gangsters?

768
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And bouncer makes six.

769
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And three-quarters.

770
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the fuck do you want?

771
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good evening, young man. We'd like a word with Jimmy Kim.

772
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If it's not too inconvenient.

773
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get the fuck out of here before I tear your head off, you old fuck.

774
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry.

775
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I think we're in trouble.

776
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I just don't understand why people feel the need, to use that kind of language.

777
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa!

778
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There he goes.

779
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, sweet Jesus.

780
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:09,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Battle Guy, what did I tell you about taking the Lord's name in vain?

781
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Sorry, sir.

782
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Eisenhower, at the ready.

783
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Insect Man, I want you right behind me.

784
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Everybody else spread out, catch the strays.

785
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh.

786
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And try to have fun,

787
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}otherwise what's the point?

788
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Nice party. Anybody wanna dance?

789
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Where are you going?

790
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Very nice.     -Behind you!

791
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Watch the birdie.

792
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoo!

793
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't you move.

794
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Night Bitch! Behind you!

795
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wait.

796
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look out!

797
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, I got his right arm.

798
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You know, you shouldn't talk with your mouth full.

799
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's very rude. Come on.

800
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who the hell are you?

801
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're the good guys.

802
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, no, you're the fucking dead guys.

803
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Eisenhower! Schwantz!

804
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh!

805
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ow!

806
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Where are the girls?

807
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, man. I've got a heart problem.

808
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, yeah?

809
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No.

810
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do you want me to solve that for you?

811
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, whoa!

812
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. The girls are upstairs in the apartments.

813
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My little brother, he's on the till. He's just a college kid.

814
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Kick-Ass, Night Bitch.     -On it.

815
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ralph D'Amico is gonna end you for this.

816
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ow! It hurts!

817
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, there's a dog on your balls.

818
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You want money? There's 50 grand on the table.

819
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Please just make him stop! Please!

820
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You think you can buy us? Is that what you think?

821
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're not here to steal from you.

822
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're here to send a message to all the other bottom-dwellers.

823
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-We're shutting you down.     -Come on.

824
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There's a van waiting outside from a battered women's shelter.

825
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It'll take you some place safe.

826
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Go. Go.     -We really can't leave.

827
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We have no money.

828
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Battle Guy, how much they have on the table?

829
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, it's like 50 grand.

830
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You got plenty now.

831
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Thank you.

832
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good job, guys.

833
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Very tidy. Very tidy.

834
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I can't believe you pulled a gun on that guy.

835
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Were you really gonna shoot him?

836
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let you in on a little secret.

837
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Empty. Don't tell the bad guys.

838
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pardon my language, Colonel, but you have got some serious balls.

839
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

840
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"There's a dog on my balls."

841
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}God damn it.

842
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Javier!     -What happened?

843
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Some douche just posted a link to a story about a whorehouse,

844
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}says that Kick-Ass' team took them out.

845
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell? Where's my crew?

846
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, everybody's just...

847
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:53,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh, can you ladies excuse us for a second?

848
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh, no, they're my sidekicks. They can listen to what we have to say.

849
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They're not your sidekicks, Chris.

850
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They're prostitutes and witnesses, come on.

851
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-All right.     -Sorry, no offense.

852
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Everybody's just too afraid of your Uncle Ralph to take the job.

853
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But he's in prison.

854
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Doesn't matter. He runs the family now.

855
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And he wants everybody to lay low.

856
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But, fortunately for you,

857
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Big Tony doesn't know how to lay low, so he's in.

858
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-I don't remember a Big Tony. Is he huge?     -He's ironic.

859
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}5 foot 4, but mean as shit.

860
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He's got such a hard-on for killing people.

861
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-He's little and he kills.     -Right.

862
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Call him "The Tumor."

863
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who's next?

864
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right, we've got, uh, an ex-Triad member looking for work.

865
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Easy, "Genghis Carnage." Come on.

866
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You gotta quit with the racist stereotypes, Chris.

867
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Archetypes. Keep going.

868
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We got, uh, Katarina Dumbrovski.

869
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wait, wait. A chick?

870
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah.

871
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Seriously, you hired a chick?

872
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah. Former KGB.

873
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She was locked up in the Gulag until she ate her cellmate.

874
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. "Mother Russia."

875
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mother Russia and Motherfucker both on the same team?

876
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That doesn't work, Chris.

877
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I am not asking for suggestions, asshole.

878
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just get them costumes and get them ready!

879
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shit.

880
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Javier, thank you.

881
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I couldn't do this without you.

882
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're pretty much like the only real family I have left.

883
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not a problem, man. I got your back.

884
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's kinda like you're the Alfred to my evil Bruce Wayne.

885
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did you just call me your fucking butler?

886
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, is that not a compliment?

887
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shit. My bad.

888
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There wasn't much action most nights.

889
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, there was always a little action with Night Bitch.

890
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The reality of being a superhero is lots of patrols.

891
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But that didn't stop people from begging to join up.

892
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}With all our new members,

893
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}it seemed kinda shitty not to ask Todd.

894
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Stop peeking, man, you're gonna ruin it.

895
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Check it out.

896
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can't fight crime in that.

897
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

898
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell's "frog-eye"?

899
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Male camel toe.     -What?

900
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not really sure about these names, either.

901
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

902
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-"Dr. Kick-Ass"?     -Yeah.

903
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, they all kinda seem derivative.

904
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let me translate that.

905
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can't just copy Dave's name, you knob-gobbler.

906
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay. Um...

907
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh...

908
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

909
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I got it. I got it.

910
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"Ass Kicker."

911
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Seriously?

912
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're such a dick, Marty.

913
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know this is why you guys aren't texting me back,

914
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not an actual idiot.

915
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, you could have fooled me, Ass-Licker.

916
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Yeah, well, screw you guys.     -Todd...

917
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, really. Fuck you guys.

918
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:57,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm gonna go find my own team.

919
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Todd. Wait. Come on.

920
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Todd was right, we were being dicks.

921
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But the truth is, the only person

922
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:08,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I really wanted on the team was Mindy,

923
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but she was too busy trying not to be a superhero.

924
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, Min, he's here.

925
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your first big date. How are you feeling?

926
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Like the first time Big Daddy sent me into

927
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}a crack den with nothing but a penknife.

928
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I've got some butterflies.

929
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,390
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You just be yourself and you let me be nervous.

930
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:39,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't worry about me. I can kill a man with his own finger.

931
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A word of advice, I wouldn't open with that.

932
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Thanks for letting me finally take you out.

933
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, uh,

934
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}how else was I gonna get you to stop calling?

935
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Thanks.     -You're welcome.

936
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Where are we going?

937
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}To a party.

938
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why is this party in the middle of nowhere?

939
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because that's where keg parties usually are, right?

940
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Guess we're the first ones here.

941
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This isn't where you have a party, moron.

942
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is where you dump a dead body.

943
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's your problem?

944
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry.

945
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'll stop being such a bitch.

946
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You actually seem like a nice guy.

947
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So, um...

948
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you wanna hook up?

949
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And a total idiot.

950
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Simon, get back in the car.

951
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now!

952
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yay, you made it.

953
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Brooke?

954
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is to celebrate you.

955
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Celebrate?

956
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What a total loser you are.

957
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And we ditch losers.

958
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Poor Mindy. What did you think?

959
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The cool kids saw something special in you

960
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and invited you to your first party

961
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}where you'd sip your first beer

962
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and finally suck face for the first time?

963
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Newsflash, you're not special.

964
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fuck with the queen bee and you're gonna get stung.

965
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Date ditch.

966
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Party at my house!

967
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pathetic.

968
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Simon, you can drive us.

969
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave?

970
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God! Mindy?

971
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Holy shit. What are you doing?

972
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just needed to see my Robin, I guess.

973
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you okay?

974
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, hey, hey.

975
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know what to do.

976
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Those girls, they're...

977
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}they're evil.

978
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's just high school. Who gives a shit?

979
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You should be out there in the real world making it a better place.

980
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, I can't.

981
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know, you promised your dad.

982
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But he's not here anymore.

983
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is your life. You've gotta live it.

984
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}How am I supposed to face them tomorrow?

985
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm so embarrassed.

986
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why?

987
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're smart. You're beautiful. You're funny.

988
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're the strongest person I've ever met. You can do anything.

989
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And you're Hit Girl.

990
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,390
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Doesn't matter if you're wearing a mask or makeup,

991
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}it's who you really are.

992
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So what should I do? Cut their tongues out?

993
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No! Definitely not.

994
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm fucking with you.

995
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just beat them at their own game.

996
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}By being yourself.

997
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, if you really wanna be popular,

998
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:29,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}consider two little words, "sex," "tape".

999
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Lois, you don't need these ax wounds.

1000
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If I can dress like them, so can you.

1001
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's a gift from some drug dealer who went missing.

1002
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just because you dress like us,

1003
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}doesn't mean you can be like one of us.

1004
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It doesn't matter what costume I wear, yours or mine,

1005
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm a superhero. That's who I am.

1006
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, Captain Muffin-Muncher,

1007
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}have fun playing make-believe.

1008
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This?

1009
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is all make-believe, Brooke.

1010
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The reality is you're an evil bitch

1011
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}who's just as bad as the worst criminal scum.

1012
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna get real, Mindy?

1013
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}In the real world, I win.

1014
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I go to an awesome college, I marry a hot guy

1015
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and I make adorable

1016
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}babies for my nanny to take care of while we vacay in Paris.

1017
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My life is gonna rock and yours is gonna suck.

1018
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And no matter how slutty you dress,

1019
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss that hole you call a mouth.

1020
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So why don't you spare us all the whining and slit your wrists now?

1021
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}'Cause the only thing that's gonna ruin my day

1022
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:48,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}is looking at your face one more second.

1023
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Told her.     -Damn.

1024
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's that? A ghetto cell phone?

1025
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Gonna call for help with a come-back? Hmm.

1026
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Actually,

1027
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}my daddy bought this from a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1028
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You see, it was designed for crowd control, but deemed too severe.

1029
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:10,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It emits a pulse that creates spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1030
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He called it "the sick stick."

1031
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Either your daddy got ripped off,

1032
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}or you're back in make-believe land, sweetheart,

1033
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,760
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}because we feel fabulous.

1034
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not for long.

1035
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, my God!

1036
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You get away from me. Please, you win.

1037
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't wanna win. I just want to make the world a better place.

1038
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dad?

1039
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You home? Dad?

1040
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is this what you've been up to while I'm out working nights saving for your college?

1041
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You've been dressing up and fighting people?

1042
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There is blood on these stick things.

1043
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What are you doing in my room?

1044
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I was looking for drugs.

1045
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I was worried about you.

1046
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay, good. Now you can stop.

1047
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No. Now I'm even more worried.

1048
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Jesus, Dave, drugs would have been better.

1049
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is deranged.

1050
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa. Some people do a lot worse.

1051
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, the people you hang out with?

1052
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No. The people I hang out with are superheroes.

1053
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There is no such thing, Dave.

1054
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is the real world with real consequences.

1055
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}When are you gonna grow up?

1056
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If it means turning into you, never.

1057
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't wear the mask because I'm ashamed of who I am.

1058
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Not like you.

1059
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's that supposed to mean?

1060
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If you're not at work, you're here doing crunches.

1061
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why? So you can look like someone else?

1062
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe get a few more years of doing nothing?

1063
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1064
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}When you're gone, who's gonna notice?

1065
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Where the hell are you going?

1066
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, uh, I'm leaving. That's what you do when you grow up.

1067
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did he say why he wanted to see me?

1068
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}When your Uncle Ralph calls, I don't ask questions.

1069
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just the kid.

1070
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, just be cool and you'll be fine.

1071
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, how you doing?

1072
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Good, Uncle Ralph.

1073
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Listen, Chrissy, things have been tough all around since your dad,

1074
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you know.

1075
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, I been trying to get the family back on track from in here.

1076
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,140
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They record these things.

1077
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know, it's fine.

1078
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The warden's a pal. Now listen to me.

1079
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1080
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but you can't go hiring a gang of heavy hitters.

1081
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Javier should have told you.

1082
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, it doesn't matter.

1083
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uncle Ralph, I am gonna make Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1084
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chrissy, you need to forget that punk.

1085
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's more important that you stay out of this.

1086
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're not like me, or your dad, you're, uh...

1087
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}special.

1088
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You can't tell me what to do anymore.

1089
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know who I am now.

1090
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,390
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, yeah?

1091
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,890
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And who's that?

1092
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The Motherfucker.

1093
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You think you're the big bad guy, huh?

1094
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let me show you what real evil looks like.

1095
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hello?

1096
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Javier, what's going on?

1097
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris, what's up?

1098
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What are you doing on Lou's phone, huh?

1099
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Drop yours in the toilet again?

1100
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Everything okay?

1101
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Thank you for that. I needed it.

1102
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}For what comes next.

1103
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't be stupid, Chris.

1104
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just get out of town for a while. Go to college or something.

1105
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why? You just taught me everything I needed to know.

1106
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Voila!

1107
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Presto and elegant, damn. Them boys designed a very tasty logo.

1108
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's the matter, girl? You hear something?

1109
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, let's go see. Come on!

1110
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,750
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Anybody out here?

1111
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't see anything.

1112
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Gonna have to stay in there until you calm down, you lunatic.

1113
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wonder what's bothering you.

1114
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know. Tonight you die.

1115
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ladies first.

1116
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You will not shoot me.

1117
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You are superhero.

1118
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You help people. You do not hurt them.

1119
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's supervillain territory.

1120
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Or as I like to call my little gang,

1121
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}the Toxic Mega-Cunts.

1122
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hi.

1123
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, like your head.

1124
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:02,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yay!

1125
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Ooh, it's gotta hurt!

1126
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,570
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I did my homework on you, Colonel.

1127
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,650
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You used to be Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1128
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:27,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did a few jobs for my dad back in the day, before you got "born again."

1129
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I used to hang with a lot of losers.

1130
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,670
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?

1131
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dressed like an idiot?

1132
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who are you supposed to be?

1133
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm The Motherfucker!

1134
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:45,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And I'm here to end Kick-Ass. Not just kill him.

1135
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I am gonna shit on everything that he loves.

1136
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's trash this place, guys.

1137
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"Miranda Swedlow"?

1138
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:06,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who's that, Sal? She one of the whores on your team?

1139
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Night Bitch all snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1140
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Looks like our boy's got a new hot pocket.

1141
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Want me to kill his dog?

1142
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The dog? Jesus Christ, I'm not that evil.

1143
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Cut the old man's head off.

1144
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You guys hungry? I'm starving. Come on.

1145
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pizza, can we get pizza?

1146
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're getting pizza.

1147
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't worry, I kill you first.

1148
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Justice For...

1149
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}ever.

1150
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A Brooklyn resident was found decapitated last night.

1151
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}According to Twitter, a man claiming to be

1152
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}the world's first supervillain...

1153
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I told you, no TV. You're grounded, remember?

1154
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Marcus, I know I made you a promise,

1155
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but I can't keep being someone I'm not.

1156
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}When I see evil, I have to stop it.

1157
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:12,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy, what you did to those girls at school was unacceptable.

1158
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-You could have really hurt them.     -You're right, I could have,

1159
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but instead I sent them home with tummy-aches.

1160
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Boo-fucking-hoo.

1161
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't get it. This obsession that you have with revenge is not healthy.

1162
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If you don't let me and the police do our jobs,

1163
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}there is gonna be nothing that I can do for you.

1164
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're never gonna have a normal life

1165
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,320
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and you'll probably end up like your father.

1166
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Marcus, they cut a guy's head off.

1167
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who else is going to stop them?

1168
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Kick-Ass? You?

1169
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You go to your room and do your homework.

1170
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now!

1171
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, guys, we're signing a sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1172
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna go 5 bucks each so we can send flowers from the team?

1173
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Did you guys see The Motherfucker's Twitter page?

1174
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who is this guy? And what's his problem with us?

1175
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know, but he has got some elephant-sized balls.

1176
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He's been bragging on the web about what they did to the Colonel.

1177
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can that be traced?

1178
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I tried. His IP address is masked.

1179
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All right, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna organize a fight.

1180
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:20,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There are a lot of guys online who said they're in if we need them.

1181
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you kidding me? This isn't West Side Story.

1182
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We didn't join up to be in a gang.

1183
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We did this so we could help people.

1184
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:28,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shannon's right. We need to leave this to the cops.

1185
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We better start walking in pairs.

1186
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:34,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Motherfucker's tweeted that the Colonel was just the beginning.

1187
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1188
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you sure she's on that team?

1189
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Stupid gash posted on her superhero page that

1190
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}she's dating Kick-Ass.

1191
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:55,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1192
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hello, Night Bitch!

1193
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey.

1194
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, she wants to take the party upstairs.

1195
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're gonna have a party.

1196
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She closed the door.

1197
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't worry, darling, I'm not gonna kill you.

1198
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I want you to give a message to your boyfriend.

1199
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:23,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on, wriggly.

1200
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let go!

1201
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1202
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's time to see what evil dick feels like.

1203
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shit.

1204
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's wrong?

1205
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What are you doing?

1206
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on!

1207
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:54,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}God, okay, I'm just... I'm not in the mood.

1208
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:56,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I guess evil dick feels limp.

1209
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hurt her. Bad!

1210
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Cops are coming.

1211
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:04,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Leave it to Mother Russia.

1212
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She makes 10 times what we do.

1213
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fifty thousand a week. Plus expenses.

1214
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, watch out!

1215
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wow!

1216
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:36,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Reverse it! Reverse it!

1217
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't move! Freeze!

1218
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:55,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Fifty thousand. She's worth it.

1219
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, whoa! Why are they backing up?

1220
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why is there a lawnmower on the trunk?

1221
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wow!

1222
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We need back-up, eight men down.

1223
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I think you mean 10.

1224
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's bounce!

1225
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Put the word out I'm building an evil army.

1226
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All psychopaths and ex-cons welcome.

1227
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't think you're gonna have a problem when people hear about this.

1228
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They just disappeared?

1229
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All they have to do is take off their masks,

1230
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}no one's gonna recognize them once they're back in their street clothes.

1231
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your attention, please!

1232
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Feds traced the IP addresses for all those other costumed freaks.

1233
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,630
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We got every law enforcement agency

1234
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}in the state working to hit them at once!

1235
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why is Kick-Ass on this list?

1236
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}His crew does community service.

1237
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't give a shit. Anyone wearing a mask is getting detained.

1238
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're putting an end to this tonight!

1239
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}A lot of people said the cops were too heavy-handed that night.

1240
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But you gotta put it into context.

1241
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:24,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The police didn't mind our real life superhero stuff

1242
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}as long as we were picking up litter

1243
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}or helping old ladies cross the street.

1244
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But suddenly it was serious.

1245
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,340
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Suddenly we represented everything that was wrong with society.

1246
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Freeze!

1247
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dad had warned me that the real world had real consequences.

1248
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}As they pulled up, he must have been feeling pretty damn vindicated.

1249
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:51,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, shit, Dave. What have you done?

1250
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Police, open up.

1251
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey.

1252
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hi.

1253
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1254
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Wow.

1255
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're actually pretty cute under that mask.

1256
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm so sorry about what happened.

1257
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't be.

1258
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,720
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's my own fault.

1259
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,590
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We're gonna find these assholes and make this right.

1260
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's the point?

1261
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, we're really superheroes

1262
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}about as much as we're really dating.

1263
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,110
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We don't even know each other's names.

1264
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:39,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I think it's time to get back to the real world.

1265
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I thought we were trying to make it a better place.

1266
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Then why is it worse?

1267
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe Night Bitch was right,

1268
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}which means Dad was, too.

1269
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I mean, things had gotten out of hand.

1270
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:00,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Maybe it was time for me to stop crashing at Marty's

1271
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and start apologizing.

1272
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dad?

1273
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, whoa. That's my dad.

1274
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your dad's Kick-Ass? What?

1275
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1276
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:23,410
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You don't understand. He's doing this to protect me.

1277
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:24,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dad!

1278
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dad!

1279
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,510
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Mindy?     -Dave?

1280
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I need your help. My dad's been arrested.

1281
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:47,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They think he's Kick-Ass.

1282
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can you talk to Marcus?

1283
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-I'm grounded.     -So?

1284
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}So that means I can't get involved.

1285
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,100
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Look. Wait a second.     -I wish I could help.

1286
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy! Are you on the phone?

1287
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, I gotta go, okay?

1288
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,440
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry, Dave.

1289
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy, wait, wait.

1290
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, what the hell were you thinking?

1291
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, I could ask you the same thing.

1292
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I can't believe you lied to them.

1293
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I wasn't gonna do nothing while you went to jail.

1294
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:25,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I chose this. You should let me deal with the consequences.

1295
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I thought you wanted me to grow up.

1296
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah? When you get a kid of your own one day, you'll understand.

1297
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1298
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No. Hey... It'll just make things worse.

1299
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,300
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1300
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He said they gotta let me out by tomorrow.

1301
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No actual crime was committed.

1302
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,820
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There are people out there who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1303
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Well, the cops are out there looking for them,

1304
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:52,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}so the safest place for Kick-Ass is right here, locked away.

1305
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I don't know how you got into all this shit, but

1306
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}you gotta promise me you will never dress up in that outfit again.

1307
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do you hear me?

1308
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I promise.

1309
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This evil lair owns!

1310
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do people still say that, "own"?

1311
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, of course.

1312
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your shark. Something's wrong.

1313
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Think you used the wrong kind of water.

1314
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What the hell, Eyal?

1315
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:33,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's fine, Chris. They're supposed to lie at the bottom of the tank.

1316
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's just their way of, how you say, settling into their environment.

1317
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't screw me on this, okay?

1318
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You said we'd be ready in two days,

1319
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}we don't even have a men's room yet.

1320
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Don't worry.

1321
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's with the bags of shit?

1322
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1323
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're not a Supervillain if you don't have a plan to destroy the city.

1324
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It will not work. You need a chemical kind.

1325
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do I have to do everything myself?

1326
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just fix it!

1327
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:59,230
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You must relax. Everything is going as planned.

1328
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:01,860
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mmm, no. No. Except it's not, okay?

1329
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,020
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That sad sack is not Kick-Ass.

1330
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I've seen Kick-Ass, he's like my age.

1331
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Guy's old enough to be his father.

1332
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No shit, right.

1333
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm sorry, who are you?

1334
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:17,250
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I... uh, volunteered for your evil army, like the others.

1335
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Right. I appreciate that. Thanks for joining the cause.

1336
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:24,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is the VIP area for the core group.

1337
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I just thought it was funny you said that.

1338
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because he is Kick-Ass' father.

1339
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Who?

1340
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,090
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mr. Lizewski. He's Kick-Ass' dad.

1341
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Shut up!

1342
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

1343
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No.

1344
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:44,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But you, my friend, have just earned life-time access to my VIP area.

1345
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Go take a little seat.

1346
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,060
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1347
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}then put his little punk ass back to work.

1348
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Okay.

1349
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on.

1350
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,840
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Can I help you?

1351
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The Motherfucker wants us to take a picture with you.

1352
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It helps that my dad is a really good lawyer.

1353
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Because I don't think my beautiful ass

1354
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,640
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}would last too long in prison.

1355
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, that's weird. Chris D'Amico just texted me a picture.

1356
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Red Mist? Whatever happened to that guy?

1357
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What is it?

1358
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:40,620
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dude, what's wrong?

1359
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What is it?

1360
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:03,690
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The next few days passed in a fog.

1361
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It didn't matter that I told the police about Chris,

1362
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}they couldn't find him.

1363
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:14,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The cops did show up at Dad's funeral,

1364
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}not out of respect,

1365
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but because they were scared something would happen.

1366
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,700
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My dad was a decent man.

1367
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}All he ever did was try and give me a good life,

1368
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and I told him no one would notice when he was gone.

1369
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I love you, pal.

1370
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,800
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I love you, too, Dad.

1371
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You guys came.

1372
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We'd love to help you track down this Chris D'Amico d-bag, but

1373
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}we just got out on parole.

1374
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, that's fine.

1375
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not looking for revenge.

1376
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Last thing I promised my dad was that I was gonna give this up.

1377
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,730
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1378
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,490
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}But you started this.

1379
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,920
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now I'm ending it.

1380
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,420
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, I'm so sorry. Do you hate me for not helping?

1381
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,550
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, not even a little bit.

1382
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,850
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You were right. You gave it up.

1383
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:27,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}If I had, too, my dad would still be alive.

1384
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}The only person I blame is myself.

1385
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Let's do this!

1386
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get down!

1387
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,810
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy!

1388
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Spread out!

1389
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Keep your head down!

1390
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on!

1391
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,450
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1392
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get him!

1393
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:32,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get that van over here!

1394
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:36,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hurry up!

1395
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:40,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy?

1396
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy!

1397
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,190
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy?

1398
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,400
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You gotta put this on.

1399
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm not gonna do it.

1400
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There's nothing left you can do to hurt me.

1401
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,500
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You wanna bet?

1402
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,540
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Whoa! Whoa!

1403
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Game on, cocksuckers!

1404
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,180
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There's a girl on the roof!

1405
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,150
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}She's still up there!

1406
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-I think I got her!     -Go check!

1407
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,970
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Get out there!

1408
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:31,710
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Come on! Move your head.

1409
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Pull over, pube-face.

1410
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.

1411
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,980
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Where is he hiding?

1412
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,030
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Eat a dick.

1413
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're gonna eat yours if you don't start talking.

1414
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,610
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Go ahead and shoot me, you little bitch.

1415
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,200
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There's nothing you can do that would make me talk.

1416
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Look, hold on. I can't do this right now. It's my dad's funeral.

1417
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, your father loved you.

1418
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:30,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Just like my daddy loved me. And I know it hurts, but maybe,

1419
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:34,560
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}maybe that's the real meaning of being a superhero.

1420
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,430
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Is taking that pain and turning it into something good.

1421
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,770
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Something right.

1422
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Remember what you told me?

1423
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,660
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}This is your life. You've gotta live it.

1424
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:53,160
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Now help me find some pliers. I'm gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1425
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Seriously?

1426
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,870
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}-Hello?     -Marcus?

1427
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Mindy. What's going on? Are you okay?

1428
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,120
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm fine.

1429
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We know where The Motherfucker's hiding.

1430
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He's recruiting an army of supervillains and making homemade bombs.

1431
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Marcus, he wants to burn the city down.

1432
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You promised me.

1433
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:14,220
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I know you see me as this little girl,

1434
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,530
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but I'm not and I never was.

1435
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,390
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're right.

1436
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,680
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Daddy did take my childhood away,

1437
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}but I'm not so sure that was a bad thing.

1438
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,520
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1439
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}a gift that I can't escape no matter how hard I try.

1440
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}And I don't need to spend the next four years of my life

1441
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,240
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}trying to figure out who I am

1442
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,360
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}because I already know.

1443
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I'm Hit Girl.

1444
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I posted the address. Do you think they'll show?

1445
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris has an army.

1446
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:52,480
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}These real life super dweebs have been waiting their whole lives for a call like this.

1447
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,270
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you okay?

1448
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,350
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What? Yeah, no... I'm fine.

1449
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Here.

1450
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,940
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Take this.

1451
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,780
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}"Last resort" really isn't my style.

1452
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:15,260
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Dave, this isn't a comic book.

1453
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,580
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Real people are going to die tonight.

1454
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}My daddy was prepared for anything.

1455
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,170
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you?

1456
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,880
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah.

1457
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:32,050
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I am.

1458

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}They should be back by now!

1459
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,010
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's definitely dead.

1460
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Says on the Internet you're supposed to keep them in fresh water.

1461
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:51,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It is just hungry. We must feed it.

1462
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Why are you looking at me?

1463
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:55,830
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We gotta get this shit started.

1464
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,460
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, yeah. Have I got a show for you bitches!

1465

1467
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,840

1470
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,930
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}feed that shit to MC Shark

1471
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:27,270

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}He's kidding, right?

1473
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,600
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Motherfucker don't kid.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's what it means to be evil.

1478
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}We, my friends, are the real 1%,

1479
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,950
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}and tonight we are gonna fuck this city up or my name is not...

1481
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:54,380
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That is not my name!

1482
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:00,470
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No, you're right. Your new name's Little Bitch.

1483
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:06,310
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh, this is perfect.

1484
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,900
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you really that stupid?

1485
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,280
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}There's two of you and a whole army of us.

1486
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,040
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Do you really have such a hard-on to die?

1487
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,740
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}No.

1488
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,330
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's why we brought our friends.

1489
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,290
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}What's the matter, Chris? Shit hit your shorts?

1490
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:02,910
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Yeah, and I'm gonna wipe my ass with your face.

1491
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,790
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}You're gonna pay for what you did to my dad.

1492
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:12,130
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Your dad? You blew up my dad with a bazooka.

1493
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:19,960
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Oh!

1494
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,080
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Are you ready to die, little girl?

1495
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:52,370
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}I might be if I have to keep looking at that shit-stain you call a face.

1496
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:03,210
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Chris!

1497
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:03,070
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}Hold him down. I wanna see what his guts look like.

1498
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,990
{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}That's enough from you boys!

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's over.

{\fs12\1c&HFFFFAA&\3c&H6A4800&\4c&HFFC140&\blur3}It's because the real world needs real heroes.
