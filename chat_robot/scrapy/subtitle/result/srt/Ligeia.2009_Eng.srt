1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,191
意志的薄弱使我们受制于死亡
We yield to death through weakness of will.

2
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:32,816
它将我们的灵魂放逐至无尽的虚无
It banishes our souls into the great emptiness.

3
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,235
无论那有多深邃
...and whatever lies beyond.

4
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:43,241
但要是某种人类的灵魂可以使用另一种力量
But what if one human spirit could draw upon the power of another...

5
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:46,569
以永恒为生又会怎么样？
...and live for all eternity?

6
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,595
黑色死神的疾病将要把我带走

7
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,963
有一天也你会被带走

8
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,208
这是我们所拥有的力量要付出的代价

9
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:32,010
你看起来很整洁
You look clean.

10
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,676
我想是神奇的肥皂泡和水的功劳
Miracle soap and water, I guess.

11
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,843
想要再变得脏点吗
Wanna get dirty again?

12
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:54,824
18世纪末19世纪初许多重要的作家和诗人
Many of the important writers and poets the late 18th and early 19th century...

13
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,318
比如拜伦 济慈 坡
...I name Byron, Keats, Poe,

14
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,137
他们对我的工作产生了极大的影响
as they have most influenced my work,

15
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,080
分享着对死亡主题的激情
shared a passion for the macabre.

16
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,991
他们还有其他的共同之处
They also had another thing in common:

17
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:09,179
他们的探索为寻找到
their quest to find...

18
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,721
最极致的美
...absolute beauty.

19
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,159
一种让人永恒愉悦
A thing of beauty...

20
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,346
的美丽事物
...is a joy forever.

21
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,181
这种美丽的力量
Its loveliness increases...

22
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,212
将永不会被虚无所吞噬
...it will never pass into nothingness.'

23
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,139
济慈同样也写到
Keats also wrote:

24
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,238
永生的鸟啊 你不为死亡而生
Thou is not born for death, immortal bird.

25
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:36,003
饥饿的时代无法把你蹂躏
No hungry generations tred thee down.'

26
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:36,003
{\pos(195,40)}<font color=yellow>出自济慈的《夜莺颂》

27
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,265
但我
But I...

28
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:45,009
不想将这主题发展成冗长的演讲 让我们去享用午餐吧
I won't tred this genration down with a longer lecture, let's go to lunch!

29
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,287
谢谢
Thank you.

30
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,475
谢谢
Thanks.

31
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,829
就是这样
That's it.

32
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,830
很棒的工作  谢谢
Nice job. Thanks man.

33
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,033
我希望知道如何才能获得激发听众热情的能力
Wish I knew how to get that kind of enthusiasm out of 'em.

34
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:16,013
我能问你些事么  你看那个一身黑衣的女孩 她还在这里
Can I ask you something? Um- You see the girl, still in here, with all black on?

35
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:20,018
她怎么了
Mhm... What about her?

36
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:27,008
她至少来听过6次我的演讲 就在离这200英里远的地方
She's been to at least six of my lectures, long well over 200 miles away from here.

37
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,081
你认识她吗
Do you know her?

38
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,332
是的，她也是我们中的一员
Yeah, she's one of ours.

39
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:32,640
宗教比拟学的研究生

40
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,790
研究生
Grad student?

41
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:37,665
怎么 你以为她是大学生里的摇滚乐迷
What, did you think she was an undergrad groupie?

42
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,853
是啊
Yeah...

43
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,166
她叫什么
Well, what's her name?

44
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,082
丽姬娅 罗马诺娃
Ligeia Romanova.

45
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:46,270
丽姬娅 是个外国名字
'Ligeia?' That's exotic.

46
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:49,755
非常迷人
Yeah, quite fetching, huh?

47
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,167
你忘记我已经订婚了
You forgot that I'm engaged?

48
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,719
-人人都觉得这太可恨了          - 你这冷嘲热讽的老家伙
-Everybody should be so cursed. -You cynical old man!

49
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,701
明晚教职工聚会上再见

-All right. -See ya, Len.

52
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:15,398
女士 抱歉 抱歉 女士

53

You seem to read poetry on a higher level, like it was a form of energy.

57
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:35,780
这 这 真是一个很有趣的评价
It is... It's an interesting assessment.

58
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:41,046
那么，你在学宗教比拟学                  - 现在谁才是暗恋者
So, uh, you study comparative religion? -Now who's the stalker?

59
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,267
不 额 是波利斯校长告诉我的
No, no, uh, chancellor Burris told me.

60

神秘主义 千真万确 这才是我真的爱好

61
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,567

64
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:03,923
额 不 我 额

开始后悔自己的决定了
Regreting your discision already?

66
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,527

玩得愉快吗 乔治
Are you having a good time, George?

好坏参半
I have some mixed feelings.

73
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:41,783
听着，别管那些 你得到了我美丽的罗
Listen, put it this way, you get my beautiful Row, and...

74
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,983
我想要的就是一次酣畅淋漓的宿醉
...all I'm gonna have is a magnificent hangover.

75
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,869
喔 爸爸
Aww, dad...

76
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,036
乔纳森 我的孩子

77
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,474
我道歉 谢谢你为婚礼掏的钱
I, um, apologize, and I thank you for paying for the wedding.

78
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,662
别担心 这没什么问题
Don't worry, that's no problem.

79
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:01,698
我生而就具有一笔财富
I was born with a silver spoon.

80
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,703
那好，即然你提到了
Well, as long as you brought it up...

81
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,115
你的财富 死亡的双亲 我的意思是
...your rich, dead parents, I mean...

82
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:11,870
-爸爸，住口 - 哦
-Dad, Stop! -Oh!?

83
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:16,308
我可以免除那些财富在你身上的负担
I can relieve you of some of the burden of you and your spoon.

84
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,496
等等，这一点不好玩
Wait, that's not funny!

85
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:39,498
至始至终
By the Alpha and Omega...

86
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:47,619
起始与结束
...beginning and end...

87
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,083

93
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,400
好吗
Okay?

94
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:50,587
我不是孩子了，罗
I'm not a baby, Row.

95
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,214
发生什么了
What's happening?

96
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,424
他死了
Is he dead?

97
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,961
这公式  它需要更多的验证
The formula; It needs more work.

98
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:31,841
丽姬娅  我应该如何摆脱这些玩意
Ligeia, how am I supposed to get rid of it...

99
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,758
校长
Chancellor!?

100
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:54,051
我的博士研究课题       我不这么认为
My doctoral research. -I think not.

101
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:59,759
你在这里获得了什么
What do you have there?

102
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,093
证明   - 证明什么
Proof. -Of What?

103
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:04,468
证明灵魂
Proof that the spirit...

104
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,906
可以被控制
...can be contained...

105
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,094
可以被支配
...and controlled.

106
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,719
生存的证明
Proof of survival.

107
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:14,090
这都是些什么鬼东西
What the fuck?

108
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,866
罗马诺娃女士
Miss Romanova

109
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,782
我可不会被你这小把戏所骗
I'm not falling for your little hoax!

110
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:24,949
这可是个严肃的学术研究机构 不是巫术
This is an institution for serious studies. Not witchcraft.

111
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,178
我向你保证这是无比真实的
I assure you it's quite real.

112
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,919
你可以放弃从这个学校获得学位的幻想了
You can forget about getting a degree from this school.

113
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,908
我要撤销你的奖学金权利
...and I'm going to revoke your scholarship privileges.

114
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,096
校长
Chancellor...

115
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:39,511
这不是你在你妻子床上操我的时候所承诺的
That's not what you promised me when you were fucking me on your wife's bed.

116
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,888
现在，离开这。
Now, get out of here.

117
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:58,535
如果他撤销了你的奖学金，那这个实验就结束了
If he pulls your scholarship, this experiment is through.

118
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,119
我希望你知道你和梅里克教授之间在做什么
I hope you know what you are doing with Professor Merrick.

119
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,682
乔纳森
Jonathan...

120
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,683
聆听我 乔纳森
Hear me, Jonathan.

121
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,349
乔纳森
Jonathan...

122
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,272
乔纳森
Jonathan!

123
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,434
渴望我 乔纳森
Desire me, Jonathan...

124
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,726
乔纳森
Jonathan...

125
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:36,060
爱慕我 乔纳森
Worship me, Jonathan...

126
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,270
来我身边
Come to me.

127
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,351
我很高兴你的决定
I'm glad you decided to come.

128
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,563
如你所见，我同样喜欢死亡的主题
As you can see, I too, like the macabre.

129
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,023
喝下它
Drink this.

130
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:52,420
它尝上去就像乙醇和欧亚甘草
That tastes like grain alcohol and licorice.

131
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:54,608
苦艾酒
Absinthe.

132
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,655
这些东西会让人变得疯狂
The stuff that makes people go crazy?

133
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,900
有些人是这么说的
Some people say that.

134
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:05,167
如果我错了请你指正 梵高不是在饮用
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Van Gogh

135
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:07,755
苦艾酒后极度兴奋之下割下了自己的耳朵
cut off his ear in an absinthe delirium?

136
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,057
但他已经疯了
But he was already certifiable.

137
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,193
（俄语）干杯
Na zdorovie.

138
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:29,235
现在我可以给你展示你生命中的倒影
Now I can show you life looking back at you.

139
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,611
看
Look.

140
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,445
我称呼它为我的“灵魂之镜”
I call it my 'Soul Mirror.'

141
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:47,320
这里
There...

142
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:49,612
你看到了吗
Do you see it?

143
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,821
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell?

144
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:12,801
基督啊
Jesus!

145
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,989
现在 让我们看看你的
Now, let's see yours.

146
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,824
你身上游荡着性的渴望
You're vibrating with so much sexual energy.

147
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,946
你并不确定自己属于她
You're not sure you belong with her.

148
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,202
你并不了解我
You don't know me.

149
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:12,202
是吗
Don't I?

150
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,953
我可以等着
I can wait.

151
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,453
梅里克教授
Professor Merrick.

152
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,039

-Here's our songbird. -Beautiful as ever.

 谢谢 喔
Yeah, thanks... oh!

160
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,937
你还好吗
Are you okay?

161
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,124
赶紧离开酒吧
Let's get away from the bar.

162
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,328
也许是我喝得太多了
Should probably be mixing more than I'm drinking,

163
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,999
不过我觉得好些了
but I feel alright.

164
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,787
那么 罗威娜 乔纳森告诉我你已经准备好很快登上舞台的中心
So, Rowena, Jonathan tells me that you'll be ready for center stage real soon.

165
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,463
哦 上帝啊 不 他是夸大其词 不过谢谢你
Oh, God, no! He's exaggerating, but thank you!

166
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,063
事实上我也许会在欧洲和俄罗斯之间举办一个巡回音乐剧
I might actually be doing a musical that's touring Europe and Russia...

167
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:34,230
真的吗
Really?

168
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,498
是啊，我已经当了好久的预备演员了 我希望这次能让我成功
Yeah, I've been an understudy for so long, I'm hoping this works out.

169
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,195
俄罗斯人喜欢音乐剧
-They like musicals in Russia?

170
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:43,490
是的 我也许要在莫斯科呆几个月
-They do! I might just be in Moscow in a few months.

171
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,523
但是，再说吧
But, we'll see.

172
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,710
太好了 抱歉
-Oh, great. Excuse me.

173
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:53,576
-这是个私人聚会            -我在宾客名单上
-This is a private affair. -I'm on the guest list.

174
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:58,148
我出去抽两口烟
-I'm going out for a smoke.

175
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:00,409
-我以为你对他们放弃希望了  –我确实
-I thought you gave 'em up? -I did.

176
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,170
-嘿   -嗨
-Hey. -Hi.

177
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,795
你不介绍下我们吗
Aren't you going to introduce us?

178
00:21:09,003 --> 00:21:11,788
恩，额，罗威纳 这是丽姬娅
Yeah, uhm, Rowena, this is Ligeia.

179
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,499
乔纳森跟我说了很多关于你的事
Jonathan's told me so much about you.

180
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,504
他真的做了
-He has, has he?

181
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:21,921
你想要喝一杯吗   想喝一杯吗
Do you want a drink? Would you like a drink?

182
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,666
我不确定你这有苦艾酒
-I don't suppose you have any absinthe?

183
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:27,879
没，我这有马提尼 这也行
No, we have martinis. -It'll do.

184
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,797
酒
Wine?

185
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:37,410
丽姬娅是个很有趣的名字
Ligeia is a very interesting name.

186
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,006
是俄罗斯名字
It is Russian.

187
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,589
哈 俄语是非常美妙的语言
Hmm! Russian is a beautiful language.

188
00:21:46,215 --> 00:21:48,298
这有什么含义吗
What does that mean?

189
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:51,007
我绝不会说的
I'll never tell.

190
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,174
我们走吧
-Here we go.

191
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:59,628
- 很高兴见到你                 -哦 当然 同样很高兴见到你
-It was very nice to meet you. -Oh, yes. Likewise.

192
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:02,258
真的很好
Really nice.

193
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,615
啊哈
Ahem!

194
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,467
什么  - 什么
What? - What?

195
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:14,154
‘我在宾客名单上’ 这是怎么回事
'I'm on ze guest list.' What the hell was that?

196
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,342
不，这不是你想的那样
No, it's not what your thinking.

197
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,270
这听起来不怎么谦逊 不过
Not to sound modest, but...

198
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:22,179
我是个有前途的教授 如果有一个年轻单纯的
I'm a pretty good lecturer. I can't help it if some

199
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:24,609
女孩子对我产生某种奇怪的迷恋 我也没有办法
impressionable young woman develops a wierd crush.

200
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,072
当然不会
Of course not.

201
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:28,833
她可是难以置信的漂亮
'Cus she's incredibly beautiful.

202
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:32,927
额
Uh-oh...

203
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:36,073
你是在嫉妒啊
Are you jealous?

204
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,261
不
No...

205
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:40,803
是的
Yes.

206
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:11,387
你瞧，生命是如此容易消逝除非你为此而努力奋斗
You see, life falls away, unless you fight for it.

207
00:23:15,514 --> 00:23:17,597
你并没有明白，不是吗
You really don't get it, do you?

208
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,539
你知道 当你第一次来到这所大学的时候
You know, when you first came to this university,

209
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,874
我对你的研究抱有极高的期望
I had such high hopes for your research.

210
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:35,052
明天 我会撤销你的大学项目资金
Tomorrow I'm cutting off your university funding.

211
00:23:35,974 --> 00:23:39,007
诚实点说 我宁可你没有和她谈过话
Honestly, I would just rather you not talk to her.

212
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:41,996
永远没有
Like, ever!

213
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,183
好的
-Ok.

214
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,975
你觉得我是否小心眼
You don't think I'm being petty, do you?

215
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:50,517
不
No.

216
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:54,131
你确定没有其他改变你心意的方法了
You sure there's no way I can change your mind?

217
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,393
我不想做那些使你苦恼的事情
I don't want to do anything to worry you.

218
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:11,726
我很抱歉
I'm sorry that...

219
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,144
事情必须发展成这样
...this is the way it has to be.

220
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:28,228
我爱你
I love you.

221
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,646
莱恩
Len?

222
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,021
上帝啊 你的眼睛
Jesus, man! Your eyes!

223
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,646
不 不 不
No, no, no!

224
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,823
快来人
Somebody help!

225
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:07,679
-到了医院我再打给你             - 再见
-I'll call you from the hospital. -Bye.

226
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,149
抱歉 我想要一起搭个车
'Scuse me. I'd like to ride along.

227
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,877
-你是家属吗      -不是
-Are you family? -No.

228
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,065
好吧，那你得和我们在医院见面
Well, then your gonna have to meet us at the hospital.

229
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,538
他双眼在不停流血 你以前看到过这样的情况吗
-He was bleeding from the eyes. Have you ever seen that before?

230
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,169
我们会照看好他的
-We will take good care of him.

231
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:23,107
没事的 乔纳森 我们会在医院见面的
It's ok, Jonathan. We'll see you at the hospital.

232
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:55,610
需要搭个车吗
Need a ride?

233
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,320
她没必要知道
She doesn't have to know.

234
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:20,022
你知道 我知道 我们都感觉到了
You know, I know; We both feel it.

235
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:29,768
就好像有什么东西在你的内心灼烧
It's like something burning under your skin.

236
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,822
一时的化学反应造就的冲动说明不了什么
Chemistry doesn't mean acting on every impulse.

237
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,989
有时让步于自己的冲动
Sometimes giving in to an impulse...

238
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:43,599
就好比听从音乐的节拍那样自然
...is as simple as surrendering to music.

239
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,479
-早上好 亲爱的         -早上好
-Good morning, honey. -Good morning.

240
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,557
乔纳森还在医院吗
-Is Jonathan still at the hospital?

241
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:49,682
是的
-Yeah.

242
00:27:49,786 --> 00:27:53,151
-你有睡过觉吗          - 有 怎么了
-Did you get any sleep? -Yeah, why?

243
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,447
有个白痴在午夜的时候打电话
Well, some fool called in the middle of the night.

244
00:27:58,287 --> 00:27:59,266
是谁啊
Who was it?

245
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,454
我不知道，我没接
-I don't know, I didn't pick it up.

246
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:04,579
去把它转去了人工应答
I let it go to the machine.

247
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,225
一条信息
Message one;

Rowena, I'm advising you about your fianc? He is fucking another woman.

00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:21,503
请进
Please, come in.

252
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:32,794
他在哪
Where is he?

253
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:34,972
我们刚刚沐浴过
We were just having a shower.

254
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:38,004
你想要加入我们吗
Would you like to join us?

255
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,213
上帝啊
God...

256
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,922

丽姬娅 快点 我们走吧
Ligeia. Come on, let's go.

258
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,677
波利斯太太
Mrs. Burris?

259
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:07,844
你好 乔纳森
Hello, Jonathan.

260
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,678
对不起
I'm so sorry.

261
00:31:11,428 --> 00:31:13,553
如果这里有什么我可以帮忙的
If there's anything I can do...

262
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:17,428
谢谢
Thank you.

263
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,659
有什么问题吗
-What's the problem?

264
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:36,093
-我的补偿         -我们已经在谈这个
-My compensation. -We already talked about it.

265
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:40,922
要是乔纳森发现是我打给他的未婚妻怎么办
What if Jonathan found out I called his fianc?

266
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:46,753
别威胁我，你这混蛋
Don't blackmail me, you little shit.

267
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:48,941
我会毁灭你
I will destroy you.

268
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:57,598
想我了没
Do you miss me?

269
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:00,516
亲爱的 亲爱的艾迪
My dear, sweet Eddie...

270
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:03,753
你在我心中一直占据着一块位置
I will always have a place for you in my heart.

271
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:14,344
那病变得更糟糕了

272
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,183
没有变得更好
It isn't getting better.

273
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,372
我很好
I'm fine.

274
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:24,559
我会好起来的
I'll be ok.

275
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:44,586
她死了  是什么让你觉得这会有什么不同
She's dead. What makes you think this will be any different?

276
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:48,513
这么多年来她一个月只离开过这公寓2次
She only left the apartment twice a month for years.

277
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,316
她的灵魂仍然在这
Her spirit will be close.

278
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,728
由始至终
By the Alpha and Omega...

279
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,807
起始与终结
...beginning and end...

280
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,021
现身吧
Show yourself.

281
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:28,731
这就是
There it is.

282
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,313
你不知道我花了多长时间致力于这公式的研究
You have no idea how long I worked on this formula.

283
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,378
我希望这一切都是值得的
I hope it's worth it.

284
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:40,565
哦 最终这会
Oh, it will be...

285
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:43,565
是值得的
...in the end.

286
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,838
我不知道发生了什么 莱恩
I don't know what going on, Len.

287
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:57,598
我只有点陷入对她的迷恋
I just sort of fell into her.

288
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:03,054
她将我身体中的黑暗释放出来
She's bringing out this darkness in me.

289
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:56,446
让我们来点苦艾酒
Let's have some absinthe.

290
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,468
你一定是乔纳森
You must be Jonathan.

291
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:04,884
是的
Yes.

292
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,941
她是独一无二的  我希望你能了解这一点
There is no-one else quite like her. I hope you know that.

293
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:30,953
-你没告诉你你病得这么重             -我很害怕
-You didn't tell me how sick you were. -I was afraid.

294
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:37,320
我知道你把我带到这来  可我没法在医院工作
I knew you'd bring me here. And I can't work in the hospital.

295
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,164
我能做什么
What I can do?

296
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:46,247
要怎么样我才能帮上忙 丽姬娅
How I can help, Ligeia?

297
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,039
你是指这个
Do you mean it?

298
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,498
我什么都愿意做
I'll do anything.

299
00:36:56,165 --> 00:37:01,213
如果我可以回到我的家 罗马尼亚的马诺尔
If I could go home where I was born: Romanova Manor.

300
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:08,895
医生一说你可以安全乘坐飞机我们就登上航班
We'll just get on a plane as soon as the doctors say it's safe to fly.

301
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,654
但是很多年前我们家族就失去了那庄园
But my family lost the manor years ago.

302
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,364
我可以买下它 我可以付任何费用
I'll buy it. I'll pay any price.

303
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,751
我爱你
I love you.

304
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,367
在那黑暗和光明中结合的爱情
-By the bonds of love in darkness and light...

305
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,712
别担心这些
Don't worry about it...

306
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:59,873
我爱你   我不能放弃你
I love you, I can't stand to see you this way.

307
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,164
黑海 乌克兰 东欧

308
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,569
丽姬娅 让我给你介绍
Ligeia, let me introduce you.

309
00:38:38,673 --> 00:38:40,757
我是弗拉索夫  你好（这句我猜的查来查去又不是英语）
I am Vaslov. -Dentombre.

310
00:38:42,174 --> 00:38:44,918
弗拉索夫是看门人  他为我们看管这个地方
Vaslov is the caretaker. He's gonna watch the place for us.

311
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:52,043
我希望你在这里能感觉像在家一样
I hope this place will feel like home to you too.

312
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,112
这是… 洛尔莱
And this is... Lorelei?

313
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,847
是弗拉索夫斯的侄女  我侄女 是的
-Who is Vaslovs' niece? My niece, yes.

314
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,176
嗨 洛而莱
Hi, Lorelei.

315
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:07,769
你好
-Dentombre.

316
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:13,734
她 不太能说话 发生一些坏事
She is, uh, can't speak so much. Some bad things happen.

317
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,260
所以现在他和我在一起
So now she is with me.

318
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:19,796
我祖父设计的
My grandfather designed it.

319
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,359
为超自然实验
For metaphysical experiments.

320
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:27,053
那么 你怎么想
So, what do you think?

321
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:29,761
这非常不寻常
It's rather unusual.

322
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,375
我希望我们能在这个房间里结婚
I wish we could have been married in this room.

323
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:37,130
孩子们会给这地方带来些生气
The child will bring some life back to this place.

324
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:41,833
带回生气 真有意思
To bring life back... Interesting.

325
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,850
甜蜜的美梦 莱恩
Sweet dreams, Len.

326
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:10,264
你和你母亲的名字一样
You and your mother have the same name?

327
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,817
我们很亲密
We were close...

328
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:16,149
非常亲密
...so close.

329
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:20,931
我可以看到她的灵魂在无尽的虚空中受尽折磨
I could see her spirit when it was sucked into the great emptiness.

330
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:28,244
我的灵魂 乔纳森 可以去任何我想去的地方
My spirit, Jonathan, will go where I will it to.

331
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:35,807
你不应该说这些
You... you shouldn't talk like that.

332
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,575
你应该在床上休息 服药
You should be in bed. Take your medicine.

333
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:57,320
如果你想要我感觉好些
-If you want me to feel better,

334
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:00,797
从地窖里拿点酒上来
get me some wine from the cellar.

335
00:43:04,736 --> 00:43:05,029
快些

336
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,529
年份醇一点的
Something old.

337
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,947
如此亲密
So close now.

338
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,396
实验已经接近结束
The experiment is almost finished.

339
00:43:39,503 --> 00:43:40,532
该死的老鼠

340
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:10,149
我要做到历史上无人能做到之事
-I want to do what no one in history has accomplished.

341
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:21,149
不是魔法也不是科学  而是把两者结合在一起
Not with magic nor science, but a combination of both.

342
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:29,890
我提取出了人类灵魂的精华
I have extracted the essence of the human soul...

343
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:32,078
并且控制了它们
...and contained them.

344
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:37,895
借用我祖先的黑魔法  我可以迫使它们遵从于我的灵魂
With the black magic of my ancestors, I will bind them to my own soul.

345
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:42,787
它们可以让我的灵魂足够强大到去任何我想要去的地方
They will make my spirit powerful enough to go where I will it.

346
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:45,432
从人类时代开启以来
Since the dawn of man,

347
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:50,159
死亡索取走每一个凡人的灵魂 就像我母亲的结局
death has claimed every mortal soul, like I saw it did my mothers'.

348
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:58,028
我不会重蹈她的覆辙
I will not share her fate,

349
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,288
但我一定要加快进度
but I must work quickly.

350
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:05,204
在我身体里的疾病越来越强大
As the disease within me grows stronger,

351
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,294
控制乔纳森让我越来越虚弱
My hold on Jonathan is weakening.

352
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:38,921
你好 嗨
Hello, hey.

353
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,921
恭喜 我就知道你一定能完成
Congratulations. I always knew you could make it.

354
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,140
你在这做什么
What are you doing here?

355
00:46:45,964 --> 00:46:48,047
我必须见到你
I need to see you.

356
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:50,839
你是怎么回来这里的
How did you even get back here?

357
00:46:53,423 --> 00:46:56,699
你忘记了我有钱 你父亲还没有死
You forget I have money? Your father never did.

358
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,375
我相信你一路飞过来不是为了羞辱我
-I'm sure you didn't fly all the way here just to insult me?

359
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,840
今晚和我共进晚餐
Have dinner with me tonight.

360
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:08,621
我看了纽约时报上关于你演出的报道
I read the notice in the Times, about your performance.

361
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:11,783
我想这可能是最后的机会能跟你谈谈
I figured it would be the last chance I'd get to talk to you.

362
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:17,799
发生了什么 乔纳森
What happened to you, Jonathan?

363
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,487
我不知道 我很诚实的说不知道
I don't know. I honestly don't.

364
00:47:33,342 --> 00:47:35,426
罗威娜 你看上去
Rowena, you look...

365
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:37,843
那么漂亮
...beautiful.

366
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:41,885
你看上去
You look...

367
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:46,177
与众不同
...different.

368
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,190
在今晚看到你之前我不知道有多么想你
I didn't know how much I missed you, until I saw you tonight.

369
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:34,431
我
I don't...

370
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,983
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

371
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:48,765
罗
Row...

372
00:48:50,682 --> 00:48:52,765
聆听我 乔纳森
Hear me, Jonathan.

373
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:03,058
回到我身边
Come back to me.

374
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,850
我不能 罗威娜
I can't, Rowena.

375
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,642
上帝啊 我太愚蠢了
God, I'm so stupid.

376
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:47,061
早上好 医生
Good morning, doctor.

377
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:50,833
早上好
Good morning.

378
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,666
事实了，应该是教授
Actually, it's Professer.

379
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:54,854
请叫我乔纳森
But, please, call me Jonathan.

380
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:56,334
你不是医生
You're not a doctor?

381
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:59,271
不是，我是有学位 文学上的
No, I have a Ph.D, but in literature.

382
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:02,271
我还以为
I just thought that...

383
00:50:04,688 --> 00:50:06,772
以为什么
Thought what?

384
00:50:07,897 --> 00:50:10,642
我还以为你是个医生
I assumed you were a doctor, what with...

385
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,726
在那个地下室里面做实验
...all experiments in the basement.

386
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:56,360
对不起
I'm sorry.

387
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,697
我让莱恩自由了
-I've set Len free.

388
00:52:01,615 --> 00:52:04,006
但我没法让他的生命回来
But I can't give him his life back.

389
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:07,865
最终这些都不重要 乔纳森
None of it matters in the end, Jonathan.

390
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:11,692
这就是最终结局 我承诺给你的
It's the end. I promise you that.

391
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:16,459
不 乔纳森 我的工作不只是为了我自己
No, Jonathan. My work isn't just for me.

392
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:19,428
跟我说说
Tell me something,

393
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:21,772
你为什么要和我结婚
Why did you marry me?

394
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:23,346
因为我爱你
Because I love you.

395
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,533
狗屁
Bullshit.

396
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:27,638
你是为了钱才和我结婚
You married me for my money.

397
00:52:27,742 --> 00:52:29,940
如果大学开除了你那么我可以支持你的工作
I could support your work if the university failed you.

398
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:32,966
-我就知道 -不 乔纳森 你一定要相信我
-I know.  -No, Jonathan, you have to believe me.

399
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:38,858
我会安排你去医院的 他们会照顾好你
I'll set you up at the hospital. They can take care of you,

400
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,170
我会支付任何费用
I'll pay for everything.

401
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:51,661
和我在一起 乔纳森
Stay with me, Jonathan.

402
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:57,932
你对我做了什么 你做了什么 你控制了我的思想
What did you do to me? What did you do? Did you control my mind?

403
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:05,563
你毁了我的生活 你毁了一切
You took my life away! You took everything!

404
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,787
服从我 乔纳森
Obey me, Jonathan.

405
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:15,621
你太虚弱了
You're weak.

406
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,470
你再也不能控制我
You don't control me anymore.

407
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:23,663
- 我要离开你      - 为了她
- I'm leaving you. -For her?

408
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,413
她什么都不是
She's nothing.

409
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,789
再见
Goodbye.

410
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:28,418
我会
I am and I will be...

411
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:40,856
由始至终  起始与终结
For the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end...

412
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:43,044
屈从与我
Bind yourselves to me!

413
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,052
屈从与我
Bind yourselves to me...

414
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:37,158
嘿  你真的应该把落叶清理干净
Hey. You really should rake the leaves out here.

415
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,012
是啊
Yeah..

416
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:52,201
听着
Listen...

417
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:54,389
那里
There's, uhm...

418
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:57,055
有人在那看你
...somebody here to see you.

419
00:56:59,806 --> 00:57:01,035
谁
Who?

420
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,505
相信我 我想他有些重要东西是你需要的
Well trust me, I think he has something important that you need to hear.

421
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:14,224
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

422
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,807
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

423
00:57:43,685 --> 00:57:45,768
她死了
She's dead.

424
00:57:46,685 --> 00:57:48,768
我知道
I know.

425
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,893
罗 你想要什么
Row, what do you want?

426
00:57:56,185 --> 00:57:58,269
我只想要帮助你
I just want to help you.

427
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:03,035
看看她 她是那么可爱
Look at her. She's so sweet.

428
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:06,748
我真的想为她做些什么
I really want to do something for her.

429
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:18,192
你还好吗 洛尔莱
Are you alright, Lorelei?

430
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:23,667
洛尔莱  你觉得你和你叔叔跟我们一起去美国怎么样
Lorelei, how would you feel about you and your uncle coming to America with us?

431
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:26,776
我能要个深盘披萨吗
Can I have deep-dish pizza?

432
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:29,818
什么
What?

433
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:34,803
我现在宣布你们成为夫妻
I now pronounce you man and wife.

434
00:59:36,068 --> 00:59:38,152
你可以亲吻新娘
You may kiss the bride.

435
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:47,903
恭喜
Congratulations.

436
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:15,322
洛尔莱
Lorelei...

437
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,950
嘿 罗威娜
Hey, Rowena.

438
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,783
我觉得我们犯了个错误
I think we made a mistake.

439
01:00:58,836 --> 01:00:59,722
什么 父亲
What, Dad?

440
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:01,946
我觉得我们犯了个巨大的错误
I think we made a big mistake!

441
01:01:04,826 --> 01:01:05,764
关于什么
About what?

442
01:01:05,868 --> 01:01:09,316
关于来到这 在这个房子里 我们犯了一个错误
About being here, in this house. We made a mistake.

443
01:01:10,785 --> 01:01:15,277
就好像她还在这里 在这座该死的城堡里
It's like she's still here, in this Godamned... castle!

444
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:18,816
这让我毛骨悚然 罗 是吧
And it's creeping me out, Row, alright?

445
01:01:20,827 --> 01:01:22,911
这地方让我抓狂
This place is making me crazy.

446
01:01:30,204 --> 01:01:33,036
听着 我知道你以为我喝多了 是不是
Listen, I know you think I'm a drunk. Don't you?

447
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:39,779
我没有责备你 但现在不是时候
'Cos I don't blame you. But that aint it right now.

448
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,245
这都不会发生的 好吗
That aint what's happening, ok?

449
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:45,121
我希望你可以等等
I wish you would just wait.

450
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:48,328
-为了什么  -为我 我们会尽可能快的
-For what? -For me, we'll go as soon as I can.

451
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,033
这不会太久的 我也不想呆在这
It's not gonna be long, I don't want to be here either.

452
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:54,039
好吗
Ok?

453
01:01:54,246 --> 01:01:56,331
好
-Ok.

454
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,585
我
I am...

455
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,693
我会在这
...and I will be.

456
01:03:15,005 --> 01:03:17,510
你怎么不睡觉

457
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:30,882
你有些不对劲

458
01:03:35,013 --> 01:03:37,688
跟我走

459
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,902
回来

460
01:03:50,082 --> 01:03:51,958
到这来 叔叔

461
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,458
是什么这么重要

462
01:04:03,509 --> 01:04:05,551
洛尔莱，你不是真正的你

463
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:54,152
峡谷里一阵阵的
The bagpipes are calling...

464
01:04:55,262 --> 01:04:57,345
风笛声传来
...from glen to glen...

465
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:02,845
我没办法呆在这
I can't stand being here.

466
01:05:03,762 --> 01:05:08,052
还有多久 我只是觉得 我就是觉得她还在...
How much longer? I just, I feel like, I almost feel like she's...

467
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:16,051
若鲜花枯萎之时你来此
If you come when the flowers are dying...

468
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:27,265
我会得到更多
-I'm getting some more of that!

469
01:05:27,317 --> 01:05:29,400
我猜爸爸又喝酒了
Guess dad's drunk again.

470
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:33,828
这就是你在一座有酒窖的房子里能找到的东西
That what you get for living in a house with wine cellar.

471
01:05:33,932 --> 01:05:36,015
这都是鬼话
This is all bullshit.

472
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:42,464
我带走罗威娜 明天 我就离开这
'Cos I'm gonna take Rowena, tomorrow, and I'm gonna leave!

473
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:46,474
还不行
-Not yet.

474
01:05:56,392 --> 01:05:58,517
对不起 这什么意思 你在说什么
Sorry, what was that? What did you say?

475
01:06:32,103 --> 01:06:35,800
我最好去看看洛尔莱  爸爸也许把她吓个半死
I better go see if Lorelei's ok. Dad's probably scared her half to death.

476
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,653
洛尔莱
Lorelei?

477
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:25,571
洛尔莱 你在这吗
Lorelei, are you in there?

478
01:08:32,113 --> 01:08:35,035
洛尔莱 你在这干什么
Lorelei, what are you doing in here?

479
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,676
我睡不着
-I can't sleep.

480
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,864
我也是
Me neither.

481
01:08:46,114 --> 01:08:48,010
你想要去喝这些 是不是
You're not going to drink that, are you?

482
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:50,552
叔叔说这些有助于睡眠
-Uncle says it helps make me sleepy.

483
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:52,870
他告诉你的 你叔叔说的
He tells you that? Your uncle said that?

484
01:08:56,073 --> 01:08:57,511
好吧
Well...

485
01:08:57,615 --> 01:08:59,850
也许这真的有助于睡眠
...maybe this will help me get sleepy,

486
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,445
但我觉得牛奶和饼干对你更有助
but I think that milk and cookies might work better for you.

487
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,095
告诉你
Tell you what...

488
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:10,314
我们回楼上吧 我会陪你一起直到你入睡
Let's go back upstairs, and I will lay with you until you fall asleep.

489
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:12,502
然后明天
And then tomorrow...

490
01:09:12,503 --> 01:09:15,424
乔纳森和我会给一个大惊喜 好吗
Jonathan and I have a huge surprise for you, ok?

491
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,159
给你的惊喜
A surprise for you.

492
01:09:37,577 --> 01:09:39,660
上帝 我真的有点头晕
God, I feel really dizzy.

493
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:43,910
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

494
01:09:46,703 --> 01:09:48,824
洛尔莱 这条路不对
Lorelei, this is the wrong way.

495
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:51,995
过来，我指给你
Come, I show you.

496
01:10:13,872 --> 01:10:15,955
罗威娜
-Rowena!

497
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:18,185
罗 罗
Row, Row.

498
01:10:18,289 --> 01:10:20,372
叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

499
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,164
洛尔莱 你听到我的话吗
Lorelei, you hear me?

500
01:10:25,706 --> 01:10:27,789
洛尔莱 去找弗拉索夫 快去
Lorelei, get Vaslov. Go!

501
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,291
乔纳森
Jonathan...

502
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,249
你还好吗
Are you ok?

503
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,874
我怎么了 你晕过去了
What happened to me? -You fainted.

504
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,974
我正准备带你去医院
I'm going to take you to a hospital.

505
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,751
罗威娜
Rowena...

506
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,292
你父亲
...your dad...

507
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:05,063
他摔下去
...he fell.

508
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:07,251
他死了
He's dead.

509
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:23,535
我不敢相信这里面你一点关系都没有
I can't believe there's nothing wrong with you.

510
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,398
我告诉过你
-I told you!

511
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:27,746
我们现在可以回家了 – 不
So now we go home? - No.

512
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:31,045
什么
What?

513
01:11:32,086 --> 01:11:33,191
我不明白
I don't understand.

514
01:11:33,295 --> 01:11:36,571
我只是不想被这个地方击溃
I just don't want to let this place defeat me.

515
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,733
你现在还想呆在这        - 是的
So now you want to stay? -Yes.

516
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,921
好吧 洛尔莱 我猜我们要呆在这
Well, Lorelei, I guess we're staying.

517
01:11:43,712 --> 01:11:47,623
洛尔莱 亲爱的 你觉得可以到外面去玩一会吗
Lorelei, sweetie, do you think you can go play outside for a minute?

518
01:11:47,674 --> 01:11:48,748
我想和乔纳森说几句话
I need to talk to Jonathan.

519
01:11:51,963 --> 01:11:54,047
谢谢你
Thank you.

520
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:01,756
我们不能照看她
We can't take care of her.

521
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,825
但是是你说你想要她和我们一起回家的啊
-But you just said you wanted to take her home with us.

522
01:12:04,981 --> 01:12:07,815
好吧 我错了 这的确是个高尚的想法 但是 不
Well, I was wrong. It was a noble idea, but, no.

523
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:10,882
罗威娜 她无亲无故 我们甚至不知道弗拉索夫在哪
-Rowena, she doesn't have anybody. We don't even know where Vaslov is.

524
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:13,253
好吧 找个其他人来照顾她 乔纳森
-Well, find someone to take care of her, Jonathan!

525
01:12:40,926 --> 01:12:44,307
我很惊奇你想要来这 罗
-I'm surprized you wanted to come here, Row.

526
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,503
这是我的另一面
It's a different side of me.

527
01:12:53,885 --> 01:12:56,629
这真是个美丽的遗产 不是么 乔纳森
It really is a beautiful estate, isn't it, Jonathan?

528
01:12:57,885 --> 01:12:59,968
这只是感觉起来是如此生机勃勃
It just feels so alive.

529
01:13:04,219 --> 01:13:07,584
照您所求 一杯上好的白兰地
-As requested: a fine old brandy.

530
01:13:13,802 --> 01:13:15,886
罗威娜
Rowena...

531
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,991
什么
What?

532
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,929
有什么东西使你恼怒
Something bothering you?

533
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:26,513
是的
Yes.

534
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:30,257
就是你想要抛弃洛尔莱的事情
It's the way you dismissed Lorelei like that.

535
01:13:32,179 --> 01:13:35,344
瞧 这并不是个鲁莽的决定 我有认真思考过
Look, it wasn't just a rash decision. I'd thought about it

536
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,764
这只是看起来很
-It just seemed so...

537
01:13:40,597 --> 01:13:42,680
什么
What?

538
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,263
你想要说什么
What are you gonna say?

539
01:13:46,264 --> 01:13:48,348
冷漠
'Cold'?

540
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:53,211
我看起来对你很冷漠吗
Do I seem cold to you now?

541
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,182
我看起来很冷漠吗
Do I feel cold?

542
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:39,477
罗威娜
Rowena?

543
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:42,727
什么
What?

544
01:14:44,602 --> 01:14:46,904
我只想说你的名字
I just wanted to say your name.

545
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,732
帮帮我
Help me.

546
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,273
帮帮我 洛尔莱
Help me, Lorelei.

547
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:03,692
首先  这么快你就从你父亲的死亡中恢复过来
First, It was how quick you got over your dad dying.

548
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:08,604
你知道 我估计 当你提出那女孩送走的时候
You know, I figured, when you sent the girl away,

549
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:11,734
你做事的方式
It was the way you did it.

550
01:16:14,151 --> 01:16:16,630
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

551
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:19,151
你穿衣服的风格
And the way you dress now...

552
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,652
真的 乔纳森 你这么做没有意义
Really, Jonathan, you're not making any sense.

553
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,163
认真的 这就是你的感觉
But really, it was the way you feel...

554
01:16:28,486 --> 01:16:30,569
你死在
You died...

555
01:16:30,777 --> 01:16:32,132
我的环抱中
...in my arms...

556
01:16:32,236 --> 01:16:34,319
丽姬娅
Ligeia.

557
01:16:42,195 --> 01:16:44,944
我是那么想要你了解真正我
I so wanted you to know that it was me.

558
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:51,451
我再也不能控制我自己
I could not keep it to myself any longer.

559
01:16:55,738 --> 01:16:57,822
回答我
Answer me.

560
01:16:58,154 --> 01:17:00,238
你对罗威娜做了什么
What did you do with Rowena?

561
01:17:02,405 --> 01:17:04,489
她不在了
She's gone!

562
01:17:30,865 --> 01:17:32,949
这么做使你不安了 乔纳森
Did that excite you, Jonathan?

563
01:18:32,745 --> 01:18:34,867
我有些东西要告诉你
I have something to tell you.

564
01:18:43,955 --> 01:18:45,476
这是你吗
Is that you?

565
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:48,532
是的 我有很多话要跟你说
Yes! I have much to tell you.

566
01:19:16,499 --> 01:19:18,583
你看起来美极了
You look beautiful.

567
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:31,251
我不能离开
I couldn't stay away.

568
01:19:33,585 --> 01:19:37,163
这是谁的身体并不重要 不是吗 乔纳森
It doesn't matter whose body it is, isn't that right, Jonathan?

569
01:19:39,334 --> 01:19:42,168
你知道 你在我心中一直占有一席之地
You know, you will always have a special place in my heart.

570
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:05,628
这感觉起来像谁
Who did that feel like?

571
01:20:08,254 --> 01:20:10,337
这当然是丽姬娅
That was definitely Ligeia.

572
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:15,098
不论我必须去做什么 我不想去死
I am not going to die, no matter what I have to do.

573
01:20:17,254 --> 01:20:18,817
有一天我们都会死
Someday we must die.

574
01:20:18,921 --> 01:20:21,005
不
No.

575
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:24,960
听着    我们不用付出什么代价
Listen, we will never have to pay that price.

576
01:20:26,797 --> 01:20:28,881
我们可以长生不死
We can live forever.

577
01:20:29,464 --> 01:20:33,328
只要让一些其他傻瓜来代替我们去死
Let some other fools take our place and die.

578
01:20:37,798 --> 01:20:39,882
但是你一定要保证 乔纳森
But you must commit, Jonathan.

579
01:20:51,632 --> 01:20:53,716
哦，我保证
Oh, I am committed.

580
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,466
饮下一个新的生命
Drink to a new life.

581
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:45,262
乔纳森
Jonathan...

582
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:09,472
不
No!

583
01:22:47,975 --> 01:22:50,132
去死 乔纳森 去死
Die, Jonathan, die!

584
01:23:24,937 --> 01:23:27,020
罗 醒醒
Row, wake up.

585
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,354
醒醒
Wake up.

586
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:30,875
乔纳森
Jonathan...

587
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:33,063
是你吗  罗  是你吗
Is it you, Row? Is it you?

588
01:23:33,604 --> 01:23:35,687
我们成功了
We did it.

589
01:23:36,188 --> 01:23:38,271
我们成功了 我们成功了
Yeah, we did it. Yeah, we did.

590
01:24:44,151 --> 01:24:48,309
看！这是个狂欢的晚上在凄凄凉凉的暮年！
<i>Lo! 'tis a gala night.
Within the lonesome latter years!</i>

591
01:24:44,151 --> 01:24:53,465
{\pos(195,40)}<font color=yellow>The Conqueror Worm(征服者爬虫)"是Edgar Allan Poe(埃德加·艾伦·坡)在1843年的作品。

592
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:53,465
有群蝉翼仙子，脸上蒙着轻纱，热泪涟涟
<i>An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears,</i>

593
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:57,475
端坐戏院里，观看一出恐惧和希望交织的悲剧
<i>Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,</i>

594
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:01,652
乐队时作时辍地奏出 飘飘渺渺的天外仙曲
<i>While the orchestra breathes fitfully，
The music of the spheres.</i>

595
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:13,925
丑角乔扮凌霄的天帝
<i>Mimes, in the form of God on high,</i>

596
01:25:14,029 --> 01:25:17,977
咕哝不停，声音低低，飞东飞西地往返无常
<i>Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly-</i>

597
01:25:18,081 --> 01:25:22,331
只是傀儡，横冲直撞，听凭无形巨掌牵上牵下
<i>Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things</i>

598
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:24,522
无形巨掌瞬息换景
<i>That shift the scenery to and fro,</i>

599
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:28,478
扑扑秃鹰翅膀，飞降,灾祸，看不清
<i>Flapping from out their
Condor wings Invisible Woe!</i>

600
01:25:36,322 --> 01:25:39,927
这出戏真是五光十色！啊，常记心头。千万莫忘！
<i>That motley drama- oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!</i>

601
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:44,193
人群不停追逐“幻影”，伸手捕捉，永远失望，
<i>With its Phantom chased for evermore,
by a crowd that seize it not,</i>

602
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,938
绕圈回旋地兜来转去，始终回到同一地方，
<i>Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,</i>

603
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:54,507
剧中情节多的是恐惧和罪恶，有的是疯狂。
<i>And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
And Horror the soul of the plot.</i>

604
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:59,240
折腾蠢动！一声哀吟，
<i>It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs</i>

605
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:50,114
灯火转暗，一一隐熄
<i>Out- out are the lights- out all!</i>

606
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:54,277
好似棺套罩上灵枢，
<i>And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,</i>

607
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,425
帷幕势比骤雨，倏地落下
<i>Comes down with the rush of a storm,</i>

608
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:59,882
脸色刷白，双目茫茫，
<i>While the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm</i>

609
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:03,473
公认台上悲剧名唤“人生”，
<i>That the play is the tragedy, "Man,"
And its hero...</i>

610
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:06,185
主角便是“毒蛊霸王
<i>The Conqueror Worm.</i>
