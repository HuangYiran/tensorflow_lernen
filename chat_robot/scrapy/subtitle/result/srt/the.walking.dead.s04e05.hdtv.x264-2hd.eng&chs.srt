"行尸走肉"前情提要...
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,561
如果栅栏再这样被压着 行尸就要爬过来了
The fence keeps bending in like that, those walkers are coming over it.

3
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:07,998
那所兽医大学里...
That veterinary college...

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,636
宠物用的药我们一样可以用
The drugs are the same we need.

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,490
包 导管 钳子 连接器
Bags, tubes, claps, connectors.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,641
清单上所有的东西都拿到了
Everything on the list.

7
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:13,975
好的 我们走
All right, let's roll.

8
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:16,032
我不能让你这么胡闹
I can't let you do this.

9
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:17,668
那些人们在经受着痛苦
There are people in there suffering.

10
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,204
是你杀了Karen和David吗?
Did you kill Karen and David?

11
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,344
是的
Yes.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,104
我会把你赶走的
I won't have you there.

13
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,584
但你会在外面活下来
You're gonna survive out here.

Henry, I need you to calm down.

17

我们在帮你
We're trying to help.

18
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:07,203
不...!
No...!

19
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:32,800
你们两个快喝点茶水
Drink some of that. Both of you.

20
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:42,720
是不是得开个会?
Some council meeting, huh?

21
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,022
还有两个成员没回来
We're two members short.

22
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,826
在他们回来之前 我们应该定些新规矩
I think we should make some new rules before they get back.

23
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,413
比如说 以后意大利面之夜
I hereby declare we have spaghetti Tuesdays

24
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,398
从周二改到周三

25
00:02:57,503 --> 00:03:00,288
我们的意大利面不够吃了
First we have to find some spaghetti.

26
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:11,182
你可以负责照顾他吗?
You okay to take over?

27
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:19,357
每隔五到六秒捏一下
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.

28
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,759
如果你觉得头晕了
You start feeling lightheaded,

29
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,779
就让别人来接替你
grab somebody else to take over.

30
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,000
我们轮流来照顾他
We'll take it in shifts.

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,778
想不想跟我一块去巡查?
You want to help me go on my rounds?

32
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,230
嗯
Yeah.

33
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,032
好的
Sure.

34
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,056
这样能让他活多久?
How long will that keep him alive?

35
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,979
只要我们一直这样照顾他
Just as long as we're willing to do it.

36
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,566
他就可以活着
As long as it takes.

37
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,603
不 别在这里这么做
No. Not here.

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,632
帮我把他抬到这上面
Help me get him on this.

39
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:49,185
好吧 但是几小时后Henry死了...
Okay, but in a couple of hours when Henry's dead...

40
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,438
- Glenn  - 你打算怎么把他的尸体
- Glenn.  - How are we gonna get his body

41
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,190
经过牢房搬下楼梯
down the stairs, across the cell block

42
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,026
还不让别人看到?
and through those doors without anyone noticing?

43
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,779
真死了... 假设死了... 你就得给我帮忙
If that happens... if... you're gonna help me.

44
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,688
如果我也死了呢?
And what if I'm gone?

45
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,524
别废话 赶紧把他抬上来
Shut up and help me get him on this.

46
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:16,225
你们在干嘛?
What are you doing?

47
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,365
我们把Jacobson先生搬到安静点的地方休养
We're taking Mr. Jacobson to a quieter place.

Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer" from my room.

49

I want you to read it by tonight.

50
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,044
我们都有事要做
We all got jobs to do.

51
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,670
- 你的事就是读书  - 我读不完
- That one's yours.  - I won't finish it.

52
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,117
怎么了?
Why?

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,908
晚上太黑了
It's gonna get too dark.

54
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,094
哦
Well,

55
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,257
尽力读吧

56
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:50,848
多喝点茶水
And drink some tea.

57
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,896
你没责任这么做 对吧?
You haven't had to do this yet, have you?

58
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,368
昨晚后半夜就有一个
There was one late last night.

59
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,453
Sasha这么做了
Sasha did it.

60
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:19,740
人们不应该看到这一幕
People don't need to see it.

61
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,742
我不希望他们看到
I don't want them to.

62
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:10,361

Glenn哪去了? 他说过会回来见我

- If you need help, I can help you. - I don't.

69

我只是想让他有事情做
I was just keeping him occupied.

70
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,483
让他一直想着帮别人

你不相信吗?
Don't you believe that?

84
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:39,072

Of course.

85
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:42,375
再多坚持一段时间
Just hold it together a little longer.

外面也需要有人照顾
We need someone out there taking care of things.

91
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:22,972
如果她看到我这样
If she saw me,

92
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,760
肯定会进来
couldn't keep her out.

93
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:28,329
我知道你不是故意骗她
I know you didn't want to lie to her.

94
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,764
我没骗她
I wasn't lying.

95
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,332

是她杀了Karen和David
She killed Karen and David.

105

她只是想停止瘟疫扩散

Tyreese马上就要回来了
Tyreese is gonna be back here soon,

107
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,762
我觉得她不能待在这儿
so I didn't think she should be here.

108
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,688
我也不能让她留在这儿
And I couldn't have her here.

109
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:01,570
她有车和补给
She has a car, supplies,

110
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,584
她会有办法活下去的

111
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,687
我去告诉你爸爸 先别告诉其他人
I'll tell your dad. Don't tell anyone else yet.

112
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:08,806
好的
Okay.

113
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,163
换作是你 你会把她带回来吗?
Would you have brought her back?

114
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:21,152
- 她亲口承认了吗?  - 是的
- She said she did it?  - Yeah.

115
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,542
那你的确应该把她驱逐出去
Then you were right to send her away.

116
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,977
我不知道我是否也能做到
I don't know if I could have.

117
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:32,384
你也会这么做的 Maggie
You could have, Maggie.

118
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,752
你做过更艰难的决定
You've done harder things.

119
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:38,255
别怀疑你自己 我们可不能再这样
Don't doubt yourself. We don't get to anymore.

120
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,593
Rick 行尸的数量比上次压倒铁栅栏的更多了
Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.

121
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,596
- 我们得想想办法  - 会有办法的
- We need to do something.  - We will.

122
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,151

123
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,354
嘿 Carl
Carl.

124
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:56,192
Carl 听到吗?
Carl?

125
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,077
你没事吧?
You okay?

126
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,446
我也想问你呢
I was gonna ask you that.

127
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,698
- 我们没事  - 没人生病吧?
- We're fine.  - No one's sick?

128
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,250
你不需要动手吧?
You didn't have to do anything?

129
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,203
还没用过我的枪 爸爸
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.

130
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,488
Judith呢?
And Judith?

131
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,973
她和Beth在一起
She's with Beth.

132
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,675
很好
Good.

133
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,616
我出去的时候找到了些食物
Found some food on the run.

134
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:17,951
里面有不少干无花果
There's a bunch of fruit leather in there.

135
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:19,953
让大家吃完都刷刷牙
Have everybody brush their teeth after.

136
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,991
- 我们很快就能出去吗?  - 还不行
- Can we come out soon?  - Not just yet.

137
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:28,629
爸爸 你当时冲锋陷阵的时候我就在你身边
Dad, I was around you when you were in the middle of it.

138
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,049
我也和Patrick接触过
And I was around Patrick.

139
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,768
但我没得病 我能帮助你
I didn't get it. I can help you.

140
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,338
谢谢 不过我还是要你待在这儿
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.

141

142
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:45,145
但爸爸 你没法保护我一辈子不干那事儿
But, Dad, you can't keep me from it.

143
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,378
什么事?
From what?

144
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,360
就是要动手杀人的事
From what always happens.

145
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,850
没错
Yeah.

146
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,960
也许吧
Maybe.

147
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,138
但努力保护你就是我的工作
But I think it's my job to try.

148
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,640
谢谢
Thank you.

149
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,512
不客气
No problem.

150
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,041
让我来看看你的病情
Let's have a look at you.

151
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:46,469
医生往往是最差劲的病人
Doctors make the worst patients.

152
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:50,723
并不是所有人都得活下去
Not everyone gets to live.

153
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:55,811
末期
End stage

154
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,080
就是没人能从中恢复的阶段
is a point that no one comes back from

155
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:01,056
或者... 他们就活不了了
or they... or they can't.

156
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:04,896
我就是末期了
That's where I am.

157
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:08,990
不 你得集中精神帮助那些病情较轻的人
No, you need to focus on the ones that can make it.

158
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,984
我又做了些静脉注射液
I made some more IVs.

159
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:17,408
如果你没做好失去一个人的准备
If you're not ready to lose one,

160
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:18,876
那可能导致更多人死去
you're gonna lose them all.

161
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,769
就像是关灯...
It's like turning off a light...

162
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,328
总会一盏接着一盏熄灭
it'll happen one after the other.

163
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,108
他们不仅仅是死了
And they don't just die.

164
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,448
我们能坚持
We can hold on.

165
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,847
嘿 Caleb
Caleb.

166
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,920
别动
Caleb.

167
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,672
自从另外那个区域出事之后
After what happened in the other cell block,

168
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:39,521
我来这里的时候就带了这个
when I came in here, I brought these.

169
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,624
快坐回床上去 事情还没那么糟
Get back in bed now. We're not that bad off.

170
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:47,746
等局面急转直下
When we are,

171
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:50,272
一切就都晚了
it'll be too late.

172
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,691
你不明白
You don't understand.

173
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,361
你有机会
You have a chance.

174
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,079
情况马上就会恶化的
This is it after this.

175
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,314
我不会放弃任何一个人
I'm not giving up on anyone.

176
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,534
至少现在不会
Not yet.

177
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,987
你得保证大家的房门都关上
Just make sure everyone's doors are shut.

178
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,269
Caleb 别...
Caleb...

179
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,304
你得保证!
Just make sure!

180
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,114
Caleb 让我看看你的病情
Caleb, you've got to let me look at you.

181
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:28,192
好吧 Hershel
Okay, Hershel.

182
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,208
你就看吧
Have a look.

183
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,806
喝点我留给你的茶
Drink the tea I left you.

184
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,476
我一个小时后再回来看你
Gonna be back to check on you in an hour.

185
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,304
各位
Everyone,

186
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,524
回各自的房间去
get back in your cells.

187
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,498
快点回各自的房间去
Go on, get back in your cells.

188
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,423
把他搬到这床上
Let's get him on this.

189
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,034
去休息吧
Go rest.

190
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,536
你能自己走回房间吗?
Can you make it to your cell?

191
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,335
# 你走吧 #
# Go your way #

192
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,808
# 我要绕远路 #
# I'll take the long way around #

193
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,544
# 我会找到下去的路 #
# I'll find my own way down #

194
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:43,681
# 如同我该做的那样 #
# As I should #

195
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:54,358
# 遥望远方 #
# And hold your gaze #

196
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:59,530
# 点石成金之道也有弊端 #
# There's coke in the Midas touch #

197
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:03,567
# 玩笑中 我们老去 #
# A joke in the way that we rust #

198
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:06,537
# 再呼吸一次... #
# And breathe again... #

199
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,409
嘿 Hershel
Hershel.

200
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,803
这是死的第三个了
Third one we've lost.

201
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:24,355
我们在楼后面烧了他们
We're burning them behind the blocks.

202
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:26,808
烧了他们
Burning them.

203
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,561
只有这一种方法了
That's what it's come to.

204
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,982
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

205
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:39,603
我昨天刚跟他聊过斯坦贝克的小说
I talked to him yesterday about Steinbeck.

206
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,123
他引用了一句话
He told me a quote.

207
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,876
"悲伤的灵魂
"A sad soul

208
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,246
比细菌更致命"
can kill quicker than a germ."

209
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,951
这也正是我不想给所有人看到这一幕的原因
That's exactly why I didn't want them all to see what happens.

210
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,422
我知道他们都明白
I know they know,

211
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:01,759
但就是不想让他们现在就看到
but I didn't want them to see it right now.

212
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,513
他们都看着你 Hershel
They're seeing you, Hershel.

213
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,633
他们看着你
They see you

214
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,736
不言放弃
keep going.

215
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:14,906
哪怕是已经快无计可施的时候
Even after all the choices keep getting taken away.

216
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:25,482
等我们撑过这一关...
When we get past this thing...

217
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,653
也不会和以前一样了 对吧?
it's not gonna be like how it was, is it?

218
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,156
对
No.

219
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:39,347
你是在否认吗?
Was that denial?

220
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,215
你觉得我没有透过表象看本质?
Not seeing things for how they were?

221
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,000
对
No.

222
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,219
你正好找到了突破口
You just caught a break.

223
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,890
你需要时间 也得到了时间
You needed some time. You got some.

224
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,008
你运气好
You got lucky.

225
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,394
我们都是
We all did.

226
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:56,781
我仍然觉得会有办法
I still think there's a plan.

227
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,234
我也相信这一切肯定有缘由
I still believe there's a reason.

228
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,289
你觉得这是试炼?
You think it's all a test?

229
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,293
生活本身就是试炼 Rick
Life was always a test, Rick.

230
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,468
我得跟你谈谈Carol的事情
I need to talk to you about Carol.

231
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:01,295
醒醒
Come on.

232
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,464
醒醒 Sasha
Come on, Sasha.

233
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,385
你知道怎么抗争
You know how to fight.

234
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,921
坚持住
Just hold on.

235
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:18,479
坚持住 千万别放弃
Just hold on. Don't give up on me, now.

236
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,346
我刚和你爸爸谈过
I just talked to your dad.

237
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,699
他看上去不错 也自有考量
He looks good, all things considered.

238
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,703
如果Carl病了 你会上去陪他吗?
If Carl were sick, would you be up there with him?

239
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,791
如果我能帮上忙的话就会
If I thought I could help.

240
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,592
你觉得我帮不上忙?
You don't think I can help?

241
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,101
该死
Damn.

242
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,141
真高兴你跟我一起在这儿
I'm just glad you're out here with me.

243
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,824
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

244
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,911
我晕过去了?
I passed out?

245
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,413
你脱水了
You were dehydrated.

246
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,299
充当英雄消耗了你很多体力
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.

247
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,368
你应该知道的
You should know.

248
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,508
我觉得你真是蠢透了才会进来
I thought you were an idiot to come in here.

249
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,927
我本来以为你会变成一个
I mean, I was sure you were just gonna be

250
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,513
死掉的老蠢蛋
a dead foolish man.

251
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:46,848
我分不清楚这是不是在表扬我
I can't tell if that's a compliment.

252
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,434
我不知道我在说什么
I don't know what I'm saying.

253
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,554
肯定是撞到头了
I must have hit my head.

254
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,912
我不相信魔法
I don't believe in magic

255
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,115
或是运气
or luck.

256
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,619
我会小心计算
I do the math

257
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,088
不会冒险赌博
and I don't gamble.

258
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,260
但我觉得如果你没做蠢事
But I don't know if I'd be here right now

259
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,130
我就活不到现在
if you weren't so damn stupid.

260
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,432
知道吗?
You know what?

261
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,385
我就当你是在表扬我了
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

262
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,980
嘿 Hersh...
Hersh...

263
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,267
嘿 Hershel...
Hershel...

264
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,582
我一会儿再来看你
I'll check on you in a little while.

265
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,371
他怎么样?
How is he?

266
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,123
睡着了
He's sleeping.

267
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:37,793
你也应该休息一会儿
You should get some rest yourself.

268
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:41,513
我不想离开他 以防他醒过来
I don't want to leave him in case he wakes up.

269
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,968
- 想让我看看他吗?  - 不用
- Want me to take a look at him?  - No.

270
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,055
让他睡吧
Just let him sleep.

271
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:58,446
嘿 Hershel!
Hershel!

272
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,232
嘿 Hershel!
Hershel!

273
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:09,958
大家都待在房间里
Everyone stay in your cells.

274
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,197
不
No.

275
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,146
去吧
Go.

276
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,481
铁栅栏更重要 我们不能让它倒掉
The fence is more important. We need to keep it standing.

277
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,600
我来处理
I got this.

278
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,789
- 你一个人干不了  - 我知道 你去吧
- You can't do this alone.  - I know. Go.

279
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,126
跟着我 Henry
Just follow me, Henry.

280
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,078
快来这儿 离开Glenn 快点
Down here, away from Glenn. Come on.

281
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,883
快点 Henry 这边走
Come on, Henry. Here we go. This way.

282
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:24,866
快点 跟着我 Henry
Come on, boy. Come on, Henry.

283
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,569
再往这儿走点
Just a little more.

284
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,270
接着走
Keep coming.

285
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,323
乖孩子 跟我走 快点
Come on, boy. Let's go. Come on.

286
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,072
Carl 听到吗?
