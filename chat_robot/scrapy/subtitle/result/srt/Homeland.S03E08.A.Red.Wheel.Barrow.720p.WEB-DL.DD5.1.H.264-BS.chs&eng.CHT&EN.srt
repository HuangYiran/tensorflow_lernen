He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe, the Middle East.

15
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,950
我們不容科威特遭受侵略
This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.

16
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,860
對于恐怖襲擊的不懈打擊
This relentless pursuit of terror.

17
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,920
我們將一視同仁
We will make no distinction...

18
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,300
美國軍艦科爾號
The USS Cole was attacked

19
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,720
在亞丁灣港口加油時遭到襲擊
while refueling in the port of Aden.

20
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,740
這是恐怖主義行動
This was an act of terrorism.

21
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,590
這是可鄙懦弱的行動
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

22
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,520
下面為您演奏的
The next samba we're going to swing for you

23
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,520
是一首經典曲目
is one of the good old favorites.

24
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,050
直到他受到了阻擊
...until something stops him.

25
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,850
整個事件就發生在我的眼前
It was right in front of my eyes,

26
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,850
而我絲毫沒預料到
and I never saw it coming.

27
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,170
該飛機撞向了世貿中心

28

成千上萬的民眾東奔西逃

You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person i've ever known.

31
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,610
我不是不明真相的那個人
I'm not the one who got it wrong.

32
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,780
我是唯一的明白人
I'm the only one who got it right.

33
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,920
拿下

麥吉森小姐  我是利蘭·本尼特

你的委托人想要什么
What does your client want?

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,660
他們想借用你的大腦
To pick your brain from time to time.

41
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,200
要保持你大腦的正常運作
Put you on retainer as it were.

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,100
別出聲

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,240
拿下來
Take it off.

44
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,050
卡莉·麥吉森

45
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,670
現在我們來說說納賽爾·赫佳茲
It's time we talk about Nassir Hejazi.

46
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,440
你用這個名字從革命衛隊中挪用了4500萬美元
Whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million.

47
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,830
你現在成了自己國家的敵人
You are now an enemy of your own state.

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,240
我已經為你計劃好了
I got plans for you.

49
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,280
什么計劃
What plans?

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,110
我要把你放回伊朗
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.

51
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,790
從現在起  你為我們做事
From now on you work for us.

52
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,870
為我做事
For me.

53
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,380
我招募了一名高級伊朗情報人員
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset.

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,550
馬吉德·賈瓦迪
Majid Javadi.

55
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,250
中央情報局恐怖爆炸事件的策劃者
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA.

56
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,880
我們已經談過
We talked about this.

57
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,540
你得摒棄你那套冷戰時期的狗屁理論
The need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

58
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,150
這是可以扭轉一切的行動
This is a once in a lifetime operation

59
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,480
一輩子就這么一次機會
that can transform everything.

60
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,440
扭轉中東的整個局勢
The entire Middle East.

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,870
你說得像嗑藥嗑多了似的
You sound like you're fucking high.

62
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,060
你走之前我得問你件事
I need to know something before you leave.

63
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,980
我必須知道
I need to know...

64
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,900
炸彈是誰放的
Who's responsible for the bomb?

65
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,080
你知道他問了我什么
You know what he asked me?

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,770
誰轉移了炸彈
Who moved the bomb?

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,450
如果是布洛迪干的
If it was Brody.

68
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,230
那他為什么那樣問我
Now, why would he ask me that?

69
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,700
那似乎在暗示該問題存在分歧
That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.

70
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,850
你應該知道是這個人
You should know that the man

71
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,100
放了炸彈  移動了那臺越野車
who built the bomb and moved the SUV,

72
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,330
他并沒有像他們說的那樣死于爆炸
He didn't die in the explosion like they say.

73
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,510
據我所知  他還在美國
As far as I know, he's still in this country.

74
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
什么地方
Where?

75
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,260
我不知道
I don't know.

76
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,240
誰知道
Who does?

77
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
就是促成我們會面的人
The man that brought us together.

78
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,490
是你的律師  是本尼特嗎
Your lawyer? Bennett?

79
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,980
你怎么這么殷勤  我會多想的
What happened to you? I started to get worried.

80
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,470
太久沒表現  都生疏了
I'm out of practice.

81
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,400
看著就很好吃  索爾  謝謝
This looks delicious, Saul. Thank you.

82
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,450
我給你倒杯茶吧
Can I pour you a cup of tea?

83
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,810
好
Please.

84
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,190
你哪里弄到的
Where did you get these from?

85
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,750
這不就是我們
Aren't these the mugs

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,640
從菲律賓帶回的杯子嗎
we brought back from the Philippines?

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,090
最后的一對
The very last pair.

88
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,570
等事情徹底了結
When this is all over,

89
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,160
我想回到蘇祿海上那座小島
I'd like to go back to that island on the Sulu Sea.

90
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,660
你不必承諾任何事
You know, you don't have to promise anything.

91
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,520
真的  我都明白
Really. I understand.

92
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,320
有何不可呢
No, I don't see why not.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,700
我們可以開開心心的
We might actually have fun.

94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,890
不過看目前情況
Well, the evidence does seem to indicate

95
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,920
確實有實現的可能
that that is possible after all.

96
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,610
你今天可以
Is there any chance

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,120
在家待著嗎
that you could stay home today?

98
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,800
求之不得
There's nothing I'd rather do.

99
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,190
不過
But?

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,460
不過我今早得去白宮和麥克·希金斯見面
I got a meeting with Mike Higgins this morning at the white house.

101
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,030
-幾點  -九點半
- When? - 9:30.

102
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,050
那我看咱們還有
Well, that gives us an hour and a half...

103
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,390
一個半小時
by my count.

104
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,990
那當然
Yes, it does.

105
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,360
這里有發現
Okay, here's something.

106
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,190
馬克西米利安·阿齊茲博士  約旦人
Dr. Maximillian Aziz, Jordanian,

107
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,960
爆炸發生時曾在會場
was actually in the auditorium the time the bomb went off.

108
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,750
外勤還是內勤
Ops or intelligence?

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,550
內勤  分析跨國事務
Intelligence-- office of transnational issues.

110
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,720
他和利蘭·本尼特有什么關系
And what's his connection to Leland Bennett?

111
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,000
他寫了很長的報告
He wrote a lengthy analysis

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,860
分析他們公司幕后的客戶
of the firm's hip-pocket clients.

113
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,930
伊朗  敘利亞  阿塞拜疆的
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan.

114
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,560
不過是兩年前
This was two years ago.

115
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,300
基本不符合條件啊
It hardly fits the profile.

116
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,110
受過訓嗎  有沒有爆破經歷
Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?

117
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,630
沒有
No.

118
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,530
好吧  先加進名單里
All right, add him to the list anyway.

119
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,890
但我還是想問問
Yeah, which begs the question--

120
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,570
能確定是那炸彈客挪了布洛迪的車嗎
are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?

121
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,620
-看怎么講了  -怎么講
- Depends. - On what?

122
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,350
得看你信不信賈瓦迪
On whether or not you believe Javadi.

123
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,940
反正你信
Which you do.

124
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,190
我是信  但是光憑想當然
Which I do. But it takes more than an opinion

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,850
可沒法說服索爾
to put it in front of Saul.

126
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,960
沒錯
Right.

127
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,750
但我總覺得這是在白費力氣
You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.

128
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,690
這些材料都快被調查局翻爛了
The FBI have been through these files a hundred times.

129
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,150
那天在總部的每一個人
Anybody that was at Langley that day

130
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,770
都被從頭到腳查了一遍
has been turned inside-out and upside-down.

131
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,270
是  但那場爆炸肯定是現場某人搞的
Yeah, well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,630
我還是接受不了他們都已死去的事實
I still can't believe all these people are gone.

133
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,940
我也是
Yeah.

134
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,730
法拉去哪了
Where's Fara anyway?

135
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,850
她一個多小時前就該過來的
She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

136
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,170
請進  索爾
Come on in, Saul.

137
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,060
你好麥克  見到你很高興
Hey, Mike. Good to see you.

138
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,120
參議員
Senator?

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,760
好吧
Yeah.

140
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,800
參議員義正言辭地對你提出了控訴
The senator's made some serious allegations.

141
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,980
具體是
Which are?

142
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,620
說你把賈瓦迪藏進我們本土的安全屋
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house, on American soil

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,860
還送他出境
and let him go.

144
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,200
這是真的嗎
Do you contest that?

145
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,320
也是  也不是
Yes and no.

146
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,100
是怎么講
What's the yes?

147
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,520
我根本不知曉有任何逮捕賈瓦迪上校的指令
I'm not aware of any standing order to arrest Colonel Javadi.

148
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,080
-那你羈押他沒有  -羈押了
- Did you have him in custody or not? - I did.

149
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,990
我操他媽的  索爾
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul.

150
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,730
我們不光是送他走  麥克
We didn't just "Let him go," Mike.

151
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,210
還盤問了他
We debriefed him.

152
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,790
策反了他
Turned him.

153
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,630
才把他送回德黑蘭
Sent him back to Iran.

154
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,070
策反了他
You turned him?

155
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,410
他是我們的人了
He's ours.

156
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,800
根本沒法保證他會合作
With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.

157
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,370
他會的
He will.

158
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,620
你怎么知道
How do you know?

159
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,100
因為我了解他
Because I know the man.

160
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,670
因為他知道游戲規則
Because he knows the game.

161
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,760
這完全是臆斷
That is total speculation.

162
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,010
他說得對
He's right.

163
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,060
最近這個部門的工作
We haven't had a whole lot of success

164
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,230
基本沒什么成果
in that department lately.

165
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,040
現在有了  賈瓦迪是中情局史上
Well, we have now. Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset

166
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,320
最有價值的線人
in the history of the agency.

167
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,470
他指揮了總部爆炸案  并為其提供資金
He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.

168
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,550
那再好不過了  沒人會懷疑他
All the better if he did. He's above suspicion.

169
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,590
公開抓捕會給伊斯蘭領袖們
A high-profile arrest would've sent a clear message

170
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,730
傳遞明確的信息
to the mullahs.

171
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,520
你他媽放棄吧
Back the fuck down.

172
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,710
但此線人能讓我們了解
Instead we have a live source, keeping us current

173
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,290
伊朗核武器的最新進展
on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon,

174
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,740
及全球真主黨的一舉一動
on hezbollah operations all over the globe.

175
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,570
這事我怎么毫不知情
How come I never saw a finding on this?

176
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,250
我們在現場對事件做出反應
We were responding to events on the ground.

177
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,040
必須當場做出決定
The call had to be made in real time.

178
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,820
他心知肚明  這就是鬼扯
That is horseshit, and he knows it.

179
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,710
邁克  該把參議員請走了
Mike, I think it's time you excuse the senator.

180
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,950
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

181
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,370
我是來向幕僚長
I called this meeting to brief

182
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,370
匯報任務第二階段計劃的
the chief of staff on the second phase of the mission.

183
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,040
那你說啊
So, go ahead.

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,250
不行  你在場我不能說
I can't. Not with you present.

185
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,930
為什么
Why not?

186
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,020
因為你的密級比"行動級"低一等
Because your security clearance is one level below operational.

187
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,530
你看到他這副德行了吧
You see what I'm dealing with?

188
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,650
這人根本不服管  完全瘋了
The man is out of hand and out of control.

189
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,030
關于剛才那點  他是對的
And in this case, he's correct.

190
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,300
抱歉  參議員
I'm sorry, senator.

191
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,840
邁克  還有九天
Mike, in nine days,

192
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,480
我就是局長了
I'm the next DCI.

193
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,380
所以九天后  索爾就會告訴你
And in nine days, Saul will brief you

194
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,910
你需要知道的一切
on whatever you need to know.

195
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,110
但在那之前不行
But not until then.

196
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,550
-邁克  -參議員
- Mike... - Senator.

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,360
-邁克  -參議員  請離開
- Mike? - Senator, please.

198
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,800
該死的  索爾
Goddamn it, Saul.

199
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,140
過去一個半月
I spent the last month and a half

200
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,300
我都在給你倆牽線搭橋
arranging a marriage between you two.

201
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,090
我出局了  我知道
I'm out, I know that.

202
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,400
現在成定局了
You are now.

203
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,290
本來不必如此的
You didn't need to be.

204
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,980
為了賈瓦迪  也值了
Javadi was worth it.

205
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,960
算了  跟我說第二階段的計劃吧
All right, tell me about this phase two.

206
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,510
政權更迭嗎
Regime change?

207
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,740
這是最后
Eventually.

208
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,220
我們還在準備
We're setting the stage.

209
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,880
怎么做
How?

210
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,920
首先我們讓賈瓦迪升職
First we move Javadi up the chain of command

211
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,250
成為軍方的高級將領
into a senior military position.

212
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,620
要怎么做
How?!

213
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,840
繼續看
Keep reading.

214
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,640
抱歉我遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

215
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,910
堵車
Traffic.

216
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,090
我給你點了杯瑪奇朵  但估計都涼了
I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.

217
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,820
謝謝
Thank you.

218
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,070
沒關系
It's fine.

219
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,620
我收到你短信了
So I got your text.

220
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,350
一切都好嗎
Everything okay?

221
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,370
都好
Yes.

222
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,030
不好
No.

223
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,400
是...  索爾
It's... Saul.

224
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,880
他怎么了
What about him?

225
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,100
我們做了個決定
We've made a decision.

226
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,090
是我做了個決定
Well, I-I've made a decision.

227
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,610
再給我們的婚姻一次機會
To give the marriage another chance.

228
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,660
我
I...

229
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,070
要知道  做出這樣的決定并不容易
You have to know, it's not easy for me.

230
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,230
什么時候決定的
And when, uh, did you decide all this?

231
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,830
昨晚
Last night.

232
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,230
恕我直言  我們昨天還在麗思卡爾頓酒店的
Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday

233
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,080
套房里翻云覆雨
in a suite at the Ritz Carlton?

234
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,920
這是怎么回事
What's changed?

235
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,390
我剛跟你說了
I-I just told you.

236
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,700
怎么  你和索爾突然
What, suddenly Saul and you

237
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,370
決定和好了嗎
have decided to reconcile?

238
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,920
不是事發突然
It's not suddenly.

239
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,500
過去兩個月我們一直在談這事
We've been talking about it for the last two months.

240
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,730
你知道的
You know that.

241
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,800
我之前一直以為你已經放棄了
Well, I was under the impression that you had given up on that.

242
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,270
你們都放棄了
That you both had.

243
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,360
我也不清楚  也許吧
Well, I don't know, maybe we had.

244
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,250
那你就是有事瞞著我
Then there's something you're not telling me.

245
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,260
我和索爾做夫妻都35年了
We've been married 35 years.

246
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,440
我愛你
I love you.

247
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,890
別說這種話
Don't say that.

248
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,610
我很享受和你做愛的感覺
I love making love to you.

249
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,050
-我得走了  -米拉
- I have to go. - Mira...

250
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,630
再見
Good-bye.

251
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,170
他簽了嗎
He signed off?

252
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,690
這么說吧
Well, let's put it this way--

253
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,740
他認為該行動計劃有可取之處
He sees the merits of the operation.

254
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,060
所以他要讓總統過目
So he's taking it to the President?

255
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,830
-是的  -可取之處
- Yes. - Merits?

256
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,150
索爾  這計劃根本就是絕了
Saul, it's fucking genius.

257
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,410
如果能落實的話
If we can pull it off.

258
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,210
你什么時候出發
When are you leaving?

259
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,330
明早
Tomorrow morning.

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,900
卡莉知道你要去嗎
Does Carrie know you're going?

261
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,050
她根本猜不到
She can't even suspect it.

262
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,720
你們找我嗎
Heard you were looking for me.

263
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,940
剛剛在看你和賈瓦迪的談話筆錄
Yeah, we were just going over the transcript of your debrief

264
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,470
看看是否與
with Javadi to see if it supported

265
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,450
昨天他對卡莉敘述的內容相符
what he told Carrie on the tarmac yesterday.

266
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,090
結果呢
Which was?

267
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,190
當時移動越野車的嫌犯
That the man who moved the SUV

268
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,520
仍身處國內
is still in the United States,

269
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,830
而且和利蘭·本尼特的律所有聯系
and he's somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.

270
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,710
什么聯系
Connected how?

271
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,380
還不清楚
It's unclear.

272
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,560
希望你可以指點迷津
We were hoping you could shed some light.

273
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,370
賈瓦迪從未談及與本尼特的關系
Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.

274
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,300
那布洛迪呢
Well, what about Brody?

275
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,420
他提及過布洛迪嗎
Did he mention Brody?

276
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,840
在什么背景下
In what context?

277
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,200
背景是他充當炸彈襲擊者
In the context of being the Bomber.

278
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,250
他沒有詳細地說
Not in so many words, he didn't.

279
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,430
那他怎么說的
Well, what did he say?

280
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,360
他說據他所知  布洛迪沒有移動那輛車
He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.

281
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,810
據他所知
As far as he knows?

282
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,390
他對我不是這樣講的
That's not what he told me.

283
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,200
-好吧  -他很確定布洛迪不是元兇
- Okay. - He told me definitively it wasn't brody.

284
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,450
你想說什么
What's your point?

285
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,100
他對你我的敘述為何不一致
Why would he tell us two different stories?

286
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,170
你是在詢問我  還是質疑我
Is that a question or an accusation?

287
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,490
我只是希望你可以坦誠地回答
Well, I guess I'd like a straight answer.

288
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,930
如果賈瓦迪提到布洛迪沒有移動那輛車
And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car,

289
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,640
那為何不繼續逼問是誰動的
why not press him on who did?

290
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,830
你生氣是因為我有關于
Well, you're angry because I didn't share

291
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,960
布洛迪的事沒和你說  哪怕是不知真偽的消息
a conversation with you about Brody. An inconclusive one.

292
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,720
不  我生氣是因為你似乎完全不在乎
No, I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent

293
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
抓住真正的炸彈襲擊者
to catching the actual bomber.

294
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,680
隨你怎么說  我沒意見
Speak for yourself. I'm all for it.

295
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,160
很高興聽到你這么說
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

296
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,910
這么說  你們倆
So... You two...

297
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,560
已經有計劃了嗎
actually have a plan?

298
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,150
是的  我們想把這家伙給引出來
Yeah, we want to flush this guy out into the open.

299
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,260
怎么做
How?

300
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,170
你和利蘭·本尼特有私交  對吧
You know Leland Bennett personally, right?

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,120
我們在政治場合一起打過幾次高爾夫
We've golfed congressional a few times together.

302
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,300
而且我們都是北方基金會董事會成員
And we serve on the board of the northern foundation.

303
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,900
你愿意與他接觸嗎
How comfortable would you be making an approach?

304
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,010
放心交給我吧
Comfortable enough.

305
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,370
這么早就回來了
Oh, back already?

306
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,040
是的  感覺不舒服
Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

307
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,280
你可以走了
You can go.

308
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,790
今天我來照看他
I'll look after him today.

309
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,550
你確定
You sure?

310
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,220
是的
Yeah.

311
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
他怎么樣了
How is he?

312
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,850
能坐起來了
Oh, sitting up.

313
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,890
有進步
Progress.

314
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,760
是啊  但有點吃力
Yeah, slowly but surely.

315
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,210
明天見
I'll see you tomorrow.

316
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,270
注意身體
Feel better.

317
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,550
謝謝
Thanks.

318
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,900
老爸
Baba Joon.

319
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,300
今天我待在家里
I'm staying home today.

320
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,290
[波斯語]

321
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,250
我需要理由嗎
Do I need a reason?

322
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,460
[波斯語]

323
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,980
我不會丟掉工作的
I'm not going to lose my job.

324
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,510
[波斯語]

325
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,180
因為我確定
Because I'm sure.

326
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,980
說英語
Speak English.

327
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,110
[波斯語]

328
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,210
[波斯語]

329
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,500
說英語
English.

330
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,930
我來美國不是為了
I did not come to America

331
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,700
像個臟兮兮的阿拉伯人一樣流落街頭
to live in the street like a dirty Arab.

332
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,900
爸爸
Baba...

333
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,860
聽我說
Listen to me.

334
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,300
不會出現那種情況的
Nothing like that is going to happen.

335
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,220
沒人會把我們從家里趕出去
No one's going to throw us out of our home.

336
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,330
別擔心
Don't worry.

337
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,120
我的工作很穩定
My job's safe.

338
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,520
銀行的工作嗎
At the bank?

339
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,660
是的
Yes.

340
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,270
在投資銀行
At the investment bank.

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,990
如果你在銀行工作
If you work at the bank,

342
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,310
我們怎么會這么窮
why are we not rich?

343
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,350
里克特是個德裔姓氏
Richter. That's a German surname.

344
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,330
我父母出生在漢堡
My parents were born in Hamburg.

345
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,270
你會說德語嗎
Do you speak it?

346
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,810
當然會[德語]
Ja naturlich.

347
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,150
很實用
That's useful.

348
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,340
柏林有三家私人銀行是我們的客戶
We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.

349
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,930
我失陪一下可以嗎
Would you, uh, excuse me for just a moment?

350
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,990
當然
Of course.

351
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,620
你來早了
You're early.

352
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,060
我正在給律所面試新人
I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate.

353
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,700
我長話短說
It won't take long.

354
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,630
你沒出席上周的基金會
We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.

355
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,280
沒時間  工作太忙
Couldn't get there. Work.

356
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,260
應該為我們擠出時間
You gotta make time for us.

357
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,470
這個季度我多給你們一百萬還不夠嗎
It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter?

358
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,180
你了解我的  從不滿足
You know me. Never satisfied.

359
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,420
不過  我今天來不是為了這事
But... That's not what this is about.

360
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,540
-不是嗎  -不是
- No? - No.

361
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,560
聽起來不妙啊
Sounds ominous.

362
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,900
順便說一句  我現在負責反恐工作
I do terror now, by the way.

363
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,880
估計你還不知道
I'm not sure you knew that.

364
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,500
我好像真不知道
I don't think I did.

365
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,060
最近你們公司的名字浮了上來
Your firm's name has come up lately.

366
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,480
不止一次
More than once.

367
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,970
-好事還是壞事  -無可奉告
- In what light? - That I can't tell you.

368
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,760
那為什么告訴我此事
Then why tell me at all?

369
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,520
因為明天早上10點整
Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00,

370
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,780
我會參加一個高層絕密會議
I walk into a high level, top secret meeting

371
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,030
而你就是會議的議程
at which you are the agenda.

372
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,020
你想要我干什么
What do you want?

373
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,210
跟我們合作  坦白交代
Cooperate with us. Come clean.

374
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,800
避免陷入一場即將升級為...
Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a...

375
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,870
傷害性極高的調查
a bruising investigation.

376
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,580
知道嗎
You know what?

377
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,530
20年前的我也許會被你嚇尿
20 years ago, I might've fallen for that weak shit.

378
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,780
但現在
But today...

379
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,070
我隨你怎么查
Come after me if you want.

380
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,920
我沒什么好隱瞞的
I've got nothing to hide.

381
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,340
一輛紅色手推車

382
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,760
蠟燭是為誰點的
Who's the candle for?

383
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,250
所有逝去的人
All the departed.

384
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,540
你是東正教徒嗎
You orthodox?

385
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,920
前男友是
Old boyfriend.

386
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
聽說他之后辦過無數次喜酒
I hear the weddings go on forever.

387
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,180
喜酒的時間比婚姻還長  這笑話能樂一輩子
Longer than the marriages, so goes the joke.

388
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,080
本尼特先生需要你幫他查一個人
Mr. Bennett needs you to look into something for him.

389
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,640
我與馬吉德·賈瓦迪合作  不是利蘭·本尼特
My arrangement's with Majid Javadi, not Leland Bennett.

390
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,790
沒錯
Correct.

391
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,440
但本尼特先生今天得到的消息
But what Mr. Bennett heard today

392
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,380
也許會牽連到你
might reverberate onto you.

393
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,800
牽連我
Onto me?

394
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,660
需要我提醒你嗎
Do I need to remind you--

395
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,840
你已被外國政府招募為特工
You're a recruited agent of a foreign government?

396
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,000
我見過賈瓦迪  一次而已
I met with Javadi. Once.

397
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,610
我同意做他的顧問  而不是做特工
I agreed to consult with him. I'm nobody's agent.

398
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,060
不知道中情局能否理解其中的區別
I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction.

399
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,310
你得到什么消息了
What the hell do you know about it?

400
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,120
我知道該律所因為某些原因
I know the law firm appears to be

401
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,860
成為了被質詢的目標
the target of an inquiry of some kind.

402
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,980
這個我可不知道
Well, not one that I'm aware of.

403
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,620
這個警告是經私人渠道傳出來的
The warning was delivered personally,

404
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,540
沒通過官方渠道
outside of official channels.

405
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,660
是在局里工作的人嗎
By somebody who works at the agency?

406
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,710
本尼特先生的老熟人  是的
A longtime acquaintance of Mr. Bennett, yes.

407
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,260
那你想讓我做些什么
So what do you want from me?

408
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,980
確認一下這個報告
Confirm the report.

409
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,570
本尼特先生需要知道
Mr. Bennett needs to know

410
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,760
哪一部分業務處于調查之中
what part of the business is under investigation

411
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,950
以及他能做些什么以求自保
and what he can do to protect himself.

412
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,800
那可不容易
That's not going to be easy.

413
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,260
這么做的話不可能不讓人察覺
Not without setting off alarm bells.

414
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,550
你會想辦法搞定的
You'll figure something out.

415
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,800
讓我想辦法嗎
I'll figure something out?

416
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,570
而且顯然你的時間有限
And obviously there's a clock on this.

417
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,920
顯然極了
Obviously.

418
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,880
喂
Hello?

419
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
見效了
It's on.

420
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,580
跟我說說
Tell me.

421
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,530
我剛跟富蘭克林見過面
I just met with Franklin.

422
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,990
他們開始慌了
They're panicking over there.

423
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,110
讓他們慌吧
Well, let them.

424
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,150
24小時過后
Wait 24 hours...

425
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,800
用我們知道炸彈襲擊者的消息給他們一擊
then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.

426
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,270
好的
Will do.

427
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,650
索爾
Uh, Saul?

428
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,740
什么
Yeah?

429
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,130
在那之前我需要一點私人時間
I need some personal time between then and now.

430
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,560
行
You got it.

431
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,470
-謝謝  -你沒事吧
- Thanks. - You all right?

432
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
沒事
Yeah.

433
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,830
我應該早些告訴你布洛迪的情報
I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.

434
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,410
抱歉  我沒考慮周全
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

435
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,010
你死里逃生
You've been to hell and back.

436
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,810
我知道那對你有多重要
I know how important this is to you.

437
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,570
我欠你的  我們都欠你的
I owe you. We all do.

438
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,310
只要我們找到真正的炸彈襲擊者
Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...

439
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,330
我們會的
We will.

440
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,350
是卡莉嗎
Carrie?

441
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,090
是  你怎么知道的
Yeah. How'd you know?

442
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,180
你的語氣
Tone of your voice.

443
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,000
你從不和其他人那么說話
You don't talk to anyone else like that.

444
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,920
我都沒注意到
Huh, I wasn't aware.

445
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,850
準備開飯嗎
You ready to eat?

446
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,490
要不要開瓶酒
Should I open a bottle of wine?

447
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,520
好主意
That's a great idea.

448
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,300
聽著
Listen...

449
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,330
我得離開幾天
I got to go away for a few days.

450
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,250
是嗎
You do?

451
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,770
-是的  -什么時候
- Yeah. - When?

452
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,230
明天
Tomorrow.

453
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,040
索爾
Saul...

454
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,220
我知道
I know.

455
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,970
時機不太好
The timing's not great.

456
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,430
但你說只是幾天對嗎
But you said only a couple of days?

457
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,630
對  最多一周
Yeah. A week, at the most.

458
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,110
一周
A week?

459
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,350
要不是我非去不可
I wouldn't be going...

460
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,760
我也不會走的
if I didn't absolutely have to.

461
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,470
我可以跟你一起去
You know what, I could go with you.

462
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,290
-那就太棒了  -為什么不行呢
- Wouldn't that be great? - Why not?

463
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,170
這不是什么休閑旅行
It's not that kind of trip.

464
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,080
雖然我希望是
I wish it were.

465
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,640
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

466
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,080
為我們
To us.

467
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,130
你覺得惡心想吐嗎
You've been nauseous?

468
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,190
是的
Yeah.

469
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,040
一般來說現在應該已經沒那感覺了
Usually that goes away by now.

470
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,680
我也是這么聽說的
So I've heard.

471
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,380
我這里看得非常清楚
I'm getting a real clear image here.

472
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,930
你想知道是男孩還是女孩嗎
You want to know if it's a boy or a girl?

473
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,210
不想
No.

474
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,180
很抱歉最后才來找你
Sorry this is so last-minute.

475
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,220
不  很高興見到你
No, no, it's great to see you.

476
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,380
真是個驚喜
This is quite a surprise.

477
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,840
上周我還在院里見到了麥琪
I saw Maggie at the hospital last week,

478
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
她什么都沒提
she didn't say a thing.

479
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,700
她不知道
She doesn't know.

480
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,560
這跟你為什么第13周
Does that have anything to do with

481
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,960
才來做第一次孕檢有關系嗎
why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam 13 weeks then?

482
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,360
其實我沒打算要孩子
I didn't exactly plan this.

483
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,470
但你知道自己懷孕已經有一陣子了吧
But you've known for some time.

484
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,980
用藥情況如何
What about medications?

485
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,510
你現在在服用哪些藥
What are you currently taking?

486
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
現在什么藥都沒吃
Uh, at the moment, nothing.

487
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,050
明白了
I see.

488
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,970
我在"那地方"的一個月內每天服用
I was on 1,800 milligrams of lithium

489
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,650
1800毫克的鋰[起鎮定作用]
for about a month there.

490
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,850
當時事情有點失控
Things were a little out of control.

491
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,750
更早之前
And, uh, before that,

492
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,140
我喝過很多酒
there was a lot of drinking.

493
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,020
非常多
A... lot.

494
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,600
在你知道自己懷孕之后嗎
After you knew?

495
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,350
直說了吧  我壓根沒想過要養孩子
I haven't been painting a nursery, just put it that way.

496
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,230
你是在說你想做人流嗎
Are you telling me you wish to terminate?

497
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,530
我只想知道測試結果
I just want to know what the tests say.

498
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,000
是不是都還好
If things are okay.

499
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,360
你缺鐵
You're iron deficient.

500
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,210
這個我們可以補回來
We can fix that.

501
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,380
但你的血壓非常高
But your blood pressure's very high.

502
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,950
我的工作壓力非常大
I've been... really stressed at work.

503
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,940
你真的應該放松一下
Well, you really should be taking it easy.

504
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,760
是啊  我會試試看
Yeah, I'll try.

505
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,580
卡莉  我們有辦法
Carrie, we can manage this.

506
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,300
保證你和寶寶的健康
Keep you and the baby healthy.

507
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,310
并不神奇  只是一個過程
It's not magic, it's a process.

508
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,850
如果你想要順其自然  決定權在你
You want to leave it to chance, that's up to you.

509
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,980
否則你就得改變下自己的習慣
Otherwise you need to modify your behavior.

510
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,920
不是一或兩周后  或是等方便了再說
Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.

511
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,310
現在就得改
Now.

512
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,740
我現在做的事和孩子父親有關
What I'm doing, it has to do with the father.

513
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,510
我得把事情捋順
I need to make some things right.

514
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,200
這關系到很多人
It matters to a lot of people.

515
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,670
但這是不一樣的  卡莉
But this is different, Carrie.

516
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,630
你現在不是一個人了
You're not on your own anymore.

517
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,300
法拉
Fara?

518
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,520
西拉吉
Sherazi?

519
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,330
你是哪位
And you are?

520
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,710
總長辦公室的米切爾·克勞森
Mitchell Clausen. From the I.G.'s office.

521
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,770
什么總長
I.G.?

522
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,080
總監察長
Inspector General.

523
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,850
我能進來嗎
May I come in?

524
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,370
[波斯語]

525
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,590
[波斯語]

526
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,810
這邊請
This way.

527
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,830
你要喝的什么嗎
May I offer you something?

528
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,230
不用麻煩了
I'm good.

529
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,770
你連續兩天請病假
You called in sick two days in a row.

530
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,320
是怎么了呢
Is something the matter?

531
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,330
偏頭痛
Migraines.

532
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,330
但你昨天開車去上班了
Yet you drove into work yesterday.

533
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,890
對
Yes.

534
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,400
你就呆坐在停車場半個多小時
Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour

535
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,360
還是決定走了
before deciding to leave again.

536
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,150
我那時候希望頭疼能止住
I was hoping the headache would go away.

537
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,750
所以你才去了長山路1426號
Is that why you then paid a visit to 1426 Longhill Road,

538
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,420
也就是最近那起雙尸案的事發地點嗎
where the recent double murder happened?

539
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,340
貝塞斯達警局記下了你的車牌號
The Bethesda P.D. took down your license number.

540
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,280
中情局找了很多關系
The agency had to call in a lot of favors

541
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,310
才結了那個案子
to close that investigation.

542
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,460
你到那里去會引發嚴重后果
Your going over there jeopardized all that.

543
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,960
我想看看案發現場
I wanted to see where it happened.

544
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,020
為什么
Why?

545
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,470
我很不安
It upset me. I...

546
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,940
那事讓我非常煩亂
I was upset by it.

547
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,400
貝倫森局長對你表示出了
Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree

548
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,540
非同尋常的信任  西拉吉小姐
of confidence in you, Ms. Sherazi...

549
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,880
對你委以國家級的重要任務
entrusted you with matters of national importance.

550
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,170
那個我知道
I'm aware of that.

551
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,510
但你目前的心理狀態
But your current state of mind

552
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,310
使你對局長和中情局的忠誠度
makes your loyalty to him and to the agency

553
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,250
成為了有待商榷之事
a very live issue.

554
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,370
轉告局長不用擔心
Tell the director not to worry.

555
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,830
我很好
I'm fine.

556
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,000
明天上班的時候  你自己跟他說吧
You can tell him yourself. When you come into work tomorrow.

557
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,900
行
Yes.

558
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,050
貝倫森局長
Director Berenson?

559
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,530
這個貝倫森局長是誰
Who is this Director Berenson?

560
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,780
他是我上司
My boss.

561
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,870
他不是銀行里的人吧
But he's no banker, is he?

562
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,560
不是
No.

563
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,210
你依舊執迷不悟是吧
You went ahead, didn't you?

564
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,980
把我的話當耳旁風
In spite of everything I said?

565
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,800
爸爸  發生了恐怖襲擊
Baba, an attack happened.

566
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,080
那又怎樣
So what?

567
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,340
這又不關你的事
It's none of your business.

568
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,760
他們需要有國際金融背景
They needed Farsi speakers

569
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,190
又懂波斯語的人
with experience in international finance.

570
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,850
我必須幫他們
I had to help.

571
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,480
要是那些伊朗特工
And when the secret police find out

572
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,680
發現你為美國人賣命  那怎么辦
who you work for, what then?

573
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,330
我們在德黑蘭還有家人
We have family still in Tehran!

574
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,090
你的叔叔  嬸嬸  侄子
Your uncle, his wife and children.

575
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,790
到時候全部都要上黑名單  被處以絞刑
They will be added to the list of those to be hanged,

576
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,170
或者槍決
or shot!

577
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,050
[波斯語]

578
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,170
[波斯語]

579
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,250
我是美國人
I'm an American.

580
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,100
目標身份依舊不明  有可能就是
Target is still unknown, but presumed to be the man

581
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,310
在總部禮堂前安放炸彈的人
who put the bomb in position in front of the H.Q. auditorium.

582
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,140
這是保羅·富蘭克林
This is Paul Franklin,

583
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,770
現在拿他做木馬  卡莉
our stalking horse. Carrie?

584
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,830
下午晚些時候  我會放出假消息
Later this afternoon, I'll promote misinformation

585
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,140
希望能唬住富蘭克林
to Mr. Franklin in the hopes that

586
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,330
利用他引出炸彈襲擊者
he'll lead us to the bomber.

587
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,550
如果計劃奏效  我們見面之后
Our assumption is that after the meeting,

588
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,550
他會聯系上面尋求下一步行動指示
he'll reach out for instructions.

589
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,630
也就是這個人
To this man.

590
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,620
利蘭·本尼特  他們律所的一個大股東
Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm,

591
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,160
因此  本次行動從現在開始
which is why operation, from this moment forward,

592
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,840
針對這兩個人進行
requires a full complement of audio

593
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,670
全程音視頻監控
and visual surveillance on both subjects.

594
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,810
不需要我再重申
I don't have to tell you

595
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,610
抓住這兩個家伙的重要性了吧
what catching this guy would mean.

596
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,610
換句話說  就是不聲張  不妄動  不露面
In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.

597
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,730
好  開始行動
Okay, everybody. Game time.

598
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,490
你是對的
You were right.

599
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,780
快說
Tell me.

600
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,470
他們已經把總部爆炸案
They've connected your firm to the guy

601
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,140
牽罪到你們律所頭上了
who detonated the bomb at Langley.

602
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,880
不可能
That's not possible.

603
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,470
就這么告訴你  信不信由你
I'm telling you what I found out.

604
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,310
好吧
All right. Okay.

605
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,610
他們還認為
They're also under the impression

606
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,960
那個炸彈客現在仍在美國
that he's still here in the United States.

607
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,360
是不是真的
Is that true?

608
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,740
回答我  不然的話
Answer the question, or so help me,

609
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,250
我現在就拍屁股走人  你別想再見到我
I'll get up and you'll never see me again.

610
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,110
放松點  卡莉  深呼吸
Take it easy, Carrie. Take a breath.

611
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,830
別把我當孩子哄
No, don't patronize me.

612
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,220
好吧
Okay.

613
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,810
是真的  他還在美國
It's true, he's here.

614
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,740
具體在哪
He's here where?

615
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,660
你這么問就是說他們也沒掌握他的下落
I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.

616
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,580
對  他們還沒掌握
No, they haven't.

617
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,590
那他們到底掌握了些什么
Then exactly what do they have?

618
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,160
以同謀罪帶走利蘭·本尼特
A warrant pending before a FISA judge,

619
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,340
面見外國情報監督法法官的逮捕令
naming Leland Bennett a co-conspirator.

620
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,310
這份逮捕令還有多久生效
How soon before the warrant's active?

621
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,060
至少要好幾天
A few days, at least.

622
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,020
他們不會知道的  本尼特做事干凈利落
They won't find anything. Bennett's clean.

623
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,240
他一貫假人之手
He works through a cutout.

624
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,580
就是你
You.

625
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,580
別摻和了  讓我來處理這件事
Just lay low and let me handle this.

626
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,060
一直以來都是你在處理
You're the one who's been handling this,

627
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,990
恕我冒昧  你的話不怎么可信
so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.

628
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,560
他們查到我們朋友了
They have a line on our friend.

629
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,290
他們是怎么知道的
How'd they get onto him?

630
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,350
-不清楚  -那就去搞清楚
- No idea. - Well, find out.

631
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,000
有點太遲了  你不覺得嗎
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

632
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,980
你確定不是你這出了差錯嗎
You sure it wasn't your mistake?

633
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,880
你確定不是你的錯嗎
You sure it wasn't yours?

634
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,650
我們當時被要求向一名與政府有關系的
We were asked to provide material support

635
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,530
美國公民提供物資支持
to an American citizen with ties to the regime.

636
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,610
并沒有提及他與爆炸襲擊案有關
There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.

637
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,020
后來提到了
There was later.

638
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,950
你說得對
Yes, there was.

639
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,500
我們當時就該解決好
Well, we should've dealt with it then.

640
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,370
也許吧
Maybe.

641
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,880
他們知道他是誰嗎
Do they know his name?

642
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
不知道
No.

643
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,460
那我們暫且沒事
Then we're still okay.

644
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,850
你想讓他離開美國嗎
Do you want him out of the country?

645
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,100
是的
Yes.

646
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,950
最好換個新身份
Preferably with a new identity.

647
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,050
我該告訴他多少
How much do I tell him?

648
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,210
無所謂
I don't care.

649
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,770
把他弄出去就行
Just get him out.

650
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,540
富蘭克林發了條短信
Franklin's sending a text.

651
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,280
告訴我內容
Talk to me.

652
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,220
是個地址  還有時間
It's an address and time.

653
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,950
凌晨一點半在林奇堡的美景汽車旅館
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 01:30.

654
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,690
能查到他發給了誰嗎
Can we trace who he's sending it to?

655
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,020
不行  他的手機上裝了匿名軟件
No, there must be an anonymizer on the device.

656
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,400
別擔心  卡莉
Don't worry, Carrie.

657
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,890
只要我們盯住富蘭克林
As long as we stick on Franklin,

658
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,370
你就能找到那個炸彈襲擊者
you'll get your bomber.

659
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,830
他說得對
He's right.

660
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,680
我們派一支戰術小隊去汽車旅館
We'll send a tactical team to the motel.

661
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
富蘭克林一清理現場
They'll arrest the target

662
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,610
我們就逮捕目標
as soon as Franklin clears scene.

663
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,380
華盛頓特區交通部
D.C. Department of Transportation

664
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,020
告誡司機朋友們  由于市區街道封閉
is warning drivers to prepare for delays

665
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,540
從星期四至星期六需做好延誤準備
due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.

666
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,930
官方稱第十四街西北的南行方向
Officials say southbound 14th Street northwest

667
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,460
G大街與賓夕法尼亞大道之間的路段將被封閉
will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.

668
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,050
有情況
Here's something.

669
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,990
可能是他
It could be him.

670
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,190
沒錯  就是他  我看到了
Yeah, it is him. I've got a visual.

671
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,610
收到
Copy that.

672
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,470
他在干什么
What's he doing?

673
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,290
現在就在那干坐著
Just sitting there at the moment.

674
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,170
B小隊  你們看到他了嗎
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

675
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,970
我在屋頂上  監視著他的車
I'm looking down on the roof of his car.

676
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,180
任何人不許動
No one moves

677
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,340
直到富蘭克林離開
until Franklin leaves site.

678
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,670
收到
Copy that.

679
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,660
他在給誰打電話
He's calling someone.

680
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,300
在監聽了
We got it.

681
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,130
你來了嗎
Are you here?

682
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,450
就在外邊
Outside.

683
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,080
閃一下車燈
Flash your lights.

684
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,830
你在哪間房
What room are you in?

685
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,010
先告訴我怎么回事
First tell me what's happening.

686
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,970
你可能被暴露了
You may have been compromised.

687
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,070
他媽的怎么會這樣
How the hell did that happen?

688
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,340
已經發生了
It happened.

689
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,170
怎么發生的有區別嗎
What difference does it make how?

690
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,210
因為要完蛋的是我
Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.

691
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,880
要不是我先找到你
If I hadn't gotten to you first,

692
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,900
你就得蹲一輩子監獄了
you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.

693
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,020
你該感激我
Try on some gratitude.

694
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,640
你到底想不想收拾行李走人
You want your exfil package or not?

695
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,860
220號房
2-2-0.

696
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,200
這就來
Be right up.

697
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,290
操  他帶了武器
Shit. He's got a weapon.

698
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,840
什么
What?

699
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,700
他在裝消音器  天吶  你們看到了嗎
Now he's silencing it. Jesus, you seeing this?

700
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,990
他有槍
He's got a gun!

701
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,020
B小隊  能確定嗎
Bravo, can you confirm?

702
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,740
不能  我的視野很模糊
Negative. My view is obscured.

703
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,140
他不是要帶走炸彈襲擊者
He's not exfiltrating the bomber,

704
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,310
他要干掉他
he's taking him out.

705
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,500
你沒法確定  卡莉
You don't know that, Carrie.

706
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,400
裝消音器還能有別的原因嗎
Why else would he have a silencer?

707
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,980
她說得對  斯科特
She's right, Scott.

708
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,460
我看到武器了
I make the weapon.

709
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,240
我說了富蘭克林要干掉那個人
I'm telling you Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

710
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,950
聽我說  我們剛聽到本尼特告訴富蘭克林
Listen to me. We just heard Bennett telling Franklin

711
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,750
把那個家伙帶出國境
to get the guy out of the country.

712
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,570
或許本尼特改主意了
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

713
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,510
不管怎樣  我們得先確保讓富蘭克林繼續行動
Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.

714
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,430
那就任由他殺掉那個炸彈襲擊者嗎
So we just let him kill the bomber?

715
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,640
如果必要的話  是的
If necessary, yes.

716
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,530
我們之前不是這樣定的
That wasn't the deal.

717
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,150
那個襲擊者是唯一可以證明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

718
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,930
但現在制止富蘭克林會暴露你的身份
And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover

719
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,250
以及賈瓦迪回到德黑蘭的計劃
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

720
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,500
你知道的
You get that, right?

721
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,830
在富蘭克林離開前
Until Franklin is clear,

722
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,140
我要求全部小隊停止行動原地待命
I want all teams to stand down.

723
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,050
全部小隊原地待命  收到請回答
All teams, acknowledge standing down.

724
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,310
B小隊  原地待命
Bravo here, standing down.

725
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,890
A小隊  原地待命
Alpha team standing down.

726
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,280
卡莉  收到請回答
Carrie, acknowledge.

727
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,420
卡莉
Carrie?

728
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,700
卡莉  你他媽要干啥
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

729
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,660
卡莉  回到車里去
Carrie, go back to the van!

730
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,590
索爾答應過我  會讓這個人活著
Saul promised me this guy alive.

731
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,590
現在這里不是索爾說了算
Saul's not calling the shots here.

732
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,980
他答應過我的  該死  讓他接電話
He promised me, goddamn it. Get him on the phone!

733
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,090
沒這個時間  你快回去
There's no time. Turn around!

734
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,820
卡莉  馬上回去
Carrie, turn around now,

735
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,760
不然我們就要阻止你了
Or we will stop you.

736
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,740
這是對你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

737
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,400
聽他的話  卡莉
Listen to the man, Carrie.

738
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,970
B小隊  我現在授權使用武力
Bravo, I am authorizing force.

739
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,470
開槍射擊  我重復一次
Take the shot. I repeat:

740
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,310
-我來  -開槍射擊
- Let me. - ...take the shot.

741
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,560
卡莉  我是奎恩
Carrie, this is Quinn.

742
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,840
快離開
Break away.

743
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,100
對不起  我不能
I'm sorry. I can't.

744
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,600
你會搞死我們的  卡莉
You're fucking us, Carrie.

745
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,820
幾個月的努力  你的努力
Months of work. Your work.

746
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,280
我不在乎
I don't care.

747
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,050
卡莉  我會開槍的
Carrie, I will take the shot.

748
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,420
要來不及了  看在上帝的份上
Window's closing, for Christ's sake!

749
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,480
他進去了  富蘭克林進屋了
He's in. Franklin is inside.

750
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,430
把她帶走  趕緊的
Pick her up, for God's sake!

751
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,860
走  快走
Go! Go!

752
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,950
挪開
Move it!

753
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,630
我的老天爺
Jesus Christ.

754
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,760
你當時磨蹭什么呢
What was the delay?

755
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,820
我攔住她了  不是嗎
I stopped her, didn't I?

756
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,560
跟她一起走  我來監視富蘭克林
Go with her. I'm watching Franklin.

757
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,790
-接通醫院的電話了  -告訴他們
- Hospital's on the line. - Tell 'em we got

758
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,450
她左上臂受了槍傷
a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep,

759
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,080
大出血  可能是射穿動脈了
significant bleeding, might have clipped an artery.

760
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,200
堅持住  你會沒事的
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

761
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,590
真該死
Goddamn it!

762
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,290
媽的  他媽的
Fuck! Fuck!

763
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,040
-奎恩  -什么事
- Quinn... - Yeah?

764
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,380
那個炸彈襲擊者死了嗎
Is the bomber dead?

765
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,820
-死了  -媽的
- Yeah. - Fuck!

766
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,570
他媽的
Fuck!

767
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,440
一定出事了
Something's going on.

768
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,850
-沒錯  你中槍了  -是啊  少廢話
- Yeah, you got shot. - Yeah, no shit!

769
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,120
你開的槍
You shot me!

770
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,680
不是  我是說出了別的事
No, I mean, something's going on.

771
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,080
這次行動...  這次行動說不通
None of this... none of this makes sense.

772
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,730
呼吸  好嗎  深呼吸  拜托
Just breathe, okay? Deep breaths. Come on.

773
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,040
過來
Come here.

774
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,920
近一點
Come closer.

775
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,610
索爾在他媽什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

776
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,910
您的旅途順利嗎
You have a good flight?

777
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,110
還不錯
Yeah, fine.

778
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,370
至少把我送過來了
Got me here.

779
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,490
這邊走
Hey. This way.

780
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,130
在這里等著
Wait here.

781
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,340
再過一個月  這里會更熱的
In another month, it's even hotter.

782
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,810
你想不到有多熱
You won't believe.

783
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,540
或許我會用那一千萬美元裝一臺空調
Maybe I use the $10 million to put in an air conditioner.

784
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,180
在那里
There.
