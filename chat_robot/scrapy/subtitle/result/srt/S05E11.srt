1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,130
可以带我们进入他的秘密实验室
That could lead us to his secret lab.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,510
我们被攻击了
We were attacked.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,840
被谁
By who?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,340
我还指望你告诉我
I was hoping you could tell me.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,770
一小时内让机器运作起来
Get the device operational within one hour

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,140
否则我就杀了他
Or I will kill him.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
懂么
Do you understand?

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,640
你们早就找到了attero设备
Somehow, you've found the attero device.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,940
什么
What?

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,270
我们出不去了
We're locked in.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,340
等等  这个设备有问题  很严重很危险
Wait, there's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device,

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,810
我们得和你上司谈谈
And we need to talk to your boss--

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,710
如果能量再继续堆积
If the power continues to build like this,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,010
星门将会超过负荷
The gate will reach critical overload

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,440
最终将导致爆炸
And most certainly explode.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,710
所有人撤离
Everyone that doesn't need to be here,

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,240
到城市另一边
Get to the edge of the city.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,740
这还不够
It's not enough.

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,970
快点
Move quickly.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,040
我们得把人群
We have to get everyone

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
撤离至塔底
To the lower levels of the tower

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,210
以确保每个人...
To make sure that everyone will be--

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,640
谢帕德中校  你没事吧
Colonel sheppard, are you all right?

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,240
约翰
John?

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,540
泰勒
Teyla!

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,670
上面有几个人
How many were up there?

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,310
两个
Two.

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,910
我去找人来
I'll go get my people.

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,540
约翰
John?!

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,040
我走时他们就在这儿
They were right here when I left them.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
如果爆炸产生的热量过大
If the explosion was hot enough,

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,070
我们也许什么都找不到
There might not be anything left for us to find.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,340
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

34
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,040
约翰
John!

35
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,470
我们没躲好
We didn't take cover.

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,240
你还好吗
Are you all right?

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,440
到底怎么样
Are you all right?

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,840
我的耳朵
My ears...

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
有玻璃插到我背上了
I think I've got a some glass in my back.

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,640
玛丽
Marie...

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,240
星门没保住  控制室也完了
We lost the stargate, we lost the control room.

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,840
真糟糕
That's bad.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,040
你在就好
But we did not lose you.

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,910
不幸中的万幸
That's good.

45
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,110
好了
Okay.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,770
您要求的部队已经传送上船
All the troops you've requested have beamed onboard.

47
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,510
叫他们把剩下的人
Have them round up the rest of the humans

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,070
通通赶到停泊舱软禁起来
And confine them to one of the hangar bays.

49
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,640
通知母舰在这儿等
Inform our hive to wait for us here,

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,510
无论如何
And under no circumstances

51
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,110
也不能启动超光速推进系统
Are they to activate their hyperdrive.

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,840
遵命
Yes.

53
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,910
我们去哪儿
Where are we going?

54
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,370
亚特兰蒂斯
Atlantis.

55
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,840
去找班克斯和她的组员
I need you to get banks and her team

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,570
在毁坏区建一个副控制室
To set up an auxiliary control room below the damaged areas.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,500
他们已经着手了  你怎么样
They've already begun. how are you?

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
至少还活着
I'm alive.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,670
已经不错了
You know, that's good for now.

60
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,670
对这一切我还是一头雾水
I still do not understand what happened.

61
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,570
星门爆炸了
The gate blew up.

62
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,070
我多少也猜到了
That much I surmised.

63
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,070
为什么
But why?

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,940
不知道
I don't know.

65
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,570
该死的麦凯哪儿去了  要找他时就不见了
Where the hell's mckay when you need him, huh?

66
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,240
好吧  这个设备
All right, so the device

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,340
制造出极其特别的子空间"干扰"
Creates a very specific subspace "turbulence"

68
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
使幽灵人无法
That makes it impossible

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,840
启动超光速推进系统
For the wraith to operate their hyperdrives.

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
你刚刚说过了
You said that already.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,540
但存在副作用
But there's a side effect.

72
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,170
杰纳斯提到的那个"未知副作用"
The "unforeseen" one that janus mentions.

73
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,440
是啊  这里肯定见不着
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here

74
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
这破星球连个星门都没有
Because there's no stargate on this planet.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
你到底想说什么  罗德尼
What's the point, rodney?

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,640
尽管这个子空间干扰
Although the subspace turbulence

77
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,700
只对幽灵的超光速推进系统产生影响
Only affects the wraith's hyperdrive systems,

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,540
它所产生的辐射也是很危险的
It creates a very dangerous type of radiation

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,440
那个
That, well...

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,940
也会扰乱对星门的基本操作
The messes with the basic operation of the stargates.

81
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,800
星门?  对所有的都有影响吗
Stargates? what, as in all of them?

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,740
是的  飞马星系网络系统里的所有星门
All of the stargates in the pegasus network, yes.

83
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
你刚刚说"扰乱"  什么意思
And when you say "messes with," you mean what?

84
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,870
听着  一旦启动
Look, when dialed,

85
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,240
星门内部就会积蓄能量
Power will build up inside the gate

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,740
直到超过负荷
Until it overloads.

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,470
你是说
So you're saying

88
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,700
只要杰纳斯的装置在运行
That as long as this janus device is running,

89
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,900
一旦有人开启了星门
Every time someone dials a gate in the entire galaxy--

90
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
就会爆炸
It'll explode.

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,170
如果不关掉的话
Millions of people will die

92
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,400
成千上万人就会死于非命
If we don't shut that thing down.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,700
醒得正是时候  伍尔希先生
Good timing, mr. woolsey.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,400
听着  我不知道你们到底误解了什么
Look, I don't know what it is you think we've done,

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,140
但我保证
But I assure you--

96
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,670
带我们离开超空间
Take us out of hyperspace.

97
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,440
我们还没抵达亚特兰蒂斯
We haven't arrived at atlantis yet.

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,300
亚特兰蒂斯
Atlantis?

99
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,070
已经进入可通信范围
We're within communications range.

100
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,240
不过我们不想离得太近
We don't want to get too close.

101
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,570
带我们出去
Take us out.

102
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,100
我还指望你意识到了呢
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,500
一切正常了吗
Well, are we up and running?

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,540
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,200
我们已将城里的主要控制器
We've routed all the city's main controls

106
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,400
弄到这个房间里了
Into this room.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,570
总算有点样子了
At least we're not blind anymore.

108
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,770
是啊  但我们损失惨重
No, but we're severely crippled.

109
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,900
没有星门
Without the gate

110
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,170
没法靠近代达罗斯号
Or the ability to reach the daedalus,

111
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,270
就无法接近M6H-987
We have no way of getting to m6h-987

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,640
也无法营救罗德尼和杰克森博士
Or rescuing rodney and dr. jackson.

113
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,170
那我们怎么办
What should we do?

114
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,570
谁能连上代达罗斯号我就给他5块钱
5 bucks to anyone who figures out how to contact  daedalus.

115
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,240
谢帕德中校
Uh, colonel sheppard?

116
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
你有办法了  班克斯?
You got an idea, banks?

117
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,800
没有  但处在子空间的代达罗斯号在呼叫我们
Well, no, but I am being hailed by the  daedalus on subspace.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,640
这算吗
Does that count?

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
技术上说这不是你的点子
Technically that's not your idea,

120
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
但是好极了
But good enough.

121
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,670
连接到大屏幕上
Put 'em on screen.

122
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,570
一会儿把钱给你
I'll pay you later.

123
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,140
代达罗斯号  很高兴...
Daedalus, it's good to, uh--

124
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,140
谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard.

125
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,100
到底发生了什么
What the hell's going on?

126
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,570
卡德威尔在哪儿
Where's caldwell?

127
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,270
我把他们都免职了
I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty.

128
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,570
他离我们有多远
How close are they?

129
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,440
乘飞船去还到不了
Not close enough to go by jumper.

130
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,340
别担心
Don't worry,

131
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,440
我很愿意
I'm more than willing

132
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,870
把船和船员都还给你们
To return this ship and its crew to you.

133
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,340
与之交换的是
In exchange for what?

134
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,670
被你们激活的设备
You've activated the attero device.

135
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,740
请给我关了
I need you to shut it down

136
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,570
并立刻告诉我它的位置
And give me its location immediately.

137
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,540
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,440
你以前很聪明的
It was very clever of you,

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
把我的船引诱到
Luring me and my ship

140
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
子空间去
Out into the open

141
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,300
然后看看是否管用
So you could see for yourself if it worked.

142
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,770
什么是否管用
If what worked?

143
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,500
我承认  从某种程度上来说我印象深刻
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed.

144
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,240
一万年前  我眼睁睁的看着
I was there 10,000 years ago

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,970
古人第一次使用attero设备
When the ancients first tried to use it,

146
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,640
但他们最终没能坚持
But they didn't have the stomach to leave it on

147
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,000
因为他们意识到
Once they realized

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
许多宝贵的星门
How many of their precious stargates

149
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
因此毁于一旦
It would destroy...

150
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,700
造成无辜生命的流逝
How many humans it would kill.

151
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,370
听上去像杰纳斯会干的事
Sounds like something janus would have worked on.

152
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,940
告诉我设备的位置
Give me the location of the attero device,

153
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,040
一旦将其摧毁
And once I have destroyed it,

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
我就把船员还给你
I will return this crew to you.

155
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
听着  不是你想得那样
Look, it's not what you think.

156
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,940
我们跟这事没关系
We have nothing to do with this.

157
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,900
你们每浪费一分钟
Every minute that goes by

158
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,640
不告诉我设备在哪儿
Without you telling me where this device is,

159
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,370
就有一个队员被杀
I will kill a member of your expedition.

160
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,100
现在开始计时
Your time starts now.

161
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,300
给我点时间
Give us a second.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,300
我觉得不能现在就开始计时
I don't think this should count toward the minute.

163
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,240
我是说  目前为止他还没
I-- I mean, he didn't say no...

164
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,940
说不
Yet.

165
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,700
有没有可能...  那东西叫啥
What are the odds that-- what's this thing called?

166
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,840
attero设备
Uh, attero device.

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
有没有可能
What are the odds

168
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
那玩意是在罗德尼开启的
That this thing was at the other end

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,040
子空间连接的另一端
Of the subspace link that rodney opened

170
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,000
当他进入实验室时
When he went to that lab?

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,970
在M6h-987?  很有可能
M6h-987? very likely.

172
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,200
也很有可能
It's also very likely

173
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
他和杰克森博士就是在那儿被抓的
That's where he and dr. jackson were taken.

174
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
一定是杰纳斯在幽灵战争期间
It must be a weapon that janus developed

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,140
开发的武器
During the wraith war.

176
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,170
能炸飞星门的武器?
A weapon to blow up stargates?

177
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,470
我很怀疑这是它的原型
I doubt that was its original design.

178
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,870
貌似这个战略不太有效
It doesn't seem like an effective strategy.

179
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,340
极其讨厌的副作用
So, a nasty side effect.

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,270
这也许是他们停产的原因
That's probably why they stopped production.

181
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,400
无论他们从实验室拿走了什么
Whatever the aliens took from the lab

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,040
用来再次激活设备
Allowed them to reactivate it again.

183
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,100
无论是什么
Whatever it is,

184
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,270
托德貌似一定要阻止它
Todd seems pretty keen to stop it,

185
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,570
不惜冒险劫持代达罗斯号
Enough to risk taking the  daedalus.

186
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,070
是啊  但我们不能给他地址
Yes, but we can't give him the address.

187
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
如果他弄到手
If he gets it,

188
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,570
就会毁掉一切阻止他的人
He'll destroy everything in his path,

189
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,170
包括罗德尼和杰克森博士
Including rodney and dr. jackson.

190
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,900
约翰  我们别无选择
John, we don't have a choice.

191
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,170
我们的防护盾
Our shield was able

192
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,570
抗得住爆炸的冲击
To take the brunt of the explosion,

193
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,000
但要是发生在其它星球上
But if this is happening on other worlds,

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,440
这会害死千千万万的人
It could kill millions.

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,970
连线吧
Put 'em back on.

196
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,640
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

197
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,840
我们不是幕后的主使者
We're not the ones behind this.

198
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,670
很好
Very well.

199
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,400
等一下
W-w-wait!

200
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
我是说  我们不是幕后主使者
I said, we're not the ones behind this,

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,000
但是我们有你想要的东西
But we may have what you need.

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,970
昨天亚特兰蒂斯被一个
Atlantis was attacked yesterday,

203
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,900
我们从来没有遇到过的种族攻击了
By a race we have not encountered before.

204
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,270
他们偷走了一部分古人科技
They stole a piece of ancient technology.

205
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,270
我们认为这是这个attero设备
We believe this could be a component

206
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,300
的组成部分
To this attero device.

207
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,540
我们成功地找到了他们
We managed to track them.

208
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,940
你过来  带上我  我会亲自带你去那里
You swing by here, pick me up, I will take you there myself.

209
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,440
然后给你创造机会伙同飞弹
And give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive

210
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
去抢走我的超光速推进器?
With one of your drones?

211
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
我觉得不可能
I think not.

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,370
为什么我要这么做
Why would I do that?

213
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,490
现在你是这个星系中仅剩的
Right now, you're one of

214
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,600
的少数人之中的一员
the few people in the galaxy

215
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,670
拥有这可以解决这个问题的飞船
With a ship capable of dealing with this problem.

216
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,440
我希望就这么一直保持下去
And I intend to keep it that way.

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
约翰·谢帕德  把你们掌握的坐标传过来
John sheppard, transmit the coordinates

218
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,170
要不然我就当这你们的面
Or I will feed on mr. woolsey

219
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,340
吃掉伍尔希先生
Before your eyes!

220
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,000
传过去吧
Do it.

221
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,470
我们拿到了
We have it.

222
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,270
后会有期
We'll be in touch.

223
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,900
你真的觉得这可行吗
You really think that's going to work?

224
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,640
难道你有更好的方法?
You got a better idea?

225
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,140
我们在太空船上
We're on a space ship.

226
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,540
这些门的设计是密不透风的
Those doors are designed to be airtight.

227
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,200
就是说连空气
That means something as tiny as air

228
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,470
都进不去
Can't even get through.

229
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,740
难道你觉得你能把它扒开吗
How do you think you will?

230
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,440
对啊  我比空气大多了
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.

231
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,970
...这正是我的意思
Yeah... that's kind of my point.

232
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,740
看到了吧
See?

233
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,640
若楠
Ronon!

234
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,270
你还好吧
You okay?

235
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,270
没事
Yeah.

236
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,640
好咧  来吧
All right. come on.

237
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,170
等一下  你想怎样  我们要去哪
Wait. what's our plan? where are we going?

238
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,570
找到进入的梯子
Get to an access ladder,

239
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,000
去到二楼的工程舱
Head down two floors to the engineering rooms.

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,140
然后我们把这飞船弄瘫
Then we cripple the ship.

241
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,100
你知道怎么做这些事吗
You... know how to do all that?

242
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,470
知道啊  你不知道吗
Yeah. don't you?

243
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,270
不是很清楚
Not really.

244
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,900
学着点哈
Watch and learn.

245
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,240
超空间之门开启
Hyperspace window opening.

246
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
你觉得是托德改变主意了吗
Think todd changed his mind?

247
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,800
他可能已经发现我们有多没用了吧
He might have realized just how crippled we are.

248
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,970
有人呼叫
We're being hailed.

249
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,570
接进来
Put it up.

250
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,700
我的名字是堪塔娜·拉布雷  我是太空游历者
My name is katana labrea. I'm a traveler.

251
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,000
拉林派我来的
Larrin sent me.

252
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,470
一切都还好吗
Well, is everything all right?

253
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,140
事实上  不好
No, as a matter of fact, it's not.

254
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,570
拉林希望你能告诉我们
Larrin was hoping you could tell us

255
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,240
为什么星门爆炸了
Why the stargates are blowing up.

256
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,260
你  跟我来
You. come with me.

257
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,290
我  为啥
Me? why?

258
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,290
我们俩都跟你走  不用那枪指着我们
Whoa. we'll both go. no need for that.

259
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,990
不是你
No.

260
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,190
我猜...可能轮到你
I guess it... just must be your turn

261
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,260
去那个"健身室"了
To use the fitness room.

262
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,390
是啊
Right.

263
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,590
祝你好运
Good luck.

264
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,020
你也是
You too.

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,990
这是我们在行星
It was the first colony we'd built

266
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,160
第一次开辟的一块聚居地
On the surface of a planet

267
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
经过了这些世代
In a hundred generations,

268
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,420
它突然升高了
And it was leveled in an instant.

269
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,290
那时候我还在轨道中
I was in orbit when it happened.

270
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,260
我可以从太空中看到整个的爆炸过程
We could see the explosion from space.

271
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,190
我从来没用看过比这个威力更大的东西了
I've never witnessed anything that powerful.

272
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,660
嗯  这个门是用naquadah做成的
Mm. the gates are made of naquadah.

273
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,190
当它们不稳定时
When they become unstable,

274
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,960
所造成的爆炸是无法估量的
The size of the explosion is unimaginable.

275
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,990
我们死了3000人
We lost 3,000 people

276
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,060
还有两艘船
And two ships,

277
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,360
包括我们古人飞船
Including our ancient vessel.

278
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
拉林本来想自己来的  但是
Larrin would have come herself, but--

279
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,890
不用了  我想她现在已经够忙的了
No, I'm sure she's got her hands full.

280
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,590
听着  这些异族人  不管他们是谁
Look, these aliens or whoever they are,

281
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,690
他们绑架了我们两个伙伴
They have two of our people hostage.

282
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,860
必须阻止他们
They need to be stopped.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,890
我们已经知道他们的方位坐标了  可是我们没用飞船
We have coordinates, but... we have no ship.

284
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,320
那么我想我来得刚刚好
Then I guess I got here just in time.

285
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,790
这正是我想要听到的
That's what I wanted to hear.

286
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,790
泽兰卡  你跟我来
Zelenka, you're with me.

287
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,500
约翰...
John--

288
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,220
泰勒  我需要你守在这里  好吗
Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right?

289
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
如果托德的奸计得逞
The second todd's done,

290
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,120
就没有人能阻止他
There's nothing stopping him

291
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,220
不止是让飞船改变方向
From turning that ship around

292
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,590
他甚至会冲着亚特兰蒂斯而来
And making a run at Atlantis.

293
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,690
我需要有一个我可以信任的人守着这里
I need somebody I can trust to stay in charge here.

294
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,090
祝你好运
Good luck.

295
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,860
我去把门锁上
I locked the door.

296
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,190
这不需要太多时间的
This won't take long.

297
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,590
那么我们要怎么做
So what do we do?

298
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,760
让整个控制系统瘫痪
Bring up the main control systems

299
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,960
还是一个个来
And disable them one by one?

300
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,860
有一个好方法
That's one way to go.

301
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,520
你还得把它们锁在主机之外
Well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe, though.

302
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,220
不然的话他们可以东山再起的
Otherwise they could just turn them back on again.

303
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,290
你有密码之类的东西吗
Do you have some sort of a passcode

304
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,360
让我们可以一次性
To make sure they're locked out

305
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,890
锁定系统
Once and for all?

306
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,260
没哦
Nope.

307
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,990
那你到底在想什么
Well, then, what are you thinking?

308
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,190
我们和超空间失去连接了
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

309
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,890
我知道
I see that, yes.

310
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,590
为什么
Why?

311
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,860
我不清楚
I'm not sure.

312
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,590
我们的电脑认为  这是战争损坏
The computer seems to think it's due to battle damage.

313
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,960
领部队去工程舱
Get our troops down to the engineering room.

314
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,090
有人在破坏飞船
Someone's sabotaging this ship.

315
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,620
你在干什么?
Wh-- what are you doing?

316
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,020
让飞船瘫痪啊
Disabling the ship.

317
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,460
我们不能就这样轰掉主系统
You can't just blast away at vital systems like that!

318
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
如果把这艘船的生命供给系统毁掉怎么办
What if you take out the life support system?

319
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,490
别担心
Don't worry.

320
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,860
生命供给系统在那一块
The life support system is that tray.

321
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,090
这个我还是很确定的
At least, I'm pretty sure it is.

322
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,490
行了  我们已经和超空间断开了
Okay, we're out of hyperspace.

323
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,660
这就够了  来吧
That's enough. come on.

324
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,660
你想跟我谈谈吗
You wish to speak to me?

325
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,020
你是首领吗
You're the leader?

326
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,060
我们得马上停了这设备
You need to shut this device down Immediately.

327
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,890
我不会这么做的
No, I do not.

328
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,520
好吧  我能理解为什么你们要毁灭幽灵人
Okay, look, I understand wanting to destroy the wraith.

329
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
真的
I do.

330
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,590
可是不能这么做
But this isn't the way.

331
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,690
我不同意
I disagree.

332
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,860
我不知道你懂不懂
Okay, I don't know if you're aware of this or not,

333
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,720
这个仪器有致命的副作用
But this device has a serious side effect.

334
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,720
在它启动的时候星门会爆炸
It makes stargates explode when they're activated.

335
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,060
我们又不用星门
We do not use the stargates.

336
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,460
好吧
Okay.

337
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,320
可是其它人要用
But lots of other people do.

338
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,720
他们的生死与我们无关
They are of no concern to us.

339
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,720
所以你们就任由他们这么死掉
So you're just going to let them die,

340
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,120
这星系里千千万万的人们?
Millions of people, across the galaxy?

341
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,820
你们不比幽灵人好到哪里去
You're no better than the wraith.

342
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,060
可能吧  可这是我们唯一的选择
Perhaps. but we have little choice.

343
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,190
为什么
Why?

344
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,790
我们的行星正在消亡
Our planet is dying.

345
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,220
它不再适合我们的生存了
It can no longer sustain us.

346
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,120
世世代代以来这是第一次
For the first time in countless generations,

347
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,490
我们必须再一次冒险进入飞马星系
We must venture out into this galaxy again,

348
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,490
而它现在被幽灵人统治着
A galaxy controlled by the wraith.

349
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,090
不是他们死  就是我们亡
If we do not destroy them, they will destroy us.

350
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,760
我们必须要这么做
This is the way it must be.

351
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,920
幽灵人比我们抢先一步了
The wraith are ahead of us.

352
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,260
他们一到那个行星
As soon as they get to that planet,

353
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,420
就会动用所有的武器
They'll open up with everything they've got.

354
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,860
相信我  他们才不会去管老百姓的死活
Trust me, they ain't going to be worried about collateral damage.

355
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,520
想要营救我们朋友的唯一的机会
The only chance we have to save our friends

356
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,990
就是要赶在幽灵人前头到达那里
Is to get there first.

357
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,320
你想要快一点吗
You want speed?

358
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,260
那你们来对地方了
You've come to the right place.

359
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,590
这就是你们的工程舱?
This is your engineering room?

360
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,620
是的
That's right.

361
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,990
虽然看起来不像
It may not look like much,

362
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,290
相信我
But trust me,

363
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,020
我们可以超过很多船队
We can outrun most anything in the traveler fleet.

364
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,260
米拉?
Mila?

365
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,420
这是谢帕德中校和泽兰卡博士
This is colonel sheppard and dr. zelenka.

366
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,460
他们从亚特兰蒂斯来的
They're from atlantis.

367
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,690
米拉是我们的主工程师
Mila's our chief engineer.

368
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,620
她一定没有16岁
She can't be more than 16 years old.

369
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,460
事实上  她只有15岁
15, actually.

370
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,290
从她4岁起
She's been working on ships

371
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,690
她就开始在这里工作了
Since she was four.

372
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,420
我们要飞得越快越好
We need to get where we're going as fast as possible.

373
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,620
我希望你竭尽所能
I want you to do whatever you can

374
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,320
去最大化超光速推进器的功率
To maximize hyperdrive output.

375
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,660
没问题
No problem.

376
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,820
嗯  泽兰卡
You know, uh, zelenka

377
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,560
也懂得一些超光速推进器方面的东西
Knows a thing or two about hyperdrives himself.

378
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,490
我相信他很乐意帮忙的
I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a hand.

379
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,520
天知道能不能帮的上
Who knows,

380
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,560
可能可以学到些东西
Maybe you'll learn a thing or two.

381
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,590
损害很厉害
The damage is significant.

382
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,660
开始维修
Begin repairs.

383
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,090
attero设备运作中的每一分钟
Every second The attero device is active,

384
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,890
我们都在不停的失去越来越多的同盟
We risk losing more and more of our alliance.

385
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,160
我已经注意到了
It has come to my attention

386
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,260
已经有某些原先的船员
That someone from the original crew

387
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,560
逃了出来
Has eluded capture.

388
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,720
你们的自由已经严重影响到我们
Your freedom has become a nuisance.

389
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,320
立刻自首
Turn yourself in immediately

390
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,690
不然我就杀掉你们的朋友
Or we will begin killing off your friends

391
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,560
一个接一个
One by one.

392
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,290
给你三分钟
You have three minutes to comply.

393
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,160
他在虚张声势
He's bluffing.

394
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,020
才不是
No, he's not.

395
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,960
你去哪里
Where are you going?

396
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,060
我去自首
I'm turning myself in.

397
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,320
你不能这么做
No, you're not.

398
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,490
他要开始大开杀戒
He's going to start killing people.

399
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,490
他会杀了你
He's going to kill you.

400
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,220
希望不会
Well, I hope not.

401
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,460
为了船上的人
We need to get armed,

402
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,890
我们得武装起来  夺回飞船控制权
Free these people, and take this ship back.

403
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,790
正是
Exactly.

404
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,820
我去自首  他就以为我们全被他抓起来了
I turn myself in, and he'll think he's got us all.

405
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,160
这样你就可以争取时间
It buys you the time you need

406
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,320
做你该做的
To do what you've got to do.

407
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,490
不  我不会让你冒这个险
No. no, I'm not letting you do it.

408
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,360
若楠  听我说
Ronon, listen to me--

409
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,190
珍妮弗
Jennifer,

410
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,490
不行
No.

411
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
好的
Okay.

412
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,590
你说得对
You're right.

413
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,820
好的
Okay.

414
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
跟我来
Come on.

415
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,590
反正我们也快到了
We're almost there anyways.

416
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,820
这事关千千万万人们的性命
We're talking about the deaths of millions of people.

417
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,420
你怎能如此冷酷无情
How can you be so callous?

418
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,120
你还惧怕什么
And what is it you're so afraid of?

419
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,860
什么你还穿着战斗的盔甲
Why-- why are you still in your battle armor?

420
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,420
我伤不了你
I can't hurt you.

421
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,120
我知道你不是人类
I know you're not human.

422
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,290
也决不是幽灵人
You're definitely not wraith.

423
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,290
如若你是古人
And if you were an ancient,

424
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,790
你根本不需要我们帮你
You wouldn't have needed our help

425
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,260
激活装置
To activate the device.

426
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,120
你究竟是何方神圣
So... what are you?

427
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,620
你是阿斯加德族的
you are asgard?

428
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,950
你以前见过我们这一种族的吗
You've encountered our kind before?

429
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,850
不仅仅是见过
No, not just encountered.

430
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,490
还共事过
I've worked with them,

431
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,450
还和其中几个成了朋友
Even called a few of them my friends.

432
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,850
的确
Indeed.

433
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,420
当然  我所认识的阿斯加德
Of course, the asgard I knew were a noble race

434
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,920
是个乐于帮助人类的
Who actually helped the human population

435
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,190
高贵种族
In my galaxy.

436
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,690
那他们现在在何方
And where are they now?

437
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,450
都死了
Dead.

438
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,850
但这不是我们的错
But that had nothing to do with us.

439
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,190
你确定?
Are you certain?

440
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,350
他们是克隆人
They were clones--

441
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,790
一代一代  无限复制
Copies of copies of copies, going back generations,

442
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,290
结果  他们遭受不可逆转的基因退化的作用
And they suffered irreversible genetic degradation as a result.

443
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,320
这点你早就得知
But you probably already know that.

444
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,650
当然
Of course,

445
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,450
我们也是复制人
Because we are clones as well,

446
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,750
遵循削弱补偿规律
Subject to the same law of diminishing returns.

447
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,990
至少  我们活得很好
And yet, we are still very much alive.

448
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,820
你把问题解决了?
So, what, you solved the problem?

449
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,090
不完全是
Not entirely.

450
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,350
但我们曾经进行过
But once we were able

451
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,220
一次无干扰的试验
To conduct our research without interference,

452
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,990
因此取得巨大的成果
We made significant progress.

453
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,350
用活人试验
Research on humans...

454
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,150
因为人类的生理构造
Because our physiology is similar

455
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,290
和你们祖先的相似
To what yours used to be.

456
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,820
正是如此
Precisely.

457
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,050
我收回刚才的话
I take that back.

458
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,220
我以前见过像你一样的阿斯加德族
I have met an asgard like you before.

459
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,850
他叫洛基
His name was loki,

460
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,420
他也是用活人做试验
And he was experimenting on humans too,

461
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,820
后来被拘捕了
Until he was caught

462
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,450
并被带到阿斯加德高等法院审判
And brought to justice by the asgard high council.

463
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,990
因为他们不信奉"为求目的  不择手段"这一真理
Because they did not believe the ends justified the means.

464
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,990
是的
That's right.

465
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,890
看看他们的下场
And look where it got them.

466
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,920
进展如何
Well, how's it coming?

467
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,720
这情况常有
It does that sometimes.

468
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,490
别介意
Don't let it bother you.

469
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,820
听着  我们现在做的事
Listen, what we are doing here

470
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,850
冒险之极
Is not safe.

471
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,050
还有什么新消息
What else is new?

472
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,050
她这样驾驶  让飞船损耗很大
She is pushing this ship well past its boundaries.

473
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,890
这不是我们正需要的吗
That's kind of what we asked for, no?

474
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,990
如果我们不在托德之前
If we don't get rodney and danny back

475
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,850
救出罗德尼和丹尼
Before todd gets there,

476
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,820
他们就死定了
They're goners.

477
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,450
这是我所见的最原始的
This is the crudest hyperdrive system

478
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,720
超光速推进系统了
I've ever encountered.

479
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,420
都是用不入流的配件装配起来的
It is cobbled together from mismatching components.

480
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,320
能用粗劣的材料建造出这样的飞船
She's got to be pretty smart to put a hyperdrive together

481
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
不就是天才所为吗
With mismatched parts.

482
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,820
飞船快要着火了
She's going to burn it up.

483
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,390
飞出超空间后  很有可能
Once out of hyperspace, there's a high possibility

484
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,420
系统就瘫痪了
We won't be able to engage the drive again.

485
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,000
到时再说吧
Let's worry about that when we get there.

486
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,790
那是什么
What was that?

487
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,320
辐射警告罢了
Just a radiation warning.

488
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,250
预报器太敏感了
The detector's a little over-sensitive.

489
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,620
我才不会担心
I wouldn't worry about it.

490
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,850
我要回舰桥那边了
I've got to get back to the bridge.

491
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,890
你自己看着办吧
I'll leave you to it.

492
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,690
我们来到这个星系  正值战乱
We came to this galaxy during the war.

493
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,490
幽灵人和古人忙于战事
With both the wraith and the ancients occupied,

494
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,290
我们可以自由地进行试验
We were free to conduct our experiments.

495
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,390
不幸地
Unfortunately,

496
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,550
战事结束得
The hostilities came to an end

497
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,750
比我们预期要早
Sooner than we thought,

498
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,420
还引发了意料外的结果
And with an unexpected result.

499
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,090
你们把宝押在了古人身上
You were betting on the ancients.

500
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,550
他们或许会囚禁你们
They may have tried to shut you down,

501
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,250
但不至于将你们斩尽杀绝
But at least they wouldn't exterminate you.

502
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,690
幽灵人不能容忍
The wraith do not tolerate

503
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,290
比他们拥有的
The presence of advanced technologies

504
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,020
更先进技术的存在
Other than their own.

505
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,120
我们意识到事态严重的时候
Before we knew what was happening,

506
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,850
已是面临攻击的时候了
We were under attack.

507
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,290
第一场交战  我们失去了星际战舰
We lost our intergalactic ships in the first battle,

508
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,620
然而我们没有资源
And we did not have the resources

509
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,790
再造新的
To build more.

510
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,950
你们是怎么逃生的
So how did you survive?

511
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,120
我们别无选择
We had no choice

512
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,390
只有遗弃了我们的聚居地
But to abandon our settlements

513
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,890
撤到别的地方
And retreat to a place

514
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,750
一个幽灵人找不到的地方
Where the wraith could not look for us,

515
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,890
一个被毒气包围的星球
A planet with a toxic atmosphere.

516
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,820
听起来...不错
Oh. that... sounds nice.

517
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,120
开始的时候还可忍受
It was tolerable at first.

518
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,290
借助简单的呼吸装置
We were able to survive

519
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,590
我们可以存活
Using simple breathing apparatus.

520
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,890
但经过万古的时期
But over the eons,

521
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,320
环境变得越来越艰苦了
The environment has grown so harsh

522
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,150
连我们的盔甲
That not even our armored exoskeletons

523
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,590
也毫无作用了
Can protect us now.

524
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,950
所以你们又回到这个星系
So you ventured back into the galaxy,

525
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,090
来到了这里
And that's when you came across this place.

526
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,190
我们知道这是古人所建的  也知道为何所建
We knew it was built by the ancients, and why,

527
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,550
但是我们不能激活
But we were unable to activate it

528
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,790
除非有你的帮助
Until you came along.

529
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,520
很遗憾
Look, i-- I'm sorry

530
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,490
得知你们过去的岁月都困在被毒气
That you were trapped on a poisonous planet

531
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,790
围绕的星球
For the last 10,000 years.

532
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,820
真的
I really am.

533
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,220
我知道滋味不好受
I'm sure it was awful.

534
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,850
但是却不能作为杀戮的借口
But that doesn't justify what you're doing.

535
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,220
我的族人正在死亡
My people are dying.

536
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,090
事实上  就像你所说的  必须壮大本族
The fact that, as you tell us, our brothers are already gone,

537
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,150
而我们的亲缘已经绝迹
Only reinforces the need.

538
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,090
不行此着  我们的整个文明
If we do not do this, our whole civilization,

539
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,290
上百万年的历史
A hundred thousand years of history,

540
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,820
就要灰飞烟灭
Will be wiped out forever.

541
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,220
我绝不能眼看这发生
I cannot allow that to happen.

542
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,290
凯勒医生
Dr. keller.

543
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,620
是你在搞破坏?
You're the saboteur?

544
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,390
是的
That's right.

545
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,620
你的武器呢
Where's your weapon?

546
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,450
武器?
My weapon?

547
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,850
是的
Yes.

548
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,450
破坏水晶盘子的那个武器
The one you used to destroy the crystal trays.

549
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,220
我把它藏起来了
I ditched it.

550
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,390
你以为我会来白白送死吗
You really think I'd want it ending up in your hands?

551
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,350
以我为敌  愚蠢之极
Oh, it's foolish of you to see me as the enemy.

552
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,890
当真  为何
Really? why's that?

553
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,550
我是奉谢帕德上校之名行事
I'm on a mission from your colonel sheppard.

554
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,190
这点我十分怀疑
I seriously doubt that.

555
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,750
说来话长
It is a long story,

556
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,150
他和我们之间
But he has requested

557
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,590
关于一个危险的目标达成了中立
That we neutralize a very dangerous target.

558
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,650
你为什么要控制飞船
Then why did you take over the ship?

559
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,190
为什么伤害我们的人
Why did you attack our crew?

560
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,220
如我所言  说来话长
As I said, it is a long story.

561
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,890
然而  这项任务时间紧急
The mission, however, is time-sensitive,

562
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,590
你们给了我们一个烂摊子
And you have handed us a major setback.

563
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,120
超光速推进系统  武器  防护盾
Hyperdrive, weapons, shields--

564
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,820
都不能用了
They are all down.

565
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,890
真遗憾
That's a real shame.

566
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,120
是的
It is

567
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,320
顾及到成千上万的
Considering that hundreds of thousands

568
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,050
人类
Of humans

569
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,490
可能因此而死
Could die because of it.

570
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,020
我想  以后你肩上的担子
I would think that will weigh heavily on you

571
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,950
可要变重了
In the future.

572
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,920
你这是什么意思
What are you talking about?

573
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,550
超光速推进系统恢复
Hyperdrive's coming back up.

574
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,890
武器呢
And weapons?

575
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,620
不可复原  对我们来说已经不再派得上用场了
Irreparably damaged. they're no good to us anymore.

576
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,020
我猜  你是不能完成任务的了
I guess you won't be able to finish the mission, then.

577
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,950
总会有办法的
Oh, we'll find a way.

578
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,790
返回超空间
Get us back into hyperspace

579
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,420
把她带去和其他人一起
And get her down with the others.

580
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,420
没事吧
You okay?

581
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,820
我以为你死了
I thought you were a goner.

582
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,950
我没事
I'm all right.

583
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,490
我的意思是  他们需要我  你就没什么价值
I mean, they need me. you're kind of expendable.

584
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,890
我还以为
I just figured--

585
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,820
我明白你的意思
Yeah, I got what you meant by "goner".

586
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,720
他们想怎样
What did they want?

587
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,650
事实上  聊天
Uh, to talk, actually.

588
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,850
谈得如何
Oh. how did that go?

589
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,990
他们是阿斯加德族
They're asgard.

590
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,290
真的?
For real?

591
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,520
是从我们的老相识那里
Yeah, a faction that broke off from the guys we knew

592
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,850
分离出来的一个小派系
Thousands of years ago.

593
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,720
那些盔甲下面的  就是他们了
They're the ones inside the suits.

594
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,620
这我倒没料到
I did not see that one coming.

595
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,390
跟幽灵人也是对头
Apparently no fans of the wraith, either.

596
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,290
那他们肯关掉那设备么
Are they going to shut off the device?

597
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,690
不
Um, no.

598
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,620
那我也不操心了
Then I don't care.

599
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,650
总之这东西要是开着
As long as that thing is on,

600
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,050
就得死一大片
Then millions of people could die.

601
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,920
话说回来  我貌似找到出去的办法了
Besides, I think I've figured a way out of here.

602
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,690
真的吗
Really?

603
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,020
这是个古人设备
This is an ancient facility,

604
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,350
罗德尼·麦凯对古人设备
And rodney mckay knows a thing or two

605
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,720
还是略知一二的
About ancient facilities.

606
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,790
要知道  临床证实
It has been clinically proven--

607
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,850
用第三人称来指代自己
Referring to yourself in the third person

608
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,690
通常是精神错乱的前兆
Is a sign of mental instability.

609
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,350
应该说狐狸般的狡猾才对
Mentally unstable like a fox!

610
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,520
看看  计划这样
Okay, so, here's the plan.

611
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,950
我把起火警报的线路烧断
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.

612
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,250
系统瞬间瘫痪
The system suddenly goes dead,

613
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,650
就会自动认定是起火了
It assumes there could be a fire,

614
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,950
然后探测到房间里的生命迹象
Detects lifesigns inside the room,

615
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,150
出于安全考虑  门就会自动打开啦
It unlocks the doors for safety.

616
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,950
干的妙
Good job.

617
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,550
还好他们把你带回来了
Good thing they brought you back when they did,

618
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,890
要不我就以为你死定了
Because I assumed you were dead

619
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,920
准备走了都
And I was going to leave.

620
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,090
-我命好  -不用谢我
Lucky me.Yeah, you're welcome

621
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,620
然后接下来我们干什么
So, what do we do now?

622
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,090
我们得把那设备关了
We've got to shut down the device.

623
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,320
要怎么做
How do we do that?

624
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,990
...即兴发挥吧
We'll just... we'll improvise.

625
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,490
对头!
Right.

626
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,450
托德没有杀了你
Todd didn't kill you.

627
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,620
可你差点害死我
No, but you almost got me killed.

628
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,820
我从来没在靶场以外的地方
I've never fired one of these

629
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,220
玩过这个
Outside of the range before.

630
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,750
你很棒
You did great.

631
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,890
若楠  干的好
Ronon. good work.

632
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,790
还没完呢
It's not over yet.

633
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,920
大厅里集结了军队
There's an armory down the hall.

634
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,790
我们得尽量找人
We need everyone we can.

635
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,390
我们要把船夺回来
we're taking the ship back

636
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,500
我们现在去控制室
we'll get to the device control room

637
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,800
你要自投罗网么
you're calling the soldiers

638
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,800
我们分散一下他们的注意力嘛
then we'll create a diversion

639
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,200
我们可以去能量补给站
Okay, uh, we go to the power relay station,

640
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,630
弄一个大爆炸
We create a massive explosion.

641
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,200
我没看出来这怎么叫转移注意力了
I never got how that made a good diversion.

642
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
什么
What?

643
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
你想把控制室的坏蛋都扫干净  对吧
You want to clear the device control room of bad guys, right?

644
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
当然
Yes.

645
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,700
那你为什么会觉得  如果有大爆炸
Why assume if there was a massive explosion

646
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
人们就一定会冲过去看呢
People would run towards it?

647
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
我就会呀
I would.

648
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,130
我持保留意见
I rest my case.

649
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,530
不好意思  我可是个大好人
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a good person.

650
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,000
我会想把人们从火里救出来
I'd want to save people from the fire,

651
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,130
然后看看到底是怎么回事
Maybe figure out what was going on.

652
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,030
可是我会继续重兵把守
I'd order more guards to protect the one room

653
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,900
因为我觉得是有人故意制造混乱
I thought whoever is blowing things up

654
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,300
想偷溜进来
Probably wants to get to.

655
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,600
制造爆炸
Explosion diversions

656
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,100
是最基本的转移注意力的办法了
Are the very cornerstone of diversions.

657
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,400
没有更好一点的么
You don't have any better ideas?

658
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,700
没有了
I don't have any better ideas, yes.

659
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,800
哦  老天  别杀我
Oh, my god. please don't kill me.

660
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,500
我还有用
You need me.

661
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,330
罗德尼?
Rodney?

662
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,400
是我们...我们还有用
Us, us. you need us.

663
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,660
那设备需要细致保养
The device needs constant care.

664
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,360
只有我知道怎么操作它的
True, I'm the only one who knows how to work it--

665
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,500
我这么说了还是要杀我吗
What am I talking about killing for?

666
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,360
你们不是个暴力的种族
You're not a violent race.

667
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,200
或许你们有更让人惊讶的地方
You may have stunned us--

668
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,160
罗德尼
Rodney.

669
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,500
超过我们之前所以为的
...more than we'd have liked, but--

670
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,660
这些只是盔甲而已
They're just suits.

671
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,200
盔甲套着的是有史以来最聪明的种族
Suits that house one of the smartest races ever.

672
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
我是阿斯加德族的迷
I've always been a big fan of the asgards.

673
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,900
我也有阿斯加德族的好朋友
Some of my best friends are asgards--

674
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,860
他们是空的
They're empty suits.

675
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,130
看?
See?

676
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
是的  我知道  我只是
Yeah. I know. I was--

677
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,300
只是什么...
You were...

678
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,260
算了  又不是什么重要的
Yeah, it's not important.

679
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,000
就我看来
From what I could tell,

680
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,330
这些盔甲不管谁穿都合适
The inside of the suits form around whoever's in them.

681
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,230
所有人都是一个型号...
One size fits all...

682
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,130
你确定都搞清楚了?
You sure you have all that figured out?

683
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,130
我有些鸟  比这难控制多了
I've flown birds a lot harder to manage than this one.

684
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,160
我很惊讶  拉林居然不发表意见
I'm surprised larrin didn't say anything.

685
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,700
拉林以前从来没提起过你
Larrin's never brought you up before today.

686
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,000
真的?  从来没有?
Really? never, huh?

687
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,160
没有
Nope.

688
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,230
我们就要出超空间了
We're about to come out of hyperspace.

689
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,560
大家准备好
Everyone, get ready.

690
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,430
看  我就说了吧
See, I knew this would happen.

691
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,760
要烧坏了
We burned it out.

692
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,630
可是我们也到了  不是吗
We got here, though, didn't we?

693
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,430
有代达罗斯的踪影吗
Any sign of the  daedalus?

694
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,400
没有  看起来是我们先到了
No. looks like we beat them.

695
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
这可是今天的第一个好消息
That's the first good news I've had all day.

696
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,100
等等
Wait,

697
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,860
有两辆飞船靠近
I've got two ships closing in.

698
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,300
升起防护盾
Shields up.

699
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,900
如有必要就开火
Fire at will.

700
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
或者来一些躲避招式
Evasive maneuvers might be good.

701
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,100
明白!
I'm on it.

702
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,830
这里是安全的!
Clear!

703
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,200
为什么我们一路上都没碰到他们
How come we haven't run into any of them yet?

704
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,060
我有不好的预感
I've got a bad feeling about this.

705
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
做一下生命迹象扫描
Do a lifesigns scan,

706
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,260
看看他们在那里
Find out where they are.

707
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,360
302第二舱有大量生命迹象
I have a mass of lifesigns in the second 302 bay.

708
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,230
他们退回到自己的船上了  但仍在舱里
They fell back to their ship. it's still in the bay.

709
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,760
他们为什么要这么做
Why would they do that?

710
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,930
难道他们看见我们武装起来了?
They saw we'd armed up?

711
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,300
不想冒死一战?
Didn't want to risk a fight?

712
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,560
这听来不像托德
That doesn't sound like todd.

713
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,000
我去看看
I'm going to check it out.

714
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
带我们离开超空间
Take us out of hyperspace.

715
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,160
怎么了
What is it?

716
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,800
他们把飞行控制加密了
They locked us out of flight controls.

717
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,260
能破解吗
Can you get us back in?

718
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,000
不会这么快
Not quickly.

719
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,300
他想干什么
What's he got planned?

720
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
把设备关了得花多长时间
Okay, how long to get the device shut down?

721
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,330
五分钟
Five minutes.

722
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,330
然后你盯着...
All right, look. you watch the--

723
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,030
噢  搞什么鬼
Oh, come on!

724
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,060
什么  现在是什么情况
What? what now?

725
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,260
这些人肯定是被吓过
Well, something must have spooked them.

726
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,930
为什么这么说
Why?

727
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,160
除去密码不说  想进入这个工作站...
Well, aside from encrypting the access to this workstation...

728
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,500
这个你可以破解的呀
Yeah, but you can break that.

729
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,930
这是很关键  可是大家也都知道
Yeah, in a heartbeat, but, as they very well know,

730
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,530
没有控制匙  就不能对机器进行操作啊
You can't operate this machine without the control key.

731
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,700
看  那个从杰纳斯实验室偷走的东西
Look-- the thing they stole from janus' lab

732
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,230
就是用来启动用的
To begin with.

733
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,730
被他们拿走了
They've taken it.

734
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,860
搞定一个了  还有一个
One down, one to go.

735
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,830
我在瞄准正前方的那艘飞船
I'm picking up a third ship headed right for us.

736
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,330
非常好
Wonderful.

737
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,030
就差一点点  它飞进超空间了
That was close. it flew into hyperspace.

738
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,900
什么
What?

739
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,030
等等  又一个窗口打开了
Hold on,I've got another window opening.

740
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,530
它们现在在我们正后方
They're coming right back at us.

741
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,860
这玩得是哪门子战术
What kind of messed-up battle technique is that?

742
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,000
这有点过时了吧
It's quite a bit out,

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
现在还不在星球附近
Nowhere near the planet yet.

744
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,730
等等  这是代达罗斯号
Wait... it's the  daedalus.

745
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,430
呼叫他们
Contact them.

746
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,400
我们需要帮忙
We're going to need the help.

747
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,230
谢帕德中校?
Colonel sheppard?

748
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,830
真是惊喜啊  看到你们
Surprised to see all of you guys.

749
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,260
我们也是
Same here.

750
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,660
我在游历者...
Look, I'm on a travelers--

751
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
我在游历者的飞船上
I'm on a travelers ship.

752
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,400
我们正和敌方交战
We've engaged the enemy.

753
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,730
你把代达罗斯号抢回来了?
Have you gotten the  daedalus back?

754
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,300
我们需要支援
Because we're going to need the help.

755
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,900
托德让我们的  没怎么抢...
Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight.

756
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,260
因为他把飞行控制锁起来了
But he's locked us out of the controls

757
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,100
还撤退到了302舱
And retreated to one of the 302 bays.

758
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,300
见鬼了他这是什么意思
Why the hell would he do that?

759
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,730
他比谁都希望把这地方摧毁掉
He needs that place destroyed more than anyone.

760
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,960
伍尔希长官?
Mr. woolsey, sir?

761
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,360
怎么了  马克斯
What is it, marks?

762
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,460
我们一旦飞出了超空间
Sir, the second we came out of hyperspace,

763
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,430
一个预先设定好的子空间路线就会自动启动
A pre-programmed sub-routine kicked in.

764
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,060
意味着...
Meaning...

765
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,230
我们确定了设备的位置
Our main scanners located a facility on the planet

766
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,800
就同时把导航系统捆绑启动了
And immediately locked the guidance system into it.

767
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,630
飞船会飞向attero设备
It's taking us to the attero device.

768
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,030
而且
In a way...

769
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,130
长官  这是一个冲撞性程序
Sir, it's programmed a collision course.

770
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,600
这就是他摧毁设备的办法
That's how he's going to destroy the facility,

771
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,060
拉我们一起陪葬
By ramming us into it.

772
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,770
难道就不可能直接减掉它的能量
Can't we just power down the entire facility?

773
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,010
开灯关灯都还需要
You can't do much more than turn the lights off and on

774
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,010
一个零部件呢
Without the component thing.

775
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,510
我们必须得做些什么啊
We have to do something.

776
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,480
等等
Wait a second.

777
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,810
这些盔甲  是能够保护穿着者
These suits were designed

778
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,050
对抗恶劣环境的  对吧
To protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?

779
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,910
技术上来说  是的
Technically, yes.

780
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,050
那我有一个非常馊的馊主意了
Then I have a really terrible idea.

781
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,050
噢不
Oh, no, no.

782
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,010
你应该不是在想
You're not thinking

783
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,610
我以为你在想的东西吧
What I think you're thinking.

784
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,010
那里的辐射应该非常强
The radiation in there would be pretty extreme.

785
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,350
更不用说这放电的东西
Not to mention those electrical discharges

786
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,380
看起来非常不友好啊
Look pretty unfriendly, but...

787
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,650
是的  但它有个控制晶体
Yeah, but the antenna has a control crystal.

788
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,810
如果我们可以人为地拿掉它...
If we could pull it manually...

789
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,380
大概有5比5的几率我们可以做到
It's 50-50 we even get that far.

790
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,810
我觉得只有3比7
I'd go 30-70,

791
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,080
但我没更好的主意了
But I don't have a better idea,

792
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,810
还有这身行头  应该能保护我们
And the suits, they should protect us.

793
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,050
我们破坏了飞船的武器装备
We disabled the ship weapons.

794
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:43,850
你们做的?
You did?

795
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,480
若楠做的
Ronon did, yeah.

796
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,650
他们没办法了
They didn't have any other choice.

797
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,880
只有用飞船去撞坏那设备
Ramming the facility with the ship

798
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,080
才最有可能把它除掉
Is the only sure-fire way to take it out.

799
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,510
还同时把我们都害死了
Killing all of us in the process.

800
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,080
我不觉得他会担心这点
I don't think he's that worried about us.

801
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,180
他们刚刚对302号舱减了压
They just depressurized the 302 bay.

802
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,180
你准备好了吗
You ready?

803
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,380
我们就解决了它吧
Let's just get this over with.

804
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,910
你知道的  我们没必要两个都去
You know we both don't have to go in there.

805
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,550
如果你不幸
Well, when you get killed

806
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,880
被电流击中了
By one of those discharges,

807
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,650
必须有人来完成这项工作  所以
Someone's going to have to finish the job, so...

808
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,280
哇  真是振奋人心的谈话  谢谢
Oh, great pep talk. thanks.

809
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,880
我很确定
I'm pretty sure

810
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,850
我们得避开这些电流
We want to avoid those touching us.

811
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,780
多谢师傅
Thanks, coach.

812
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,780
你在等什么
What are you waiting for?

813
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,250
我必须选对
I have to pull the right one

814
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,410
否则它就爆炸了
Or the antenna explodes.

815
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
快点
Hurry up.

816
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,550
但还是要选对
But get it right.

817
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
代达罗斯号还有多久会撞击表面
How long before the daedalus hits the surface?

818
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,310
最多1分钟
A minute, tops.

819
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,280
飞船上有多少人
How many people on board?

820
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,610
大概200
Couple hundred.

821
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,050
听着  我有个主意  但你要相信我
Look, I've got an idea, but you'll have to trust me.

822
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,350
好
All right.

823
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,050
泽兰卡  米拉
Zelenka, Mila...

824
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,280
我要你开启超光速推进系统
I need you to open up the hyperdrive

825
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,510
30秒之内
In 30 seconds.

826
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,950
我们要做个短距离的跃迁
We're going to have to make a short jump.

827
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,780
不可能
Impossible.

828
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,350
没问题
Not a problem.

829
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,680
你能做到的  马克斯
You can do this, marks.

830
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,810
我们都靠你了
We're all counting on you.

831
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,910
我快要好了
I've almost got it.

832
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,810
我们进入大气了
We're entering the atmosphere.

833
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,480
马克斯
Marks...

834
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,510
好了
Okay.

835
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,680
什么也没发生
Here goes nothing.

836
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,410
丹尼尔
Daniel!

837
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,410
怎么了
What just happened?

838
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,580
欢迎回来
You're welcome.

839
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,210
你们做了什么
What did you do?

840
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,710
只是开了一个够我们两艘船
I just opened up a hyperspace window

841
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,010
用的超空间窗口
Big enough for the both of us.

842
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,710
我们刚刚穿过了星球
We just traveled through the planet.

843
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,180
搞定了
i got it.I'm back in.

844
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,380
我们又能控制飞船了
We've got control of the ship.

845
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,310
还不算太晚
And not a moment too late.

846
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,180
他们又找到我们了
They found us again.

847
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,680
火力全开
Give them everything you've got.

848
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,710
好
Okay.

849
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,110
你还好  你没事的
You're okay, you're okay.

850
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,480
又错了
Wrong again.

851
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,850
你关了吗
Did you turn it off?

852
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,080
我关了  是我们  是你
I did-- we did-- you did.

853
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,310
你哪儿受伤了
Look, where does it hurt?

854
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,380
浑身都是
Everywhere.

855
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,750
我想这里附近没医院吧
I don't suppose there's a hospital nearby?

856
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,880
我想  我们要自己解决了
I'm-- I'm pretty sure we're on our own.

857
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,680
很好
Good.

858
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
但是好的一面是
Look, on the bright side,

859
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,280
我们俩在大概5天内都会脱水致死
We'll both be dead of dehydration in, like, five days,

860
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,050
到时候你就不用再忍受我了
So you won't have to put up with me for much longer.

861
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,380
我  我很糟糕  罗德尼
I'm, uh, I'm pretty busted up, rodney.

862
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,880
我想我  坚持不了那么久
I don't... I don't think I'm going to make it that long.

863
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,110
我知道这看起来不像
Okay, um, I know it may not seem like it,

864
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,250
但我想告诉你  我真的很尊...
But I want you to know I really res--

865
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,180
感谢上帝
Oh, thank god.

866
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,850
很高兴看见你们
I sure am glad to see you two.

867
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,850
他伤得很重
He's badly hurt.

868
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,250
你有身新装扮
That's a new look for you.

869
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,780
你知道我的
Well, you know me,

870
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,310
功能性大过时尚性
It's function over fashion.

871
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,780
那些设备还在运作吗
Is the device still active?

872
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,380
没了这个就不行
Not without this.

873
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,110
这是设备上的主要的控制晶体
It's the facility's main control crystal.

874
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,450
这还不够
That's not good enough for me.

875
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,780
谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard,

876
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,180
我们找回麦凯·博士和杰克森了
We have drs. mckay and jackson.

877
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,480
但我们的武器装备还没恢复
Our weapons are not operational.

878
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,780
你能不能确保下
Can you please see to it

879
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,950
我们不用再
That we never have to deal

880
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,410
担心attero设备了
With the attero device again?

881
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,610
我正在确定它的坐标
I'm locked on to its coordinates.

882
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,210
开火
Opening fire.

883
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,750
夷平了
Leveled.

884
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,980
很好
Good.

885
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,180
我们回去吧
Let's go home.

886
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,910
你能不能  帮我拉下拉链
Well, you want to... unzip me?

887
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,310
我会找个开罐器
I'll look for a can opener.

888
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,810
泽兰卡对飞船的修补起了很大的作用
Zelenka has been a big help with ship repairs.

889
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,680
我们应该尽快让她准备起飞
We should have her ready to fly in no time.

890
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,750
然后呢
Then what?

891
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,950
找个新的聚居地
Start a new settlement, I guess.

892
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,150
这听上去不错
That's good to hear.

893
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,310
你告诉拉林  我会
You tell larrin I'll help you

894
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,580
尽全力帮你们
With whatever you need.

895
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
谢谢
Thank you.

896
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,710
我们会再联系的
We'll be in touch.

897
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,880
好  保持联系
Yeah. I'm sure you will be.

898
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
告诉拉林她不必等着有什么紧急情况发生
Tell larrin she doesn't need to wait

899
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,150
才肯过来拜访一次
For the next galactic emergency To drop by.

900
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,250
我朋友都安全的时候
I'm a lot more charming

901
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,950
我也更和蔼一点
When my friends aren't about to die.

902
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,250
拉林可不是这么说的
That's not what larrin said.

903
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,910
看  她果然提过我
See, she does talk about me!

904
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,980
时不时地
Every now and again.

905
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,650
她说了什么
What does she say?

906
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,080
干嘛  连个提示都没有?
What, not even a hint?

907
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,010
你好
Hey.

908
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,180
你好
Hey.

909
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,280
你今天都忙完了?
You all done for the day?

910
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,680
库尔医生替了我的班
Uh, dr. cole's taking my shift. yeah.

911
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,710
想弄点吃的吗
Want to get something to eat?

912
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,080
听着
Um, listen,

913
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,080
我很高兴你一起参加了这次的任务
Um, I'm really glad you came on the mission.

914
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,450
如果没有你  我们可能都死了
I mean, without you there, we'd... probably all be dead.

915
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,810
但是...
But...

916
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:28,250
我只是想澄清一下  因为...
I just want to be clear, because, um...

917
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,980
我只是想你知道
I just want you to know,

918
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:40,310
我对...另一个人比较有兴趣
That, uh, I'm kind of... interested in somebody else.

919
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,480
所以呢
So?

920
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,150
我只是不想你误...
I just didn't want to give you the wrong--

921
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,250
没有  我只是想拿点吃的
Didn't. I just, um, wanted to get something to eat.

922
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,780
好的  我只是以为
Okay, because I thought--

923
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,580
是啊  所以你想错了
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

924
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,350
好
Okay.

925
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,610
好了
Okay.

926
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,550
你还要去...
Do you still want to go--

927
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,380
不了  我还是...
Uh, no. I should probably...

928
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,350
我要走了
I should go.

929
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,050
你好
Hey.

930
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,110
感觉怎么样
How are you?

931
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,980
吃个水果杯都疼
Well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.

932
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,180
那就别吃水果杯
Don't eat the fruit cup, then.

933
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,050
谢谢啊
Thank you, groucho.

934
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,580
听着  不是我不欢迎来访
Listen, not that I don't appreciate the visits,

935
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,810
只是你不是应该在想办法
But shouldn't you be trying to figure out a way

936
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,380
防止阿斯加德族人再来吗
To keep the asgards out of the shield again?

937
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,350
先你一步  不会再有这种事了
One step ahead of you. that won't happen again.

938
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,450
那很好
Oh. good.

939
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,980
你觉得他们不会再来找我们了?
You don't think they'd make a run at us again?

940
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,380
我不确定
Well, I'm not sure,

941
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,050
但我们的确是毁了他们的计划
But we did ruin the one plan they had

942
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,210
他们本可以自由地在星系活动
To feel free in this galaxy.

943
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,280
他们可能会怀恨在心吧
They might hold a grudge.

944
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,050
希望不要
Well, let's hope not.

945
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,850
我想我也不会留下查明这件事了
I don't think I'll be around to find out, though.

946
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,410
是的  我听说他们要把你送回地球
Yeah, I heard they're sending you back to earth.

947
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,550
是的  我需要点好的治疗和恢复
Yeah, I guess I need some major patching up and recovery.

948
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,950
兰德更希望我会地球做而不是这里  所以...
Landry prefers I do that there instead of here, so...

949
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,410
代达罗斯号从老的星门桥
The daedalus has already picked up a gate

950
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,080
那边选了一个门
Left over from the old gate bridge,

951
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,180
我们这会谈的时候  我的队伍正在安装测试
And my team is installing it as we speak,

952
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,710
马上就可以送你回家了
So we should have you home in no time.

953
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,780
那很好
That's good.

954
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,050
真是...好
That is good.

955
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,710
是啊  所以
Yes. so...

956
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,310
这一切真是  独特
Well, it's been... unique.

957
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,410
是的  当然
Yes, it has. it sure has.

958
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,150
但我还是要说声谢谢
But I do want to say thank you

959
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,080
为了你说你尊敬我
For, um, saying that you respected me

960
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,580
在你以为我快死了的那会儿
When you thought I was about to die back there.

961
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,880
等一下  我没这么说过
Excuse me? I said no such thing.

962
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,850
你说了
Yeah, you did.

963
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,850
你说
You were, like, um,

964
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,380
我知道这看起来不像
"i know it may not seem like it,

965
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,450
但我真的很尊敬你
But I really respect you,"

966
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,650
这对我而言意义很大
And that means a great deal to me.

967
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,450
我想我没把话说完
I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.

968
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,880
你还能怎么把它说完
How else would you have finished that sentence?

969
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,310
我会说  后悔
I would have said "regret."

970
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,550
我想说我很后悔你在那儿
I would have said I really regret you being here

971
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,880
因为这一切就都不会发生了
Because none of this would have happened...

972
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
如果那样
Otherwise.

973
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,010
你对将死之人就只说这些
So you can only give compliments to the dying?

974
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:51,550
这是一个我仍需加强的地方
It's something I'm working on.

975
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,180
你想不想尝尝这些
Do you want to try any of this?

976
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,180
哦  油炸的
Ooh, fries.

977
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,180
是的是的
Yeah, yeah.

978
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,180
多吃点吧  拿到那边去
Dive right in, take the-- take the deal there.
