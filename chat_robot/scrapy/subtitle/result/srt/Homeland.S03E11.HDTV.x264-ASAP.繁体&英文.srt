沒人希望讓你待在這里

摩薩德不想  我也不想

就是為了折磨你嗎
Giving you a hard time?

136

他們的核心啊
Their heart.

145
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,930
你想什么呢
You think what?

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,390
我們會歡迎叛國者嗎
We like traitors here?

147
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,400
不是
No.

148
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,610
-誰派你來的  -沒人  都告訴你了
- Who sent you? - No one. I told you.

149
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,640
我就是想避難
I just want asylum.

150
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,140
就是想...想歇歇
I just w... want rest.

151
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,370
要休息一下嗎
Should we take a break?

152
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,540
太好了  拜托
Yes. Please. Please.

153
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,040
不行
No.

154
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,600
再過一遍
Go over it again.

155

您收好

謝謝
Merci.

172

謝謝您  女士
Merci pour vous, madame.

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,130
{\an2}他們要您上去

174
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,970
{\an2}可以等等嗎  十分鐘后我有個會

175
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,730
{\an2}阿克巴里將軍找您呢  先生

馬蘇德·施拉吉
Masud Sherazi?

180
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,450
你是
Yes?

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,440
我是你侄女的朋友
I'm a friend of your niece.

182
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,300
你有東西要交給我吧
You have something for me.

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
東西呢
Where is it?

184
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,400
先說說是怎么回事
First you tell me what's going on.

185
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,550
法拉怎么和你說的
What did Fara say to you?

186
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,340
她要我幫個忙
That she needed a favor.

187
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,120
出于對你的保護  你知道這些就可以了
For your own protection, that's all you want to know.

188
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,520
這也算是保護我嗎
And was this for my protection?

189
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,730
從海關走私違禁物  還送到我家里
Sending contraband through customs, here to my house?

190
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,750
-東西沒走海關  -上面寫著呢
- It never went through customs. - It says!

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,530
不是  那是我們的標簽
No, those are our labels.

192
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,530
從日內瓦發的外交包裹
It came by diplomatic pouch from Geneva.

193
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,500
你是中情局的吧
You're CIA, aren't you?

194
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,050
我是你侄女的朋友
I'm a friend of your niece's.

195
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,350
那她也是中情局的了
So she's CIA, too.

196
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,050
為她祖國的敵對國工作
Working against her own country.

197
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,750
是為她的祖國工作
Working for her country.

198
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,780
她相信你理解這點
She trusted you to underand that.

199
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,390
她讓我把這個給你
She asked me to give you this.

200
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,090
她在美國也戴頭巾嗎
She wears the hijab there in America?

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,410
我覺得她的心還在這里
I think her heart is here still,

202
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,710
還在德黑蘭
in Tehran.

203
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,950
那我的兄弟
And my brother,

204
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,160
他同意她這么做嗎
does he approve what she's doing?

205
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,540
我認為他逐漸接受了
My understanding is he's grown to accept it.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,950
謝謝
Thank you.

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,430
告訴我  你還需要什么
Tell me, is there anything else you need?

208
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,400
{\an2}你相信他只是來避難的嗎

209
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,750
{\an2}我們仍在核查他那番話

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,710
{\an2}那你相信他嗎

211
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,650
{\an2}不確定

212
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,040
{\an2}有人出現在邊境  我們得多加小心

213
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,290
{\an2}你對他太溫和了

214
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,190
{\an2}我知道

215
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
{\an2}如果你真有疑慮...

216
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:21,660
{\an2}我覺得他在這是客  是貴賓

217
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,040
{\an2}可能有巨大的宣傳價值

218
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,300
{\an2}這個炸了中情局的人嗎

219
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,120
{\an2}他是炸了中情局的美國士兵

220
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,540
{\an2}過去式的美國"英雄"

221
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,500
{\an2}他這輩子算是受盡磨難了

222
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,190
我覺得不該再折磨他了

223
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,870
{\an2}我們得確認可以相信他

224
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,470
{\an2}然后才能讓全世界知道他在這

225
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,450
{\an2}是的  長官

226
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,810
[波斯語]

227
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,910
{\an2}我提個建議如何

228
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,510
[波斯語]

229
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,980
{\an2}也許你該和布洛迪面談  由您親自判斷

230
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:16,990
{\an2}這是要事  值得考慮

231
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,360
-拿到手機了嗎  -是
- You got the phone? - Yeah.

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,480
她叔叔怎么樣
How was the uncle?

233
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,760
開始有疑慮  后來沒事了
He was dodgy at first, then okay.

234
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,980
你那邊情況如何
How did you make out?

235
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,900
阿倫說通了摩薩德的人
Alain got Mossad to say yes.

236
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,890
很好
Good.

237
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,620
給你安排了兩名特工準備見你
I have two agents on the ground there ready to meet you.

238
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,400
都是伊朗籍的
Both Iranian nationals.

239
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,590
他們知道多少
What do they know?

240
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,490
我盡可能少告訴他們
I told everyone as little as possible.

241
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,740
你來決定告訴他們多少
You need to decide how much to let them in.

242
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,530
我跟他們說了
I did tell them

243
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,210
他們參與的是近距離暗殺行動
they'll be supporting a close-quarters assassination,

244
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,050
你需要一把武器
and that you'll be needing a weapon.

245
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,330
希望第一次見面他們能有些方案
Expect them to bring some options to the first meeting.

246
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,520
我想把見面安排在法拉叔叔家
I'd like to make it at the uncle's house.

247
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,720
你確定嗎
You sure?

248
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,960
確定
Yeah.

249
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,880
那里很安全  我相信他
It's safe there. I trust him.

250
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,960
現在你賓館有衛星監控
I got a satellite over your hotel right now.

251
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,880
我在七樓陽臺上
I'm on the balcony-- seventh floor.

252
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,840
你是不是包著頭巾
Is that a head scarf you're wearing?

253
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,750
你開玩笑的  是吧
You're kidding, right?

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,320
看得見個鬼
I can't see crap.

255
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,770
太暗了
It's too dark.

256
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,690
賈瓦迪那還沒什么消息
We haven't heard much from Javadi,

257
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,740
應該算是件好事
but we're taking that as a good thing.

258
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,040
他們把布洛迪藏在阿扎迪塔附近了
They got Brody stashed at a compound near Azadi Tower.

259
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,950
顯然他在努力撐著
Apparently, he's holding together.

260
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,550
還不錯
Well enough anyway.

261
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,390
熬過了整整三天的審訊
He survived three solid days of interrogations.

262
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,460
卡莉
Carrie?

263
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,990
怎么了
What?

264
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,670
你還好嗎
You good?

265
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,630
我該掛了
Uh, I should probably go.

266
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,300
明天...明天是個大日子
It's a... it's a big day tomorrow.

267
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,110
晚安
Good night.

268
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,160
我們不能接受這樣
We didn't agree to this.

269
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,940
我只知道有兩名情報人員準備就緒
Yeah, well, I was told we had two assets ready to go.

270
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,430
沒有姓名  沒有地點
No names, no places.

271
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,090
時機成熟你們會知道的
You will learn when you need to.

272
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,210
我現在就得知道
I need to know now.

273
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,700
不  我現在就得知道能相信你們
No, I need to know now that I can trust you.

274
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,120
而目前為止  你們說的話不能讓我相信
And so far, nothing you've said is making me think that.

275
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,050
我們要求摩薩德派兩個好手
We asked Mossad for the two best men in Iran.

276
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,880
結果是你們二位
They sent you and you.

277
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,920
他們錯了嗎
Were they wrong?

278
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,720
你需要幫助的暗殺行動  在哪
This assassination you need help-- where?

279
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,010
我還不清楚
I don't know yet.

280
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,190
什么時候
When?

281
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,430
我也不確定  但很快
I'm not sure, but soon.

282
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,620
我們不是這么辦事的  什么都等著看情況
This is not how we work-- everything wait and see.

283
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,220
我跟你們說
I will tell you this.

284
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,540
行動目標是伊朗革命衛隊領袖
The target is the head of the IRGC.

285
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,810
達尼什·阿克巴里嗎
Danesh Akbari?

286
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,680
沒人能接近他
No one can get close to him.

287
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,900
我們能
We can.

288
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,780
他會被就地待命的美國人拿下
He'll be taken down by an American already in place.

289
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,140
我們的工作就是讓他全身而退
Our job is to get that man to safety afterwards.

290
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,760
你們能做到嗎
Can you do that?

291
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,770
他們說不能用槍
They say no gun.

292
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,570
這是氰化物
Is cyanide.

293
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,750
這個  美國人
This, uh, American--

294
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,370
他需要近身阿克巴里
he will need to be right next to Akbari.

295
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,530
而阿克巴里肯定有保鏢護衛
And Akbari will be guarded.

296
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,100
是的  他有貼身衛隊

297
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,050
[波斯語]

298
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,410
[波斯語]

299
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,720
我們有C-4炸藥
We have C-4.

300
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,530
我們可以聲東擊西
We can create a diversion.

301
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,310
但這個怎么辦
But what about this?

302
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,360
誰去交給那個美國人
Who will get this to the American?

303
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,060
我來處理
I'll take care of it.

304
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,430
巴吉魯女士嗎
Madame Bezieux?

305
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,230
{\an2}我是  怎么了

306
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,490
{\an2}那些人在打聽你

307
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,620
{\an2}我看就是例行公事

308
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,780
{\an2}有什么事嗎

309
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,610
這邊請
This way, please.

310
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,510
{\an2}我們要去哪兒

311
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,910
{\an2}你們要帶我去哪兒

312
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,530
{\an2}我沒做錯事

313
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,670
{\an2}我是貴國游客  有權利知道

314
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,110
安靜  安靜
Quiet! Quiet!

315
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,060
我還是喜歡你金發碧眼的樣子
I liked you better as a blonde.

316
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,370
有必要嗎
Was this really necessary?

317
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,100
你想怎樣  在大堂里喝酒嗎
What do you want, drinks in the lobby?

318
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,770
你讓那個前臺懷疑我了
You've got the desk clerk wondering about me now.

319
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,310
你記住  我根本不想讓你來
Remember, I didn't want you here at all.

320
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,170
任務是阿克巴里
The mission is Akbari.

321
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,560
那才是任務
That's the mission.

322
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,380
你來這兒干嘛  幫布洛迪脫逃
What you're here for, getting Brody out--

323
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,510
大可不必
strictly optional.

324
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,110
可以了嗎
Are we agreed?

325
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,950
任務是阿克巴里  沒錯
The mission is Akbari, yes.

326
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,430
好的
Good.

327
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,770
好
Good.

328
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,370
有事發生了
Something happened.

329
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,640
怎么了
What?

330
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,910
阿克巴里白天從不離開辦公室
Akbari never leaves his office during the day.

331
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,520
他說太危險
Too risky, he says.

332
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,890
但他明天要了一支安全車隊
But he's requested a secure convoy for tomorrow.

333
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,560
-他要出門  -去哪兒
- He's heading out. - Where?

334
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,160
沒人會說
No one's saying.

335
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,750
但我昨天告訴他
But I told him yesterday

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,580
應該和布洛迪親自談談
that he should really talk to Brody in person.

337
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,060
要開始了
So, it's on?

338
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,820
就用這個嗎
Is that it? The device?

339
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,100
是的
Yeah.

340
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,660
以色列的貨
Israeli.

341
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,350
能交給布洛迪嗎
Can you get it to Brody?

342
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,510
我會想辦法的
I'll find a way.

343
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,120
好了  都聽好
Okay, listen up.

344
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,300
我們在德黑蘭有行動
We have movement in Tehran.

345
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,400
無論如何  我們都希望
We now expect closure on our operation,

346
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,250
這項任務
one way or another 

347
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,040
能在當地時間明早9點左右結束
at approximately 9:00 A.M. tomorrow local time.

348
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,720
情報人員認為此次行動會在
Intelligence suggests this will take place 

349
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,650
布洛迪被羈押的阿扎迪塔
at a compound near Azadi Tower

350
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,690
附近某建筑進行
where Brody is currently held.

351
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,460
武器  氰化物針
The weapon, a cyanide needle,

352
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,300
正在轉交給他
is being delivered to him,

353
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,400
還有他的撤離計劃
along with the plan for his extraction.

354
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,760
布洛迪的任務是
Brody's job is to position himself

355
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,700
直接和目標達尼什·阿克巴里碰面
in direct contact with the target, Danesh Akbari.

356
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,010
-他怎么通過守衛  -不用
- How does he get past the guards? - He doesn't.

357
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,520
目標來見他
Target comes to him.

358
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,720
最好能私下里會見
We're expecting a personal encounter,

359
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,790
由阿克巴里提出
initiated by Akbari.

360
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,290
我們有兩名摩薩德特工待命
We have two Mossad agents in place,

361
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,530
一個從這棟樓
one with a direct sightline

362
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,360
直接監視樓宇情況
into the compound from this building here.

363
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,160
另一名特工會在布洛迪接近阿克巴里后
That agent will remotely detonate a motorcycle bomb

364
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,560
至少也要在兩人共處一室時
in this alley at a moment

365
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,380
在這條路上
when Brody is proximal to Akbari,

366
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,320
遠程引爆摩托車上的炸彈
at the very least in the same room.

367
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,430
爆炸會造成混亂
The explosion should generate sufficient confusion

368
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,880
使布洛迪干掉目標
to allow Brody to take out the target

369
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,210
并從房子的后門逃走
and escape through this doorway at the rear of the compound.

370
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,310
這里可以直接通向街道
It provides a clear exit to the street

371
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,550
我們的兩名特工會在車里等他
where our two agents will be waiting in a vehicle.

372
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,630
如果計劃順利  布洛迪會在幾小時后
If the rest follows plan, Brody will be delivered

373
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,950
被轉送到德黑蘭外的一所安全屋
to a safe house outside Tehran a few hours later.

374
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,100
有意見嗎
Comments?

375
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,630
我明白  不確定因素還很多
I'm aware-- it's a lot of moving parts.

376
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,730
此次行動卡莉什么角色
Where's Carrie in all this?

377
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,370
她的工作已經完成
She's done her job

378
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,270
整合逃亡計劃
putting together an extraction plan.

379
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,480
行動前不應該讓她撤離嗎
Shouldn't she be pulled out before the event?

380
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,940
她不這么看
She doesn't see it that way.

381
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,230
好了
Okay.

382
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,750
準備吧
Let's get ready.

383
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,830
還剩不到12小時
We have less than 12 hours.

384
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,260
起來  快
Get up. Now!

385
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,290
怎么了
What's going on?

386
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,290
起來把衣服穿上  快點
Get up and get dressed... quickly!

387
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,500
為什么  怎么了
Why? What's happening?

388
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,580
穿這個  快點
In these. Hurry.

389
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,500
我的鞋呢
Where are my shoes?

390
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,440
鞋
Shoes.

391
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,010
給你鞋  快點
Shoes. Hurry.

392
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,240
我覺得他們要出發了
I think they're moving.

393
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,610
什么意思
What do you mean?

394
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,390
他們要帶他走
They are taking him somewhere.

395
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,330
[波斯語]

396
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,110
[波斯語]

397
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,040
該死的  你先回來
Shit. Get back here.

398
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,770
索爾  你在看嗎
Saul, are you seeing this?

399
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,100
布洛迪被帶走了
Brody's being moved.

400
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,430
我們看到了
We see it.

401
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,610
他們是帶他去阿克巴里那里嗎
Are they taking him to Akbari?

402
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,480
不  阿克巴里的保鏢隊
No. Akbari's convoy

403
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,410
六分鐘前就離開了伊革命衛隊
left the IRGC six minutes ago.

404
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,850
我們還以為是去你那里
We thought he was coming to you.

405
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,700
所以布洛迪他媽的是要去哪里
So where the fuck is Brody going?

406
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,130
我們得跟上他們
Hey, we need to follow them.

407
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,260
你們派的刺客居然是尼古拉斯·布洛迪
Your assassin is Nicholas Brody?

408
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,690
對  我們能開始行動了嗎
Yes. Can we get moving?

409
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:39,760
他可是世界頭號通緝犯
The most wanted man in the world.

410
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,290
這么重要的事居然不告訴我們
This was not important for us to know?

411
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,500
那現在你知道了
Well, now you know.

412
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,950
我們走吧
Let's go.

413
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,900
快走吧
Let's go.

414
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,020
注意這里
Look at this.

415
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,850
阿克巴里和布洛迪的車隊正在靠攏
Akbari. Brody. The convoys are converging.

416
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,690
朝哪里靠攏
Converging where?

417
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,730
一個叫達瓦吉噶爾的地方
An area called Darvazy Gar.

418
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,300
阿克巴里的車停下了
Akbari's stopping.

419
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,310
他的人封鎖了那個地方
His men are locking down the area.

420
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,900
他們在羅斯塔米街
They're on Rostami Street.

421
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,300
卡莉在哪里
Where's Carrie?

422
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,940
布洛迪后面兩個街區
Two blocks behind Brody.

423
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,280
這是什么地方
What is this place?

424
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,600
馬上就到了
Almost there.

425
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,430
阿克巴里進了那棟樓
Akbari's gone inside that house.

426
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,860
查出住戶的身份
Find out who lives there.

427
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,190
我們正在查
Yeah. We're looking.

428
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,320
別忙著找  問一下賈瓦迪
Don't just look. Ask Javadi.

429
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,720
地址是羅斯塔米街421號
The address is 421 Rostami Street.

430
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,230
卡莉
Carrie,

431
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,650
阿克巴里和布洛迪在你前方90米處
Akbari and Brody are 100 yards ahead of you.

432
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,980
會面開始了
Meeting is on.

433
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,860
在這里停
Stop here.

434
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,400
停  快停下
Stop! Stop.

435
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,940
這不是個好主意  我們毫無準備
This is not a good idea. We are not set up.

436
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,750
我們有準備  布洛迪見到了阿克巴里
We are. Brody's meeting Akbari.

437
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,840
唯一有變化的是地點
The only thing that's changed is the location.

438
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,220
布洛迪知道我們在這里嗎
Does Brody even know we are here?

439
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,150
他聽到爆炸聲就會知道了
As soon as he hears the explosion, he'll know.

440
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,670
優素福現在需要找個地方
Yousef needs to find a place now.

441
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,340
我們現在最好暫時收手
The best thing is for us to back away,

442
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,220
等待一個更好的機會
wait for a better chance.

443
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,320
不會再有更好的機會了  你搞清楚這點
There won't be a better chance, do you understand?

444
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,700
只管照做
Just do it.

445
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,070
優素福
Yousef...

446
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,850
[波斯語]

447
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,120
[波斯語]

448
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,860
[波斯語]

449
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,260
牽制炸彈裝好了
Diversion is set.

450
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,150
卡莉  你來指揮
Your call, Carrie.

451
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,140
你有現場指揮的便利
You're the eyes on the ground.

452
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,060
優素福
Yousef...

453
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,710
[波斯語]

454
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,340
[波斯語]

455
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,880
這操他娘的發生了什么事
The fuck what is happening?

456
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,340
阿克巴里離開了
Akbari's leaving.

457
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,360
他們根本沒有碰面  阿克巴里走了
They never met. Akbari's gone.

458
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,130
我想他是要進那棟樓里去
I think he's going inside the house.

459
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
我他媽的最后問一遍
For the last fucking time,

460
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,180
我們能不能查到是誰住在那里
can we find out who lives there?

461
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,880
[波斯語]

462
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:43,310
[波斯語]

463
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,790
[波斯語]

464
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,240
[波斯語]

465
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,400
尼古拉斯
Nicholas.

466
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,710
索爾  賈瓦迪的消息
Saul, a message from Javadi:

467
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,100
羅斯塔米街421號屬于伊革命衛隊
421 Rostami is owned by the IRGC.

468
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,840
現在的住戶叫納塞林·莫勒彼
Current resident... Nassrin Mughrabi.

469
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,390
卡莉  布洛迪見的是納塞林·莫勒彼
Carrie, Brody is meeting with Nassrin Mughrabi.

470
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,360
納塞林  那是誰
Nassrin? Who is that?

471
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,210
阿布·納齊爾的遺孀
Abu Nazir's widow.

472
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,410
阿克巴里為什么要這么做
Why did Akbari do this?

473
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,410
布洛迪曾在納塞林家住過兩年
Brody lived in Nassrin's house for two years.

474
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,850
阿克巴里用她來審查布洛迪
Akbari's using her to vet Brody.

475
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,760
阿克巴里告訴我你在這里的時候
When Akbari told me you were here,

476
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,260
我根本不敢相信
I couldn't believe it.

477
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,200
但是你還是出現了
But here you are.

478
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,800
我的尼古拉斯
My Nicholas.

479
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,530
我完全沒想到你會住在德黑蘭
I had no idea you were living in Tehran.

480
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,640
納齊爾死后我一直住這里
It's been my home since Nazir died.

481
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,660
我很抱歉  納塞林
I'm sorry, Nassrin.

482
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,070
再沒有人能像他一樣了
There was no one like him.

483
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,560
再也沒有了
No one.

484
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,920
看得出來你經歷了很多
But I can see you have been through a lot.

485
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,620
我上次見你的時候
When I last saw you,

486
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,460
你像個就要上戰場的士兵
you were like a soldier going to war.

487
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,580
我現在是從戰場歸來的士兵
Now I'm a soldier back from war.

488
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,450
得勝歸來
With a victory.

489
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,340
根本算不上什么勝利
It's hard to see it like that.

490
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,440
我失去了那么多
I lost so much.

491
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,030
你的家人
Your family.

492
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,540
尤其是我的女兒
My daughter, especially.

493
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,760
當我...
When I, um...

494
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,810
當我完成任務
when I completed the... the plan that, um,

495
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,560
安拉交付我的使命
Allah had set out for me...

496
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,690
這擊垮了她
it destroyed her.

497
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,390
她試圖自殺
She tried to kill herself.

498
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,080
信念的缺失讓人迷茫
It is hard when you don't have faith.

500
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,580
她有信念
She had faith.

501
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,400
她相信她的父親不會背叛她
She had faith that her own father wouldn't betray her

502
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,080
讓她生不如死
and make her life unlivable.

503
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,720
納齊爾幫你做好了思想準備
Nazir prepared you for this.

504
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,930
他說只要你忠于安拉
He said that if you were true to Allah,

505
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,270
你會心如止水
you would find peace.

506
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,800
你是虔誠的
And you were true.

507
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,490
你也是
And so were you.

508
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,250
你心如止水了嗎
Have you found peace?

509
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,790
有時能
Sometimes... yes.

510
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,710
但有時我會問
But sometimes I ask

511
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,750
為什么真主要帶走我的兒子
why God had to take my son

512
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,760
和丈夫  而留下我
and my husband instead of me,

513
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,350
然后我的感覺和你女兒一樣
and then I feel like your daughter did:

514
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,650
生不如死
life is unlivable.

515
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,430
但我挺過來了
But I survive.

516
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,050
我們都應該這樣
It's what we do.

517
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,550
對
Yes.

518
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,770
我們掙脫苦海
We crawl out of the rubble

519
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,480
重新振作
and we gather up the bodies.

520
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,450
你為什么來德黑蘭  尼古拉斯
Why did you come to Tehran, Nicholas?

521
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,520
我無處可去
I had nowhere else.

522
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,590
你來這里干什么
What do you want here?

523
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,150
我想結束逃亡
I want to stop running.

524
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,740
你在這里干什么
What are you doing here?

525
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,290
[波斯語]

526
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,180
告訴我們你在這里干什么
Tell us what you are doing here.

527
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,040
你在這里干什么
What... what are you doing here?

528
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,740
蒙主恩澤
By the grace of God...

529
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,540
我來這里尋求庇護
I am here to seek asylum.

530
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,640
只有在這里  我才能心如止水
This is the only place in the world that I can find peace.

531
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,090
你是德黑蘭的名人了  布洛迪
You're a big man in Tehran, Brody.

532
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,710
真正的大人物
A really big man now.

533
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,200
{\an8}六天后

534
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,790
在你那段著名的錄像里  你說
In your famous videotape, you said,

535
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,240
我愛我的祖國
"I love my country."

536
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,080
我是真心的
Which I meant.

537
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,280
但美國卻把你列為國家公敵
And yet America declares you an enemy of the state.

538
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,460
美國人的自我標榜與現實的美國
There's a wide gulf between what America says it is

539
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,980
是天壤之別
and what it actually is.

540
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,290
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

541
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,360
最新的羞辱
The most recent insult.

542
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,180
這是否能解釋你12月12日的行動
Does this explain your actions on December 12?

543
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,870
是的
It does.

544
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,490
對
Yes.

545
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,470
[波斯語]

546
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,280
布洛迪在一周內學了波斯語
Brody learned enough Farsi in one week

547
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,390
為了在國家電視節目中譴責我們
to denounce us on state television.

548
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,610
標準的"美國去死"論調
Standard "Death to America" fare.

549
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,090
[波斯語]

550
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,430
但我聽說他的移送過程很順利
But I'm told his delivery is pitch-perfect.

551
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,550
剛剛和他通過電話
Just got off the phone with him.

552
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,000
他要求"行動"
He demanded "Action."

553
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,110
沒錯
Yeah.

554
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,580
我接到了相同的電話
I got the same call.

555
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,180
布洛迪這部分行動
The Brody part of the operation

556
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,110
總是很艱難  索爾
was always a long shot, Saul.

557
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,550
所有部分都很難
It was all a long shot.

558
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,080
行動奏效了
And it worked,

559
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,460
在此之前
until now.

560
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,700
布洛迪不可能接近阿克巴里
Brody's never going to get anywhere near Akbari.

561
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,890
我知道
I know.

562
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,620
賈瓦迪的直接消息
That's straight from Javadi.

563
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,240
布洛迪已經被伊朗公關部接手
Brody's been handed off to their PR department.

564
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,970
我們沒有機會了
Our window is closed.

565
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,500
那我們要放棄他嗎
So we just discard him?

566
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,830
我們想讓他撤離
We tried to extract him.

567
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,800
但布洛迪沒有在集合點露面
Brody didn't even show up for the rendezvous.

568
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,090
現在他在整個德黑蘭大放厥詞
Now he's spouting off all over Tehran.

569
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,450
最起碼
Bottom line,

570
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,580
布洛迪從線人變成了大累贅
Brody's gone from asset to serious liability.

571
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,970
我得知道他怎么想的
I need to know what he's thinking.

572
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,810
他的想法顯而易見
It's obvious what he's thinking:

573
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,040
就是他在那些網絡視頻中說的話
what he's saying on all those YouTube videos.

574
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,990
伊朗救了他
Iran saved his life,

575
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,690
他熱愛伊朗  憎恨美國
he loves them, hates us.

576
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,720
你知道還有什么嗎
And you know what else?

577
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,030
無論他現在腦子里想些什么
Whatever he's thinking today,

578
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,150
誰能確保在今后不會變成現實
who's to say what it will be tomorrow?

579
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,800
他和當初將他洗腦的同一撥人
He's spending his days with the same people

580
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,550
生活在一起
who brainwashed him in the first place,

581
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,110
對于布洛迪可以確認的一點
and one thing we know about Brody is

582
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,190
就是這個家伙反復無常
this is a guy who changes his mind.

583
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,800
你在伊革命衛隊中安插了重要線人
You placed a major asset inside the IRGC.

584
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,120
馬吉德·賈瓦迪
Majid Javadi.

585
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,010
這是值得我們繼續利用的重大勝利
That's a huge victory worth preserving.

586
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,530
布洛迪隨時會暴露賈瓦迪的身份
Brody could expose him at any moment,

587
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,170
事情很簡單
and the simple fact is

588
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,960
我們不能信任布洛迪
we can't trust Brody.

589
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,230
不能信任
We never could.

590
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,840
該結束了
We need to end it.

591
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,120
你是說殺了布洛迪嗎
You mean end Brody?

592
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,720
總統希望能解決此問題
The president wants this resolved.

593
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,770
我們知道布洛迪每日做禱告的地方
We know where Brody prays every day.

594
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,050
摩薩德在那邊也有人
Mossad has some men on the ground there.

595
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,450
是時候了
It's time.

596
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,640
他當然要抨擊我們
Of course he's bad-mouthing us.

597
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,890
你指望他說什么
What do you expect?

598
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,150
只有這樣  他才能不被懷疑  索爾
He's doing what he needs to, to preserve his cover, Saul.

599
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,100
僅此而已
That's all.

600
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,850
冷靜下  我只是問問
Well, calm down. I'm just asking.

601
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,000
計劃有變
The plan changed,

602
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,830
按照我們通常的做法
so we do what we always do,

603
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,570
我們隨機應變
what he's doing-- we adjust.

604
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,980
我們應變過了
We did adjust.

605
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,790
我們試圖讓他撤走
We tried lifting him out of there.

606
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,700
他沒理會
He blew us off.

607
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,380
那是因為他覺得原計劃能成功
Because he still thinks the plan can work.

608
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,940
這是他的原話嗎
Is that what he's saying?

609
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,270
這是我的話
That's what I'm saying.

610
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,790
所以  他還沒和你聯系嗎
So he hasn't reached out to you?

611
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,680
沒有  我們一直都說  和我聯系
No. We said all along any contact with me

612
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,030
風險太大  不是嗎
was too risky, right?

613
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,890
發生什么事了
What's going on?

614
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,340
你是時候該回來了
It's time you got on a plane and came back.

615
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,910
我們不能就這么把他丟在這里
We can't just abandon him here.

616
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,140
索爾  從始至終我對他的判斷都是正確的
Saul, I have been right about him this whole time.

617
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,190
我知道
I know.

618
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,870
等你回來了  我們再好好談
And we'll talk it through when you're back.

619
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,640
卡莉
Carrie?

620
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,750
卡莉  聽得到嗎
Carrie, you hear me?

621
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,390
聽得到
Yeah, sure.

622
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,630
再見
Bye.

623
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,130
拜
Bye.

624
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,860
她才不會乖乖地坐上飛機
She's not getting on any plane.

625
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,310
我知道
I know.

626
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,950
我們來解決吧
Let's get it done.

627
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,630
現在就去
Do it now.

628
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,330
馬蘇德  我是卡莉
Masud. It's Carrie.

629
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,840
你得再幫我一次
I need one more favor.

630
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,090
日安
Salaam.

631
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,300
[波斯語]

632
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,900
[波斯語]

633
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,330
有個朋友待會兒會給你打電話
A friend will call you now.

634
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,100
[波斯語]

635
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,770
請你在里面等我一會兒
Will you wait inside for me a moment, please? 

636
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,940
謝謝
Thank you.

637
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,380
你好
Yes?

638
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,010
是我  我就站在庭院對面
It's me. I'm across the courtyard.

639
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,900
布洛迪  我有車
Brody, I have a car.

640
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,320
我得把你帶離德黑蘭
I need to get you out of Tehran.

641
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,170
我跟他們說過了  我不走
I told them already, I don't want to leave.

642
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,520
我知道  你的話讓他們覺得不安
I know, and it made them nervous.

643
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,860
不安  這什么意思
Nervous? What's that mean?

644
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,240
我也不清楚
I'm not sure.

645
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,410
沒人肯告訴我  我猜他們打算...
No one would tell me, but I think they're...

646
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,270
丟卒保車  以保護賈瓦迪
they're cutting their losses to protect Javadi.

647
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,690
丟卒保車
Cutting their losses?

648
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,650
我說過了  還不確定
I said I'm not sure.

649
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,960
是指我嗎
Meaning me?

650
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,810
那是他
That's him.

651
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,750
他似乎在打電話
Looks like he's on the phone.

652
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,760
摩薩德的人在哪
Where's Mossad?

653
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,700
拜托  和我一起  坐上車就好
Please, just come with me, just get in the car.

654
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,800
去哪
And go where?

655
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,690
哪都行  求你了
Anywhere. Please.

656
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,120
求你  現在就跟我走
Please, just come with me now.

657
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,530
一旦出了德黑蘭  我們就能重整旗鼓
As soon as we're clear of Tehran, we can regroup.

658
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,190
還重整旗鼓個屁
Regroup for what?

659
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,830
再做個操蛋的計劃嗎
What? To make another fucked-up plan?

660
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,370
不是  我們得離開
No, we just need to leave.

661
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,110
別這么說  行嗎
Will you stop saying that?

662
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,400
離開  離開  去哪啊
Leave, leave. Leave where?

663
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,500
我無處可去  卡莉
I have nowhere to go, Carrie!

664
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,040
我不可能回美國了
I can't go back to the States.

665
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,870
那我們去別的地方
We'll go somewhere else.

666
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,080
做什么呢
And do what?

667
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,280
四處躲藏嗎
Hide out?

668
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,390
然后他們追捕我們倆嗎
So they're hunting us both?

669
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,410
我有人脈
I have contacts.

670
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,680
我已經經歷過一次了  卡莉
I've been through that already, Carrie.

671
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,920
不想再來一次了
I won't do it again.

672
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,290
我也不會讓你承受一次的
And I won't do it to you.

673
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,120
雙人組在那里
And there's the Tag Team.

674
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,720
布洛迪  求你了
Brody, please.

675
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,070
見鬼
Shit.

676
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:27,860
已經開始了
It's happening.

677
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,010
什么事
What?

678
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,530
你背后  從清真寺走過來的兩個男人
Behind you, from the mosque, there's two men,

679
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,090
一個穿著深色襯衫和卡其色褲子
one in a dark shirt and khaki pants,

680
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,740
另一個穿著皮夾克
the other in leather jacket.

681
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,300
別掛電話
Just stay on the phone

682
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,650
我會告訴你情況
and I will talk you through.

683
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,580
他在移動
He's moving.

684
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,010
-布洛迪  -快離開這里
- Brody? - Just get out of here.

685
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,840
有人提醒了他
Someone warned him.

686
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,490
誰干的
Who?

687
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,940
她真是狗膽包天
She wouldn't fucking dare.

688
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,610
怎么的
What?

689
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,220
你這事干得真操蛋
You really fucked up this time.

690
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,450
他是為我們工作的
He's working for us.

691
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,970
那個計劃失敗了
The plan failed.

692
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,530
所以你就派來人來殺他
So you send a hit squad?

693
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,440
我們試圖把他召回  被他拒絕了
We tried to recall him. He said no.

694
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,580
現在托你的福  他可以在德黑蘭
Now thanks to you, he's loose

695
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,840
街上自由行動  天知道他會干什么
on the streets of Tehran doing God knows what.

696
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,750
日安
Salaam.

697
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,130
日安  日安
Salaam, salaam.

698
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,930
[阿拉伯語]

699
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:16,790
[阿拉伯語]

700
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,750
拜托  告訴她
Please, tell her.

701
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,950
馬上告訴她  這非常重要
Tell her right now. It's very important.

702
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,230
尼古拉斯
Nicholas?

703
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,130
我沒想到你會來
I wasn't expecting you.

704
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,690
對不起
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,770
納塞林  我需要你的幫助
Nassrin, I need your help.

706
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,450
發生什么事了
What happened?

707
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,140
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

708
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,440
有人想殺我
Somebody just tried to kill me.

709
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,880
我的天
My God.

710
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,070
我得和達尼什·阿克巴里談談
I need to talk to Danesh Akbari.

711
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,280
達尼什
Danesh...

712
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,840
他可不喜歡被人打擾
he is a very private man.

713
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,020
我有...
I have...

714
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,540
我有關于馬吉德·賈瓦迪的消息
I have information about Majid Javadi

715
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,030
絕對是他需要知道的
that he absolutely needs to know, okay?

716
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,360
這非常重要
It's very important.

717
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,390
求你了  納塞林  求你
Please, Nassrin, please, okay?

718
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,250
好吧  好吧  我會告訴他的
All right, all right, I'll tell him.

719
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,170
我們從賈瓦迪那里收到一條消息
We got a message from Javadi.

720
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,710
布洛迪剛剛在革命衛隊總部現身了
Brody just showed up at the Revolutionary Guard headquarters.

721
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,900
他在干什么
What's he doing?

722
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,070
賈瓦迪說護送他的人是阿克巴里的手下
Javadi said he was escorted by Akbari's men.

723
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,860
他要去見阿克巴里
He's going to Akbari.

724
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,110
布洛迪知道我們想殺他
Brody knows we just tried to kill him.

725
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,810
他會讓整個計劃全他媽泡湯
He's gonna burn the whole fucking thing down.

726
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,620
納塞林告訴我你很激動
Nassrin told me you were upset.

727
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,540
想找我談談
That you wanted to talk to me.

728
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,780
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

729
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,000
你知道嗎  我就是在這間辦公室
You know, it was here in this office

730
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,770
第一次聽說你的名字
that I first heard your name.

731
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,330
阿布·納齊爾跟我談起過你
Abu Nazir told me about you:

732
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,160
他找到了怎樣的一塊寶石
what a jewel he had found...

733
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,710
怎樣的一把真主之劍
what a sword for Allah.

734
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,370
怎么會有人...
Why would anyone...

735
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,990
想要殺掉這樣一件珍寶
want to kill such a treasure?

736
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,950
是想阻止我告訴你關于賈瓦迪的事情
To stop me telling you about Javadi.

737
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,900
賈瓦迪的什么事
What about Javadi?

738
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,310
他覬覦你的職位
He wants your job.

739
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,420
你以為我會不知道嗎
You think I don't know that?

740
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,660
中情局已經為他計劃好了
The CIA has planned it for him.

741
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,210
中情局
The CIA?

742
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,280
就算是賈瓦迪這樣的人也不會和中情局合作的
Even Javadi wouldn't work with the CIA.

743
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,530
可他合作了
Well, he is.

744
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,620
他們發現他挪用了革命衛隊幾百萬的公款
They found out he embezzled millions from the IRGC.

745
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,990
他們握住了他的把柄
They own him.

746
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,620
你是在逃犯
You were on the run.

747
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,910
你怎么會知道美國方面在做些什么
How could you know what the Americans are doing?

748
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,480
因為這個計劃我也有份
Because I was part of it.

749
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,330
我來到德黑蘭是為了接近你
I was to come here to Tehran to get close to you.

750
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,500
你接近我以后要干什么
And when you got close?

751
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,330
他們想讓我把你除掉...
They wanted me to take you out...

752
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,340
以便讓賈瓦迪取代你
...so they could replace you with Javadi.

753
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,370
那就是我接到的指令
Those were my orders.

754
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,030
不過你并不想執行這些指令
But you don't want to obey those orders.

755
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,190
所以你才會來找我
That's why you came to me.

756
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,090
我來這里是為了自我救贖
I came here to redeem myself.

757
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,220
你已經做到了
And you have.

758
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,300
已經做到了
You have.

759
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,330
謝謝你  尼古拉斯
Thank you, Nicholas.

760
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,140
我會對付賈瓦迪的
I will deal with Javadi.

761
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,290
你和阿布·納齊爾談起過我嗎
You spoke with Abu Nazir about me?

762
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,770
就在這個房間嗎
In this room?

763
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,130
是的
Yes.

764
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:12,390
談起他是如何派你去對抗美國的
How he would send you against America.

765
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,550
就像一把插入敵人心臟的利劍
A sword to strike the heart of our enemy.

766
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,510
很好
Good.

767
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,440
都是在這里開始的
It all started here.

768
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,920
喂
Yes?

769
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,570
是我
It's me.

770
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,900
我在阿克巴里的辦公室
I'm in Akbari's office.

771
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,810
布洛迪  你做了什么
Brody, what have you done?

772
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,020
我把他殺了
I killed him.

773
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,890
把我弄出去
Get me out of here.
