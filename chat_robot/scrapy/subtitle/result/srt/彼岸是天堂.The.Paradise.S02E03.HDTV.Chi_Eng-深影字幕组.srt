00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:04,605
彼岸是天堂 第二季 第三集

2
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,605
妈妈 她快跟你一样漂亮了
Oh, Mama! She's almost as beautiful as you!

3
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:49,605
但是你看? 她穿着内衣就出来了
But see? She comes to us only in her underclothes.

4
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,830
我们得给她置办一身行头
We must attend to her wardrobe.

5
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,830
那我们要带她去女装部吗?
Are we to take her to Ladieswear, then?

6
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:56,830
多么好的想法
What a splendid notion!

7
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,831
她值得拥有最好的
She deserves nothing but the best.

8
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,920
尽管奥德丽小姐离开了 我仍然相信
And I am confident that despite Miss Audrey's departure,

9
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,721
她的部门仍然是无以伦比的
her department will remain the jewel in the crown.

10
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:07,798
德妮丝 你不这样认为吗?
Do you not think, Denise?

11
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,882
不 夫人 我也这样认为 
Yes, Ma'am. I hope so.

12
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,882
克莱拉 你很不同
You are quite the anomaly, Clara.

13
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:22,881
你没有像别的姑娘一样吃惊而渴望
You do not gasp and wonder with the rest of your sex.

14
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,882
先生 想让我吃惊可不是一个玩具就能做到的
Oh, it would take more than a toy to make me gasp, sir.

15
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,975
有这么被宠的孩子吗?
Was ever a child so adored?

16
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,975
有这么被溺爱的孩子吗?
Was ever a child so spoiled?

17
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,975
整个小衣柜里都是女装部的衣服
An entire wardrobe in miniature ordered from Ladieswear?

18
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:45,975
真可笑
What a farce!

19
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,590
如果你要申请奥德丽小姐的岗位
You might want to revise that opinion 

20
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,975
你或许要再斟酌一下你的话
if you're to apply for Miss Audrey's post.

21
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,975
鉴于这是芙罗拉父母的店
Seeing as Flora's parents own the store.

22
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,875
谁说我在申请?
Who said I was applying for anything?

23
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,975
海湾的沃尔特 他设了赌局
Walter. In the bays. He was offering odds.

24
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,975
一赔六赌你赢 一赔四赌德妮丝
Six to one for you, four to one on Denise.

25
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:00,976
他们在拿我们打赌吗?
They're betting on us?

26
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,219
我听见时也很震惊
I was scandalised when I heard.

27
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,221
谁在乎这个
Who cares about that?!

28
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:08,022
我在乎的是 出游的事怎么样了?
What I want to know is, what about the works outing?

29
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:12,065
去年莫里先生离开的时候我们错过了
We missed it last year when Mr Moray was away, so it stands to reason

30
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,065
按理说 今年我们应得双份快乐
we're due a double helping of pleasure this year.

31
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,065
你怎么好意思啊?
How do you even do that?

32
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,060
你就像天生就是个汗涔涔的荡妇
It's like you were born sweating smut.

33
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:21,065
我听说是要去看年度的蜡像
I heard it was the waxworks one year.

34
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,065
我迫不及待想看看蜡像了
Oh, I'd die to see the waxworks!

35
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,065
注: 基尼为英国古式货币

36
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,945
他们可能在三冠酒店的酒吧后面放十基尼
They could put ten guinea behind the bar of the Three Crowns

37
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,065
我会非常开心的
 and I'd be happy.

38
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,023
如果真要出游
As it so happens, 

39
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:30,066
我相信我对莫里的计划已有所了解
I believe I have a notion of Moray's plans.

40
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:32,869
哦 音乐厅
Oh, the Music Hall!

41
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,528
去年员工们被迫放弃了出游
Last year the staff had to forego their outing.

42
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:38,528
今年我们要补偿他们
This year, we shall make it up to them.

43
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,528
如果你确信音乐厅是最好的选择
If you're sure the Music Hall is the right choice.

44
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:41,485
达德利 只有一个星期了
One week only, Dudley. 

45
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:42,528
要是错过我们就是傻子了
We'd be fools to miss it.

46
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,528
我的意思是 舆论确实不利于我们
I mean, the tone does tend towards the improper.

47
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:48,528
达德利 每天为员工提供食物的女人
Dudley, the staff are daily served food by a woman who cannot

48
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,528
连往盘子里放布丁的时候都要冷嘲热讽几句
put a pudding on a plate without innuendo.

49
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:52,528
跟梅尔托生活在一起之后 我怀疑
After life with Myrtle, I doubt any of us

50
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,229
我们每个人都学会了冒犯
have sensibilities left to offend.

51
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:56,045
如果奥德丽小姐仍跟我们一起
You'd never have dared suggest

52
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,272
你是不敢提意见的
 it if Miss Audrey was still with us!

53
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,472
但是她没有 达德利 她没有
But she's not, Dudley! She's not.

54
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,273
提前关门让员工们出游?
Close early for a staff outing?

55
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,272
不可能
Out of the question!

56
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:10,272
我们的利润这么低 我真为你的想法感到吃惊
With profits so low, I'm surprised you even think to suggest it.

57
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,272
礼貌来说 利润在上涨
With respect, profits are rising.

58
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:14,272
况且年度出游并不是纯粹的放纵
And the annual outing is not a mere indulgence.

59
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,272
每一名员工都是我们的财富
Every member of our staff is an asset.

60
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:19,272
我们已经花时间和精力来训练他们 教育他们
It has taken time and care to train them, to teach them.

61
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,272
如果他们离开我们
If they leave us,

62
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:22,701
我们失去的不只是同事
we lose not just the colleague,

63
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,272
还有我们对他们的投资
 but the investment we've made in them.

64
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:28,272
我们发的工资并不能跟工厂相提并论
We cannot compete with the wages offered by industry 

65
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,563
所以我们必须用其他的方式
so we must work in other ways 

66
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,572
让我们成为特别的雇主
to make ourselves the employer of choice.

67
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,272
- "必须"? - 这是我们一直...
- "Must"? - Well, this is something we've always...

68
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:33,272
真是胡说
Oh, God's blood, man!

69
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:36,273
你随口说的"我们" 好像你是皇室一样
You bandy about that "we" as if you were royalty!

70
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:42,272
根本就没有"我们" 这里只有我和我的妻子
There is no "we". There is only myself and my wife.

71
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,272
还有你 我们的雇员
And you. Our employee.

72
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:47,973
至于音乐厅 莫里 真是非常粗俗
And the Music Hall, Moray! It is fearfully vulgar, you know.

73
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:52,272
寻找新的女装部主管进展的怎么样了?
How goes the search for a new Head of Ladieswear?

74
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,272
已经有几人递交了申请
Several applications have already been submitted.

75
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:57,272
过程必须如此正式吗?
Must the process be so formal?

76
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,272
难道我们不能简单地指定一个部门里的人吗?
Can't we simply appoint one of the girls already in the department?

77
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,272
例如克莱拉
Clara, for example.

78
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,272
说真的 亲爱的 我们不能简单地提升任何
Really, darling, we can't simply promote every female

79
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,731
你感兴趣的女人
that catches your eye. 

80
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:09,272
整个店都会归这个无礼的深色头发女人经营
the entire store would be run by pert brunettes!

81
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,272
想想 刚烫伤的手指
And one might imagine that fingers so recently burnt

82
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:14,272
还是会感到疼痛的
would still be smarting.

83
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:17,572
此外 要说有谁已证明了自己值得晋升的话
Besides, if anyone has proved themselves deserving

84
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:20,273
难道不是德妮丝吗?
of the advancement, surely it is Denise?

85
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:25,273
既然我们已经登了广告 我们必须按规则来
As we have advertised the post, we must follow protocol.

86
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:30,272
我可以建议本周末安排第一次面试吗?
May I suggest the first interviews at the end of the week?

87
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:33,273
务必安排 按正规程序来
By all means. Let due process be observed.

88
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,273
希望最优秀的人能赢
And may the best man win.

89
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:39,273
绅士们
Gentlemen.

90
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:51,272
我有种不安的感觉 我正被卷入一场战争
I have the disquieting sensation I'm caught up in a war,

91
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:53,272
战争的起因和目的只能自己猜测
the causes and objectives of which, I can only guess at.

92
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:58,273
达德利 这才是炮灰的含义
I believe, Dudley, that is the definition of cannon fodder.

93
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:22,272
女士 对不起
I'm sorry, Madam.

94
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:24,272
只有员工才有资格调整展示的衣服
Only members of staff are allowed to adjust the displays.

95
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:27,273
是不是有什么需要我帮忙的...?
But if there's anything I can help you with...?

96
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:34,272
快点 跟着她
Quick! Go after her!

97
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:36,474
看看她会不会从办公室拿表格来填
See if she picks up an application form from the office.

98
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,272
- 克莱拉... - 别说
- Clara... - Oh, don't.

99
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,272
我知道你要说什么
I know what you're going to say.

100
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:45,773
我们中的任何一人都比她那样的人强?
Better one of us, never mind which, than someone like her?

101
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,272
恐怕如果要我在你和
Well, I'm afraid if it came to a choice between you

102
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:52,272
鼻子下面有股怪味的丑老太婆
and some crone with a bad smell under her nose

103
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:55,181
或者嘴撅起来像猫屁股的人之间选择
and a mouth pursed up like a cat's arse,

104
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:56,272
我仍会选她
 I'd still pick her.

105
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,039
因为 说实话 
Because the truth is, 

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,572
我受不了人们总选你而不选我了
I cannot bear to have you chosen over me again.

107
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,272
如果你觉得你跟我想法不一样
And if you believe you'd feel differently,

108
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,273
那你根本就没有了解你自己
you don't even begin to know yourself.

109
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,272
德妮丝 我刚刚在街上看到一只松鸡
Denise? I've just seen a jay in the street.

110
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,272
朝河边飞去了
Flying towards the river.

111
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:13,273
我现在要休息一会 现在没什么事
I'll take my break now, while it's quiet.

112
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,673
德妮丝什么时候对小鸟感兴趣了
Since when did Denise care for birds?

113
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,272
噢 别自欺欺人了
Oh, don't perjure yourself!

114
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,273
还有什么比真爱更令人无法忍受的吗?
Was there ever anything as insufferable as true love?

115
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,272
德妮丝
Denise...

116
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:51,273
有时 我觉得当我死的时候 这就是我的天堂
Sometimes, I think that when I am dead, this will be heaven.

117
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:56,273
我走向这座桥 你站在这里 等着我
Me, walking toward this bridge, you standing here, waiting.

118
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,272
你的想法总是很伤感 我经常注意到
You have a maudlin cast of mind. I've often noted it.

119
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:02,272
你还注意到什么?
And what else have you noted?

120
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:05,272
你还没有递交女装部主管的申请
That you have not yet submitted an application for Head of Ladieswear.

121
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,272
我还没腾出时间
I've not yet had time.

122
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,272
别交
Don't.

123
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:13,272
凯瑟琳和她丈夫之间有矛盾
There is trouble between Katherine and her husband.

124
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:15,272
他想克莱拉担任这个位置 
He favours Clara for the position.

125
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:18,272
因为他喜欢克莱拉 凯瑟琳支持你
And because he favours Clara, Katherine champions you.

126
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:20,272
你们都是他们游戏中的棋子
You're both pawns in their game.

127
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,272
这件事不安全
That is not a safe thing to be.

128
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,415
你会跟克莱拉谈吗?
Will you be talking to Clara?

129
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,272
你会告诉她不要去申请?
 Will you tell HER not to apply?

130
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:28,273
我又不爱克莱拉
I do not love Clara!

131
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:33,272
德妮丝 你自己也说了 我们必须小心行事
Denise, you said so yourself, we must tread carefully.

132
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:36,272
我们所有的努力都是要赢回天堂百货
All of our efforts must go to winning back The Paradise.

133
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:40,272
如果奥德丽小姐没有离开
If Miss Audrey had not left, if...

134
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:42,272
事情可能就不同了
things might have been different...

135
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,873
但是现在她离开了
But now that she has,

136
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:47,273
我无法压制在我心中慢慢苏醒的欲望
 I cannot quiet this hunger that has awoken in me.

137
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:53,272
约翰 我有激情 我急切地想得到这个职位
I have such a passion, John! I burn to take this position.

138
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,272
一想到我必须靠边站 甚至不去尝试...
The thought that I must stand aside, not even try...

139
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:00,272
你从没有过极度渴望的东西吗?
Have you never longed for something so desperately?

140
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,272
除了它你什么都不想?
you could think of nothing else?

141
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,273
有 就是你
Yes! You.

142
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:08,272
甜心 等待实在是太难熬了
Sweetheart, is it really so hard to wait,

143
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:13,272
一年 或许几个月 天堂百货就是我们的了
when in a year, maybe months. The Paradise will be ours.

144
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,273
不仅会是女装部 所有的一切
Not just Ladieswear. Everything.

145
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:23,273
再叫我一遍这个名字 它会让我踏实点
Call me that name again. It will keep me steady.

146
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,273
甜心
Sweetheart.

147
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,273
甜心
Sweetheart.

148
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,273
甜心
Sweetheart.

149
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,272
你从巴黎远道而来 所以我必须教教你英语
You have come all the way from Paris, so I must teach you English.

150
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:48,272
既然那样 你得先提升自己的水平
In that case, you must improve your own.

151
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:50,273
洋娃娃不是过来 而是被带来的
The doll has not come, but been brought.

152
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:53,273
是的 爸爸
Yes, Papa.

153
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,272
芙罗拉 巴黎在哪?
Where is Paris, Flora?

154
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:58,272
在法国
In France.

155
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,272
那法国在哪?
And where is France?

156
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,272
海那边
Across the sea.

157
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,272
什么海?
Which sea?

158
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,273
是...
The...

159
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:07,273
...大西洋
..Atlantic.

160
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,873
你把法国跟美国搞混了
You confuse France with America.

161
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:17,273
不过也情有可原 都是发生革命的国家
Perhaps it's understandable - all those revolutions.

162
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:21,272
谁发现的美洲?
Who discovered America?

163
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,273
- 克里斯多弗・哥伦布 - 什么时候?
- Christopher Columbus.- When?

164
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,272
很久以前
A long time ago.

165
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,272
啊是啊 我也这么觉得
Oh, yes. I should think it was.

166
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,273
很久很久以前
A very long time ago.

167
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,273
久的让人不可思议
A fearfully long time ago.

168
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:38,272
1066年吗?
1066?

169
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,272
哦 天哪!
Well, heavens!

170
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:42,272
你这么看着她
How can anyone be expected to remember anything

171
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:43,872
谁能想起来那么多事啊?
when you look at them so?

172
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,273
要是当年你爸爸在婚礼上这么对我这么凶
I'm sure if your Papa had been so fierce with me at the altar,

173
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,273
我肯定连自己名字都想不起来了
I should have forgotten my own name.

174
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,272
晚安 亲爱的
Good night, my darling.

175
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:54,273
晚安 妈妈 晚安 父亲
Good night, Mama. Good night, Father.

176
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:04,272
她无知得可悲
Her ignorance is deplorable.

177
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,273
已经很晚了 她累了
It is late. She is tired.

178
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,273
你又这么严厉
And you were so stern.

179
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,273
是因为你背痛吗?
Is it your back?

180
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,273
是不是因为这个烦?
Does it trouble you?

181
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:23,273
我可以让佣人们退下 只剩你我二人
I could send the servants away...wait upon you myself.

182
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,273
我烦的不是背痛 凯瑟琳
It is not my wounds that gall me, Katherine.

183
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:32,272
今天在天堂百货 你怎么敢那样对我说话?
Today in The Paradise, how dare you speak to me as you did?

184
00:10:32,273 --> 00:10:34,572
我? 我冒犯你了吗?!
I? I have offended?!

185
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:37,073
我们已经说好了
We had an agreement.

186
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:40,272
你非要跟莫里斗我也不拦着你 
Lock horns with Moray if you must, 

187
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,272
但你别想打垮他
but you will not seek to crush him,

188
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,272
你也别满世界炫耀你的轻率之举
and you will not flaunt your indiscretions for the world to see.

189
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:46,273
你当我是你的玩偶吗?!
You imagine me your puppet?!

190
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:51,272
你以为我看不出你的小算盘吗?
Do you think I don't see how you scheme and manoeuvre?

191
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,272
你的眼睛一直盯着某个人不放
How your eyes never leave one person?

192
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:55,272
我说过了 他对我来说什么都不是
I have told you...he is nothing to me.

193
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:59,273
哦 你关注的并不是莫里
Oh, it is not Moray your eyes follow.

194
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,273
而是德妮丝
It is Denise.

195
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,513
而且 你不是因为爱才关注她 
And it is not love that draws you on, 

196
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,873
而是因为一些恶毒之事
but something noxious.

197
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,273
你想惩罚她
You wish to punish her.

198
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,273
为什么?
Why?

199
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,273
因为莫里选她没选你吗?
Because he chose her over you?

200
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:22,272
你看她的眼神就像猫凶狠的看着小鸟一样
Oh, you watch her as a cat watches a bird,

201
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:24,272
你伺机待发
hoping that circumstance will present you

202
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:27,272
企图反咬她一口 同时
with an opportunity to pounce. And in the meantime, 

203
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,272
你看似为她着想 
you work for her advancement,

204
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,272
那是因为她职位升得越高 将来也会跌的越重
because the higher she is raised, the further she will have to fall.

205
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,272
你胡说八道!
You are ridiculous!

206
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,590
不管你维护德妮丝利益的出发点是什么
Whatever your purpose in promoting Denise's interests, 

207
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:37,272
我警告你
I promise you,

208
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:40,272
如果你下次还敢在其他人面前羞辱我的话
if you ever again seek to humiliate me before other men...

209
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,272
哦 相信我 我从来没想那么做
Oh, believe me, I make no effort on that front.

210
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,273
你是自取其辱
You do the job so thoroughly yourself.

211
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,273
抱歉
I am sorry.

212
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,273
我累了
I am tired.

213
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:02,273
我一直在想芙罗拉
I've been thinking about Flora.

214
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:06,273
我没想到她会那么无知
Her ignorance appals me.

215
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:10,273
我该雇个女家庭教师了
I intend to engage a governess.

216
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,273
然后把阁楼改造成书房
The attic will be converted to a schoolroom.

217
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:18,272
今后不会再让她懒散 放纵
An end to idleness and indulgence.

218
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:22,273
也不许购物 玩洋娃娃了
To shopping and dolls.

219
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,272
没有出游?! 没有出游?!
No outing? No outing?!

220
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,272
我相信威斯顿先生认为在当前形势下...
I believe that Mr Weston feels that in the current climate...

221
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,272
当前形势算个屁!
Current climate be buggered!

222
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,272
他以为我多久才能享受一次这种待遇?
How often does he think I get to savour a treat like that?

223
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:53,272
一年只有一天 仅有这一天才能做我自己
One sole and solitary day a year to take my place in the world

224
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,272
才能像淑女一样享受闲暇!
and enjoy my leisure like a lady!

225
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,272
我有个披肩还准备穿呢!
I have a tippet I was to wear!

226
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,272
为什么会这样 达德利先生?
What was it to have to been, Mr Dudley?

227
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,272
是因为音乐厅 对吗?
Was it the Music Hall? Was it?

228
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,272
我不知道
I cannot say.

229
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,272
莫里本来要带我们去音乐厅的
Moray would have took us to the Music Hall,

230
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,272
而那个可恶的混球不准!
and that miserable bugger has forbade him!

231
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:11,972
我发誓要让他为此付出代价
Oh, I swear I will make him pay for this.

232
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,177
我要把他的心挖出来 
I will cut out his heart 

233
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,771
放盘子里 然后端上桌!
and serve it up on a platter!

234
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:19,272
记得提醒我去三冠酒店吃饭啊!
Remind me to start taking my meals at the Three Crowns!

235
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,376
德妮丝 我一直在考虑
Denise, I've been thinking about 

236
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,720
你申请接替奥德丽小姐职位的事 
your application for Miss Audrey's job... 

237
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,573
- 山姆 - 我突然想到
- Sam... - Now, it strikes me

238
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:26,272
有一点她有你没有...
 that the one thing she had that you do not...

239
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,272
- 山姆! - 是一句座右铭
- Sam! - ...is a motto.

240
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,272
山姆 我不申请了
Sam, I've decided not to apply.

241
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:31,272
不申请了?!
Not to apply?!

242
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:34,152
如果有人天生适合接替奥德丽小姐的位置
If anyone was born to fill Miss Audrey's shoes,

243
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,272
那就是你啊!
 it is you!

244
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,272
你会毁了沃尔特的赔率!
You'll cause havoc with Walter's odds.

245
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:40,272
他必须得把梅尔托的赔率从一赔五百调整到
He'll have to move Myrtle from 500 to one,

246
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:41,972
四百九十九赔五百了!
to 499!

247
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:46,273
五百！他娘的一赔五百?
500! 500 to bloody one?

248
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,272
你知道吗 我绞尽脑汁也想不出
You know, I've been racking me brains why you might choose

249
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:01,272
你为什么不申请做女装部主管
not to apply for Head of Ladieswear.

250
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,272
我只能想到一个原因
And there's only one thing I can think of.

251
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:07,272
你怀孕了吗?
Are you in trouble?

252
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,272
因为如果是这样 德妮丝 你要让他帮助你
Because if you are, you have to make him stand by you, Denise.

253
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,272
让他负责! 
Hold him to his promises!

254
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,272
你要是不跟他说我可以替你说...
 I'll talk to him if you can't do...

255
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:16,273
不！克莱拉 不是那样的
No! Clara. No. It's not that.

256
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,273
情况很复杂 但不是你想的那回事
It's complicated, but it's not that.

257
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:23,564
好吧 虽然你不打算说 
Well. I would ask, 

258
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:26,273
但我还是要问 到底是不是?
but you're not going to say. Are you?

259
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,273
如果我得到了那个工作
Look, I won't change anything, you know.

260
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:37,272
我不会做任何改变 任何
If it's me that gets the job. Not a thing.

261
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,272
但是在这儿我们可以做的事很多!
But there's so much more we could do here!

262
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:41,772
可以把它变成一个独一无二的部门!
This could be a department like no other.

263
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,272
一个前所未有的商店!
A store no one's ever been to before.

264
00:14:44,273 --> 00:14:46,011
甚至不再是一个商店 
Not even a shop any more, 

265
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:48,772
它会是一个... 梦幻的世界
it could be a... a fantasy.

266
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,780
这不是生活 德妮丝 这是工作 仅仅是工作
This isn't life, Denise, it's work, only work.

267
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:55,272
他们怎么看这事?
How did they take it?

268
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:56,881
他们大部分人... 很失望
Most of them ... disappointed. 

269
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:59,272
梅尔托... 快气疯了
Myrtle...murderous.

270
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:01,273
威斯顿!
Weston!

271
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,272
他借我之手惩罚他们
He punishes them through me.

272
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,273
不 他借他们之手惩罚你
No. He punishes you through them.

273
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:11,272
他是一个能发现人的弱点
He is a man who sees where the tender places are

274
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,273
然后有的放矢的家伙
and lands the blow accordingly.

275
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:21,272
抱歉打扰一下 莫里先生 
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr Moray, sir,

276
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,273
我能和你谈谈吗?
might I have a moment of your time?

277
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,272
我会在办公室
I will be in the office.

278
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:29,273
德妮丝
Denise.

279
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,185
再跟我说一遍 
Tell me again 

280
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,272
如果天堂百货是我们的 会怎么样!
what it will be like when The Paradise is ours!

281
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:41,272
再跟我说一遍我为何要袖手旁观!
Tell me again why I must stand aside.

282
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,272
发生什么事了?
What's happened?

283
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,273
克莱拉是...
Clara is...

284
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:49,272
... 我的朋友
..my friend.

285
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:53,272
但对她来说 女装部主管只是一份工作
But to her, Head of Ladieswear is only a job.

286
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:54,522
而对我来说 
To me, 

287
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,272
它却是我得以成长 呼吸 生存的机会!
it would be a chance to grow, to breathe, to live!

288
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:58,273
它...
It...

289
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,272
...会...
..will...

290
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:02,273
是...
be...

291
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,272
...值得的
..worth it.

292
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,272
我们在赌的是更重要的事
We are playing for bigger stakes.

293
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:10,272
我们必须把次要的想法放一边
We must set aside lesser considerations.

294
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,272
次要的想法?!
Lesser considerations?!

295
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:14,272
这只是一个部门
It's only one department.

296
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:18,272
另外 这次晋升并不在我们的利益范围内
Besides, perhaps this advancement would not have been in our interests.

297
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,636
如果像你认为的那样 
If, as you believe,

298
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,272
凯瑟琳不会像她假装的那样
 Katherine is not as accepting of the situation

299
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:25,272
接受我们的处境 那么你任何的失误
of us, as she would pretend, any failure on your part

300
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:27,272
只会被她用作对抗我们的武器
would only give her ammunition to use against us.

301
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,272
你觉得我会失败?!
You imagine I would fail?!

302
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,522
每个人都会失败! 
Everyone fails! 

303
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,272
只有犯错我们才能成长!
That is how we learn! By making mistakes.

304
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:38,272
大多数人都默默成长 你不需要大肆宣扬
Most of us do so privately. You would not have that luxury.

305
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:41,000
你太容易被看穿 太容易被人了解了
You are too visible, too known.

306
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,272
我俩的关系已经是众所周知的秘密了
Your association with me is a public secret.

307
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:46,272
从你选择的那一刻起 
You would be scrutinised and judged from the moment

308
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,272
你就注定会被大众审视 评价
you took on the role.

309
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,272
失败 错误...
Failure, mistakes...

310
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:52,272
你认为我没能力接替奥德丽小姐的位置吗?
Do you even believe me capable of filling Miss Audrey's shoes?!

311
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:55,272
你是我的小冠军 但这次可是大动作
I think you are my little champion, but this is a big step up.

312
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,272
别老是用对孩子的口气和我说话!
Do not speak to me as if I am a child!

313
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:00,272
德妮丝 我们不只接受来自本城的申请
Denise, we are receiving applications not just from the city,

314
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:02,272
而是更大范围的
but beyond.

315
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,793
我从未发现竞争是如此激烈
I've never known competition as fierce!

316
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:11,272
没错 你让我感到很惊讶
Look, you know that you astonish me,

317
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:14,272
你的想法更让我大吃一惊
that your ideas astonish me.

318
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:17,273
可想成为女装部主管要的可不仅是想法
But being Head of Ladieswear requires more than ideas.

319
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,272
放弃这场争斗吧 反正怎样都会输的
You are bowing out of a fight you may have lost anyway.

320
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:24,272
为之如此牺牲真的值吗?
Is that really such a sacrifice?

321
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:27,273
对我来说值!
It is to me!

322
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:38,272
我想申请
I would like to make an application

323
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,272
女装部主管这个职位
for the position of Head of Ladieswear.

324
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,272
德妮丝! 我以为你已经改变主意了
Denise! I thought you'd changed your mind.

325
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,273
我又改回来了
I've changed it back again.

326
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,272
如你们所知 我们这整个星期
As you know, we have, all week,

327
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,272
都不断收到来竞争奥德丽小姐空职的申请
been taking applications for the post vacated by Miss Audrey.

328
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:01,772
你们应该把我这话当成对你们自己的赞美
You should take it as a personal compliment to yourselves that

329
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:05,782
这么多才华横溢 经验丰富的候选人
so many talented but highly experienced candidates

330
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,272
申请成为你们中的一员
have applied to join your number.

331
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,576
现在申请已递交完毕 
All submissions are now in

332
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:10,272
我们将从中制定一份决选名单
 and we'll presently be drawing up a short list.

333
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:11,701
被选中的候选人
Successful candidates 

334
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:15,273
将被邀至天堂百货参加面试 谢谢
will be invited to The Paradise for interview. Thank you.

335
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:22,313
这两人就是脖子扭断了也不愿看对方一眼
Those two are going to give themselves neck strain not looking at each other.

336
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:35,273
伙计们 来下注吧
Right then, lads, let's be having your bets.

337
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,273
沃尔特!
Walter!

338
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,273
你在开赌
You are running a book.

339
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:49,273
赌谁会被任命为女装部的主管
Odds are given on who will be appointed Head of Ladieswear.

340
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:59,272
我愿意下注
I should like to place a bet.

341
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,273
十先令 押梅尔托
Ten shillings. On Myrtle.

342
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:13,272
亚瑟 你也许好奇为何我要浪费这十先令
Arthur. You're wondering why I choose to throw away ten shillings.

343
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:16,272
梅尔托甚至都没申请这个职位
Myrtle hasn't even applied for the job.

344
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:19,272
沃尔特提议下注的唯一原因是因为一想到她
The only reason Walter was offering odds is because the thought

345
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:22,272
代替奥德丽小姐 大家都会笑的
of her taking over from Miss Audrey made everyone laugh so.

346
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:26,273
你认为被大家当作笑柄感觉如何?
How do you suppose it feels to be the joke that everyone gets?

347
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:30,272
那么如果是有人表态了呢?
What if there were to be a gesture made?

348
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:32,272
十个先令 是表明有人认为
Ten shillings that said he considered Myrtle

349
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:34,273
梅尔托和所有人在所有事上都平等
the equal of anything and anyone.

350
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:38,273
那会让她好受些
It would make her feel better.

351
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:40,513
但是她得要听到这个才行
But only if she heard about it.

352
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:46,272
那么 我们下一步该做什么?
So. How do we progress?

353
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:47,499
等查阅完所有申请 
When all applications are read, 

354
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,272
你们每个人都写出一个或几个
it is for each of you to put forward

355
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:52,273
你们感觉值得面试的人
the name or names of those you feel merit an interview.

356
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,433
四个人进入决选
We have a short list of four.

357
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:21,272
如果我们这结束了 我要去见见芙罗拉
If our business is concluded, I should see to Flora.

358
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:23,272
我该如何回应那些
How would you like me to respond to the candidates

359
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:25,000
没在名单里的候选人?
who have not been so fortunate as to make the short list?

360
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,273
感谢他们的参与
Thank them for their interest.

361
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,874
告诉他们以后再有职位
Tell them we'll be happy to consider them

362
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,273
我们会很乐意考虑他们的
 for future positions.

363
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:41,272
弗兰克先生
Mr Franks.

364
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,272
为什么每次我一见到你
Why is it that, whenever I see you,

365
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:45,272
我都感觉你在看着我?
I have the impression that you're watching me?

366
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:49,272
我说过 我在看人这方面训练有素
I have told you, I have trained myself to know men.

367
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,273
知道一个人什么时候值得追随
To know when a man is worth the following.

368
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:57,272
同样了解历史的潮流何时改变
To also know when the tide of history is changing

369
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,273
并向新宠靠拢
and inclining towards a new favourite.

370
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:05,272
发现自己的用处 给这样的人效劳
To find oneself of use - of service - to such a man

371
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,273
将会感到十分荣幸
would be a very great privilege.

372
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,273
妈妈 快看!
Oh, Mama! Look!

373
00:21:28,273 --> 00:21:29,273
对不起
Excuse me.

374
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:39,273
她看上去很漂亮 你也是
She looks lovely. You both do.

375
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,354
真抱歉 威斯顿夫人
Oh, I am sorry, Mrs Weston.

376
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,273
亚瑟
Arthur.

377
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,472
威斯顿夫人有点不适 
Mrs Weston has taken faint. 

378
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,272
请帮我把这些交给克莱拉和德妮丝
Please deliver these to Clara and Denise.

379
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,272
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

380
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:54,273
来 挽着我的手
Come. Take my arm.

381
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:23,272
威斯顿夫人 我无意冒犯
Mrs Weston, I do not wish to intrude

382
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:25,272
但是我不能看着你这么痛苦
but I cannot see you in such distress

383
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:29,273
而不问问是否有我能帮得上忙的地方
and not ask if there is any way in which I might help.

384
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:33,273
你是位父亲 对吗?
You are a father, are you not?

385
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:36,272
我有两个孩子
I have two children.

386
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,273
当我结婚时我没想到...
When I married I did not expect...

387
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:43,273
芙罗拉她...
Flora is...

388
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:47,872
我丈夫发现她简直无知得可悲
My husband finds her woefully ignorant.

389
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,003
或许她的确是
And perhaps she is.

390
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:55,272
但是我并不想让她被赶进书房
But I do not want her banished to the schoolroom with lessons

391
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:58,373
跟着老师上课 而没有关爱
and tutors and no love.

392
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,272
我不想失去她
I do not want to lose her.

393
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:05,273
我不会情愿我的孩子无知地成长
Well, I should not care for my children to be raised in ignorance.

394
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:09,273
但为什么一定要在书房里?
But why must it be in a schoolroom?

395
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:12,273
为什么你不能教她呢?
Why can you not teach her?

396
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:15,272
你是个有学问的女人
You are an accomplished woman

397
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:17,272
旅行又增长了你的见闻
and you have had the benefit of travel to broaden your mind.

398
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:20,272
我太肤浅了 我几乎都不记得了
I am so shallow, I remember almost none of it.

399
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,272
再好不过了
All the better.

400
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:24,272
你可以同时教芙罗拉和你自己
You can teach Flora and yourself at the same time.

401
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:27,272
如果我们自己不以身作则 我们的孩子
I cannot see how our children can be expected to acquire

402
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,072
就不可能如我们期望地那样热爱学习 
a love of learning unless we ourselves demonstrate it.

403
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,673
那你是按照你的原则去做的吗?
And do you follow your own precept?

404
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:37,272
每天我翻开词典随便找一个单词
Every day I open the dictionary at random and pick out a word

405
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:39,273
并把它牢记在脑中
and commit it to memory.

406
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,273
虽然我在医学术语和灌木上有点偷懒
Though I discount medical terms and shrubs.

407
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:50,273
你这种对知识的渴求真让我感到羞愧
Such a thirst for knowledge. You quite put me to shame.

408
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,273
有一天 我们还年轻时 
One day, when we were young, 

409
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:56,273
莫里用了一个我不懂的词
Moray used a word I did not understand.

410
00:23:57,273 --> 00:24:01,272
我意识到如果我不努力 像他一样渴求进步
I realised that if I did not try and match his hunger for betterment,

411
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,273
那么他将遥遥领先 我就再也无法追上他了
then he would get so far ahead of me I would never catch him again.

412
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:07,354
我也不想失去他
I did not want to lose him.

413
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:14,272
你不要感觉是你一个人在努力
You need not feel alone in your efforts.

414
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:17,272
如果你能考虑让芙罗拉走出你的视线一阵子
If you would consider allowing Flora out of your sight for a time,

415
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,272
那么天堂百货的生意对她就是一种教育
then the business of The Paradise can be an education in itself.

416
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:23,273
并且我认为现在我该有个初学者来协助我了
And I believe it is high time I had a junior to assist me.

417
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,272
山姆!
Sam!

418
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:29,272
你在决选名单上!
You made the short list!

419
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:31,272
还有克莱拉和另外两个人
And Clara. And two others.

420
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,272
还有那嘴巴像猫屁股一样的女人
Including her with a mouth like a cat's arse.

421
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,272
我看大家都被梅尔托的"文雅"给传染啦
I see Myrtle's refinement is rubbing off on all of us!

422
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,272
- 什么时候面试? - 明天
- When are the interviews? - Tomorrow.

423
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:39,772
山姆 你说的奥德丽小姐有
Sam, what did you mean

424
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:42,272
但我没有的是句座右铭是什么意思?
when you said the only thing Miss Audrey had that I don't is a motto?

425
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,252
不只是奥德丽小姐
Not just Miss Audrey.

426
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:45,395
这座大楼里每个部门的主管
Every Head of Department in this building 

427
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,272
都有条标志性的座右铭
has a signature saying.

428
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:47,772
奥德丽小姐的座右铭是 
With Miss Audrey it was, 

429
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,272
呃 灵感总是在晚上到来
er, things came to her in the night.

430
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:52,272
玻璃制品部的爱德华先生则一直都在声明
Mr Edwards in Glassware is for ever declaring,

431
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:55,272
"水晶上的污点就是我们部门的污点"
"A smudge on the crystal is a slur on the department."

432
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,272
海湾的沃尔特是...
With Walter in the bays, it's...

433
00:24:57,273 --> 00:25:00,272
- "我知道你做了什么" - 我知道你做了什么
- "I can see what you're doing." -  I can see what you're doing.

434
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:01,272
你不能没有座右铭 德妮丝
You cannot be without one, Denise.

435
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:06,272
我冒昧地写了几句不错的
Now, I took the liberty of setting down a few possibilities.

436
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,986
"姑娘们 姑娘们 姑娘们
"Girls. Girls. Girls. 

437
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,272
姑娘们 姑娘们"
Girls. Girls."

438
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:12,272
我喜欢这个词 还有你念它的方式
I like the word. I like the way you say it.

439
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:14,272
也许更多的是个人意见 那一条
Perhaps more of a personal treat, that one.

440
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:17,272
"当一天结束 我们的工作结束"
"When the day is done, so are we."

441
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:19,272
以防懒惰
In case of idleness.

442
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:21,272
"在皮布尔斯有句老话" 
"We have a saying in Peebles."

443
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,272
皮布尔斯: 英国苏格兰中部古国

444
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:25,272
最妙的是你可以把它用在员工和顾客两者上
Ah, now, the genius of that one is you can use it on staff and customers alike.

445
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,272
反正又没人知道在皮布尔斯有什么话
Well, since no-one has any notion of what is said in Peebles,

446
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:29,272
你可以任意加上你喜欢的话
you can append it to whatever you like.

447
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:33,272
你自己的想法 说出来就像谚语一样权威
Your own thoughts, delivered with all the authority of a proverb.

448
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:36,272
"在皮布尔斯有句老话"
"We have a saying in Peebles."

449
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:40,272
噢 梅尔托 难道这事儿不能私下里整理吗?
Oh, Myrtle, is that not something the three of you could arrange in private?

450
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:45,272
山姆对本季的露胸装没有概念
Sam has no notion of this season's decollete.

451
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,272
好了
There.

452
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,272
恭喜你!德妮丝!
Congratulations, Denise!

453
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:50,011
谢谢 亚瑟 
Thank you, Arthur. 

454
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:53,272
虽然 乔纳斯先生会不高兴的
Though, er, Mr Jonas shouldn't be pleased.

455
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:56,272
你们没听说吗? 大家都在谈论这个呢
Haven't you heard? Everyone's talking about it.

456
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:58,272
他押十个先令赌梅尔托会得到这份工作
He put ten shillings on Myrtle to get the job.

457
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:00,273
一赔五百
At 500-1.

458
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,273
那个?
That one?

459
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:12,272
- 荷兰语 - 这个?
- Dutch. - This?

460
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:13,272
西班牙语
Spanish.

461
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:15,272
那边的呢
Over yonder?

462
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,272
意大利语 像西班牙语 但更像意语
Italian! Like the Spanish, but with more Is.

463
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,272
芙罗拉 你太惊人了
Flora, you are a marvel.

464
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:23,272
仅用了一个上午你就能分辨欧洲所有的语言了
In one morning you have managed to identify every European language

465
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:25,273
甚至一些更远地方的
and a few from further afield.

466
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:31,272
现在 这些从日本来的箱子对我们非常重要
Now, the crates from Japan are particularly precious to us at this time.

467
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,272
你觉得是为什么
Why do you suppose that is?

468
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,272
日本的玩意儿很流行?
Japanese items are popular?

469
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:36,272
是的
They are.

470
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:38,272
会断货吗?
Is there a shortage?

471
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:40,273
恐怕有 这又是为什么?
We fear one. And why might that be?

472
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,272
发生了一场大灾难
There has been a great disaster.

473
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:45,272
他们的海军在风暴中沉没了
Their navy was sunk in a storm

474
00:26:45,273 --> 00:26:47,272
所以现在他们不能运送他们做的东西
and now they are unable to deliver the goods they have made.

475
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,272
呃 那应该是场特大风暴
Well, that would have to be a mighty storm indeed.

476
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:52,272
不过你能联想到灾难上还不错
But you are right to think in terms of disaster.

477
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,272
只是这种灾难是人为的
Only this one was man-made.

478
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:55,272
战争!
A war!

479
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:59,272
酝酿中的战争 战争摧毁贸易和生命 看吧?
A war brewing. And war destroys trade as well as lives. See?

480
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:00,939
通过逻辑推理 
Through logical deduction,

481
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,272
你慢慢地掌握了一些世界知识了
 you have come to a grasp of world affairs.

482
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:06,272
累么? 好极了
Tired? Very well, then.

483
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:08,272
有些人我想让你见一见
There are some people I should like you to meet.

484
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,881
四码半的三乘六大小最好的亚麻布
Four and a half yards of finest cambric at three and six

485
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:12,272
卖十五先令九便士
 makes 15 shillings and ninepence.

486
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:15,272
加上罗缎丝带值十六先令整
Add the grosgrain ribbon, we'll call it an even 16.

487
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:18,272
- 那么丝带花费多少? - 三便士?
- Which means the ribbon costs? - Thruppence?

488
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,731
女士们先生们 
Ladies and gentlemen, 

489
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:23,272
这是我的新助手 芙罗拉・威斯顿小姐
my new assistant, Miss Flora Weston.

490
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,272
你怎么算得这么快?
How do you do it so fast?

491
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,272
山姆比任何人都熟悉乘法表
Sam knows his times tables like no-one else.

492
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:28,272
这可不容易
It's not easy.

493
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,272
比方说 七七表就非常之难
The seven times table, for example, is the very devil.

494
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:32,272
正常人可记不住它
No sane person can learn it,

495
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:34,272
你必须巧妙地将它放在脑中
you have to keep it in your head with tricks.

496
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:37,273
不过九九表... 现在有种九九表
Nines, on the other hand... Now, there's a pattern with nines.

497
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:40,273
- 按钮(法语)!- 是的!
- Bouton! - Yes!

498
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:44,273
- 手套!(法语) - 非常好!
- Gant! - Very good!

499
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:49,272
雨伞(法语)
Parapluie.

500
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:52,272
芙罗拉纠正了达德利的发音

501
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:50,772
Parapluie才对 
Parapluie. 

502
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,272
因为Pluie是雨的意思
Because pluie is rain.

503
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:53,663
我今天学了好多 
I have learned so many things today, 

504
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:56,272
我都不知道怎么把它们装进脑子里
I don't know how they will fit inside my head.

505
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:58,272
大脑的空间比你想象地要大得多
There's more room in there than you think.

506
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:59,837
你可能会忘记一些 
Some items may fall out,

507
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:02,272
不过绝大多数都会留在你的脑中
 but most'll find a place to lodge.

508
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,273
芙罗拉小姐
Miss Flora.

509
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:07,272
恶毒是什么意思?
What does noxious mean?

510
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:10,272
怎么 那是另一种有害的说法
Why, it's another way of saying harmful.

511
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:12,272
我不知道人们怎么说梅尔托的厨艺
I don't know what people have been saying about Myrtle's cooking,

512
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,272
不过我可以跟你保证 她做得蛋糕美味极了
but I can assure you, her cake is excellent.

513
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:19,272
有害的? 妈妈为什么想害德妮丝?
Harmful? Why would Mama wish to harm Denise?

514
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:22,272
爸爸说这就是为什么妈妈总盯着德妮丝
Papa says that is why Mama watches her all the time,

515
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:24,272
不过我想他一定错了
but I think he must be confused.

516
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:26,753
我觉得妈妈整天看着她是因为她太美了
I think Mama watches her all the time because she is so pretty.

517
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:33,272
那孩子听到了些什么
The child overheard something.

518
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:34,272
她就是一个孩子
She is a child.

519
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:37,272
她不能肯定什么 我们也不行
She cannot be sure what was meant, nor can we.

520
00:28:37,273 --> 00:28:39,003
不管这意味着什么 
Whatever the meaning, 

521
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:42,272
非常明显威斯顿女士对德妮丝保有恶意
it is clear that Mrs Weston bears some manner of ill-will towards Denise,

522
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:45,272
而她却支持她成为女装部的主管
and yet she advocates her for Head of Ladieswear.

523
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,273
这种矛盾让我感到恐慌
There is a paradox in that which unnerves me.

524
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:51,891
我对威斯顿夫人没有敌意
I am no enemy to Mrs Weston,

525
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,272
但德妮丝是我的朋友
 but Denise is my friend.

526
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:58,672
我关心她 而现在... 我担心她
I care for her and now... I fear for her.

527
00:28:58,773 --> 00:28:59,999
你以为我不担心吗?
You think I don't?

528
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:01,182
我是觉得你不在的时候 
I think you did not see her as I did 

529
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:02,272
你没有像我一样每天看着她
every day of your absence

530
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,972
看她一个人 面对流言蜚语
alone, exposed to gossip and rumour

531
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,272
还有丑闻的猜忌
and the speculation of scandalmongers,

532
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:11,272
身边没有她爱的人
without the man she loves,

533
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:15,272
她没有办法与任何人分享她的感受
unable to share the feelings of her heart with anyone.

534
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:19,272
被盯住 被指戳 被说闲话
Stared at and pointed at and whispered about.

535
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,272
尽管如此 
And yet through it all, 

536
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:24,272
她却总是抬起头熟练地礼貌地优雅地完成工作
she held her head up and did her job with skill and courtesy and grace,

537
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:29,273
即使有段时间支撑住她的仅仅是她强烈的意志
even though there were days when I could see the only thing holding her together was her own force of will.

538
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:34,873
我从没有这么尊敬过一个人
I've never held anyone in higher esteem. 

539
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,273
即使是你 莫里
Not even you, Moray.

540
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:45,545
德妮丝很勇敢很机智 
Denise is gallant and resourceful.

541
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:49,273
但这并不代表她不会受伤害
 But she's not invulnerable.

542
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:53,272
你曾劝她退出这场争斗
You persuaded her once to withdraw from the fray.

543
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,273
不能再做一次吗?
Could you not do so again?

544
00:29:57,273 --> 00:30:00,272
我怕德妮丝不愿意再听我的了
I fear Denise is no longer minded to listen to me.

545
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:02,273
你必须让她听你的
Then you must make her.

546
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,272
我太愚蠢无知了
I am disgracefully ignorant

547
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,273
我再也不能忍了
and I simply cannot tolerate it any longer.

548
00:30:21,273 --> 00:30:23,273
我决定自学
I am determined to educate myself.

549
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,273
哦 我看到了法国选举
Oh, I see there are elections in France.

550
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:32,272
小姐你对政治有兴趣吗?
Do you take an interest in politics Mademoiselle?

551
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:36,272
没有? 那你可能想知道
No? Then perhaps you would care to know that

552
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:39,272
威尔士王子在苏格兰枪击
the Prince Of Wales is shooting in Scotland

553
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:43,272
还有下议院准备讨论日本问题
and the House Of Commons is to debate the Japanese question.

554
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,272
那你觉得会讨论什么问题呢
Now, what do you suppose that is

555
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:48,272
还有他们为什么要讨论这个问题?
and why do you suppose they're debating it?

556
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:51,273
我想可能和日本正在酝酿的战争有关
I expect it has something to do with the war brewing in Japan.

557
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:55,272
你对日本即将到来的战争有什么看法?
And what do you know of the impending war in Japan?

558
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:57,272
它扰乱贸易 爸爸
It disrupts trade, Papa.

559
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:01,273
我想也许这就是政府要争论的原因
I think perhaps that is why the government wish to debate it.

560
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:05,273
我曾以为你没有头脑
And I thought you empty-headed.

561
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,272
芙罗拉 我好像错看了你
Flora, it seems I misjudged you.

562
00:31:09,273 --> 00:31:11,272
现在我脑子里装了各种各样的东西
I have all manner of things in my head now.

563
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:13,273
但达德利先生说我还能容纳更多
But Mr Dudley says there is still room for more.

564
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,272
达德利先生
Mr Dudley.

565
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:18,272
我享受了一整天爸爸!
I have had such a day, Papa!

566
00:31:18,273 --> 00:31:20,272
我们属于天堂百货 我太高兴了
I am so glad that we belong to The Paradise.

567
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:24,272
我们不属于天堂百货 天堂百货属于我们
We do not belong to The Paradise. The Paradise belongs to us.

568
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,272
她只是说她觉得那里像家一样
She means only that she feels at home there.

569
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:30,273
我的女儿 觉得在店里像在家里一样?
My daughter, at home in a shop?

570
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:36,272
芙罗拉 到你房间去
Flora. Run along to your room.

571
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:39,273
玛莎会帮你准备睡觉
Martha will be wanting to get you ready for bed.

572
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,273
晚安 妈妈
Good night, Mama.

573
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:51,272
我想我已经把我的想法说得很清楚了
I thought I'd made my feelings clear.

574
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:54,272
天堂不是她的游乐场
The Paradise is not her playground.

575
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,272
但是你看看她学到了多少
But see how much she has learnt.

576
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:58,272
我不容许我的女儿看起来
I will not have my daughter smelling of that shop

577
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:01,272
像是商人的种一样
as if she were the spawn of some merchant!

578
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:03,272
也许你是对的
Perhaps you were right.

579
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:08,272
家庭教师 看来都没有必要了
A governess, tutors - it all does seem rather unnecessary.

580
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,272
也许我就应该直接把她送到学校去
Perhaps I should simply send her away to school.

581
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:12,272
我不允许! 你听到了吗? 我不会允许的!
I will not allow it! Do you hear me? I will not!

582
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:14,272
你竟敢命令我?!
You dare to dictate to me?!

583
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,836
我警告你 凯瑟琳 
I warned you, Katherine, 

584
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:17,848
不要指望我的修养
do not presume on my gallantry

585
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,272
也不要以为你是女人我就不敢怎么样
 or the protection of your sex.

586
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,118
如果你选择和我拔剑相向 
If you choose to cross swords with me, 

587
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,272
我会让你记得你嫁的是一个士兵
I will make you remember you married a soldier.

588
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:24,272
我会迎战的 懂吗?
I will meet you head on. Yes?

589
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:27,272
可你要忍受你背上的伤
And yet you bear your scars on your back.

590
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,273
滚出去 滚出去!
Get out. Get out!

591
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:41,272
你在紧张明天的面试吗?
Are you nervous about your interviews tomorrow?

592
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:44,273
如果是我我会的 我会合不了眼的
I would be if I were you. I wouldn't sleep a wink.

593
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,272
哦 让我猜猜
Oh, let me guess.

594
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:51,272
你在去三冠酒店的路上看见了夜莺?
You saw a nightingale on the way to The Three Crowns?

595
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,273
或者是莫里先生办公室的花鸡?
Or was it a chaffinch in Mr Moray's office?

596
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,273
我很快回来
I won't be long.

597
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,228
好吧 如果那两个人重修旧好的话
Well, if those two are on terms again, 

598
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,272
我可能会放弃的
I may as well give up.

599
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:09,272
而且 就一次 我觉得我有机会成功
And, just for once, I thought I might be in with a chance.

600
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:11,129
莫里先生不会就因为他喜欢德妮丝
Mr Moray wouldn't give Denise the job just 

601
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,272
而给她这份工作的
because he likes her.

602
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,272
- 他不是这样的人 - 亚瑟是对的
- He's not like that. - Arthur's right.

603
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:18,272
如果他对爱情这样傻那他绝对建不起天堂百货
If he was such a fool for love he would never have built up The Paradise.

604
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:20,273
如果他不是 他永远不会失去爱
If he wasn't, he'd have never lost it.

605
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:54,272
德妮丝
Denise.

606
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,354
你为什么要见我?
Why did you wish to see me?

607
00:33:58,273 --> 00:34:01,272
我从巴黎回来的时候 你告诉我...
When I returned from Paris, you told me that...

608
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:04,272
凯瑟琳太冷静了 太好了
Katherine was too calm, too kind.

609
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:07,263
让你害怕
That you feared her.

610
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:11,273
你这样做是对的 她想伤害你
You were right to do so. She means you harm.

611
00:34:13,273 --> 00:34:14,272
如果你获得了这份工作...
If you win this role...

612
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:17,000
你觉得我没能力做那份工作
This role that you do not consider me ready for or capable of?

613
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,367
如果你成为了女装的总管 
If you are made Head Of Ladieswear, 

614
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:21,272
你会在明处 失去遮掩
you will be visible. Exposed.

615
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:25,272
而且不管凯瑟琳怎么做 我都没有办法保护你
And whatever Katherine's designs, I will not be able to shield you.

616
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:27,972
你担心你的计划会因为我而破坏?
You fear your plans will suffer through me?

617
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:30,273
不 我担心你会受伤!
No, I fear you will suffer!

618
00:34:32,273 --> 00:34:34,972
直到达德利告诉我 我才意识到
I had not realised until Dudley told me

619
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,177
我去法国的那段日子 
how my departure to France 

620
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:39,872
你是怎样脆弱 没人保护
left you vulnerable, unprotected.

621
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:44,002
我无论如何也不想再让事情重演
I would not, for all the world, have that happen again.

622
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:48,272
德妮丝 求求你...
Denise, please...

623
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,523
让我保护你 
let me keep you safe.

624
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:54,273
求求你... 退出吧
 Please... withdraw.

625
00:34:58,273 --> 00:35:01,994
当你是我这个年纪时 
When you were my age,

626
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:04,872
你在建立天堂百货
 you were building The Paradise.

627
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:07,263
是的 但你不是我
Yes, but you are not me.

628
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:11,272
- 你是你自己 - 你的小冠军
- You are yourself - Your little champion.

629
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:14,272
- 是的 - 但不是你的对手
- Yes! - But not your equal?

630
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,273
你是不同的
You are different.

631
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:22,272
当我是你这个年龄时 我确实在建立天堂百货
When I was your age I was building The Paradise.

632
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,272
但不仅仅是因为我有想法
But not only because I had the ideas,

633
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:28,272
更是因为我走进外面的世界 去求 去借 
because I'd gone out into the world and begged and borrowed

634
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:31,098
战战兢兢地寻找资金上的支持
and browbeaten my way into the kind of financial backing 

635
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,272
来让我的想法成为现实
that turns ideas into reality.

636
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:35,272
我在你身上看不到这点
That is not something I see in you.

637
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:39,272
因为如果我去银行寻找资金支持
Because if I walked into a bank seeking financial backing,

638
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,272
他们会以为我是去当清洁工
they would assume I'd come to sell my services as a cleaner

639
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:44,272
或是干脆把自己给买了
or perhaps just to sell myself.

640
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,272
我都不知道女人能不能通过那些门槛
I do not even know that a woman would be allowed through the doors.

641
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:51,272
这种不同不是我造成的
It is different for me but not because I am different

642
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:54,273
而是这世界就是如此
but because the world treats me so.

643
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:57,273
你不明白吗
Can you not see that?

644
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:04,272
我不想你变成另一个版本的我
I would not want you to become another version of what I am.

645
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:07,272
像我一样
Of who I am.

646
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:08,273
约翰...
Oh, John...

647
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:12,273
..这是我们意见相左的地方
..that is where we differ.

648
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:22,273
德妮丝
Denise.

649
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:25,272
他不明白
He cannot see.

650
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:28,272
他不明白我在各个方面都和他一样
He cannot see that I am like him in every way.

651
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:31,272
限制我的成就的并不是我的内在原因
That the limits to what I might achieve are not inside me

652
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,273
而是外因
but outside.

653
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:38,272
抱歉
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:41,272
这么晚了 你没必要听我的抱怨
It's late, you do not have to listen to my tales of woe.

655
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:44,273
我会听你告诉我的一切
I would listen to whatever you had to tell me.

656
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:50,273
我只希望向他展示我真正的才能
I only wish that I could show him what I'm truly capable of.

657
00:37:40,273 --> 00:37:45,272
在莫里先生办公室的走廊上放四把椅子
Set four chairs in the corridor outside Mr Moray's office.

658
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:49,272
威斯顿夫人 你来早了
Mrs Weston. You are in advance of the schedule.

659
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:50,320
面试还没开始...
Interviews aren't set to commence until... 

660
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,272
我想先跟你谈谈
I wanted to see you first.

661
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:53,272
真是史上最不幸的事
It is the most unfortunate thing.

662
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,272
芙罗拉的娃娃 似乎在生产的时候有些问题
Flora's doll. It seems there was a fault. In the manufacture.

663
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:00,272
真的很抱歉 夫人 我们当然会换新的给你
I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am. We will of course replace it.

664
00:38:00,273 --> 00:38:03,272
如果你可以把有缺陷的产品给我
If you could let me have the defective item.

665
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:05,272
不
No!

666
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:07,272
它不见了 是我的错
It is gone. It is my fault.

667
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:11,272
我不想让芙罗拉看到并... 伤心
I did not wish Flora to see it and be... distressed.

668
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:14,272
我告诉她我们会再给她一个一模一样的
I have told her we will replace it with another the same,

669
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:15,850
就要一个一样的 
just the same 

670
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:18,413
然后就像什么也没发生过一样
and it will be as if nothing happened.

671
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,272
威斯顿夫人 出了什么问题吗
Mrs Weston, is something wrong?

672
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:22,273
发生了什么让你伤心的事吗
Has something happened to distress you?

673
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:27,273
谢谢你对芙罗拉的照顾
Thank you for the care you took with Flora.

674
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,273
我不会忘记的
I will not forget.

675
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:40,273
先生 我可以跟您谈谈吗
Sir, might I have a moment of your time.

676
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:45,273
今早我头痛欲裂
I've a devilish head on me this morning.

677
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:49,272
昨晚的事一片模糊
Last night is something of a fog.

678
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:53,272
我想不起来我怎么会
I can't remember what I was drinking,

679
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,273
喝这么多酒
other than too much.

680
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:59,273
祝你健康
Your health.

681
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:07,272
我能帮到你什么
How can I be of help?

682
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:11,272
我以为应该反过来讲
I was hoping it might be the other way round.

683
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:12,673
我可能会帮到您
That I may be of assistance to you.

684
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:16,273
我不觉得我需要帮助
I wasn't aware I stood in need of assistance.

685
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:20,272
是 你可能不需要
No. Quite possibly you are not.

686
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:23,272
你必须明白 天堂百货不仅仅只是个地方
You must understand... The Paradise is more than just a place.

687
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:27,273
还包括工作人员 这帮人的首领是莫里
It's a people, a tribe whose leader is Moray.

688
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:32,273
他们软弱 易受骗 并且极度忠诚
They are weak, credulous, loyal beyond measure.

689
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:36,272
他们没有看到莫里气数已尽
They do not see that Moray's time is past,

690
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,273
只是他对他们很好 是他们承认的领袖
only that he was good to them, their rightful king.

691
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:43,115
每个反对他的小动作
Every action against him 

692
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:46,273
都会增加他们的忠诚度
increases their loyalty.

693
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:48,415
有可能 极有可能 
It is possible, more than possible,

694
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,272
他们对这男人的愚忠
 that in their ill-conceived

695
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:56,272
会使他们攻击被他们视为篡权者的人
fidelity to the man, they might turn on those they view as his usurpers.

696
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:59,272
他们如果发起内部斗争
They'd be turning on themselves in the process.

697
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:02,272
我将解雇他们所有人
I'd sack every man jack of them.

698
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:04,272
那天堂百货会怎么样呢
What would then happen to The Paradise?

699
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,273
那下金蛋的鹅
The goose that lays the golden eggs.

700
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,272
我不能容忍暴动
I will not tolerate insurrection.

701
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:16,272
我告诉您了 他们简单 容易上当
I have told you, they are simple, credulous.

702
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:19,272
我们只需要转移他们的忠诚
All that is needed is for them to transfer their loyalty.

703
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:22,272
他们现在所有的抱怨嘀咕都是围绕着
All their murmurings and mutterings at present

704
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:25,273
禁止他们组团去音乐厅的
centre around the forbidden outing to the Music Hall.

705
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:30,273
如果您找到改变现状的方法...
If you were to find a way of restoring it...

706
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:37,272
以我的经验来说 撤销禁令
In my experience, the rescinding of an order is never anything

707
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:39,272
是示弱的表现
but an exhibition of weakness.

708
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,272
我相信还有其他方法
I believe there is another way.

709
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,272
您今天早上将面试
You are this morning conducting interviews

710
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,273
竞选女式服装部主管的候选人 不是吗
for the Head of Ladieswear, are you not?

711
00:41:01,273 --> 00:41:04,367
如果一位顾客想要一件礼服 
If a customer was desirous of a gown 

712
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:06,272
可你觉得不适合她
you did not think suited her,

713
00:41:06,273 --> 00:41:07,272
你会怎么说
what would you say?

714
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:09,272
那要由礼服的价钱决定
That would depend on the price of the gown.

715
00:41:09,273 --> 00:41:12,272
在冒昧的发表对这件事的看法之前
Before venturing an opinion on the matter,

716
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:16,272
我会先去找更有经验的领导征求意见
I would seek the advice of a more experienced authority.

717
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,272
先生 我觉得有些真相是女人不想听到的
Sir, I believe there are some truths a woman does not wish to hear.

718
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:22,272
我会直接告诉她
I would tell her the truth.

719
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,272
我不想顾客兴起才来
I do not want her custom only today,

720
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,272
我希望客人们成回头客
but tomorrow and for many years to come.

721
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:29,272
要做到这点 我们和顾客之间必须信任彼此
And for that, there must be a trust between us.

722
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:33,272
真心实意 让别人感受到我们对产品的自信
At the heart of it, one must have faith in one's own stock.

723
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:37,272
如果给你这个提升的机会 你会做出哪些改变
If you were given this advancement, what would you change?

724
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:39,273
一切听领导安排
Whatever I was told to.

725
00:41:40,273 --> 00:41:43,272
天哪 从哪开始说呢
Heavens! Where to start?

726
00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:45,272
我不会改变任何事
I wouldn't change a thing.

727
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:47,748
如果奥德丽小姐觉得够好了 
If it was good enough for Miss Audrey,

728
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:49,272
那我也觉得够好了
 it's good enough for me.

729
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,272
我会改变任何我觉得需要改变的事
I would change, anything I felt needed changing.

730
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:55,772
你介意说的更详细点吗
Would you care to be more specific?

731
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:57,272
为什么 不行
Why, no.

732
00:41:57,273 --> 00:42:01,272
因为如果我告诉你了 我恐怕就升不了职了
Because then you would have my ideas and I might have no advancement.

733
00:42:01,273 --> 00:42:05,272
你似乎很看重你的想法啊 洛维特小姐
You seem to set great store by your ideas,  Miss Lovett.

734
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:09,273
我不仅有想法 更会用我的能力去实现它们
Not just by my ideas, but by my ability to make them real.

735
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,272
洛维特小姐 最后一个问题
Miss Lovett? One last question.

736
00:42:13,273 --> 00:42:16,272
我们假设 为了鼓舞士气
Let us say, that for reasons of morale,

737
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:19,272
你想带员工们去音乐厅
you wished to take the staff on a trip to the Music Hall.

738
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:22,999
再假设 由于种种原因
And let us say, that for reasons 

739
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,272
我们不能去 你被拒绝了
we need not go into, you were denied.

740
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:27,773
你会怎么做
What would you do?

741
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:34,272
如果我不能带员工们去音乐厅 我相信
If I could not take the staff to the Music Hall, I believe

742
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:38,272
我会找方法把音乐厅带到他们面前
I would seek to bring the Music Hall to them.

743
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:41,272
如果你被告知 考虑到以防资金运转不周
And if you were told that the considerations preventing

744
00:42:41,273 --> 00:42:45,272
没有任何预算
attendance were in part financial, that there was no budget

745
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:49,272
去请任何表演人员 你会怎么做
to pay for any performance, what would you do?

746
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:51,272
在皮布尔斯有句老话
We have a saying in Peebles...

747
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:55,272
"如果买不到 那就自己做"
"If the store doesnae have it, make it yirsel'."

748
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,272
我会这么做
That's what I would do.

749
00:42:57,273 --> 00:43:00,273
我会做一个音乐厅之夜
I would make a Night at the Music Hall.

750
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:07,272
德妮丝 面试的怎么样
Oh, Denise! How did it go?

751
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:10,272
我说了 山姆 "在皮布尔斯有句老话"
I said it, Sam! "We have a saying in Peebles!"

752
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:12,272
我直视他们并脱口而出
I looked them straight in the eye and just said it!

753
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,272
那奖励我一个吻吧
So, does that earn me a kiss?

754
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:16,272
比吻更好 下班一起喝一杯
Better than a kiss. Drink after work.

755
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:20,273
德妮丝 某人想私下找你谈谈
Denise. There is someone who would like a word with you privately.

756
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,273
洛维特小姐
Miss Lovett.

757
00:43:33,273 --> 00:43:35,272
令人印象深刻的面试
An impressive interview.

758
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:40,272
我对你自制音乐厅的想法特别感兴趣
I was particularly struck by your idea for the home-made Music Hall.

759
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:45,272
告诉我... 如果在现实中你要尝试这种事
Tell me... if you were to attempt such a thing in reality,

760
00:43:45,273 --> 00:43:47,273
你需要什么
what would you need?

761
00:43:50,273 --> 00:43:53,272
在天黑之后的大礼堂
The Great Hall. After dark.

762
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:58,273
和尽可能多的灯和蜡烛
With as many lamps and candles as we could find.

763
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:03,272
如果这活动是完全仿制
And, if the experience was to truly replicate

764
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:08,272
音乐厅之夜 那我们还需要茶点
a night at the Music Hall, there would have to be refreshments.

765
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:12,272
这些都可以安排 表演人员是谁呢
That could be arranged. Who would be your performers?

766
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:15,272
我们 天堂百货
Us! The Paradise!

767
00:44:15,273 --> 00:44:19,273
非常好 那我就委托你去落实这件事
Very well. You are commissioned to bring such an event into being.

768
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:24,273
今晚 关门一小时之后开始
Tonight. Shall we say, an hour after closing?

769
00:44:34,273 --> 00:44:37,273
这是一次机会 德妮丝 证明你自己
It is an opportunity, Denise. To prove yourself.

770
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:42,272
向他们展示你真正的实力
To show to all of them what you're capable of.

771
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:44,272
不知什么时候开始你和威斯顿先生
I did not know that you and Mr Weston were

772
00:44:44,273 --> 00:44:47,272
这么信任彼此了
so much in each other's confidence.

773
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:50,272
你在怀疑我的做事动机
And now you're wondering what business it is I am about.

774
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:53,273
告诉你吧 我只为天堂百货服务
Well, I shall tell you. I serve The Paradise.

775
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:56,272
你必须出类拔萃 德妮丝
You must shine, Denise.

776
00:44:56,273 --> 00:45:00,272
即使是你的反对党 你也要试着人尽其才
You must persuade even the most unlikely of your colleagues

777
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:01,272
物尽其用
to take part.

778
00:45:01,273 --> 00:45:05,273
你得学会白手起家的本事
You must conjure something from nothing.

779
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,272
你盯着我干什么
Why do you look at me?

780
00:45:12,273 --> 00:45:14,294
乔纳斯先生 
Mr Jonas -

781
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:18,673
你上次跳回旋舞是什么时候?
 when was the last time you danced a reel?

782
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:23,272
这个嘛 一个人没办法自己跳这舞
Erm, a man cannot dance a reel alone.

783
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:27,272
况且独臂大侠可找不到舞伴
A man with one arm is no fit partner for anyone.

784
00:45:27,273 --> 00:45:31,272
好吧 我有双臂双腿
Well, I have two arms and two feet,

785
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,272
尽管这双腿跳起舞别扭得很
although both the feet are left,

786
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:36,272
所以或许咱俩是一样的
so perhaps, overall, we'll equal each other out.

787
00:45:36,273 --> 00:45:39,272
我可以唱歌! 算我一个
I can sing! Put me down.

788
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:41,272
谢了 苏西! 想想要唱的歌曲
Thank you, Susy! Have a think about the song.

789
00:45:41,273 --> 00:45:42,273
遵命!
I've got it!

790
00:45:46,273 --> 00:45:49,273
有人告诉我你天资非凡!
So a little birdie tells me you have a talent!

791
00:45:57,273 --> 00:45:58,273
谢谢
Thank you.

792
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:02,272
山姆 我全靠你了
Sam, I'm relying on you.

793
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,272
你口齿伶俐
You have such a way about you.

794
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:06,272
能够让顾客好几个小时眉开眼笑的
You keep the customers entertained for hours.

795
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:07,986
你天生就是这块料! 
You were born to do this! 

796
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:09,272
没必要拍马屁了
There's no need to flatter us.

797
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:11,272
你知道我会为你鞠躬尽瘁的
You know I'd give you the shirt off me back.

798
00:46:11,273 --> 00:46:13,272
我不用你鞠躬尽瘁 山姆
I don't want your shirt, Sam.

799
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:16,272
你只要用你那八面玲珑的才智逗人开怀就好
I only want your wit and your love of making people laugh.

800
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,273
此外我再加点好料怎么样
How about I throw a little something extra in there as well.

801
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:24,272
每次我要插手什么事的时候
Every time I seek to influence events,

802
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:27,272
结果总与我预期的背道而驰
the effect seems to be the perfect opposite of what I intended.

803
00:46:27,273 --> 00:46:30,272
我想让她放弃 低调点
I wished her to withdraw, to be less visible,

804
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:32,272
这会儿她却绽放得更灿烂了
and she burns brighter by the moment.

805
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:35,272
还有些事没有解决
Perhaps there's something in the air.

806
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:38,272
我在教导芙罗拉 我想软化她父亲对她的态度
In teaching Flora, I hoped to soften her father towards her.

807
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:40,272
怕是会弄巧成拙
I fear the reverse may be true.

808
00:46:40,273 --> 00:46:42,272
汤姆・威斯顿不吃这套
Tom Weston is not the kind of man who would love

809
00:46:42,273 --> 00:46:44,272
他不爱孩子本身
the child for herself.

810
00:46:44,273 --> 00:46:47,273
他只会爱她带来的荣耀
Only the reflected glory she might bring.

811
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:56,272
十先令!
Ten shillings!

812
00:46:56,273 --> 00:47:01,272
我想来想去还是猜不透那是什么意思
I think and I think and still I can't fathom the meaning of it.

813
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:03,272
我奔波了好几个月
I was on the road for many months.

814
00:47:03,273 --> 00:47:07,873
从未邂逅一丝善良 这儿却有千丝万缕
I met with no kindness there. And much here.

815
00:47:07,883 --> 00:47:09,872
善良可不标价
It didn't come with a price tag.

816
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:12,753
可能是因为我了解被指手画脚的感觉 
Perhaps I know what it is to feel judged.

817
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:13,573
曾经了解
 Known.

818
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:16,272
一个人的眼界如此局限
One's borders so completely mapped that

819
00:47:16,273 --> 00:47:18,898
除了眼前看到的
all around imagine 

820
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:22,273
再也无法探索到更深
there is no more to you than what is seen.

821
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,273
没有自我
No inner self.

822
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:33,272
好吧 十先令已经相当可观了
Well, ten shillings is a considerable sum.

823
00:47:33,273 --> 00:47:36,272
有它一个女人可以重新找回
A woman might find her self-respect again with that amount

824
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,272
自尊自重自爱
riding on her back.

825
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,272
虽然我觉得请我喝杯酒比较实在
Though you might just as well have bought me a drink.

826
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:45,273
你自己就可以买到杯酒
A drink is something you can buy for yourself.

827
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:50,272
想吃点什么的话 炉子上有葡萄干布丁
There's a plum duff in the stove if you've a mind.

828
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:52,272
你看起来仍然精神矍铄
You still have a spare look about you

829
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:55,273
还有 跳回旋舞的话 还是补充些能量的好
and if there's to be reeling you'll need your energy.

830
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,272
谁告诉你我要跳回旋舞的?
Who said anything about a reel?

831
00:47:59,273 --> 00:48:01,272
隔墙有耳 乔纳斯先生
The walls have ears, Mr Jonas.

832
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,939
我想知道的是 
What I want to know is 

833
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,272
你会不会穿苏格兰裙上场?
will there be a kilt worn?

834
00:48:06,273 --> 00:48:10,273
我对穿苏格兰裙的男人有特殊情结
I have a strange partiality for a man in a kilt.

835
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:23,272
德妮丝 据说打烊之后
Denise, it is an open secret that you are working to stage

836
00:48:23,273 --> 00:48:26,272
你要在天堂百货组织一个晚会
a Music Hall, in The Paradise after closing tonight.

837
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:29,272
- 是的先生 - 威斯顿先生会出席?
- Yes, sir. - And Mr Weston is to attend?

838
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,272
应该会的
I believe so.

839
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:33,272
我觉得他对取消晚会的事感到遗憾
My impression is that he regretted his decision to cancel

840
00:48:33,273 --> 00:48:35,272
并且希望得体地
the outing, and wishes to make reparation,

841
00:48:35,273 --> 00:48:37,272
做出补偿
without losing face.

842
00:48:37,273 --> 00:48:40,272
德妮丝 我在想你是不是能把这次活动
Denise, I wonder if you could find space in the programme

843
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:44,273
办得既有娱乐性又兼具教育意义
for an act that would be both entertaining and instructive.

844
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:48,273
音乐厅

845
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:17,272
- 晚上好 威斯顿夫人 - 晚上好
- Good evening, Mrs Weston. - Good evening.

846
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:19,272
- 芙罗拉. - 达德利.
- Flora. - Dudley.

847
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:21,272
可以带芙罗拉小姐看看后台吗?
Would it be OK to show Miss Flora backstage?

848
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:22,272
当然可以
Yes, of course.

849
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:24,273
芙罗拉 想去看看后台吗?
Flora, would you like to see backstage?

850
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,272
真是貌美如花余音绕梁啊!
You look beautiful and you sound lovely!

851
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:49,272
山姆 准备好了吗?
Sam, you ready?

852
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:53,272
他快好了! 加油山姆 最后的冲刺了
He's nearly there! Come on, Sam, just one last squeeze.

853
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,273
穿进去啦!
I'm in!

854
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:02,273
最好别他娘的是我想的那样
That better bloody not be what I think it is.

855
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:28,272
你不觉得模仿你也算一种奉承么?
Don't you know that imitation is a form of flattery?

856
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:31,272
欢迎来此盛会 女士们先生们 哇噢!
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Ooh!

857
00:50:31,273 --> 00:50:33,272
你好啊 帅哥!
Hello, handsome!

858
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:36,272
现在 女士们先生们 都准备好了吗?
Now, ladies and gentlemen, are we ready for the show?

859
00:50:36,273 --> 00:50:37,272
好了!
Yes!

860
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:40,272
再问一遍 都准备好了吗?
I said, are we ready for the show?

861
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:41,272
准备好了!
Yes!

862
00:50:41,273 --> 00:50:44,272
下面有请...
Then I give you...

863
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:47,273
奇迹大师 亚瑟!
The Amazing Arthur!

864
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:56,273
威斯顿先生 不介意的话借用下你的帽子
Mr Weston, your hat, if you wouldn't mind.

865
00:50:57,273 --> 00:50:59,273
给
There you go.

866
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,273
大力士 沃尔多!
The Mighty Waldo!

867
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:30,272
# 有天清晨 #
Early one morning

868
00:51:30,273 --> 00:51:33,272
# 朝阳初升 #
Just as the sun was rising,

869
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,316
# 我听闻 
I heard 

870
00:51:34,317 --> 00:51:37,272
年轻女孩在山谷中扬起的美妙歌声 #
a young maid singing in the valley below

871
00:51:37,273 --> 00:51:40,272
# 噢 别欺骗我 #
Oh, don't deceive me

872
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:43,272
# 噢 别离开我 #
Oh, never leave me

873
00:51:43,273 --> 00:51:48,273
# 你如何忍心欺侮这可怜的少女至深 #
How could you use a poor maiden so? 

874
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:19,273
真不错 乔纳斯先生
That's good, Mr Jonas.

875
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:37,273
太精彩了
Bravo.

876
00:52:51,273 --> 00:52:53,272
注意了 女士们先生们
Now, ladies and gentleman.

877
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:57,939
请静待我们的最终场 
Please pray silence for our final act, 

878
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,273
压轴戏来了
and the highlight of our show.

879
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:06,273
小神童 芙罗拉・威斯顿小姐!
The Infant Prodigy - Miss Flora Weston!

880
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,272
她要表演什么?
What is she about?

881
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:17,272
大伙们 只能问十个问题
Ladies and gentlemen, ten questions only.

882
00:53:17,273 --> 00:53:19,272
我们没有多少时间了
We only have time for ten questions

883
00:53:19,273 --> 00:53:21,272
所以第一个 谁先来个热场的
so that will come on a first come, first served basis.

884
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:22,272
谁呢...
So...

885
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:23,272
就你了
Yes?

886
00:53:23,273 --> 00:53:27,272
请问 秘鲁的首都是?
I would like to know, what is the capital of Peru?

887
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:28,273
利马
Lima.

888
00:53:35,273 --> 00:53:38,272
我想问问小神童
I would like to ask the Infant Prodigy,

889
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:40,272
"雨伞"用法语怎么说?
how do you say "umbrella" in French?

890
00:53:40,273 --> 00:53:42,273
Parapluie
Parapluie.

891
00:53:47,273 --> 00:53:50,272
你能说出一种化学元素吗?
Can you name me one chemical element?

892
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:51,273
铜
Copper.

00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:59,272

895
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,272
你能拼出chrysanthemum(菊花)么?
Can you spell the word chrysanthemum?

896
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:09,273
C-H-R-Y-S-A-N-T-H-E-M-U-M
C-H-R-Y-S-A-N-T-H-E-M-U-M.

00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:13,273
苏格兰的首府是?
Can you tell me the capital of Scotland?

898

爱丁堡
Edinburgh.

899
00:54:22,273 --> 00:54:24,273
稍等一下
Excuse me?

900
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:33,273
我想问小神童一个问题
I should like to ask the Infant Prodigy a question.

901
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:37,272
克里斯多夫・哥伦布
In what year did Christopher 

902

904

她是你的荣耀
She is a credit to you.

905
00:54:59,273 --> 00:55:02,273
做得好 芙罗拉小姐 来这边坐
Well done, Miss Flora, go and sit down.

906
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:08,272
感谢你们的到场 女士们先生们
Thank you all for coming, ladies and gentlemen.

907
00:55:08,273 --> 00:55:13,273
今晚要特别感谢两个人 威斯顿先生
Now we have two people to thank for this evening. Mr Weston.

908
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:23,273
以及女装部的德妮丝・洛维特
And Denise Lovett of Ladieswear!

909
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:42,272
接手吧 那职位归你了
Have it. Have the job.

910
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:45,273
但我得提醒你 你会失去你男人
But I'll tell you something - you'll lose the man.

911
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:58,273
德妮丝 你惊艳了我们所有人
Denise. You have dazzled us all.

912
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,273
我只想惊艳到你
I only wanted to dazzle you.

913
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:05,273
我不能忍受我们分开了 我受不了
I can't bear it when we're apart. I can't bear it.

914
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,273
去吧 大家都等着你呢
Go. Your public awaits.

915
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:33,272
莫里 我想女装部的新主管可以定下了
Moray? I think we've found our new Head Of Ladieswear.

916
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:35,272
当心了 莫里
Only be careful, Moray.

917
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:37,273
光彩夺目的德妮丝可能会掩盖住你的光芒
Denise shines so bright she may yet outshine you.

918
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:44,273
我觉得或许你都达不到她今天的成就
I don't think even you could have achieved what she did today.

919
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:02,272
我是女装部主管
I am Head of Ladieswear.

920
00:57:02,273 --> 00:57:03,272
你得尽快进入角色
You need to step into the role now.

921
00:57:03,273 --> 00:57:05,272
这意味着你做的决定可能不招人喜爱
That means making decisions that others won't like.

922
00:57:05,273 --> 00:57:07,272
苏西 照顾一下小姑娘
Susy, please attend to the young lady.

923
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:11,272
这些就交给你了 现在我要和莫里去喝杯咖啡
I will leave it with you while I have a coffee with Moray.

924
00:57:11,273 --> 00:57:14,272
你算什么 你就是一个被宠坏了的娇娇女!
You're just a spoiled little nothing, that's what you are!

925
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:15,272
你个熊孩子!
You are a child!

926
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:17,272
苏西 到餐厅去
Susy, go down to the Refectory right now.

927
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:18,272
我要找妈妈
I want Mama.

928
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:21,272
你要为我孩子蒙受的耻辱主持公道
It was you who presided over this humiliation of my child.

929
00:57:21,273 --> 00:57:23,272
你怎么处置那女孩?
What do you propose to do about this girl?

930
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,272
你自己想要这个职位 这不是过家家
You wanted this position. It is not all tea parties.

931
00:57:26,273 --> 00:57:29,273
你得收拾东西...走人
You must collect your belongings... and go.
