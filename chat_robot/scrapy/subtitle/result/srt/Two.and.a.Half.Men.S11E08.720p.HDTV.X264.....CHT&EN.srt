早安
Morning.

00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,580
早安
Morning.

7
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,430
香脆上校[麥片]
Ooh, Cap'n Crunch.

8
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,760
那是我唯一放進嘴里的"男人"
That's the only man I put in my mouth.

9
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,300
這讓我從另一角度看待我和
It puts my relationship with Orville Redenbacher

10
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,030
奧利華·雷登巴赫[爆米花]的關系
in a whole different light.

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,320
我比較喜歡UPS的速遞男
I'm partial to the U.P.S. Guy.

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,050
我們這是拿食物開玩笑呢
We're making food jokes here.

13
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,700
UPS速遞男不是食物
The U.P.S. Guy's not food.

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,190
他是  前提是在他身上涂一層生奶油
He is if you cover him with whipped cream.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,200
我能說什么呢
What can I say?

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,320
女人都迷戀褐色短褲制服里面的壯碩身材
There's just something about a man in brown shorts.

17
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,150
我有大麻煩了
Okay, I'm in big trouble.

18
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,900
一說穿著褐色短褲[內褲]的人  那人就到
Speaking of a man with brown shorts.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,950
怎么了
What's wrong?

20
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,870
剛林賽的男友拉里打給我
Well, I just got a call from Lyndsey's boyfriend Larry.

21
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,740
他說想見我
And he wants to see me.

22
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,620
他是要見杰夫·斯壯曼
Well, he wants to see Jeff Strongman.

23
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,370
誰是杰夫·斯壯曼
Who's Jeff Strongman?

24
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,470
杰夫·斯壯曼是艾倫塑造的另一個自我
Oh, Jeff Strongman is Alan's alter ego

25
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,050
專門用來跟拉里見面和打擊罪犯
he uses to meet Larry and fight crime.

26
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,040
慢著  所以這個假名
Wait, so, you use a fake name

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,870
是為了跟其他男人偷情時用的嗎
to sneak around with other men?

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,740
你們在哪里認識的  女神卡卡的演唱會嗎
Where do you guys meet? A Lady Gaga concert?

29
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,740
女神卡卡受到眾多同性戀的喜愛

30
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,780
如果你非要知道  是在單車課上
It was a spin class if you must know.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,440
那我現在應該怎么辦
Now, what am I gonna do?

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,290
我早告訴你會發生這種事了
I told you something like this was gonna happen.

33
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,560
"我早告訴你會發生這種事了"
"I told you something like this was gonna happen."

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
我是說真的
Look, I am serious--

35
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,680
他不肯告訴我見面的原因
he wouldn't tell me why he wanted to see me

36
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,750
而且他聽起來很不開心
and he sounded pretty upset.

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,820
我們到底生活在什么樣的世界
Well, what kind of world are we living in

38
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,150
居然會有人因為其他男人
where a guy is upset with another guy

39
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,300
睡了他的女朋友而不開心
for banging his girlfriend?

40
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,020
所以我才喜歡當同性戀
See, that's why I love being gay.

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,270
男人一旦發現我睡了他的女朋友
A guy finds out I'm doing his girlfriend,

42
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,700
他們不會打電話來罵我
I don't get an angry phone call.

43
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,640
相反我會收到玫瑰花  和交歡時的視頻
I get a dozen roses and a copy of the video.

44
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,260
真可惜  我不能說服拉里我是基
Too bad I can't convince Larry I'm gay.

45
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,110
得了吧  廢柴  我們早被你說服了
Come on, Zippy, you're making it too easy for us.

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,710
他來了
There he is.

47
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,030
那個皮膚蒼白的男人
My main man with a winter tan.

48
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,690
杰夫
Jeff.

49
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,960
我給你點了咖啡  你還要其他的嗎
Uh, I got you a coffee. Can I get you anything else?

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
要不要來個瑪芬蛋糕  麥麩做的哦
Uh, one-one of these muffins? They're bran.

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,960
能讓你的身體保持健康哦
Keeps your trains running on time.

52
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,540
-我不餓  -那好吧
- I'm not hungry. - All right then,

53
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,090
我就坐在你對面
I'll just sit across from you.

54
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,530
坐在
Right here...

55
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,630
眾多目擊證人前
in front of all these witnesses.

56
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,120
你知道我女朋友林賽吧
You know my girlfriend Lyndsey?

57
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,190
她叫林賽嗎
Is it Lyndsey?

58
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,600
我以為叫琳達呢
I thought it was Linda.

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,470
幸好在我下次見到她前  說清楚
Glad you cleared that up before I saw her again...

60
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,290
不過我見不著她  我干嘛要見她
which I haven't, and why would I?

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,150
她背著我偷人
She's been cheating on me.

62
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,850
抱歉  有點噎著了
Mmm, sorry. Just a little...

63
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,610
你為什么覺得她背著你偷人
Why do you think she's cheating on you?

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,640
我找了個私家偵探跟蹤她
I hired a private investigator to follow her.

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,530
你不介意吧
Uh, do you mind?

66
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,780
她一直去馬里布的別墅跟他私會
She's been meeting him at a house in Malibu.

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,690
抱歉  我只是有點震驚
Sorry, sorry, I'm just a little shocked.

68
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,090
想象下我的感受
Imagine how I feel.

69
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,370
想象不到  但我知道
Well, I-I can't, uh, uh, but I do know

70
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,260
在這種情況下  要怪就怪那個女人
that in situations like this, it's the woman who's to blame.

71
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,700
不止該怪她
She's not the only one.

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,900
求你了  我還有個兒子要養活
Please, I have a son!

73
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,240
這就是那個奸夫
This is the guy.

74
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,720
-等等  是這家伙嗎  -是的
- Wait, this is the guy? - Yeah.

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,950
你認為是這家伙睡了你的女朋友
This is guy you think banging your girlfriend?

76
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,290
我知道是他
I know he is.

77
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,380
只有他
And only him?

78
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,370
沒別人了嗎
Nobody else?

79
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,870
這還不夠糟嗎
Isn't this bad enough?

80
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,870
說的也是
Well, sure.

81
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,910
但應該有其他合理的解釋
But, you know, there could also be another explanation.

82
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,270
我是說  或許是她迷路了
I mean, maybe she's just lost

83
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,120
然后向這家伙問路呢
and she's asking this guy for directions.

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,540
是啊  "不好意思  先生
Right, "Excuse me, sir,

85
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,580
能幫我找到去G點的路嗎"
can you help me find my G-spot?"

86
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
證據不光是這張照片
It's not just this photo.

87
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,990
晚上出去辦事
It's the late night errands.

88
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,080
把手機藏起來
Hiding her phone.

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,930
還有我們好久沒做愛了
Plus, we haven't had sex in forever!

90
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,920
那是挺慘的
Wow, that's rough.

91
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,600
我猜  不管這個男人是誰
I guess this guy, whoever he is,

92
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,790
他滿足了她的所有需求
satisfies her every need.

93
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
我想殺了他
I want to kill him.

94
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,720
我討厭被人這樣欺騙
I hate being lied to like this.

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,040
我懂
I get it, you know.

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,860
有時就是知人知面不知心啊
Sometimes you think you know a person, but you don't.

97
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,390
斯壯曼的意式三文治
Panini for Strongman.

98
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,390
-杰夫  在叫你呢  -什么
- Jeff, that's you. - What?

99
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,250
對  對  是我
Oh, oh, yeah, that's me.

100
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,110
杰夫·斯壯曼
Jeff Strongman.

101
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,850
沒有睡任何人的女朋友
Someone who's not banging anyone's girlfriend.

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,200
天啊  我家進了個陌生人
Oh, no, there's a stranger in my house.

103
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,520
可能是70年代同性戀黃片的明星
And it's possibly a gay porn star from the '70s.

104
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,950
是我啦  艾倫
It's me, Alan.

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,680
我想你剛說的是
I-I believe you're supposed to say,

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,950
"是我啦  馬里奧"
"It's-a me, a-Mario!"

107
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,740
所以你和拉里的會面并不愉快嗎
So, I take it things didn't go great with Larry?

108
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,860
他的確知道了林賽背著他偷人
Well, he does know that Lyndsey's cheating on him,

109
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,230
但好消息是他不知道奸夫是我
but the good news is he doesn't know that it's with me.

110
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,080
那你為什么打扮得像
So, why do you look like one of

111
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,700
穿著便裝的村民樂隊成員
the Village People in street clothes?

112
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,700
村民樂隊是1970年代的經典男子演唱組合
成員分別裝扮成警官  印第安酋長  建筑工人  士兵  摩托車手和牛仔

113
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,670
他找了個私家偵探
Ah, well, uh, he hired a, uh, a private detective,

114
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,950
監視這個房子  因為
uh, to watch the house because, uh,

115
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,950
有意思的地方來了
and here's where it gets really funny,

116
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,670
他認為林賽的奸夫是
he thinks that Lyndsey is cheating on him with...

117
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,230
不是吧
No.

118
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,410
不  不
No, no, no.

119
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,910
不  不  不  這樣不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

120
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,590
很扯吧
It's crazy, right?

121
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,180
你干嘛不告訴他真相
Why didn't you tell him the truth?

122
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,070
害怕  膽小
Fear, cowardice.

123
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,080
沒有給牙齒買保險
Lack of a dental plan.

124
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,620
再說了  他都失去林賽了
Uh, besides, he-he just lost Lyndsey,

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,060
我不想他再失去他最好的朋友
I didn't want him to lose his best friend.

126
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,500
好吧  如果你不處理好這件事
Okay, well, you're gonna lose your best friend

127
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,880
你會失去你最好的朋友
if you don't fix this!

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,460
原來我是你最好的朋友啊
Oh, I'm your best friend?

129
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,070
艾倫  我說真的
Alan, I am serious.

130
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,580
我不想讓私家偵探監視我的房子
I do not want a private detective watching this house.

131
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,460
我也絕對不想
And I... and I definitely don't want

132
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,450
被憤怒的男友追殺
an angry boyfriend after me.

133
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,480
你之前跟林賽上床時
Well, you should've thought of that

134
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,290
就應該想到這一點
before you slept with Lyndsey.

135
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,430
我還有事情要做
I've got some work to do.

136
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,260
我要出去處理點事
And I'm gonna go out and run some errands.

137
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,470
等我回來時  這事最好已經解決了
And when I get back, this better be cleaned up.

138
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,280
別擔心  我馬上處理
Oh, oh, don't worry, I'm on it.

139
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,940
以防萬一
Oh, oh, but just in case.

140
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,290
天啊
Oh, God!

141
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,850
有什么是你這英俊的臉蛋不能駕馭的嗎
Is there any look you can't pull off?

142
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,850
我要殺了你
I'm-a gonna kill you.

143
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,940
你要踢死我啊
What the hell?

144
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,060
艾倫  你在干什么
Alan, what are you doing?

145
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,980
此時此刻  我在找我左邊的蛋蛋
At the moment, looking for my left ball.

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,700
拉里剛送我回來  他會看見你的
Larry just dropped me off. He could've seen you.

147
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,690
所以我才來的
That's why I'm here.

148
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,840
拉里覺得你跟沃頓在偷情
Larry thinks you're having an affair with Walden.

149
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,480
什么  他干嘛那樣想
What? Why would he think that?

150
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
因為他請的私家偵探
Well, because he he hired a P.I.

151
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,970
拍了一張你們倆在一起的照片
who t a picture of the two of you together.

152
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,560
對了  從照片看那天很冷啊
And by the way, it looked like it was a cold day.

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,500
-你個白癡  -我知道
- You're an idiot. - I know.

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,170
那我們應該怎么辦
So, what-what are we gonna do?

155
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,220
沒事  這方面我超有經驗
Okay, look, I've done this plenty of times before.

156
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,470
首先要做的就是否認
The first thing you do is deny everything.

157
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,400
好的  否認  等等
Right, denial. Wait.

158
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,090
你這方面超有經驗
You've done this plenty of times before?

159
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,980
你是不是也背著我偷人
Did you ever cheat on me?

160
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,570
沒有
Never.

161
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,500
好的
Okay, good.

162
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,470
是拉里
Oh, it's Larry.

163
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,460
他找你干嘛
What does he want?

164
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,580
我看一下
Uh, well, let's see.

165
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,040
"剛把那個偷人的妓...
Uh, "Just dropped off the cheating whor...

166
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,670
林賽送回家"
Lyndsey."

167
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,640
"想出來喝一杯嗎"
"Want to grab a drink?"

168
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,400
你繼續扮演同情他的好朋友  
Okay, you go play the sympathetic friend,

169
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,460
安撫他
calm him down.

170
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,470
我來想辦法
I'll figure something out.

171
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,510
聽起來不錯
Sounds good, uh...

172
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,690
"沒問題  哥們"
"No problem, bro."

173
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,250
加上雞尾酒杯的圖案
Cocktail glass emoji.

174
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,380
-盡量拖延時間  -好的
- Stall him as long as you can. - Right.

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,040
很抱歉踢了你蛋蛋
I'm sorry I kicked you in the balls--

176
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,300
你想我怎么補償你
is there anything I can do?

177
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,110
你可以親親它  讓它好受點
You could kiss it and make it better.

178
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,190
再見  艾倫
Good-bye, Alan.

179
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
別這樣嘛
Oh, come on!

180
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,330
我自己又親不到
It's not like I could do it myself.

181
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,230
天知道我曾試過
God knows I've tried.

182
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,810
-上車  -羅斯
- Get in the car! - Rose?

183
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,580
你怎么在這里
What are you doing?

184
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,120
有人在跟蹤你
Someone's following you.

185
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,470
沒錯  你嘛
Yeah, you!

186
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,220
沒時間說那么多  你現在很危險
There's no time for this, you're in danger.

187
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,320
沒錯  因為你嘛
Yeah, from you!

188
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,820
快上車吧
Just get in.

189
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,380
我為什么要上你的車
Why would I get in your car?

190
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,940
上一次我試圖相信你
I mean, the last time i tried to trust you...

191
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,900
怎么  你在看什么
What? What are you looking at?

192
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,490
你襯衣上有個小點
You got a little spot on your shirt.

193
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,990
開車  開車  開車
Drive! Drive! Drive!

194
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,050
快開車
Drive! Drive!

195
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,980
我又發現一些新信息
I found out more about this guy.

196
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,160
他的名字是沃頓·施密特
His name is Walden Schmidt.

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,200
更像是一噸·特壞屎
More like lying sack of Schmidt.

198
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,430
對不對
Am I right?

199
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,520
原來他是個靠網絡發家的億萬暴發戶
Turns out he's some kind of stupid Internet billionaire.

200
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,000
你不覺得不用為生活而工作的人很討厭嗎
Don't you hate when guys don't work for a living

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,350
就像咱倆
like you and me?

202
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,760
沒錯  杰夫·斯壯曼
Amen, Jeff Strongman.

203
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,870
振作點  
Hey, come on, you know,

204
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,390
這并不是世界上最糟糕的事
this isn't the worst thing in the world.

205
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,380
你會重新振作起來
You're gonna bounce back.

206
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,700
我早該猜到會有這么一天
I guess, I mean, I should've seen it coming.

207
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,030
她當初就是背著她前男友跟我偷情
I mean, she cheated on her last boyfriend with me.

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,620
你是說她前男友
Her-her last boyfriend?

209
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,940
是啊  那個家伙就是個屌絲
Yeah, I guess the guy was a real loser.

210
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,200
白吃白喝的可憐蟲
A pathetic freeloader.

211
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,110
那也只是猜測
Well, that's just conjecture.

212
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,560
也許他是很棒的人
I mean, you know, maybe he's a-a really great guy

213
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,260
而她只是個愛說謊話的賤女人
and she's just a crazy lying bitch.

214
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,650
我不會像她前男友那樣
I'm not gonna take it lying down

215
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,740
娘娘腔似的忍氣吞聲
like the pansy she was dating before me.

216
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,040
"娘娘腔"是你說的  還是她說的
Is "pansy" your word or hers?

217
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,920
她說的
Hers.

218
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,860
我要殺去他們私會的地方
I'm going to the head.

219
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,660
你買單
You get the check

220
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,860
等會我們去會會這個混蛋
and we'll go pay this bastard a visit.

221
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,250
慢慢來
Take your time.

222
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,490
別著急
No rush.

223
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,080
快點  林賽  接電話  快接電話啊
Oh, come on, Lyndsey, pick up, pick up, pick up!

224
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,140
就知道會是語音信箱
Of course, voice mail.

225
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,590
林賽  情況更糟了
Lyndsey, things have gone from bad to worse.

226
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,990
拉里要找沃頓當面對質
Larry is gonna confront Walden,

227
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,840
我不知道該怎么辦
and I don't know what to do.

228
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
快回電話
Call me back.

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,180
PS  咱倆之間
Oh, and PS-- you and I have

230
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,270
有點小問題需要討論一下
a little issue to discuss ourselves.

231
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,970
PPS  "P"代表"娘娘腔"
Oh, and PPS-- the "P" Stands for "Pansy."

232
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,690
好像甩掉他了
Looks like we lost him.

233
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,160
到底發生什么事了
What the hell is going on?

234
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,270
我很確定拉里雇了一個殺手
Well, I'm pretty sure Larry hired a hit man.

235
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,620
你怎么知道拉里這個人
How do you know about Larry?

236
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,660
因為他在跟蹤你啊
Because he's stalking you.

237
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,190
你怎么知道他在跟蹤我
How do you know that?

238
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,220
因為我在跟蹤你啊
Because I'm stalking you.

239
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,980
好吧  這太荒唐了
Okay, okay, you know, this is ridiculous.

240
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,240
我要報警
I'm calling the police.

241
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,960
你要跟警察說什么
And tell them what?

242
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,230
我們什么證據也沒有
We have no proof of anything.

243
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,850
而且  上次你因為我報警
And besides, how helpful were the police

244
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,230
他們也沒幫上什么忙啊
when you called them on me?

245
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,940
我向警察申請了對你的禁止令
Uh, I got them to issue a restraining order.

246
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,990
你覺得管用嗎
Hi.

247
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,000
好吧  我
Okay, I...

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,370
他又來了
Uh-oh, he's back.

249
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,630
我不知道為什么他總能找到我們
I don't know how he keeps finding us.

250
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,410
我來告訴你為什么
I'll tell you how.

251
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,480
我手機上有GPS定位
The GPS on my cell phone.

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,120
手機給我
Give me that.

253
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,330
我本來只想關機  不過好吧
I was gonna turn it off, but okay.

254
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,580
抓緊
Hang on.

255
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,820
什么  為什么
What? Why?

256
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,030
應該可以甩掉他了
That ought to do it.

257
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,820
聽我說  這真是胡鬧
Okay, you know... this is nonsense!

258
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,510
送我回家
Take me home.

259
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,920
好吧  送你回家
Okay, homeward bound.

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,930
然后被人塞住嘴
And gagged.

261
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,720
折磨好幾天
And tortured for days.

262
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,510
那好吧  送我去酒店
Okay, well, fine, then take me to a hotel.

263
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,370
貝弗利山酒店如何
Beverly Hills Hotel okay?

264
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,140
很好
It's perfect.

265
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,200
砰的一聲  你就被人射死了
And bang, you're dead.

266
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,850
你需要擺脫慣性思維
You need to get off the grid.

267
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,420
去一個他們想不到的地方
Someplace they don't expect you.

268
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,600
也查不到你信用卡的地方
A place they can't track your credit cards.

269
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,100
沒人在查我的信用卡
Nobody is tracking my credit cards.

270
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,450
昨晚你不是還刷卡做了咖啡灌腸嗎
Oh, that wasn't you last night getting a coffee colonic?

271
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,290
我那是為了大腸健康
I will not apologize for a healthy colon.

272
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,220
好了  到了
Okay, here we go.

273
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,970
這個地方看起來不錯
This place looks perfect.

274
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,980
-這簡直就是個垃圾場  -沒錯  
- This place is a dump. - Exactly,

275
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,050
所以沒人會來這地方找你
and it's the last place anyone would look for you.

276
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,430
對啊  但是肝炎
Yeah, but it's the first place

277
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,800
肯定會來這找我
that hepatitis would look for me.

278
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,870
好吧  這只是暫時的
Okay, this is only temporary.

279
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,110
你保持低調  我來幫你解決
You lay low, and I will straighten this out.

280
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,110
我究竟憑什么要相信你
Why in God's name would I trust you?

281
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,380
沃頓  我知道以前給你
Look, Walden, I know that I've caused you

282
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,120
造成了一些小困擾  但是
some tiny problems in the past, but...

283
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,300
你說小困擾嗎
Wha...? Tiny?

284
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,740
你假裝懷孕嚇走了我女朋友
You pretended to be pregnant to scare my girlfriend away.

285
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,190
你讓那只瘋狂的雪貂攻擊我
You sicced rabid ferrets on me!

286
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,100
你把我綁在床上  
You tied me to my bed

287
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,560
試圖用吹葉機猥褻我
and tried to violate me with a leaf blower!

288
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,620
你真貼心  居然都記得
It's so sweet you remember everything.

289
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,580
但是現在我可以彌補過去的事情
But I can make up for all of that now.

290
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,000
你看  下水道堵了要找水管工
Look, when your sink is clogged, you call a plumber.

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,490
車子壞了要找修車工
When your car breaks down, you call a mechanic.

292
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,780
當一個危險的變態跟蹤你時
When you have a dangerous psychopath after you,

293
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,590
你要找我
you call me.

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,910
好吧
All right, fine.

295
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,470
我要殺了艾倫
I am gonna kill Alan.

296
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,690
如果你活過了今晚  可以找拉里雇的殺手
Oh, if you survive tonight, you should hire Larry's guy.

297
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,940
他很出色
He's good.

298
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,790
就是這里了
Here you go.

299
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,430
這是你們這里最好的房間嗎
This is, uh, this is the best room you got?

300
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,310
這間是總統套房
It's the presidential suite.

301
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,620
哪國的總統
The president of what?

302
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,480
斯洛伐克鳥國嗎
Crap-o-slovakia?

303
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,540
我可以給你提供蜜月套房
I could offer you the honeymoon suite.

304
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,530
如果你聞得慣"愛情的味道"的話
You know, if you don't mind the smell of love.

305
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,530
不了  這里
No, no... this is, uh...

306
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,800
這里就行
this is fine.

307
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,140
你們有客房服務嗎
Do you, uh, do you have room service?

308
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,000
我這里或許有你想吃的"東西"
I might have something you might want to eat.

309
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,930
我不想吃
I don't think you do.

310
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,390
聽著  如果有人來打聽我
Listen, uh, if-if anyone comes here asking about me,

311
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,740
就說我不在這里
I-I'm not here.

312
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,270
別擔心
Don't worry.

313
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,610
永遠不會有人找到你
No one will ever find you.

314
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,200
如果等會你寂寞了
Hey, uh, if you get lonely later on,

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,730
我就在樓后面的公寓里
I'm in the apartment behind the building.

316
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,570
好  我知道了
Yeah, okay.

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,020
我家也沒什么好東西  但我有些好大麻
It's nothing fancy, but I've got some good weed

318
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,120
還有水療浴缸
and... a spa tub.

319
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,430
我都記住了
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.

320
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,810
14頻道在播《生存恐懼》
There's a Live Feed on channel 14

321
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,750
喜歡就看看
if you want to check it out.

322
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,660
這下可好  還得躲著他了
Great, now I got to hide from him, too.

323
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,580
沃頓這家伙會后悔當初偷了我的女友
This Walden guy is gonna regret the day he stole my girlfriend.

324
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,610
這不是偷  
Oh, it's-it's not stealing.

325
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,640
應該算是借
It-It's more like borrowing.

326
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,190
-就像租車一樣  -可當你租車后  
- Like-like renting a car. - Yeah, but when you rent a car

327
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,310
知道以前有其他男人在里面坐過  
you know there's been other guys inside it,

328
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,860
扭扭凸起的把手  擺弄擺弄座位
turning the knobs, playing with the seat,

329
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,250
-還把東西塞進后備箱  -好了  好了
- shoving stuff in the trunk. - Okay, okay,

330
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
這個類比不恰當
maybe that's a bad analogy.

331
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,810
但你去找他對質
But that doesn't change the fact

332
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,190
也于事無補
that going over there to confront him

333
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,690
更不會改變事實
is not gonna help anything.

334
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,830
你有更好的主意嗎
You got a better idea?

335
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,880
我有
Uh, I-I do.

336
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,640
不如你忘記林賽
How about you forget about Lyndsey

337
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,030
咱們去酒吧泡妞
and we go out to a bar and pick up some women.

338
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,510
拉里和杰夫出外活動
You know, Larry and Jeff out on the prowl.

339
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,670
杰夫  很感謝你一番好意
Jeff, I appreciate what you're trying to do.

340
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,050
但恐怕如果我不這樣做
But I'm afraid if I don't do this,

341
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,430
我就永遠無法安心
I won't be able to live with myself.

342
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,400
恐怕你這樣做
And I'm afraid if you do this,

343
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,310
我就永遠無法安生了
I'll have to live by myself.

344
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,640
不  14頻道
Oh, no! Channel 14!

345
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,750
老天
Oh, God!

346
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,050
誰啊
Who is it?

347
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,080
拉里  我是來殺你的  沃頓
It's Larry, I'm here to kill you, Walden.

348
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,090
沃頓先生已經死了
Mr. Walden, he die.

349
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,790
我是打掃衛生的
I clean room.

350
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,750
不  小傻瓜  是我
No, silly rabbit, it's just me.

351
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,290
什么  是羅斯嗎
Wha...? Rose?

352
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,920
是...
Is that...?

353
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,380
你一個人嗎
Are you alone?

354
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,210
是  但剛才有個好人邀請我去泡水療浴缸
Yeah, but a nice man did just invite me into his spa tub.

355
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,460
我買了些吃的
Here, I brought some food.

356
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,560
-我不能吃東西  -為什么
- Yeah, I can't eat. - Why not?

357
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
如果我吃了
Well, because if I do,

358
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,250
最終就會去那里
eventually I'll have to go in there.

359
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,250
打死我都不會進去
And I'm not going in there.

360
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,720
有什么新情況嗎
Uh, so, did you find anything out?

361
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,250
還是沒找到拉里  他去哪里都有可能
Still no sign of Larry. He could be anywhere.

362
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,190
老天  艾倫應該處理好這件事的
God, Alan was supposed to take care of this.

363
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,700
是啊  他還告訴你他只會
Well, yeah, he also told you he was only gonna live

364
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,750
在你家住幾天  但現在已經過去了八百
and here we are at day 800 and...

365
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,520
四十三天
43.

366
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,950
我差點忘記了
Oh, I almost forgot.

367
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,650
我買了巧克力條
I got us some candy bars.

368
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,940
椰子口味是你的  這是你的最愛
Mounds for you, 'cause it's your favorite.

369
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,770
杏仁是我的
Almond Joy for me

370
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,970
你也知道  果仁嘛[瘋子]
'cause, you know... nuts.

371
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,520
你為什么對我這么好
Hey, why are you being so nice to me?

372
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,660
我得承認你傷害過我
You know, I'll admit that you hurt me.

373
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,830
我也做過不光彩的事情
And I did some things that I'm not proud of.

374
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,290
但就因為你申請了針對我的
But just because you took a restraining order

375
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,400
限制令
out against me...

376
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,790
并不代表我可以限制自己對你的感情
doesn't mean that I can restrain my feelings for you.

377
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,500
這是我聽過的
That is the sweetest,

378
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,600
最甜蜜最恐怖的話
most terrifying thing I've ever heard.

379
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,130
你真的怕我嗎
Are you really scared of me?

380
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,480
我在這房間里碰到的人  你都不算最恐怖的
You're not even the scariest person I've met in this room.

381
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,830
事實是  我也有錯
And the truth is, I'm-I'm not blameless.

382
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,820
我選擇了其他的女生
I mean, I chose another girl over you,

383
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,530
但看現在是誰陪在我身邊
and look who's here with me now?

384
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,410
我從未真正離開過你
I never really left you.

385
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,450
還真是這樣
Literally.

386
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,590
我知道我會后悔的
File this under things I'm gonna regret.

387
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,350
見鬼  應該把吹葉機帶來  
Damn it, should've brought my leaf blower.

388
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,370
門鈴沒用
Oh, uh, the doorbell doesn't work.

389
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,750
什么
What?

390
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,600
我是說這樣沒用
I mean, uh, that-that does not work

391
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,990
如果你想來個強勢登場的話
if you want to send a message that there's a man here.

392
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,750
叮當
Ding-dong.

393
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,870
我要踢你屁屁
"I'm gonna kick your tushie."

394
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,580
有道理
You're right.

395
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,180
聽我說  可能不好收場
Okay, now, listen, now-now, this could get crazy.

396
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,680
可能會互相進行人身攻擊
I mean, there's gonna be a lot of name calling--

397
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,460
混蛋  白癡  艾倫
uh, uh, jerk, uh, idiot, uh, Alan.

398
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,640
-拉里  -林賽
- Larry? - Lyndsey?

399
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,040
你和沃頓·施密特的事
I know exactly what's going on

400
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,400
老子一清二楚
between you and Walden Schmidt.

401
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,980
他在哪里
Now, where is he?

402
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,670
哇  好漂亮的房子
Wow! This house is amazing.

403
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,860
拉里  不是你想的那樣
Larry, this isn't what you think.

404
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,330
就是我想的這樣
It's exactly what I think.

405
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,420
我有照片
I have pictures.

406
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,370
我們現在站在他的家
We're standing in his house!

407
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,510
是時候告訴你真相了
Okay, it-it's time for me to tell you the truth.

408
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,340
別相信她  她是個酗酒的劈腿蕩婦
Don't believe her! She's a cheating, drunk whore!

409
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,850
拉里  聽我說
Larry, listen to me.

410
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,040
我不是來和沃頓·施密特上床的
I'm not here to sleep with Walden Schmidt.

411
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,000
我是來這里和其他人上床的
I'm here to sleep with someone else.

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,490
-什么  -什么
- What?! - What?!

413
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,450
還記得你跟我說過
Remember you told me

414
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,890
你的性幻想就是看到我和別的女人在一起嗎
your fantasy was to see me with another woman?

415
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,580
-怎樣  -怎樣
- Yeah? - Yeah?

416
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,090
我做了安排  令你的夢想成真
I've arranged for your dream to come true.

417
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,680
-是嗎  -是嗎
- You did?! - You did?!

418
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,200
對  所以我才從沃頓·施密特手中
Yes, that's why I rented this beautiful beach house

419
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,150
租下這間漂亮的海邊別墅  作為生日驚喜
from Walden Schmidt as a birthday surprise.

420
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,980
我還準備了其它的驚喜
I also got us something else.

421
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,140
在旁邊觀戰的是哪一個
So, which one is watching us?

422
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,190
如果是他  我要加錢
If it's him, I'm gonna have to charge extra.

423
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,250
等等  這是真的嗎
Wait a minute. Is this for real?

424
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,270
生日快樂  寶貝
Happy birthday, baby.

425
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,680
3P
A threesome.

426
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,730
好大的禮啊
That is quite a gift.

427
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,230
時間倉促
Well, it was last minute,

428
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,290
我必須想出點什么
and I had to think of something.

429
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,710
一件漂亮的羊毛衫不算厚禮嗎
A nice cardigan wouldn't have done the trick?

430
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,370
老天  我覺得自己好蠢
God, I feel so stupid.

431
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,970
我甚至雇了人跟蹤你
I even hired someone to follow you.

432
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,730
你打電話讓他們走人吧
Well, why don't you call them off,

433
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,770
我們進去坐下來
and we'll all go sit down

434
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,730
好好談談你想看到的事情
and talk about the things you want to see?

435
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,850
再見  杰夫
Bye, Jeff.

436
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,920
再見  杰夫
Yeah, bye, Jeff.

437
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,520
我會寄給你一份視頻拷貝
I'll send you a copy of the video.

438
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,560
等等  這個  等等  這個
Wait. Thi-Thi... Wait. This is

439
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,500
是真的嗎
really... happening?

440
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,620
你是說  你和她嗎
I mean, you-you-you and-and-and her?

441
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,510
還有  還有他嗎
And-and... and him?

442
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,700
還有  在這里嗎
And-and-and here?

443
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,850
而  而我
While... while I...?

444
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,330
這招太賤了
Son of a bitch!

445
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,850
真是瘋了
This is crazy.

446
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,840
我打賭
You know, I'll... I'll bet

447
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,950
如果林賽真的是偷漢子了
if Lyndsey had been sleeping with somebody else,

448
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,780
那個男的現在一定非常非常生氣
he'd be really, really mad.

449
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,190
我知道  是不是好棒  杰夫
I know. Isn't this great, Jeff?

450
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,990
她不是劈腿的蕩婦  她只是蕩婦而已
She's not a cheating whore. She's just a whore.

451
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,900
你好  我是拉里·馬丁
Hi. It's Larry Martin.

452
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,560
是你啊
Oh, hey.

453
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,500
我不再需要你的服務了
Listen, I'm not going to be needing your services anymore,

454
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,390
很感謝你的幫忙
but I appreciate all your help.

455
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,620
不客氣
No problem.

456
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,850
我很榮幸
It was my pleasure.

457
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,540
再見
Good-bye.

458
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,890
艾倫打來的
That was Alan.

459
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,800
他說了什么
What did he say?

460
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,600
他感謝我保護你
Well, he, uh, thanked me for protecting you.

461
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,520
但還是沒找到拉里
But there's still no sign of Larry.

462
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,910
只要他還不知所蹤  你就不安全
And as long as he's out there, you're not safe.

463
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,740
我去買點必需品
I'm gonna go get us some supplies.

464
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,110
別走
No, don't go!

465
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,770
我們這么開心
We're having a good time.

466
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,330
你真是黏人的小可愛啊
You're just a sticky little honey bun, aren't you?

467
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,110
千萬別試圖聯系任何人
Now, don't try to get in touch with anyone,

468
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,170
否則拉里會殺了你
or Larry will kill you.

469
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,070
親親
Kisses.

470
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,220
我得去廁所了
I got to go to the bathroom.

471
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,100
媽的  我就尿床好了
Screw it. I'll just pee the bed.

472
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,330
羅斯
Rose?

473
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,900
別鬧了  羅斯
All right, come on, Rose.

474
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,310
這樣不好玩
This... this... It's not funny.

475
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,450
拉里
Larry?!

476
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,420
聽我說  我們可以說清楚的
Listen, we can... we can... we can work this out!

477
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,910
只是一點小誤會
It's-it's just a little misunderstanding.

478
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,980
老天  我...
Oh, God! I...

479
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,870
真沒禮貌
Well, that was rude.

480
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,870
看來我的澡白洗了
Looks like I took a shower for nothing.

481
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,540
無論你在哪里  出來吧  出來吧
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

482
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,470
我恨你  杰夫·斯壯曼  
I hate you, Jeff Strongman.
