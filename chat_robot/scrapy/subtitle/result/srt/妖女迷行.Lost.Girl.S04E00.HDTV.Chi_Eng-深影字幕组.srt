So let's take a look back and see where we left off.

我会像他一样统治

即使死亡也会畏惧我们

21
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:40,749
这只是短暂的分开...

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,543

I call for a vote of no confidence in this fake Ash.

27
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,366
莫里根刚刚宣布你是他们领地的敌人

00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:42,109
- 我们总有一天会死去 - 停车

You know? Never looked better going off a cliff.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,064
上一季发生了很多事啊 
A lot happened last season, 

35
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:09,770

是啊 上一季的确发生了很多 
Yes, a lot did happen last season. 

37
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:11,871
比如呢?
Like what?

38
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:15,145
我生了个儿子叫山姆
Including the birth of my son, Sam.

39
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:22,582
跟妖女迷行大家庭 分享喜悦真是太棒了
It's been great to share this time with my Lost Girl family.

40
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,394
每个人都很欢迎山姆 
Everyone has welcomed Sam, 

41
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,386
他也是第四季的重要部分
and he's been a big part of season 4.

42
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:28,854
我也想把他介绍给大家
And I just wanted to introduce him to you guys.

43
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:31,023
但已经过了山姆的睡觉时间 
But it is just past Sam's bedtime, 

44
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,357
所以他要去睡觉了
so he's going to go off to sleep now.

45
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,559
好吧 晚安 山姆

46

47
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:39,098
现在 我认为你们肯定同意我的看法
Now, I think you guys would definitely agree with me when

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,334
那就是我们拥有全世界最棒的粉丝 对不对?
I say that we have the greatest fans in the world. Right?

49
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,656
是啊 - 我确信 
Yes. - Bet it. 

50
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,337
事实上我们拥有一个神奇的
We actually have a magical

51
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:49,341
写满了粉丝们问题的异种之箱
Fae box full of questions that you guys have written in with.

52
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,610
所以 来看看你们都想知道什么吧
So, let's see what you all want to know.

53
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:54,045
第一个问题 来自妮基・克莱尔
First question, from Nicky Claire.

54
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:57,015
"你们在哪长大 小时候是什么样?"
"Where did you grow up and what were you like as a kid?"

55
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:00,319
- 哦哦 - 从你开始吧 K.c.
- Ooh. Ah. - Let's start with you, K.C.

56
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:04,322
我绝大部分时间在多伦多长大
I grew up in... for the most part, Toronto.

57
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:07,025
很多地方 但是我不想说的那么复杂
A lot of other places, but to keep it nice and not

58
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:11,662
所以就是多伦多吧 我小的时候...
complicated, Toronto. And as a kid, I was...

59
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:13,464
我是说 我很健壮
I mean, I was athletic...

60
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,667
我觉得我是整个宇宙的守卫者
I felt like I was a defender of the universe.

61
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,404
- 真不错 - 哇哦 - 我守护着许多人
- Nice. - Wow. - I defended a lot of people.

62
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:24,576
结果我打了不少架 我的祖母对此很不乐意
And I ended up in a lot of fights that my Grandma wasn't happy about.

63
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,845
- 祖伊 你呢? - 我在坎波恩长大 
- What about you, Zoe? - I grew up in Camborne,

64
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,815
英国的康沃尔郡 直到我十岁才搬过来
Cornwall, England, until I was about ten, and then we moved here.

65
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:35,385
并且我十分亢奋 好像我是个超级小孩
And I was hyper. Like, I was a really hyper kid.

66
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,855
别忘了 祖伊 你和我住在同一个村庄
on't forget, Zoie, you lived in the same village as me, too.

67
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:39,857
在威尔士? 我也住在威尔士
In Wales? I lived in Wales, too.

68
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,626
- 你们住在村庄里 - 是啊
- You guys lived in a village. - Yeah.

69
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:43,628
是的 一个很小很小的村庄 
Yeah, a tiny, little village. 

70
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,628
我是个城里人 我喜欢...
I'm a city boy. I like...

71
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,309
我在新不伦瑞克省的弗雷德里顿长大 
I grew up in Fredericton, New Brunswick. 

72
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,098
我知道
I know this.

73
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,566
我喜欢什么呢?
And what was I like?

74
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,135
我觉得我当时和现在没什么两样
I was kind of exactly like I am now, I think.

75
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,638
但是我的确花了一整个夏天扮成神奇女侠
But I did spend an entire summer dressed as Wonder Woman,

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,006
逐个打击我们社区的犯罪
literally fighting crime in my neighbourhood.

77
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,044
- 真的吗 - 当然了
- Really? - Yes.

78
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,233
我每天都穿同样的衣服 
I wore same thing every day. 

79
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,009
架打的怎么样?
How was that one fight?

80
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,979
得了吧 那可是新不伦瑞克省
Come on, it's New Brunswick. Come on.

81
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,114
那也会发生许多案件的
Hey, some stuff happens there, okay.

82
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,884
很奇怪 我长大了还会扮演神奇女侠
Strangely enough, I grew up also playing Wonder Woman.

83
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,659
所以我带着手环到处走 
So I would walk around with my bracelets. 

84
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,887
你是认真的吗?
Are you being serious?

85
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,889
是啊 我很认真的 我爱神奇女侠
Yes, I am. I loved Wonder Woman.

86
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,623
我在拉脱维亚的里加长大
Me, I grew up in Riga, Latvia.

87
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,795
小时候 我只记得我超爱童话故事
As a kid, I just remember loving fairy tales.

88
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:22,631
没有比听故事更好的事了
There was nothing better than being told a story.

89
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,301
所以这就是我当演员的原因吧
So I think that's why I wanted to become an actor,

90
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,969
因为我太热爱叙事艺术了
because I just loved the art of storytelling so much.

91
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,256
- 瑞秋呢? - 你就是从那起步的
- Rachel? - That's where you started it.

92
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:32,541
我在加拿大的多伦多长大
I grew up in Toronto, Canada.

93
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,147
我还是孩子时 我确实很有女孩样
And as a little girl, I was very much a girly girl.

94
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,879
所有东西都是粉色的 
Everything was pink. 

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,784
是啊 我知道 很震惊吧
Yeah, I know. Shocking.

96
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:47,622
我曾经很有女孩样 因为我现在就是个爷们
I was a girly girl. 'Cause I'm like a dude now, you know? So...

97
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,624
- 闭嘴吧 - 你呢 保罗?
- Shut up. - How about you, Paul?

98
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:54,095
好吧 我在威尔士的一个小村庄里长大
Well, I grew up in a little village in Wales where we used

99
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:57,822
我们惯说一点当地语言 就是威尔士语
to speak a little funny hobbit language called Welsh.

100
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,892
当我说威尔士语的时候 听起来就像这样
If I were to speak Welsh then it would sound something like this.

101
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,243
所以这是门美丽的语言 
So it's a beautiful language, 

102
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:04,472
被许多美丽的人讲出来
surrounded by beautiful people

103
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,071
还有一个美丽的乡村 
and beautiful countryside, 

104
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,309
我在那里长大真是非常非常幸运
and I was very, very lucky to grow up there.

105
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,294
那你怎么会变得这么邪恶? 
And how did you turn out to be so evil? 

106
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,146
不 我要告诉你发生了什么
No. I tell you what happened.

107
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:16,116
我的祖父是个主持人 就像酒吧的司仪一样
My Grandfather was a compere, which is like an MC in the clubs.

108
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:19,119
所以他经常在酒吧里唱歌讲笑话来逗大家
So he used to entertain and sing and tell jokes in the clubs.

109
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:22,122
我的叔叔经常偷偷带我去酒吧
And my uncles used to smuggle me into the clubs.

110
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:24,395
所以我可以坐在桌子上
So I could sit on the table 

111
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,894
看我祖父逗笑400多人
and watch my Grandfather entertain like 400 people.

112
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:27,829
你呢 ? 
How about you, Rickster? 

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,696
我在安大略省的金斯顿长大
I was born in Kingston, Ontario,

114
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:33,132
就挨着马路 我是个刻薄的孩子
just down the road. And I was a sarcastic child,

115
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,737
有点博学多才 所以 你们懂的 就这样
a bit of a know-it-all. So, you know, there you go.

116
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,971
完美啊 看看命运... 
Perfect. Look what fate... 

117
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,407
我没有脱离轨迹
I didn't fall far from the tree.

118
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,195
没脱离我角色的轨迹 
From my character's tree. 

119
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,578
下一个问题 来自福尔・凯斯费
Next question, from "Val Kensfey."

120
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,080
"剧中的所有虚构生物中

121
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:49,582

show, which one would you want to be if you had the chance?

122
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,684
- 沼泽怪 - 沼泽怪?
- The swamp one. - The swamp one?

123
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:52,886
你想住在沼泽中? 
You wanna live in a swamp? 

124
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,087
又泥泞又冷又潮湿?
Muddy and cold and wet?

125
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,923
带着那样的脑袋? 
With the head? 

126
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,757
瑞秋的品味很古怪的
Rachel's got a weird taste in things.

127
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,628
外表超级诡异 出来的时候哇哇大叫
It's just to get to look like that and come out be like, "Waah!"

128
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,098
好吧 伙计们 让我们看看粉丝的视频提问
Okay, guys, let's check out a fan video question.

129
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,094
来自奥德利
This is from Audrey.

130
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,461
专业地说
Professionally talking,

131
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,870
推特是不是带来了改变? 
did Twitter change something, 

132
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,676
如果是 改变了什么
and if yes, what?

133
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,356
还有:我爱你们
PS: I love you guys.

134
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,305
- 我们也很爱你 奥德利 - 是啊
- We love you too, Audrey. - Yeah.

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,749
谢谢你的问题和一直的支持
Thanks for your question and your endless support.

136
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:26,751
她是从一开始就关注我们的铁杆粉丝
She's been one of our biggest fans from the very beginning.

137
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,654
我认为她是本剧成功的原因
I think she's the reason the show is successful.

138
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,824
- 只靠一人之力 - 你知道什么最疯狂吗
- Single-handedly. - Do you know what has been

139
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:36,561
就是发推特的人有好多啊
crazy, though, is how big Twitter has become now, and the fact

140
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:40,131
其实 上一季的首映 就上了热门讨论榜首
that on the last season premiere, it was trending #1.

141
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,300
我记得很清楚我当时坐在哪
And I remember exactly where I was sitting.

142
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:43,804
我就想看看热门讨论
And I'm like, I'm gonna see what's trending.

143
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,303
"妖女迷行? 什么?!"
"Lost Girl? What?!"

144
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,605
然后我给我认识的每个人打电话 我就说
And then just called everybody I knew. I was like, "You have

145
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,974
"现在马上看推特 去推特上"
to go on Twitter right now. Go on Twitter."

146
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,609
太疯狂了 真是件大事
And that was wild. It was really huge.

147
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:55,379
这是我们观众和粉丝的证明
It's a testament to our viewers and our fans.

148
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:58,816
好吧 我们现在要休息一下 看一段网络视频
Okay, we're going to take a break for a webisode now.

149
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:01,819
在第三季最后 肯吉和布鲁斯
At the end of season 3, Kenzi and Bruce sped off in

150
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,788
在一辆非常性感的车中疾驰 找寻
a very sexy car, in search of Massimo.

151
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,598
我想知道 这两个人的公路奔驰
I wonder, what would a road trip 

152
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,891
会是什么样子并且
with these two be like, besides

153
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:11,027
他们还吃了很多奇多 听着辣妹组合的音乐
eating lots of Cheetos and listening to Spice Girls?

154
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,395
让我们拭目以待
Let's check it out.

155
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,230
布鲁斯 谈话终止吧
End of discussion, Brucey.

156
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,066
我和我想要的东西仅一桥之隔
I am one bridge away from getting what I need.

157
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,367
不成功便成仁
Strew it or bust.

158
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,570
但是肯吉 马西莫不是个好人
But Kenzi, Massimo is not a nice person.

159
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:22,405
别说了! 好人就像又脏又旧的牛仔裤
Please! Nice is yesterday's skinny jeans.

160
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,842
我需要的是今日的残酷真相
What Kenzi needs is today's brutal truth.

161
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:27,677
真相就是异种末日到了
And the truth is that it's Fae-mageddon out there.

162
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,475
所以我需要穿上盔甲 异种的盔甲 
So I need to armour up, Fae style, 

163
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,047
把那些人类的巧舌之徒抛开一会
lose this human shrike for a while...

164
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,450
但是我是异种 我的生命并非完美无缺
But I'm Fae, and my life is not exactly peaches and cream.

165
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:36,353
好吧 至少你还存在着 而我...
Well, at least you've got presence. Me...

166
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:39,389
哦 你看到了吗 我几乎都不能走路
Oh! You see? I can barely even walk.

167
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,592
- 是因为你的鞋太高了 - 真的吗?
- That's your shoes. They're too tall. - Really?

168
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:45,962
在你我经历这一切之后 你还羞辱我的鞋?
After everything you and I have been through, you're dissing my kicks?

169
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:49,499
羞辱? 我从不羞辱什么
Diss? I never diss.

170
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:53,536
- 哦! - 我甚至不知道怎么羞辱别人
- Oh! - I don't even know how to diss.

171
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:57,540
肯吉 等等 有危险 到处都是危险
Kenzi, wait. Danger. It's everywhere.

172
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:02,411
- 不许过 - 谁说的?
- Passage denied. - Says who?

173
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:06,448
- 数六下 - 数七...下
- Up your six. - Up yours... seven.

174
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,419
那是我的口号 眼线妹 你根本不懂
That's my handle, eyeliner. You probably wouldn't understand.

175
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:11,953
你需要男人告诉你怎么做
You're used to men telling you how it is.

176
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:14,956
男人 算了 男孩 甭想
Men, nyet. Boys, never.

177
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,026
尤其不需要这种卷发 磕碜的臆想狂
Especially not scruffy, pit-stained maggots.

178
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:21,763
抱歉 你这身上世纪的破布太吵了
Sorry, your trashcan goth rags are screaming '90s too loud.

179
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,432
- 我听不见你说的! - 哦 真的吗
- I can't hear you! - Oh, really?

180
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,234
好吧 如果你不懂潮流的话 我很遗憾
Well, I'm sorry if you can't stand style,

181
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,770
你个主流嬉皮士爱好者 滚吧
you mainstream hipster poser. Then get off the runway.

182
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,673
天啊 碰上巨怪了
Oh boy. We'd better troll.

183
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:36,575
我没跟你说话 什么
You I'm not talking to. But if I was, I'd be like,

184
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,679
像桥下的巨怪吗?
what, like an under-the-bridge fugly troll?

185
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,049
不 网络巨怪
No. An Internet troll.

186
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,584
他们真的是巨怪?
Those are, like, actual trolls?

187
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:46,287
- 啊哦 - 天啊
- Uh-huh. - Oh boy.

188
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:49,790
嘿 小六 你不应该在网上烦人么
Hey, Six, shouldn't you be online pissing people off?

189
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,259
我匿名损人太过了
I trolled a little bit too awesomely on Anonymous.

190
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,061
我们发现了我 转移我一个月
They had me hacked, transferred for a month.

191
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:57,197
来了老式桥哈 活该
Mmm. To old-time Bridgeville. Well, bam.

192
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,733
用阿兰尼斯的不朽名言就是 太讽刺了吧
In the immortal words of my girl Alanis, isn't it ironic.

193
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,769
我只剩一周的时间了 好吗
I only have a week left, okay?

194
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:04,371
你要哭了吗 你想让我帮忙吗
Are you gonna cry? Do you want me to polish up

195
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:06,306
帮你抛光那些巴迪霍利镜片?
those non-prescription Buddy Holly glasses for you?

196
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:09,076
哦 你很犀利 也很聪明
Oh, you're sharp. And smart.

197
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,643
还很淘气
And nasty.

198
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,013
来吧伙计们 这样对抗着让我手都痒了
Come on, guys. Confrontation makes me itchy.

199
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:17,050
让我们重新开始 我是
Let's start over. I'm Bruce.

200
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,991
- 布鲁斯- 很高兴见到你 布鲁斯
- Bruce. - Nice to meet you, Bruce.

201
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:36,869
这么瘦骨嶙峋 还这么能打
Oh, for a skinny guy, you sure pack a lotta punch.

202
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,937
是啊 巨怪嘛
Yeah. Troll.

203
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,343
你瞧 我需要在桥那边找德鲁人
Look. I need to get to a Druid on the other side of that bridge,

204
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,212
穿过那个你守卫的桥
the bridge that you've been assigned to guard.

205
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,236
什么代价啊 百事通? 
What of it, Captain Exposition? 

206
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:49,948
好吧 怎么做才行?
Okay, how's this gonna work?

207
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,351
你想要什么报酬 我的头发?
Do you want some kind of payment, a lock of my hair?

208
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,754
当成牙线用一个星期吗?
And me flossing weave for my teeth for a week?

209
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,013
不了 谢谢 
No thank you. 

210
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:59,057
是啊 如果你吃东西的话
Yeah, if you were eating it.

211
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,310
哦 天哪 你要吃了我吗? 
Oh, my god, are you gonna eat me? 

212
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:03,561
如果你在这签字 我就放过你
Not if you sign here.

213
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,866
什么 你想让我守卫这座桥?
What, you want me to take over guarding the bridge?

214
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,468
你再合适不过了 你骂人和我一样损
You're perfect for the gig. You spit back insults as fast as I do.

215
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,220
不过你仅剩一周啊 
Yeah, but you have, like, a week left. 

216
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:13,971
所以没什么大不了嘛
Exactly. So it's no biggie.

217
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,508
就跟你化眼妆的时间一样长嘛
What's that, as long as it takes you to apply your eye makeup?

218
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,110
我需要马上见到马西莫
I need to see Massimo now.

219
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,547
除非你在这签名
Not until you sign here.

220
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,784
看我的完美嘴型 不
Read my perfectly lined lips. No.

221
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:38,362
好吧 没事 没事的
Okay. It's okay. It's all right.

222
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,997
别哭啦 没事的
Don't cry. It's all right.

223
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,067
小六子 我又没说什么 先冷静
Six, honey, I don't speak sad troll. Just slow down.

224
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,471
冷静 深呼吸 告诉肯吉怎么回事
Slow down, take a breath and tell Kenzi correct what's wrong.

225
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,606
是这样的 一个月前
Well, see, it was about a month ago

226
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,242
我在网上遇到一个叫欧文的人
I was online and I met this guy named Owen,

227
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,279
明天应该是我们第一次约会
and tomorrow was supposed to be our first, like, date

228
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,282
在一个咖啡馆兼游戏室兼折纸室的地方
at this coffee shop/game room/ Origami workshop.

229
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,785
噢 红色康乃馨 这样他就能认出你了
Oh, the red carnation so he knows it's you.

230
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,174
很传统嘛 我喜欢 
Old-school. I like it. 

231
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,688
但糟的是时间定在两点
But it's suck-atood central.

232
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,824
好嘛 但是我不能擅离职守
Okay? Because I can't leave the bridge unguarded.

233
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,443
无所谓了 我不损人
It doesn't even matter. I can't talk to anyone

234
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:11,061
都没法好好说话了
without insulting them, road-trip breath.

235
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,429
- 对吧 - 好吧
- See? - Okay.

236
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:16,365
你喜欢黑别人因为这样显得自己聪明
You like insulting people because you think you're clever.

237
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,435
- 我就是天才 笨蛋 - 哼
- I am clever, no lobes. - Uh-huh.

238
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:24,006
那你干嘛不花点心思说点好话出来 试试看
So why don't you try being clever by saying something nice? Try me.

239
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:28,544
看到你的裤子我不想吐
Your pants don't even make me wanna puke.

240
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:30,779
好吧 首战告捷
Okay. Great first try.

241
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:34,183
但是注意不要说呕吐了 再试试 当我是欧文
But let's pin the puke and try again. I'm Owen.

242
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,318
你网上的切格瓦拉名言集
Your online collection of Che Guevara quotes

243
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
让我想给自己织个贝雷帽
make me want to knit my own beret.

244
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:40,089
棒 棒 超棒 太好了
Yes! Yes. Totally. Okay.

245
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,920
那关于这个桥 
So, about the bridge... 

246
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,359
没办法姐就是这么有爱
I am such a sucker for love.

247
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:47,029
- 不要签 - 少管闲事
- No! - Mind your own business.

248
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,531
她的事就是我的事 你这个傻叉小网迷
Kenzi is my business, you Internet cockroach shag rag.

249
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,765
- 布鲁斯 没事的 - 而你
- Bruce, it's okay. - And you,

250
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,734
- 你真是一点都不知道
you have some deep-seated misconceptions

251
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,669
自己多么渺小脆弱
about just how little power you have over people.

252
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,038
但你是我朋友 所以我支持你
But you're my friend, and I support you

253
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,441
尽管你穿这鞋连路都走不了
even if your shoes are ridiculously road-trip unfriendly.

254
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,043
哇 他真棒 和网上的水军一样棒
Oh, he's good. Like, online board message good.

255
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:04,879
- 是啊 谁会想到啊 - 我也不想这样
- Yeah. Who knew? - I don't like being this person.

256
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:09,276
但为了让你开心 快把合约给我吧
But I'll do it if it makes you happy. So just give me the contract.

257
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,687
噢 太感谢你了 兄弟 能握个手吗
Ohh, thanks, dude. Can I shake your hand?

258
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,123
我能捏碎吗
Can I crush it?

259
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:24,765
祝我好运吧 还有 大爱这鞋子 超炫的
Wish me luck. PS. Love the shoes. Fierce!

260
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,339

Thanks! Good luck! Have fun!

261
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,006
我爱你 小肯
I love you, Kenzi.

262
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,876
- 但如果你发生什么事 - 闭嘴啦
- But if anything happened... - Shut up.

263
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,779
- 你才闭嘴 - 你闭嘴
- You shut up. - You shut your mouth.

264
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,081
- 你走开 - 你关门滚粗
- You shut your face. - Shut the front door.

265
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,566
你走的时候别被门夹到哦
Don't let it hit you on the ass on the way out.

266
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,792
哇!
Bam!

267
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:48,255
谢谢你替我守桥 为我做的一切
Thank you for guarding this bridge, for everything.

268
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:50,242
感谢你的出现
Thanks for being you.

269
00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:56,105
- 别轻信马西莫 - 我答应你
- Don't trust Massimo. - Promise.

270
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,105
不要怀疑大块头的智慧
They never suspect the big ones.

271
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,810
- 大爱啊 - 超棒的
- Love it! - Awesome!

272
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:13,913
这段关系很有爱 我喜欢看他们在一起
It's a nice relationship. I love seeing them together,

273
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:18,450
因为我感觉他们都在寻找自己的栖身之地
because I feel like they're both looking for their place in the world.

274
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:21,320
我觉得肯吉同情布鲁斯
And I think Kenzi feels bad that Bruce has had this really hard

275
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:24,123
的坎坷的命运 所以和他感同身受
life and hard upbringing, so she relates to him.

276
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
所以我觉得这段关系很赞
So, I think it's a beautiful friendship.

277
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,127
好啦 同志们 我们先休息一下
Okay, guys, we are going to take a break.

278
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:30,780
等一下会看到更多网络剧
But when we come back, more webisodes, some

279
00:14:30,781 --> 00:14:33,432
让我激动的花絮
bloopers that I'm super excited to see, and

280
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:36,435
和更多的粉丝提问 等下见啦
some more of your fan questions. So, see you soon.

281
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:41,239
大家好 我是Kc 欢迎回到俱乐部
Well, hello. I'm K.C. Welcome back to the Clubhouse.

282
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,643
今晚我们在此讨论妖女迷行的一切
We're here tonight talking about everything Lost Girl,

283
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:46,045
来迎接第四季首播
and to get ready for the season 4 premiere.

284
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,047
我们收到无数的粉丝提问
We have tons of questions from the fans.

285
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:52,391
第一个来自谢莉尔・王尔德
The first question here is from Shirley R. Wild,

286
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,167
这是关于安娜和祖伊的 
and it's for Anna and Zoie. 

287
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,089
两个野性的女子
Who surely are wild.

288
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:01,712
说得好 伙计 真不错 好啦
Well done, sir. Well done. Okay.

289
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,896
波和劳伦是两个很不同的个体
"Bo and Lauren are opposites on so many levels, yet their

290
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:08,266
但她们的爱却惊天动地 好像天生注定
love is phenomenal and inevitable."

291
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:11,469
- 嗯 - 你觉得是为什么呢
- Okay. - "Why do you think that is?"

292
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,672
- 反向吸引吧 - 嗯 就是这样
- Opposites attract. - Definitely there's that.

293
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:17,475
我觉得对劳伦来说 波是少数
And also, I think that for Lauren, Bo is one of the few people...

294
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:20,546
劳伦觉得自己在很多时候是个局外人
Like, Lauren I think feels like an outsider in a lot of ways because

295
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,615
因为她是人类 随时会被异种遗弃
she's a human and at any moment could be tossed aside by the Fae.

296
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:26,718
而波出现前就是人类
I think that because Bo comes from a world where she kind

297
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,820
在某种程度上来说 好像是这样
of started as a human, to some degree, or seems that way,

298
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:33,724
我们有一种 我觉得我有点依赖你
that we kind of had some... I think I clinged on to you a little bit.

299
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:36,227
我觉得不和祖伊・巴莫擦出火花真是太难了
I would find it hard to not have chemistry with Zoie Palmer,

300
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:39,062
因为她这么美丽动人冰雪聪明
because she's beautiful and smart and...

301
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,865
你也是啦 你也好美腻
You're those things, too. You're beautiful, too.

302
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,534
- 别说啦 - 快停下 不 - 你停下
- Shut up. - Stop it. - No, you shut up.

303
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,594
好吧 小伙伴们 不管她们了 
All right, everyone, let's leave them 

304
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:47,771
让她们就这样闹吧
and let them at it.

305
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:51,474
我们继续 这个问题来自丹尼尔・米勒
So, here we go. This one is from Daniel Miller.

306
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:56,146
他说很喜欢预告里的浪人这首歌
And he says, "I love the Wanderer song cover in the promo."

307
00:15:56,148 --> 00:16:00,850
想知道这是从哪儿来的 他可以下载吗
He wants to know, where did it come from and can he get it?

308
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:02,852
真是个好问题 这里面有个好故事
Well, that's a good question and a good story.

309
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:05,576
因为杰・费尔斯通 我们的执行制片
Because Jay Firestone, our executive producer,

310
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:08,639
和范娜莎・皮亚拉 一个很棒的制片人
and Vanessa Piazza, one of our amazing producers,

311
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,261
一起面试了很多
they got together and they actually held auditions

312
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,764
女歌手来唱这首歌
for female vocalists to come in to cover the song.

313
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,766
最后选择的是名叫
And the one that won it, her name is...

314
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:20,269
- 艾米丽・摩尔来唱 - 艾米丽・摩尔
- Emily Mover. - Emily Mover. M-O-V-E-R.

315
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,105
可以在Showcase官网下载
And it's available on showcase.ca .

316
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:25,007
不好意思 我们能再来杯酒吗
Excuse me, can we have a another glass of that wine?

317
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:28,210
哇谢谢 布鲁斯
Ah, merci! Bruce

318
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:31,213
- 耶 布鲁斯 - 布鲁斯
- Yay, Bruce! - Bruce!

319
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,416
- 你好啊 波 怎么样 - 很好啊你呢
- Hi, Bo. How are you? - Good. How are you?

320
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,552
- 狼人
- Wolfman.

321
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:39,054
我现在比你更害怕 相信我
I'm more afraid than you are right now, trust me.

322
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:43,226
- 谁是发图小能手 - 大家来投票吧
- Who is the best Instagramer? - Oh, guys. Let's take a vote.

323
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,527
谁最爱发图?
Who is the best Instagramer?

324
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,963
我觉得一定是沙发上这三个人的一个
It's got to be one of these three, I think, on the couch.

325
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,965
- 因为我不玩 - 我不知道
- 'Cause I don't Instagram. - I don't know.

326
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,568
我高高在上 我只想说
I think I'm high up there. I just want to say.

327
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,138
我觉得克里斯拍的照片很艺术有美感
I feel like Kris takes phenomenally artistic, beautiful photos.

328
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,031
别忘了柯辛娜单人
The thing is, Ksenia Solo has entered

329
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:03,544
- 参加了摄影比赛 - 我觉得是柯辛娜
- a competition for her photographs. - I think Ksenia wins.

330
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,046
如果你都去参赛了
If you're entering competitions,

331
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,547
- 自动胜出嘛 - 是吗
- you just automatically win. - Oh, yeah?

332
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:10,484
好啦 同志们这有一个视频提问
Okay, guys, so there is another video question.

333
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,411
我们开始吧 开始了
Should we get to it? Let's get to it.

334
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,590
我们想了解大家在片场的性格
We want to know more about people's personalities on set.

335
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:16,857
比如谁最搞笑
Like, who is the funny one?

336
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,694
谁有公主病 从不出自己的拖车
And who is the Diva who never comes out of their trailer and

337
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,495
一副说别看我 别和我说话的样子
says, "Don't look at me. Don't even talk to me."

338
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:26,700
- 谁是飚戏大王 - 谁最幽默
- Who's the serious method actor? - And who is the practical joker?

339
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:29,103
我有王子病 我从不出拖车
I'm the Diva. I never leave my trailer.

340
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:31,638
- 从不 - 我缩在里面
- Never. - I huddle in there.

341
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,841
我真不觉得我们中谁有公主病
I don't know if any of us are Divas, really.

342
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:36,527
有些人总要花久一点时间
I mean, some of us are slower to come out of

343
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:39,212
才出拖车 但我不知道是谁
our trailers than others. I don't know who.

344
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:40,213
但你知道吗
But you know what?

345
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:44,217
男人们总是要花很久打扮
The guys always take a little extra time primping and priming.

346
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,219
神奇女侠才有公主病
Well, Wonder Woman is a bit of a Diva.

347
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,745
谁最爱搞笑 
Who is a practical joker? 

348
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:50,223
我觉得不是你就是克里斯
I think it's either you or Kris.

349
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:51,840
对 你和克里斯中的一个 
Yeah. Between you and Kris. 

350
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,226
我们就是常常互相搞怪
Well, we just practical-joke each other.

351
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:54,728
- 的确 - 好吧
- That's true. - Well, there you go.

352
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,729
克里斯拍着拍着就脱裤子
Kris does every other scene with his pants down.

353
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:00,666
- 对或者 手里拿把吉他 - 我就说
- Yeah, or a guitar in his hand. - I always say, you are

354
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:04,536
你现实中更像肯吉而不是戴森
actually more like Kenzi in your real life than you are Dyson.

355
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:07,774
所以你演肯吉 真是小菜一碟
So when you played Kenzi, it was like no biggie.

356
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:08,741
你就是这种性格的
You're used to that.

357
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:10,743
我当时就觉得 克里斯终于可以本色出演了
I was like, "Oh. Kris finally gets to play himself."

358
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:11,744
哇噢
Woo-hoo!

359
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:15,281
到时候看另一个网络剧啦
I think it's a good time for another webisode.

360
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:18,450
特里克和黑尔一直是密友
Trick and Hale have always had a very tight relationship.

361
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:22,254
今年作为新艾什 黑尔视特里克为导师
As the new Ash, this year, Hale really used Trick as a mentor.

362
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:25,223
在接下来的网络剧中有幸可以看到
This next webisode was a nice chance to see the two back

363
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,193
特里克回到豆吧后两人的重聚
together after Trick gets back to the Dal.

364
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:32,197
让我们来看看第二集网络剧 预言
Let's take a look at the second webisode, Prophecy.

365
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:37,102
这真像僵尸世界大战的战场
It's like World War Z happened in here.

366
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:40,872
- 欢迎回家 布拉德・皮特 - 你来干嘛
- Welcome home, Brad Pitt. - What are you doing here?

367
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:44,875
给你捎邮件 有人落在你门口了
Bring in your mail. Someone left it on your doorstep.

368
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,078
我在整理东西 不当艾什后
And I'm checking up on things. Being the former Ash,

369
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,148
我闲得很
it leaves you with a lot of free time on your hands.

370
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,726
不用谢我了 
You're welcome. 

371
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,486
知道我的酒吧发生什么了吗
Any idea what happened to my bar?

372
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:57,588
复仇女神闯进来开了个舞会吗
Furies broke in and threw a party?

373
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,792
说到舞会 你的性福之旅怎么样
Oh, speaking of partying, how was your sex-cation?

374
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:04,528
别提了
Just... don't.

375
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,164
不好意思 我不知道你和史黛拉分手了
Ooh. Sorry, I didn't know you and Stella split.

376
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,266
好吧 和我说说吧
All right, well, talk to me.

377
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:12,203
这个嘛
Well...

378
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:17,374
你听说过分离是甜蜜的忧伤吗
Do you know the saying parting is such sweet sorrow?

379
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,242
嗯
Yeah.

380
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,745
我的很甜蜜
I've had sweeter.

381
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,281
女人啊
Women.

382
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,784
嗯 还有爱女人的傻子们
Mm-hmm. And the fools who would love them.

383
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:30,690
- 还是自己的家好啊 - 所剩无几啦
- Be it ever so humble. - What's left of it.

384
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,891
再说到我的初恋吧
Now to tend to my first love.

385
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,515
我给你倒点茶 
I'll make you some tea. 

386
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:42,631
请告诉我你见到肯吉了
Please tell me you've seen Kenzi.

387
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,902
你是我第一个见到的熟人
You're the first familiar face I've seen come through that door.

388
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:47,937
她发短信说自己没事
She sent me a text message saying she was okay.

389
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,538
但是我不知道她在哪儿
It's just, I don't know where she is.

390
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,776
而戴森和塔姆辛我都不知道他们是不是还活着
Dyson and Tamsin on the other hand, I don't even know if they're alive.

391
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:56,211
我对这发生的有不好的预感
I have a bad feeling about what happened here.

392
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,248
备一桶酒慢慢干就会好的
Nothing a bucket and some elbow grease can't fix.

393
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:04,089
- 这是什么 - 轻拿轻放
- What's this? - Be very careful with that.

394
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:07,756
看起来像什么异种显灵板
It looks like some kind of Fae Ouija board.

395
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:12,560
这是个古老强大的占卜板
It's a very old, very powerful diviniation plank.

396
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,129
我刚就是这么说的啊
I believe that's what I just said.

397
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,965
是吗 你以为德尔菲神谕
Really? You think the Delphic oracles

398
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,135
就用粗直板和灵界沟通吗
used a chip board to commune with the spirit world?

399
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:24,138
这是台湾制造吗
Were there boards also made in Taiwan?

400
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,540
我没说这是原版的
I never said it was an original.

401
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:29,778
- 但同样威力无比 - 我赌一爪各玛币
- But no less powerful. - Well, one dragma...

402
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,448
你的板子预言的能力
says that your plank is as good as predicting the future

403
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,764
和我的八号球一样挫 
as my big old eight balls. 

404
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,886
你不能用预言赌博的
You can't gamble on prophecy.

405
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:42,223
就像用潘多拉盒子放遥控器一样
That's like using Pandora's box as handy place to keep your TV remote.

406
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:45,726
- 我就知道 - 喂
- Just what I thought. - Uh!

407
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:48,930
你想看证据么 好吧
You want proof? Fine.

408
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,835
- 你在干嘛啊 - 看不出来吗
- What the hell are you doing? - What's it look like?

409
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,972
你看起来像脑子坏了
It looks like you were dropped on your head.

410
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:02,843
- 好吧 我受够了 - 好啦 天啊
- Okay, I've had enough. - Okay. All right. Jeez.

411
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,878
我知道为什么史黛拉把你甩了
I'm starting to see why Stella curbed your ass.

412
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,849
通灵神谕是很严肃的 事先声明
Channelling the oracle is serious. And just for the record,

413
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,151
是我提的分手
I'm the one who did the curbing.

414
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:14,520
好啦 我会乖的
Okay, I'll behave.

415
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,225
闭上眼睛 清空大脑
Close your eyes. Clear your mind.

416
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:22,095
这对你倒是不难的
That shouldn't be too hard.

417
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:25,198
准备好了就提问吧
And when you're ready, ask your question.

418
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:31,203
哪位美女正想着我呢
Which fine woman is thinking about me right now?

419
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:34,567
肯吉


420
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:40,613
- 你看见了吧 - 你让板子这么做的
- You see. - You rigged the board to do that.

421
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,181
我怎么会知道
How would I know that?

422
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:43,983
人人都知道
Everybody knows that.

423
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,818
好吧 这次认真点
All right, serious question this time.

424
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,487
为了你的钱
To your money.

425
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:54,259
谁会接任艾什
Who will replace me as the next Ash?

426
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:56,528
黑尔?
Hale?

427
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,699
你当备战未来
Prepare yourselves for the arrival.

428
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:06,137
预言将会灵验
The prophesy shall be fulfilled.

429
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,808
枕戈待旦 严阵以待
Prepare. Prepare.

430
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,910
磨厉以须
Prepare.

431
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:18,917
我就知道这货是假的
Eh, I knew this thing was a fake.

432
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,785
跟你玩的不错
Pleasure doing business with you.

433
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,565

严阵以待
Prepare.

435
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:45,475
好嘞 不错哟
All right. There we go. 

436
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,477
有点前传后传的意思
A little bit more back-story and pre-story.

437
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,547
- 算命板把我吓死了 - 我也是
- Ouija boards always freak me out. - Yeah, me too.

438
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:52,249
我们请詹姆斯・厄尔・琼斯来配音的么?
Did we hire James Earl Jones to do that voice, or...?

439
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:53,897
不 亲爱的 我只是调了个频
Well, no, baby, I just went from the diaphragm.

440
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,509

波需要性能量维生
"Bo needs to feed off of sexual energy to survive.

456
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,165
如果你必须要一件物赖以为生 会是什么? 
If you had to feed off of any one thing to survive, what would it be?"

457
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,868
- 高级披萨啊 - 我选笑容

I like making people laugh, so when they

460
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,577
我就可以靠他们的笑容活命
laugh, then I can feed off that laughter.

461
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,580
要我说 人生最动容的事莫过于
For me, nothing moves me more in life

462

人们真诚实在的善良

463
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,785
- 我要以善良为食 - 哇塞 多有深度
- So I would feed off of kindness. - See, now I've got to get all deep.

464
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:04,221
我本来想说香蕉啊 玉米煎饼什么的
I was just thinking like, a plantain, or a burrito.

465
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:07,224
- 现在我得深刻点了 - 我以意面为食
- But now I need to get all deep. - I would also feed off of pasta.

466
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:09,293

470
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:27,377
我有件很棒的要分享 我超激动的
But I think I got one to top this, and I'm really excited about this.

471
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,839
我要向大家介绍小肯吉
I want to introduce the world to little Kenzi, who was made by

472
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,252
由才华横溢的约・莫科斯小姐制作
a very talented artist by the name of Ms. Jo Moxy.

473
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:40,707
小肯吉配备齐全 上至黑色羽毛文胸
And little Kenzi's got everything from a black leather bra, to Lady

And so hopefully, one of you guys at home will have little Kenzi one day soon.

477
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,504
我不知道是不是最棒的 
I don't know if I've got one to top that, 

478
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:56,005
不过我也有件有意思的事
but I've got an interesting one.

479
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:59,575
显而易见的是 我们这剧有很多退伍的粉丝
Well, obviously, like the show has a lot of ex-military fans.

480
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:02,277
我们去亚特兰大的时候 我和一位粉丝
So when we were down in Atlanta, I had this really very, very

481
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,981
进行了长久深刻的交谈
deep conversation with this one fan.

482
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:09,152
她给我一枚硬币 她说要是你
So, she gave me this coin. So she said, if you meet anybody

483
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:12,661
遇见部队上的人 给他们看看硬币
in the military and you show them this coin, if they don't

484
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:17,038
要是他们没带硬币 依据军法 该请你喝酒
have their coin, they, by law, military law, have to buy you a drink.

485
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:20,028
- 什么?! - 上周我在纽约
- What?! - So I was in New York just last week.

486
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,782
有个妹子 超级可爱 而且是部队的人
This young girl, she was really lovely, and she was actually

487
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:25,534
她刚刚从阿富汗回来
in the military. She'd just come back from Afghanistan.

488
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:29,538
我口袋里刚好有那枚硬币 我想 我有招了
So I actually had it in my pocket. I thought, "I know I have that"

489
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,373
我从口袋掏出硬币 放在桌上
So I pulled it out of my jacket, I put it on the table.

490
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:37,179
她停下 跑到对街 一袋
She stopped, ran out, went across the street, came back with

491
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,581
- 啤酒买来 - 哇 真的假的?
- a brown paper bag with a beer - Oh! What?

492
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:42,773
- 放在我桌上 - 太赞了吧!
- inside of it and put it on my desk. - That was awesome!

493
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,519
- 毋庸置疑 - 真不错
- No questions asked. - That's nice.

494
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,554
- 挺酷的 - 确实不错
- That's cool. - That's pretty good, yeah.

495
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:47,955
可没那个酷
But it's not as cool as that.

496
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:52,560
Dv 潘德米克问 你怎么看塔米辛和波的
From DV Pandemic: "What is your view on the

497
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:57,532
化学反应和情侣关系?
chemistry/relationship between Tamsin and Bo?"

498
00:25:57,534 --> 00:25:59,833
- 不存在 - 什么?
- It doesn't exist. - What?

499
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:03,037
我是说 我单纯爱你
I mean, I just love you.

500
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,305
很容易跟你来电
So it's so easy to have chemistry with you.

501
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:08,575
我感觉你就是那种人...
I feel that you're one of those people you know, where...

502
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:10,610
并不是我一人这样觉得
I didn't exclusively feel this.

503
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,579
我想遇见你的每个人都有这种感觉
I think everybody felt this way when they meet you.

504
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:15,082
就好像跟你认识好久了
Its like... you feel like you've known you forever.

505
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:18,118
- 哦 谢谢你 瑞秋- 你超级性感
- Oh, thank you, Rachel. - And you're hot.

506
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,013
- 锦上添花嘛 - 天啊
- So, that's cool. - Good Lord.

507
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,190
我觉得瑞秋和我之前有趣的是
What I think was interesting for Rachel and I, is that you

508
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:25,325
塔米辛和波开始就合不来
know, Tamsin and Bo didn't exactly hit it off

509
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:27,992
可是我们却很合得来
in the beginning, but Rachel and Anna did.

510
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,413
所以我们要强迫自己要记得
So we had to kind of remind ourselves that

511
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,530
我们恨对方 我们恨彼此
we hate each other, we hate each other.

512
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:33,382
- 我们本来很融洽 - 变脸 仇视彼此
- We'd be like, ha, ha, ha... - Yeah, hate each other.

513
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,035
没错 我想塔米辛和B相互尊重的
Exactly. But I think there is a mutual

514
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:38,738
她们是平等的
respect between Bo and Tamsin. They are equals.

515
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,141
她们都很强大
They are very powerful, so I think there is

516
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,542
我想其中既有化学反应又有尊重吧
a respect and the chemistry kind of exists there.

517
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:46,245
尽管她们可能意见相左
Even though they might not always love each other's

518
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:48,815
她们还是互相尊重
choices, they kind of respect them.

519
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,516
大伙们 我想知道
You know what I want to know, guys?

520
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:54,854
我想知道出演邪恶是什么感觉 禽兽伐克斯
I want to know what it's like to play the evil, monstrous Vex.

521
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,889
- 我就想知道这个 - 什么感觉
- That's what I want to know. - What is it like.

522
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:01,860
各种霸权集于一身什么感觉?
Yeah, what is it like to be the all-powerful Mesmer?

523
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:04,863
出演伐克斯 感觉太霸道了
It's like the most powerful thing ever, playing Vex,

524
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:09,567
每天都得穿皮裤
and just to be able to get into those leather pants every day

525
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:13,572
我走到片场 做那些手势
I come into set and just to do the hand movement.

526
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:18,276
没事了 没事了 一切都好的
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

527
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,653
- 快看我的片段吧 - 好嘞
- Can we just watch me now? - Alright.

528
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:26,083
闭上眼 一秒钟 想想看
Close your peepers for one hot second and imagine this.

529
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:30,888
比查理・辛的自大还大的喷泉
Dulce de leche fountains big enough for Charlie Sheen's ego,

530
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,359
美味的宾客 让模特都蠢蠢欲动
guests so delicious, they'd make a model wanna eat.

531
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,728
还有一身行头 抢镜行头啊
And the outfits. Phwa! The outfits.

532
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,964
它们会让简-保罗 格烈丽的春款
They will make Jean-Paul Gaulthier's spring collection

533
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:42,967
看起来在重症监护室
look like a string-your-own macaroni necklace day

534
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:46,072
做出的意面项链 我们说的是
at the geriatric ward. Phew. We are talking about

535
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:52,778
世纪大趴 告别过去的我
the party of the century for little old "me."

536
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,775
聚光灯! 交响乐!
Spotlight! Symphony!

537
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,482
伐克斯 黑尔在一号线上
Vex, Hale is on line one.

538
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:00,417
他说这是他第七次打来了
He says it's the seventh time he tried to call you today.

539
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,186
可我很忙!
But I'm busy!

540
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:04,688
走进门来
Entrance.

541
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,693
全场瞩目于我 从血钻水晶吊饰灯下出场
All eyes on me as I descend on a blood diamond Chandelier.

542
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:13,096
事实上 他们倒下是因为你清除了他们
Fact: they descend cause that's how you clean them, apparently.

543
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,398
唏嘘 掌声
Gasps. Applause.

544
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,834
泪水 奖励
Tears. Boners.

545
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:22,471
迎接新黑暗时代的到来吧
Welcome to the start of the new Dark Era.

546
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:27,444
在节庆后 我的宾客们相要些小吃
Now, after the festivities, my guests will want some nosh.

547
00:28:28,446 --> 00:28:30,413
此时你入场
And that's where you come in.

548
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:36,852
你是欧洲唯一一位愿意
Now, you are the only chef on the continent

549
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,956
准备河豚的大厨
that is willing to prepare Fugu, the cyanide of fish.

550
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,360
准备不当 会立刻致命
Prepared incorrectly, it will kill, instantly.

551
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:48,230
好了 为什么你的证书是无效的?
Now. Why have all your references been crossed off?

552
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:50,132
艾尔莎!
Alyssa!

553
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,402
能为您效劳吗?
What can I do for you?

554
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:56,738
试试河豚
Uh, try the Fugu.

555
00:28:57,874 --> 00:29:01,710
- 我食素 - 噢 素食主义者啊
- I'm vegan. - "Oh, I'm vegan"!

556
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,313
哦 看在我们最爱的歌手 王子的份上
Oh! For the love of the artist formerly known as Prince,

557
00:29:04,315 --> 00:29:05,747
跟我说你定了地点
tell me you booked the venue.

558
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,482
是的 其实他们刚...
Yeah. Actually, they just got back...

559
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:10,685
敢告诉我坏消息试试!
Don't you dare think about giving me bad news!

560
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:13,822
因为别墅是政府财产
Since the chateau is part government property,

561
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,758
他们要求申请 并要几个月才能通过
they require an application and the process takes months.

562
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,193
那B计划呢 游船趴?
What about plan B, the party boat?

563
00:29:19,195 --> 00:29:21,929
我知道不同寻常 可我们别无他法啊
I mean, I know it's a tad common, but it's the only choice we got left.

564
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:25,399
港口法律规定夜间九点以后严禁喧哗音乐
The harbour laws have restrictions on loud music after 9:00 P.M.

565
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:27,235
宾客数量也有严格限制
and restrictions on numbers of guests.

566
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:30,102
我们不能招待一千五百人 需要许可
We can't accommodate 1500 people. It would require a permit.

567
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,739
- 将需要... - 让我猜猜!
- That would take... - Let me guess!

568
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:34,108
- 几个月通过? - 没错
- Months? - Yeah.

569
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,378
办个派对能有多难?!
How hard is it to arrange a party?!

570
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:43,136
你想要我吗 伐克斯? 
Yeah, is that what you want, Vex? 

571
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:45,018
今天免了 小甜心
Not today, sugar puffs.

572
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,287
你说噎死不算亲热
You said choking isn't making out.

573
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,523
是啊 可是你激怒我了
Yeah, but you've made me very upset.

574
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:52,824
这个派对就是一切
This party is everything,

575
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,291
而就我在打理一切
and I feel like I'm doing all the work.

576
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,636
一人的把戏!
A bloody one-man show!

577
00:29:56,671 --> 00:30:01,268
我喜欢一个人的表演只有洗澡
And the only one-man show I fancy is a long shower in chaps, yeah?

578
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,836
- 要我给你洗澡吗? - 不必
- Should I start the shower for you? - Negative.

579
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:08,141
我会另找地点 有泳池 旋转楼梯
I'll find you another venue, and it'll be even better with a pool

580
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:10,976
以备你的华丽登场
and a winding staircase for your grand entrances.

581
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,045
那华丽的告别呢?
How about a grand exit?

582
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:17,293
试试鱼吧
Try... the... fish.

583
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,422
去你的 你有工作了
Fug you. You're hired...

584
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:25,892
前提是找到场地 嘿 你 下一位!
providing we can find a venue. Hey, you, next!

585

Hello.

586
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:32,531
有什么能为您效劳?
What can I do for you?

587
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,499
亲爱的 说话用中气
You'll have to use your outside voice, darling.

588
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,835
- 叫什么名字? - 贝蒂
- What's your name? - Betty.

589
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:41,506
很好 艾尔莎 我现在想办个派对
Oh, perfect, Alyssa. Now, I simply am trying to throw a party.

590
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,942
可我总是碰到阻拦
But I keep running into red tape.

591
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:46,511
现在我要你把一切阻碍消灭
Now I'd like you to make that red tape vanish.

592
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,047
我可不想听到失败的消息
And if it's still there, I don't wanna hear anything about it

593
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:50,725
你的工作就是想尽一切办法
because it's your job to find a way 

594
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:51,983
让它成功的 明白?
around it. Got it?

595
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:03,227
哦...
Ohh...

596
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,033
真是个苦差事 亲爱的
It's hard work, darling.

597
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:12,503
我是说 各种束缚和无能的人
I mean, restrictions, incompetent people.

598
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:16,507
我就只想办个派对啊
And I'm just simply trying to throw a party.

599
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:20,678
那我要想干大事了可怎么办?
What's gonna happen when I try to do something serious?

600
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,063
- 我到底做了什么? - 包裹?
- What have I done? - Package?

601
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,219
好吧 令人印象深刻 我懂
Oh, yeah. It's impressive, I know.

602
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,456
在澳大利亚 他们叫这个便当
In Australia, they call this a "packed lunch."

603
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,925
- 放桌上就行了 - 好的
- You can just put it on the desk. - Okay.

604
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:56,479
- 要放映机吗? - 速速取来
- Projector? - Quickly.

605
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,386
杀了厨子 派对结束了
And kill the caterer. The party is over.

606
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:09,291
- 噢 - 你穿皮裤真好看 保罗
- Ooh. - You do look good in leather, Paul.

607
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:13,874
有趣的是 我当时是一镜到底
The funny thing about that is I actually do that all in one,

608
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:16,232
每次都如此 太难了
every single time, which is pretty tricky.

609
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,886
- 一身劲装啊! - 很难 没有别的意思
- That's an outfit! - Tricky. No pun intended.

610
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,448
很大程度上是因为... 是的 没错
It's largely because... Yeah, exactly.

611
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:21,370
很大程度上是因为我是
It's largely because I am the

612
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,172
我们之中唯一一位科班出身的演员
only classical trained actor amongst us all.

613
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,552
- 对吗? - 你倒还真敢说
- Is this correct? - You gotta lay that on.

614
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:30,007
好了 马上回来更多妖女迷行主创精彩

621
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:53,896
小偷! 我本来要说这个的
Oh, you stealer! That's what I was going to say.

622
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:56,482
更魔幻 更戏剧化
Magical. Theatrical.

623
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,817
有点颠覆你的猜测
It's more of the opposite of what you think you know.

624
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:02,388
- 没错 出乎意料 - 更左倾一点
- Yeah, it's more like that. - It's a lot more left than right.

625
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,391
- 是的 - 前所未有的大范围
- Yes. - It's more circular than it's ever been.

626
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,393
- 有些缺少中心 - 更高了
- It's more less centre. - It's taller.

627

- 太疯狂了 - 范围更宽
- It's bananas. - It's a little wider.

Zoie Palmer. 

632
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:20,205
这是比利・麦克西向大伙的提问
This is from Billy McCarthy for everyone.

633
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,609
如何平衡你们的个人生活和职业生活呢?
"What is it like balancing your personal lives and your professional lives?"

634
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,455
我们生活在这 我们在这住 
Ooh. We live here. We live, 

635
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,425
在这呼吸 流汗流泪
breathe, sweat and cry here.

636
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,075
就像是我们第二个家
This is kind of like our second family.

637
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,691
可是我想我们真的家人很想念我们
But I think our real families do miss us.

638
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:35,119
很有意思 因为我们是演员
It's interesting, because when we work as actors, there is

639
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:37,622
所以常常就会有所扮演角色和本人
a lot of transference sometimes between the character that we

640
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:41,225
之间的转换问题 可是我发现司凯乐
play and the person that we are. But I have found with Skyler,

641
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:45,530
每次我见司凯乐 他都不一样 
whenever I see Skyler, there is a wash, a clean wash.

642
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:47,032
我想做一个好人
And it's just like I want to be the best

643
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,532
我想当他的好父亲
person I can be, the best dad I can be for him.

644
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:51,068
这就是柯辛娜和我对马科斯和缇娜的感觉
That's how Ksenia and I feel about Max and Tina.

645
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,639
我们为了他们成为更好的人
We just want to be the best people we can be for them.

646
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:56,863
快乐 并爱着他们 
Happy. Yeah, and love them. 

647
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:57,975
喂他们最好的粮食
Feed them the best Kibble.

648
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:01,045
- 最好的粮食 - 好好将他们养大
- The best Kibble. - Train them properly.

649
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:04,148
- 说得好 瑞秋- 说实话 我们
- That's beautiful, Rachel. - Honestly, we have a pretty

650
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,451
妖女迷行是个很棒的大家庭 你们也都看到了
amazing family at Lost Girl, which you can see.

651
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:10,220
有时真的超级好笑
Sometimes things get pretty hilarious.

652
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,989
- 搞笑 - 让我们看看一些瞬间
- Hilarious. - Let's take a look at some

653
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:16,391
我们中有些人不好过哦
moments that didn't go too well for a couple of us.

654
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,763
天啊
Oh, my god.

655
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:20,597
开拍!
Action!

656
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:22,472
我跟黑暗小精灵握手言和 
So I shook hands with a dark pixie 

657
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:24,034
如今我欠你了我欠你?
and now I owe you my IOU?

658
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:26,080
是啊  没错
Yeah. Uh-uh. Exactly.

659
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:31,607
你该剪头了 抱歉
You deserve a haircut. Whoops.

660
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,444
我刚刚打到克里斯的球了
I just hit Kris in the balls.

661
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:37,447
让我们从踢球那里开始 我爱被虐
Let's pick it up from the ball hit. Because I like that so much.

662
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,417
说真的 你是什么? 
Seriously, what are you? 

663
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,551
你永远杀不死我的 波波
Something you can't kill, Bo-Bo.

664
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:43,619
这个也许会杀了你哦
But this might kill you.

665
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,327
停!
Cut!

666
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:58,689
我很抱歉 不好意思了 各位
I'm so sorry. Sorry, guys.

667
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:02,637
有人干扰我的魔力
Somebody's f . . . -ing with my magic.

668
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,374
- 太棒了 - 太有了
- That was awesome. - That was the way to go.

669
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,377
- 看这个真不错 - 谢谢你们邀请我
- That was good to see. - Thank you very much for having me.

670
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,012
我要去赶飞机啦
I have to go to make a flight.

671
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:13,782
不过其他人还会陪大家 
But everyone else will be back very soon. Mwah!

672
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:17,352
- 爱你哦 - 拜!
- Love you. - Bye!

673
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,809
大家好 我是祖伊・巴莫欢迎回到俱乐部
Hi, hello. I'm Zoie Palmer. Welcome back to the Clubhouse.

674
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:23,811
我真的吃爆米花就停不下来
I literally can't stop eating popcorn.

675
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,381
这是我第七盒了
I'm on my seventh box of popcorn here.

676
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:29,650
第四季马上首映开始 我们好激动啊
The season 4 premiere is coming up very soon. We're all very excited.

677
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:32,520
不过还有些时间回答粉丝问题
But we still have some time for some more fan questions.

678
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:35,189
安吉拉・罗曼提问
This one is from Angela Romano.

679
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:39,794
我们还会看到肯吉和劳伦曾经的故事吗?
"Will we learn more about Kenzi and Lauren's back story?"

680
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:43,521
- 哦 - 你是随机抽到那个的吗?
- Oh. - Did you pull that one by accident?

681
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,199
- 你从哪拿的? - 关于我的啊
- Where did you get that? - Anything about me.

682
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:48,669
我想是的 我们确实更了解劳伦了
I think that, yes, we do learn more about Lauren's back story.

683
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:52,005
我们了解更多她的毛病是什么
We'll learn a little bit more about what her problem is.

684
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:54,040
我不知道 你说呢肯吉?
And I don't know, what about you, Kenz?

685
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:58,078
我想是的 我们探讨了肯吉的过去
I think, yeah, we delve into Kenzi's past and some peeps

686
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:03,583
看见些事 不会剧透太多 有人
appear, without giving too much away, who kind of shed

687
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:07,053
让肯吉的人生增光添色 还有她的家乡
some light on Kenzi's life and where she comes from.

688
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:09,055
好了 又到视频提问环节
Okay. We are going to go on to a video question.

689
00:36:09,057 --> 00:36:10,957
我们看大屏幕吧
We're gonna watch the monitor.

690
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:15,361
嗨 我是安娜 我的问题是 肯吉和劳伦
Hi, I'm Anna. My question is, will Kenzi and

691
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:20,166
还是朋友吗? 我希望如此
Lauren be friends this season? I hope so.

692
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,768
她说"肯吉和劳伦这一季还是朋友吗?"
She said, "Will Kenzi and Lauren be friends this season?"

693
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,938
- 我希望如此 - 天啊
- I hope so. - Oh my god.

694
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,675
在第三季终时 我们终于
Well, at the end of season 3, we finally, you know,

695
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,228
冰释前嫌 聊开了 
dish it out, talk things out. 

696
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:32,779
是啊 我们拍了那场
Yeah, we had that scene

697
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,580
那时我们都有点暴脾气 之后...
where we were a bit grumpy and then we got...

698
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:36,649
- 更发火了 - 记得暴脾气那场吗?
- Very grumpy. - Remember that grumpy scene?

699
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:38,051
- 我们一起打猪 - 是啊
- We fought pigs together. - Yeah.

700
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:39,451
记得吗? 那很好啊
Remember that? That was nice.

701
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:41,453
- 我感觉... - 我们快了 
- So I feel like, you know... - We're getting there.

702
00:36:41,455 --> 00:36:44,956
我们有了我们的愤怒时间
We've had our grumpy, mean times.

703
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:49,093
所以是时候让肯吉和劳伦相亲相爱了
I feel like it's time to get in to the love with Kenzi and Lauren.

704
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:50,194
好了 到了网络片段的时间
Okay, now it's webisode time.

705
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:52,864
今年我们会介绍一种全新异种
And we're introducing a whole other kind of Fae this year.

706
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:56,834
我们在参加会议时有过暗示
And we've hinted about that at some of our conventions that we've attended.

707
00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:59,203
现在是时候更多了解今年异种世界
But now it's time to get to know a little more about some of the

708
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:01,805
异种世界的新人了
new players in the Fae world this year.

709
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:04,808
或者说 一些老演员
Or rather, some of the old players.

710
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,288
异种电影公司荣誉出品:
The Faedonia Film Company presents:

711

第一章 血圣的消失
to Know You, chapter one, The Disappearance of the Bloody King.

717
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:33,704
这将我们引向新物种 尤那达人
Which of course brings us to the creation of the Una Mens.

718
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:36,439
他们是谁? 做什么事?
Who are they? What do they do?

719
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,408
对你我又意味着什么呢?
What do they mean to you or I?

720
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,376
我会详细告诉你的
Well, I'll tell you sure enough.

721
00:37:40,378 --> 00:37:42,629
我们何不先去看看
But why don't we first find out what

722
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,880
你已知的 并从那开始吧
you know already and go from there.

723
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:52,188
他们不在这 对吧 强尼?
They're not here, are they, Johnny?

724
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,725
嘿 问你呢 谁是尤那达人?
Hey, you there, who are the Una Mens?

725
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,395
我听说他们是超级英雄 这样就能把你灭了
I heard they were superheroes and they could wipe you out just like that.

726
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:02,732
左勾拳 右勾拳 你挂了
Wham, smack, pow, bam!

727
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:08,136
你个子挺低的 胆子倒挺大 
You're short, buzz, but not on moxie.

728
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:11,707
- 我听说他们是大妖怪 - 噢! 
- I heard they was the bogeymens. - Aw!

729
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:14,843
不 小姑娘对不住了 那是吾那达人
Oh, no, sorry little one, that's Una Mens.

730
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:18,507
看来我们需要点帮助啊
Hmm. Well, it looks like we're gonna need a little help.

731
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:20,093
尤那达人是古种生物 是异种长老 
The Una Mens are near Omiscient,in fact they are fae elders 

732
00:38:20,094 --> 00:38:21,049
他们解决问题 践行法律 执行死刑
who solve problems doing enforce the laws and pin the death.

733
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,923
懂了么?
Easy enough for you?

734
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:33,059
尤那达人掠走了我的孩子 我的儿子!
The Una Mens took my son. My boy!

735
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,163
我要他们死光!
And I want them dead!

736
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,532
要是你问我 他们就该被吊死
If you ask me, they should be strung up, brought to the

737
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:41,168
被恐吓 用尽一切办法折磨
gallows and whooped but good! Ah!

738
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,770
不不!
No! No!

739
00:38:42,772 --> 00:38:43,771
坏了
Uh-oh.

740
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:46,173
看来有人忘了尤那达人的三R定律了
It looks like somebody forgot the three R's of the Una Mens:

741
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:50,225
自律 自尊 自醒
restraint, respect, or reckoning.

742
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:57,191
一切都很简单  对于异种世界里
It's all quite simple, really. There's nothing to fear for the

743
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:59,100
遵纪守法的公民来说没什么害怕的
law-abiding citizens of the Fae world.

744
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,721
我们要保持冷静 拼搏向前
We must keep calm and carry on.

745
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:05,137
并且铭记 如果我们尊重
And remember, if we show

746
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:08,551
并受异种法律约束
restraint and respect the laws

747
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:10,930
就不会有...
of the Fae, there will be no...

748
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:14,567
不会有... 喂!
no... Psst!

749
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:17,804
- 巴兹 该说台词了 - 没有自醒
- Buzz, that's your cue. - No reckoning.

750
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,208
接得好 小伙 有此光明异种的态度
Nice one, junior. Why, with a nice Light Fae

751
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,912
有朝一日你可能当阿什哦
attitude like that, you're a shoo-in for Ash one day.

752
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:27,423
也许可以演阿什 
Oh. Well, maybe acting Ash. 

753
00:39:27,424 --> 00:39:29,083
为什么 我应...
Why, I outta...!

754
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:33,920
悠着点 小伙 记住 偏离法律
Easy, junior. Remember, stray from the one

755
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:37,190
或者说强纳森太太的感恩节
true set of laws, and, well, let's just say Mrs. Johnson's

756
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:40,459
火鸡就会变小不少哦
turkey is gonna be a little bit smaller this Thanksgiving.

757
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,637
- 去死吧 - 拜托 强纳森太太
- Go to hell! - Oh, come now, Mrs. Johnson,

758
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:49,067
我们要明白尤那达人的三R法则
we all must observe the 3 R's of the Una Mens.

759
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:51,670
没有了他们 就没有了灾难
For without them, there would be chaos.

760
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:54,957
没人愿意那样的
And nobody wants that.

761
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:58,243
所以 朋友们 对于诚实守信的
So you see, friends, life as

762
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:01,667
异种而言 生活就是...
an honest to goodness Fae is...

763
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,949
简单来说...
It's as easy as 1...

764
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,954
简单来说...
It's as easy as...

765
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:13,024
自律
restraint.

766
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,732
我做不下去了
I can't do this anymore. This...

767
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,567
这他妈到底是什么?
what the hell is this, huh?

768
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,020
死亡异种之书吗?

还有死亡异种的照片
There's pictures of dead Fae in here.

770
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,973
他们想怎么样...
What, do they... Do they do what...

771
00:40:28,975 --> 00:40:30,908
你干的?
So you do this?

772
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,010
我认识这些人
I know some of these people.

773

什么 我是下一个吗?
What, am I next?

774
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,882
我有消息给你 哥们 你不能杀我
Well, I got news for you, pal. You can't have me.

775
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:41,919
因为我只听命于弗兰林・德克
'Cause I only answer to Flynn Decker, and Flynn Decker only.

776
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:44,221
把你手放开! 不! 不!

This is from Bri Amber "Yumans"? Okay. This is for Zoie.

789
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:37,561
亲爱的 问题是为了扮演劳伦
And the question is, my love: "Was it hard learning

790
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:40,297
学习那么多医用术语很难吗?
all those medical terms and phrases Lauren says?

791
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:43,300
那其他人呢? 如何为角色准备的?
How about everyone else? How do you prepare for scenes?"

792
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:45,736
是的 很难 非常难
Yes, it's hard. It is hard.

793
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:47,771
我有时根本不懂我在说什么
I sometimes have no idea what I'm saying.

794
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:52,009
我真的只记发音然后背出来的
I literally just memorize it phonetically and then say it.

795
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:55,246
- 其他人呢? - 我绝对谷歌了
- How about everyone else? - I definitely Google and

796
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:58,782
并且维基百科了异种什么的 因为...
Wikipedia different Fae stuff. And because it's...

797
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:01,752
是啊 我需要脑袋里有画面
Yeah. I need to have a picture of something in my head

798
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,253
才能诠释故事嘛
when I'm trying to tell you guys a story.

799
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:06,990
我在片场乱转 在角落乱闻 在东西上乱尿
I walk on set, I smell in corners, I pee on things.

800
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,992
还冲陌生人乱吼
And I just kind of basically growl at the odd stranger.

801
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,027
舔自己的蛋蛋
And you lick your own balls.

802
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:12,262
好吧 那可得几年瑜伽功夫呢 哥们

803
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,264
不要低估我的训练
Don't diminish my training.

804
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,566
来到这 上妆发 装尾巴
Getting here and then going into the hair and make-up

805
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,868
就是我们常做的第一件事
trailer, which is usually the first thing that we do.

806
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,870
我开始逐渐觉得我越来越像波
I slowly start to feel more and more like Bo.

807
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,273
我一穿上紧裤子 就有裂纹
And then as soon as I put on the tight pants a

808
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:26,042
又搭皮带什么的...
nd the cleavage comes out and the belt goes on...

809
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,278
- 而且安娜就走掉了 - 安娜转头就走
- And the Anna goes away! - The Anna goes away.

810
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,513
我是谁啊? 不 我是说...
Who am I? No. I mean, it's...

811
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:33,783
我真的感觉我准备好一展身手了
And then I really feel ready to kick some ass.

812
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:37,753
我想知道你们在家什么感觉 知道再过
I wonder how you guys at home are feeling, knowing that we are

813
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,757
一会 史诗般的第四季就要拉开帷幕啦
mere moments away from the epic season 4 premiere.

814
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,160
马上播出 再回答一个问题
We are this close, but we've got one more question.

815
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,737
- 这是最终特别问题 - 好激动
- So this is the special last question. - Exciting.

816
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,331
我要去拿异种盒子 抽出题来
I'm gonna reach into the Fae box and I'm gonna pull it out.

817
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,733
来自简宁斯・肖恩的问题
And the question is from Janice Shawn.

818
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,381
我们知道你们不能剧透第四季 
"We know you can't give away season 4, 

819
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:55,704
不过给点线索吧
but throw us a bone."

820
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,706
- 噢! - 天啊!
- Ohh! - Gosh!

821
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,707
哇喔!
Whoa!

822
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,243
谈论第四季太难了 因为
It is so hard to talk about season 4, because there were

823
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,845
第三季留了很多悬念
so many cliff-hangers at the end of season 3.

824
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,915
不过我可以保证 你不会失望
Yeah. I can say I do feel like you won't be disappointed.

825
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,584
- 绝不会失望 - 你绝对不会失望
- Will not be disappointed. - You will not be disappointed.

826
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:12,187
- 火力全开的一季 - 太多转折
- It's a strong season. - There are so many twists and

827
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,256
峰回路转 迷雾重重 秘密勾当 性感撩人
turns and mysteries and secrets and sexiness.

828
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:17,534
我想每个角色 你都会
And I think each of the characters, you're going to see

829
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:20,261
以前所未有的角度审视他们
them in a way you've never quite seen them before.

830
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,263
- 我觉得这对我们都适用 - 没错 
- And I think that is the case for all of us. - Yeah, that's true.

831
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,766
我想我们中的每位你都将会
I don't think there is any one of us that you're not going to get

832
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:27,268
有更进一步的了解 也会有更多惊喜
