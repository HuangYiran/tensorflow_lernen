我们自称为"布莱克组织"

你们现在肯定都很害怕
You must all feel scared,

很紧张
nervous.

65
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,010
由你们自己选择
should you so choose.

66
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,820
我们为何需要律师
Why would we need an attorney?

67
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,740
从我们的角度来看看这事  金宝
Well, let's look at this from our perspective, Kimball.

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,450
你们的上司伯特仑是个罪犯
Your boss Bertram is a criminal.

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,130
所以有可能你们也是
Makes sense that you might be one, too.

70
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,360
我们会非常仔细地审视你们每个人
We will be looking very closely at all of you.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,690
如果你们有任何
If you have ever done anything

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,050
只要一点点可疑的举动
even remotely questionable,

73
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,330
我们都会发现
We will find out,

74
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,420
然后起诉你们
and we will prosecute.

75
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,480
当然了  除非
Unless, of course,

76
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,010
你们能够配合  那我们会非常非常满意
We feel very, very comfortable with your cooperation.

77
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,030
那样你们就有点回旋的余地
Then you got a little wiggle room.

我听说了
I heard.

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,240
那你听说了伯特仑当时在加油站做什么吗
Did you hear what Bertram was doing at the gas station?

118
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,190
没
No.

119
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,230
他在打公用电话
Using a pay phone.

猜猜他打给了谁
Guess who he was calling.

121
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,560
我猜是简
I'm gonna guess Jane.

122
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,900
没错  那他在哪
Ahh. Yeah. So where is he?

我不知道
I don't know.

我没法左右你的想法
I can't help what you think.

126
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,490
我认为你的男朋友和一名危险的逃犯勾结
I think your boyfriend is colluding with a dangerous fugitive.

127
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,710
我认为他已经深陷布莱克组织中无法自拔
I think he is up to his neck in this Blake Association craziness,

128
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,210
可能你也是
and probably you are, too.

129
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,720
我不是  他也不是
I'm not. He's not.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,590
简无法阻止打给他的人
Jane can't help who calls him,

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,610
而且他也不是我的男朋友
and he's not my boyfriend.

132
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,690
真是太遗憾了  特蕾莎
It's a damn shame, Teresa.

By all accounts...

134

你曾是个好警察
You were a good cop.

135

I still am.

Is it safe?

139
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,910
嗯  你们在干嘛
Yeah. What are you doing?

140
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,220
我们听说了伯特仑今早干的事
We heard about what Bertram did this morning.

141
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,840
听说联调局的人在找我们
We heard the F.B.I. were looking for us.

142
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
所以现在是怎样  你们就躲在停车场吗
So what now? You're hiding in the parking lot?

143
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,600
不  我们不是躲起来  只是
No. No, we're not hiding. We're just...

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,460
低调行事
laying low.

145
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,390
我们暂时还安全
Well, we're safe for now.

146
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,770
至少现在还没有下达对我们的逮捕令
There's no arrest warrant that's put out for us just yet.

147
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,750
他们迟早会的
Give 'em time.

148
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,670
简在哪
Where's Jane?

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,870
她刚已经问了
She just did.

151
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,590
听我说
Listen to me.

152
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,800
如今加调局已经不复存在了
The C.B.I. is gone now.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
我们只能靠自己了  你们得保护好自己
We're on our own. You need to protect yourselves.

154
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,610
你们不知道简在哪里  他在干什么
You don't know where Jane is, you don't know what he's doing,

155
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,130
也不想知道  明白了吗
and you don't want to know, you understand?

156
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,550
明白  头儿
Yes, boss.

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,190
-明白  头儿  -明白  头儿
- Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.

158
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,600
那就好
All right then.

159
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,020
但我已经不是你们的头儿了  关键就在这里
But I am not your boss anymore. That's the point.

160
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,320
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

161
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,520
我们明白的
Yeah, we get it.

162
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,890
那他在哪
So where is he?

163
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,610
{\pos(191.4,278.4)}加州  萨克拉门托  威廉兰德公园

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,650
你被通缉了
You're a wanted man.

165
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,610
我想也是
Well, I like to think so.

166
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,020
我说真的  艾伯特给你下了逮捕令
Seriously. Abbott put an actual warrant out on you.

167
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,770
也不是第一次了
Eh. It's not the first time.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,630
所以你到底要不要告诉我
So you gonna tell me, or what?

169
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,010
哦对  伯特仑打给我了
Oh, yeah. Uh... Bertram called me.

170
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,200
我知道
I know.

171
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,210
他说了些什么
What did he say?

172
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,620
不管他想说什么  他那时都没来得及
Well, whatever he wanted to say, he didn't have time.

173
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,870
为什么他还在城里
Why the hell is he still here?

174
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,170
他想做什么
What does he want?

175
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,660
我猜他会很快再打来告诉我
I'm guessing he'll call back soon and tell me.

176
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,320
你的手机不安全  联调局...
Your phone's not safe. The F.B.I.--

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,220
对  他们装了窃听
Yeah, they have a tap on the line.

178
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,440
但他们还没追踪到
But they don't have a trace yet.

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
如果他们追踪到了  我现在就早该被捕了
If they had a trace, then I'd be arrested already.

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,390
也许如此  但他们早晚会追踪到你的
Maybe so, but sooner or later, they'll get a trace on you.

181
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,230
我知道
I know.

182
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,940
但在伯特仑打来之前我不能扔掉手机
But I can't get rid of my phone until Bertram calls.

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,460
所以事情就悬在这了
It's all very suspenseful.

184
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

185
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,250
谁
Who?

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,110
伯特仑
Bertram.

187
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,100
到时候就知道了
We'll see.

188
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,070
你在闪烁其词
Now you're being evasive.

189
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,580
小鸟的眼睛圆又亮
What beady little eyes birds have.

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,330
《小恐龙》[系列童书]  你知道吧
Tiny Dinosaurs, you know?

191
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,130
我知道
I know.

192
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,460
我知道你很清楚他的意图
I know you know what he wants.

193
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,530
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

194
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,950
-喂  -很抱歉我那时不得不挂电话
- Hello? - Oh, sorry I had to hang up on you.

195
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,300
今天实在太忙了
It's been a busy day.

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,930
没关系  这个电话不安全
Yeah, no problem. You know, this phone is not safe.

197
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,440
我马上再打给你
Let me call you back in a moment.

198
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,620
好的
Yeah.

199
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,450
他说什么
What'd he say?

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,750
稍等一下
Just a second.

201
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,300
你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

202
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,970
我出一百块换你的手机  行吗
I'll give you $100 for that phone.

203
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,560
什么
Huh?

204
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,830
两百块换你的手机
$200 for that phone.

205
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,230
这是什么骗局吗
What's the catch?

206
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,250
不是骗局
No catch.

207
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,730
三百块  外加
$300 plus...

208
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,770
一部替代机
a replacement phone.

209
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,850
那好吧
Uh, okay.

210
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,050
哥们  我一会儿再打给你
Yeah, dude, I'll call you right back.

211
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,360
交易愉快
Pleasure doing business with you.

212
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,210
谢了  伙计
Thanks, man.

213
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,130
他刚才到底说了什么
What did he say?

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,020
我觉得我们应该见面好好谈谈
Look, I think we should meet and talk.

215
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,930
-就我们俩  -就像约会一样吗
- Just the two of us. - What, like a date?

216
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,610
是啊
Yes...

217
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,160
不
No.

218
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,830
听着  游戏结束了
Look, the game is over.

219
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,020
我得说你我确实不分伯仲
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

220
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,780
既然现在一切都结束了
And now that it's over,

221
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,940
我真的觉得我们应该好好谈谈
I really think that we should talk.

222
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,850
停战  不带武器  不玩花招
You know, a truce. No weapons, no tricks.

223
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,190
就谈谈
Just talk.

224
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,040
然后各行其道
Then we both walk away.

225
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,360
谈谈  谈什么
Talk. About what?

226
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,420
谈谈这一切
Well... everything.

227
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,410
我想我们都需要有个了结  不是吗
I think we both could use a little closure, don't you?

228
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,880
就在今天  现在
It has to be today. You know, now.

229
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,830
我时间有点紧
I'm kind of pressed for time.

230
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,210
我怎么知道能否相信你呢
How do I know I can trust you?

231
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,570
都到现在了就别胆小了  派翠克
Ah, don't be timid now, Patrick.

232
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,710
我有那么多机会杀你  却都没下手  不是吗
I could have killed you many times, and I haven't, have I?

233
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,340
好吧  时间  地点
Okay. When and where?

234
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
非常好
Excellent.

235
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,720
半小时后弗里蒙特公园的喷泉边见
I'll be at the Fremont Park fountain in half an hour.

236
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,470
不行  我不知道那个地方  中央汽车站见
No. Don't know it. Central bus station.

237
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,810
-北入口  -不行  那里人太多
- North entrance. - Nah, There's too many people.

238
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,920
而且警察太多
There's too many cops.

239
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,970
你知道亚历山大公墓吗
You know Alexandria Cemetery?

240
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,050
我当然知道
Of course I do.

241
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,040
西门那边有个小教堂
Yeah, there's a chapel by the western gate.

242
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,620
行啊  半小时之后见
That--that'll do. Half an hour.

243
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,290
别迟到  我不能待太久
Don't be late. I can't wait around.

244
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,430
半小时之后见
Half an hour.

245
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,090
他说什么
What'd he say?

246
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,030
他想见我
He wants to meet with me.

247
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,330
这是个陷阱
It's a trap.

248
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,100
可能吧
Probably.

249
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,390
你准备怎么办
Well, what are you gonna do?

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,900
我去见他
I'm gonna meet him.

251
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,930
不行
You can't.

252
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,880
相信我  我知道自己在干什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

253
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,750
简  别去  你想想
Jane, don't do this. Think about it.

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,190
联调局马上就要抓到伯特仑了
The F.B.I. is gonna get Bertram soon enough.

255
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,130
我不想他落在联调局手上
I don't want the F.B.I. to get him.

256
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,790
你知道这一天早晚会来
You knew this day was coming.

257
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,110
就是今天了
It's here.

258
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,120
那我和你一起去
Let me come with you.

259
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,600
不行  我不想让你牵扯进来
No, I don't want you involved.

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,140
牵扯  我早就深陷其中了
Involved? I am involved.

261
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,090
不能再这样了
Not anymore.

262
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,100
我要借你的枪
I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

263
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,780
我的枪
My gun?

264
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,920
是  你的枪  我不会开枪的
Yes, your gun. I'm not gonna use it.

265
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,030
就是壮壮胆
Just a prop.

266
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,330
特蕾莎  请你相信我
Teresa, trust me, please.

267
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,430

谢谢
Thank you.

269
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,640
那边吧
Like that way.

270
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,770
谢了
Thanks.

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,860
疑犯逃跑
The suspect got moved.

272
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,900
负责人呢  艾伯特在哪儿
Where's the man in charge here? Where is Abbott?

273
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,040
跪下
Get down on your knees.

274
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,690
把手举到我能看见的地方
Keep your hands where I can see them.

275
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,410
艾伯特在哪儿  我必须得走了
Where is Abbott? I-I have to go.

276
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,350
好了  淡定点  伙计们
All right, take it down a notch, people.

277
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
他又不是阿尔·卡彭
He's not Al Capone.

278
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
{\an8}著名黑帮老大

279
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,700
艾伯特  请听我说
Abbott, please listen to me.

280
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,000
我看得出来你是个正人君子
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

281
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,830
我以我的名誉发誓  我一小时之后就回去自首
On my honor, I will give myself up in an hour.

282
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,650
但是现在  我...  我要
But right now I just-- I just need...

283
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,780
只要
Just...

284
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,760
算了
Forget it.

285
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,970
别别别  告诉我
No. No, no, no, no. No, tell me.

286
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,860
起来
Come on.

287
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,950
你要干什么  你需要什么
No, what do you need? What do you need, huh?

288
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,420
你需要一小时
You need an hour?

289
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,100
干什么
For what?

290
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,920
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

291
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,170
去见谁
Who are you gonna go meet?

292
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,710
不说吗
No?

293
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,230
那回局里说怎么样
Well, let's take a trip downtown, shall we?

294
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,210
没事  让她过来吧
No. You can let her go.

295
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,270
你好  里斯本女士
Hi, Miss Lisbon.

296
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,400
就算是咱们两个警察间帮个忙  艾伯特
Do me this one favor, Abbott, cop to cop.

297
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,910
放他走  我发誓到时候一定把他带回来
Let him go, and I swear I will bring him back later.

298
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,360
不可能
Not happening.

299
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,580
你们到底有什么紧急的事
And what is all this urgency I'm hearing here?

300
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,020
你们是跟伯特仑有约吧
You made a plan with Bertram.

301
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,790
是吗  是这样吗
Is that it? Is that what you did?

302
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,410
拜托了  艾伯特
Please, Abbott.

303
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,500
联调局  退后
FBI! Back it off!

304
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,690
-加调局  你给我退后  -怎么回事
- CBI. Back it up yourself. - What's this?

305
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,390
放他走  艾伯特  他什么也没做错
Let him go, Abbott. He's done nothing wrong.

306
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,620
好啊  各位
Hey, guys.

307
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,430
很高兴见到你们
You know, I-it's good to see you.

308
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,030
我本来不想打击你们的  但加调局已经不存在了
I hate to bring you down, but there is no CBI.

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,610
你们的警徽就是个玩具
That badge is a toy,

310
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,040
而你们只是在假扮警察
and you're all impersonating officers of the law.

311
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,470
随你怎么说  放他走
Whatever. Let him go.

312
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,920
你是缠上我了是吗
Are you mad-dogging me right now?

313
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,470
缠上联调局了
The F.B.I.?

314
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,610
你说你是真的联调局探员  有什么证据
You say you're legit F.B.I., but how do we know?

315
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,200
对  你们也许是布莱克组织的成员
Yeah, you could be members of the Blake Association

316
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,660
也不是没可能
for all we know.

317
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
我们不是
We're not.

318
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,030
拿出证明来
Prove it.

319
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,960
你的手下里德·史密斯就是其中之一
Your man Reede Smith was a member.

320
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
你为什么不可能是
Why not you?

321
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
而且我们怎么知道简会不会有危险
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

322
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,520
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

323
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,770
抱歉 艾伯特探员
I'm sorry, Agent Abbott,

324
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,610
但是在确保他的安全之前
but it is our duty to protect this man

325
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,000
保护好他是我们的责任
until we're assured his safety.

326
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,990
放他走
Let him go.

327
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,560
别这样  别这样
No, no, no, no, no.

328
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,950
没事的  放下枪
It's all right. Just stand down.

329
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,020
各位都放下枪  没必要起冲突
Stand down, guys. No bloodshed required.

330
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,340
没事的
It's cool.

331
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,250
让他走
Let him go.

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,980
开我的车
Take my car.

333
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,760
长官
Sir?

334
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,960
没关系  让他走
It's okay.

335
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,060
谢谢各位了
Thank you, guys!

336
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,280
没事了
We done?

337
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,110
他走了  就没事了
He's gone. We're done.

338
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,870
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

339
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,450
把你们的枪都放到地上
Put your guns down on the ground...

340
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,720
慢慢地
slowly.

341
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,770
照他说的做
Do as he says.

342
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,700
去追踪里斯本探员的车
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

343
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,840
是  长官
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,570
你在我车上装了追踪器
You put a bug on my car?

345
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,610
要不我们怎么能找到简
How do you think we found Jane?

346
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,150
我说过认识你们这些人我很高兴
I said I was glad to see you people

347
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,700
因为我知道你们早晚要出篓子
because I knew you would screw up

348
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,760
能省我不少事
and make my life easy.

349
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,910
你们这不就照做了吗
And you did just that.

350
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,540
谢谢
Thank you.

351
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,740
逮捕她
Arrest her.

352
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,820
走吧
Come on.

353
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,370
他还没准备好呢
He wasn't ready for it.

354
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,740
没错
No.

355
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
瞧啊
Check it out.

356
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,830
瞧瞧这个
Check this out.

357
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,060
你好吗
What's up?

358
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,170
能帮我看会儿车吗
Uh, could you guys keep an eye on my car for me, please?

359
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,880
当然了  会看好的
Sure, I'll watch it.

360
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,040
谢谢
Thank you.

361
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,210
动手
Let's go.

362
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,100
好  伙计  别担心
Yeah, man, no worries.

363
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,780
等等
Hey there.

364
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,600
抱歉麻烦你了  女士
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

365
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,010
说来话长
Uh, long story.

366
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,830
你愿不愿意载我一程
Uh, I need--I need a ride, if you're willing.

367
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,590
这里是四队  我们发现目标车辆了
This is Unit 4. We have the vehicle in sight,

368
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,860
停在第五大道和谢尔曼街交会处
stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

369
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,530
退后  先退后  他们可能就在那儿接头
Stay back, stay back. This could be the meet.

370
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,340
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

371
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,780
四队  什么情况
Unit 4, what's the situation?

372
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,140
四队  回答  该死的
Unit 4, respond, damn it.

373
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,070
头儿  里斯本车里就几个孩子
Boss, it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

374
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,450
简不在里面
Jane wasn't there.

375
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,640
没有发现简  重复  我们没发现简
We don't have Jane. Repeat. We don't have Jane.

376
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,510
是否收...
Do you co--

377
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,780
别再越错越多了
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

378
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,350
他去哪儿了
Where did he go?

379
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,840
不知道
I don't know.

380
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,820
你们是不见棺材不落泪是吧
You guys really have a death wish, don't you?

381
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,080
长官  我们真的不知道
Sir, we really don't know.

382
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,080
长官  你居然还叫他长官
"Sir"? Why the hell are you calling him "Sir"?

383
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,560
别激动  "头号公敌"
Oh, calm down, Dillinger.

384
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,560
{\an8}约翰.迪林杰是萧条时期联调局追捕的最著名的黑帮头目  曾两度越狱

385
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,440
我们现在是阶下囚  还是识相点吧
We're under arrest here. We might as well be civil.

386
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,550
干嘛  你以为能弄到个好点的牢房
Why? You think you'll get a nicer cell?

387
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,520
非常感谢[西语]  奥雷利奥
Muchas gracias, Aurelio.

388
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,710
别客气  祝你好运[西语]
De nada. Buena suerte.

派翠克
Hey, Patrick.

392
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,430
得先得搜搜你身上有没有武器
I'm gonna need to search you for weapons.

393
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,510
然后你才能进去  把手举起来
So you can go ahead, put your hands up.

394
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,330
试下也无妨
Worth a shot.

395
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,120
你可以进去了
You can go in now.

396
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,790
派翠克
Patrick.

397
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,510
谢谢你这么准时
Thank you for being so punctual.

398
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,800
你骗了我
You lied to me.

399
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,690
你不也是
Oh. Well... as did you.

400
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,340
我们还真是俩无赖  对吧
What a couple of scamps we are, huh?

401
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,180
我保证  这是最后一次骗你了
I promise that is the last lie that I will ever tell you.

402
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,500
先说正事
So... first things first.

403
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,520
你和联调局犯了个严重的错误
You and the feds have made a big mistake.

404
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,150
我不是血腥约翰
I'm not Red John.

405
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,260
你说什么
What?

406
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,470
我不是血腥约翰
I'm not Red John.

407
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,010
很抱歉让你失望了
I-I'm sorry to disappoint you,

408
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,660
但是我只是布莱克组织
but I'm just a humble foot soldier

409
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,890
一员卑微走卒罢了
in the Blake Association.

410
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,470
血腥约翰可是高层
Red John is one of the top brass.

411
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,310
我不是很相信你
I'm not sure I believe you.

412
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,300
信不信是你的权利  但
Well... that's your privilege, but--

413
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,060
但是我说的是真的
But I am telling you the truth.

414
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,610
你们的结论都是错的
You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.

415
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,310
那么谁是血腥约翰
Okay, so who is Red John?

416
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,900
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

417
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,240
真的
No, h-honestly.

418
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,840
不知道
No idea.

419
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,720
组织严格遵循的原则是只须知道必需的信息
The association works on a strictly need-to-know basis.

420
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,190
假设你说的是真的
Supposing what you say is true,

421
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,610
那么我们完全可以在电话里说
then we could have had this talk on the phone.

422
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,270
但是如果我们在电话里说
Yeah, but if we talked on the phone,

423
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,870
那你  你可能就不会来见我了
Then you... you probably wouldn't have come to meet me,

424
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,990
不是吗
Would you?

425
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,930
我接到命令要打电话给你
And I was told to call you,

426
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,040
告诉你游戏结束  安排和你见面
tell you the game's over, and arrange a meeting.

427
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,130
为什么
Why?

428
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,460
为什么要我过来
Why am I here?

429
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,110
请你千万不要以为
Please... don't think for a moment

430
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,650
我乐意这么做
that I am happy about this.

431
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,880
组织不想有遗留问题
The association doesn't like loose ends.

432
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,040
他们讨厌留下把柄
Just hates them.

433
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,550
所以
So...

434
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,270
动手吧  奥斯卡
Go on, Oscar.

435
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,790
别  别  听着  听着
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,250
我们谈谈  等等
Let's--let's talk about this. Just... w-wait.

437
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,860
我很抱歉  这不是我能决定的
Now I am truly sorry, but it is totally out of my hands.

438
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,540
我一直都很喜欢你  派翠克
I always liked you, Patrick.

439
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,350
别  别  不需要这么做
No. No. This is not necessary.

440
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,560
我们不
We don't--don't--

441
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,820
什...
H-hey...wh-

442
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,330
谢谢  奥斯卡
Thank you, Oscar.

443
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,640
你可以出去等着了  就...
You can wait outside. Just, uh...

444
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
确保没人来打扰我们
Make sure we're left in peace.

445
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,610
你好  派翠克
Hello, Patrick.

446
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,360
你好
Hi.

447
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,460
现在什么情况
Hey, what's going on?

448
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,010
格蕾斯  你在干
Grace, what are you--

449
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,450
你  别这么做
What--please don't do that.

450
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,510
你还不如周呢
You're worse than Cho.

451
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,140
他们必须告诉我们到底怎么了
They need to tell us what's going on.

452
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,120
他们不需要做任何事
They don't need to do anything.

453
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,460
我们也什么都做不了  行行好就放松点吧
And we can't do anything, so please just relax.

454
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,500
放松  我怎么放松得下来
Relax? How can I relax?

455
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,250
你有时候表现的好像你很享受无助感
You know, sometimes I think you like being helpless.

456
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,140
好了  我收回  别放松
Okay, fine, I take it back. Don't relax.

457
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,340
就用额头把车窗撞破
Just break the window with your forehead

458
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,420
我们就可以跳车跑了
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it.

459
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,370
伙计们  团结一点好吗
Guys, let's try to keep it together, okay?

460
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,170
好的  很抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

461
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,280
"抱歉"
"Sorry."

462
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,410
莫林斯  你是本地人  对吗
Mullins, you're from here, yes?

463
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,680
是的  长官  林肯高地的
Yes, sir. Over to Lincoln Heights.

464
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
-给我弄一张萨克拉门托的地图  -是  长官
- Get me a map of Sacramento. - Yes, sir.

465
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,270
车里的电脑上就有
There's one on the computer in the car.

466
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,770
纸质地图
Paper map.

467
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,930
纸质  地图
Paper... map.

468
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,570
快点去找
Come on. Let's go.

469
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,530
你有纸质地图吗
Hey, do you have a paper map?

470
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,910
派翠克  终于又见面了
Well, Patrick, here we are.

471
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,560
可怜的家伙
Poor fella.

472
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,940
说他聪明他又傻
Smart but dumb.

473
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,460
他从来没想到
It never occurred to him

474
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,160
我也是布莱克组织的一员
that I am the Blake Association.

475
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,960
你为什么要杀他
Why'd you have to kill him?

476
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,720
每个人都认为他是血腥约翰  不是吗
Everyone thinks he's Red John, don't they?

477
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,890
所以你们两个同归于尽
So... it would seem a fitting end to the story

478
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,220
会是这个故事完美的结局
if you two were found dead together.

479
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,770
没人会再深究下去
No one will look any deeper.

480
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,700
所以我也必须死  是吗
So I'm supposed to die, am I?

481
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,390
耗了这么多年
After all these years,

482
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,530
是不是不太公平
seems kind of unfair.

483
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,470
很公平
It's totally fair.

484
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,220
游戏结束  我赢了
The game's over, and I won.

485
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,060
这可不是游戏
It's not a game.

486
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,070
有人输  有人赢  这就是游戏
There's a winner and a loser. That's a game.

487
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,120
我可没要玩这个游戏
It's not a game I asked to play.

488
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,190
即使如此  你还是玩得很好
No, but you played it very well nonetheless.

489
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,250
你很有趣  很有挑战性  谢谢
You were fun, challenging. Thank you.

490
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,690
你肯定有很多问题想问我把
You probably have a lot of questions for me, huh?

491
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,270
我们多得是时间  想问就问吧
We have time, if you want.

492
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,980
我没什么要问的
I have no questions.

493
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,680
你是个邪恶  性变态的反社会人渣
You're an evil, sexually perverted sociopath

494
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,860
还很可悲地妄自尊大
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

495
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
本质如此  其余的只是细节罢了
The rest is just details.

496
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,320
邪恶  性变态的反社会人渣
"Evil, sexually perverted sociopath"?

497
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,610
这一点我到是承认  但是
Well, I guess I have to own that, but, uh...

498
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,380
妄自尊大
"delusions of grandeur"?

499
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,440
我不承认
No.

500
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,920
我从没有妄想
I have no delusions.

501
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,240
我建立了这个地下帝国
I built a secret empire.

502
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,150
我控制着千万人的生命
I control the lives of thousands of people.

503
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,840
我说的话可以决定生死
My word is life and death,

504
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,220
却没有人知道我是谁
and nobody knows who I am.

505
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,050
如果这还不算伟大
Now if that's not grandeur,

506
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,420
那你说算什么
I don't know what you call it.

507
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,330
我会说这是卑鄙的自大狂的胡言乱语
I'd call it the ravings of a squalid egomaniac.

508
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,840
瞧
You see?

509
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,540
你总是这样没来由地粗鲁  目空一切
For no reason at all, you... you're rude and contemptuous.

510
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,410
这就是害死你老婆孩子的原因
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

511
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,730
你又有什么资格
Who are you to butt in here

512
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,740
在这对我评头论足
and make obnoxious judgments about me?

513
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,760
你算什么
Who are you?

514
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,500
你算得上什么
Who are you?

515
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,560
谁也算不上
Nobody.

516
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,060
谁也算不上
Nobody.

517
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,990
你以前不了解我
You didn't know me.

518
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,730
现在也不了解我
You don't know me.

519
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,990
你一无所知
You have no idea.

520
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,810
派  你的问题在于
Here's your problem, Pat.

521
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,390
你很聪明  但是太傲慢
You're a smart man, but you are arrogant.

522
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,920
你想不到别人会比你聪明
You can't imagine someone smarter than you.

523
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,770
这就是为什么每一步
Which is why I've been ahead of you

524
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,260
我都能抢在你前面
at every step along the way.

525
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,370
你有枪  想自吹自擂
You're holding the gun. You want to brag?

526
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,300
尽管吹吧  我不会阻止你
Go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you.

527
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,050
你还是不知道我怎么骗过你的  是吗
You still don't know how I fooled you, do you?

528
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,120
我怎么从爆炸中逃脱的
How did I survive that bomb?

529
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,790
我怎么猜出你的名单的
How did I know all the names on your list?

530
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,650
你一直缺少的就是这个对吧  有人能欣赏你
Is this what you've been missing? Appreciation?

531
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,640
想让我为你喝彩吗
Do you want me to applaud?

532
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,530
你一无所知  是吗
You have no idea, do you?

533
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,400
我不知道你是怎么猜到嫌疑人名单的
I don't know how you got the list of suspects.

534
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,940
干得漂亮
That was a good trick.

535
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,310
但是炸弹那事很简单
But the bomb gag is simple.

536
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,590
有两次爆炸
There were two explosions.

537
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,990
第一次是个震央炸弹  为了把所有人炸晕
The first was a concussion bomb, knocked everyone out.

538
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,990
第二个
The second

539
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,770
才是那个炸死哈弗内和斯特尔斯的致命炸弹
lethal bomb that killed Haffner and Stiles

540
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,810
你把我  伯特仑和史密斯
only went off after you dragged Bertram,

541
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,270
拖出爆炸伤害范围之后才引爆的
Smith and me out of harm's way.

542
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,610
没错
Correct.

543
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,180
伪造你的死亡就更简单了
Faking your own death was easy.

544
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,060
布雷特·帕特里奇是布莱克组织的
Brett Partridge was Blake Association.

545
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,340
他可以接触到原始DNA数据库
His job gave him access to the primary D.N.A. database.

546
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,050
他把你的DNA记录
He switched your D.N.A. Records

547
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,310
和你留着的一具尸体的记录对调了
with a body that you had on ice.

548
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,570
一具替代品
A surrogate.

549
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,690
你用把尸体放在汽车后备箱
And you brought the body to my house

550
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,840
带到了我家
in the trunk of your car

551
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,990
然后把尸体放在哈弗内和斯特尔斯旁边
and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

552
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,170
很好
Very good.

553
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,120
好个出色的事后诸葛亮
Your hindsight is 20/20.

554
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,090
能给你看件东西吗
Can I show you something?

555
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,830
当然
Sure.

556
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,240
面包屑
Bread crumbs?

557
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
鸟
Birds.

558
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,080
真聪明
Very clever.

559
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,630
炸弹是你犯的一个错误
The bomb was a mistake.

560
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,640
是你演的一出戏
It was theater.

561
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,950
我知道不管事实看起来如何
I knew that whatever the truth looked like,

562
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,720
与之相反的才是真相
The opposite must be true.

563
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,740
求你别
Please don't.

564
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,590
别杀我
Don't kill me.

565
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,700
现在你来祈求宽恕了
Oh, now you want mercy?

566
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,100
在你犯下那么多恶行之后
After all you've done?

567
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,860
你和我不一样
You're not like me.

568
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,780
你是个好人
You're a good man.

569
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,930
杀了我  你会饱受折磨
It'll haunt you.

570
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,520
我可不是在犹豫
Oh, I'm not hesitating.

571
