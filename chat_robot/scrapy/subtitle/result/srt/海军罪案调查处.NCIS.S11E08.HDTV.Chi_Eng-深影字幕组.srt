00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,395
达克 我这边结束了
All right, Ducky, I'm done.

5
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,562
谢谢 蒂姆
Thank you, Tim.

6
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,485
可怜的小东西
You poor dear.

7
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,305
戴着耳机都没有听到车开过来吧
Probably didn't even hear it coming.

8
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,525
托尼在哪里呢?
Hey, where's Tony?

9
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:42,976
我不知道
I don't know.

10
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,278
我本来说要载他一程
I offered to give him a lift,

11
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,313
但是他说有人会去接他
but he said someone would pick him up.

12
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,814
从哥伦比亚特区开到昆迪克吗?
From DC to Quantico?

13
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,616
我也觉得很奇怪
Sounded strange to me, too.

14
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,502
没有车真不知道他是怎么活的
I don't know how he's surviving without a car.

15
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,922
是他吗?
Is that him?

16
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,040
不 是黛利拉
No. It's Delilah.

17
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,876
我们正计划溜出去度过一个漫长周末呢
We're talking about sneaking away for a long weekend.

18
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:00,294
真有你的
Nice.

19
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,212
你们要是墨迹完了
If you hens are finished,

20
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:03,881
就过来帮忙
I could do with some help.

21
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,016
好的
Oh, yes.

22
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:08,385
她的身份是下士乔迪・雷
Her name's Petty Officer Third Class Jody Ray.

23
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:10,554
巡逻队日出时分发现了她的尸体
Patrol spotted her body just after sunrise.

24
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:12,005
她在基地诊所工作
She works at the base clinic.

25
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,941
昨晚九点打卡下班
Punched out just after 2100 last night.

26
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,442
然后就出来跑步了吗?
And she went for a run?

27
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,844
同事说她正在进行马拉松训练
Coworker said she was training for a marathon.

28
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,397
几个月来几乎每晚都在跑步
Had been running almost every night for the past few months.

29
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,782
通知亲属了吗?
Next of kin been notified?

30
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,367
伤亡援助电话处的人正在通知 长官
CACO team is on it, sir.

31
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:25,685
知道了 谢谢
All right, thanks.

32
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,024
很高兴看到你来了 迪诺左
Nice of you to join us, DiNozzo.

33
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,576
抱歉迟到了
Yeah, sorry.

34
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,212
嘿 吉米
Hey, Jimmy.

35
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,299
我错过什么没有?
So, what did I miss?

36
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,427
是谁大老远开车送你过来的?
Who was it that drove you all the way over here?

37
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:45,672
一个朋友
A friend.

38
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,374
别打马虎眼 
No, seriously.

39
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,708
真的只是一个朋友
Seriously.

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,561
我有什么工作 拍照吗?
What should I do, photograph?

41
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,878
不用 我已经做完了
No, I already did it.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,815
好吧
gh. All right.

43
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,217
达克?
Duck?

44
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:02,055
死亡时间 昨天晚上十点左右
Last night, 2200 hours,or thereabouts.

45
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,236
嘿 艾比
Hey, Abbs.

46
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,737
有什么发现吗?
Come up with anything?

47
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,289
有点进展
Making progress.

48
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,961
你看 这块碎片是车头灯零件的一部分
Look, okay, this is a part of the vehicle's headlight assembly.

49
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,245
厂商和型号?
What's the make and model?

50
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:29,967
全国有四十七家汽车生产商
There are 47 manufacturers of cars and trucks in the United States.

51
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,936
每一家都有好多型号和风格
Each one of those produces multiple models and body styles.

52
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:34,805
配件和车饰每隔几年就会推陈出新
And the parts and the trim are redesigned every few years.

53
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,440
有无数种可能性呢
There are zillions of possibilities.

54
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,091
为什么每个人都认为
Why would anyone assume that I could take

55
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,260
通过一块小小的塑料
a teeny, tiny piece of plastic

56
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,362
我就能轻松地辨别出车型呢?
and easily identify a vehicle?

57
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:43,597
厂商和型号?
What's the make and model?

58
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,225
是一辆零三至零五年生产的
A 2003 to a 2005

59
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,101
道奇公羊敞篷小卡车
Dodge Ram pickup truck.

60
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,870
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

61
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,438
但是还是得缩小范围才行
But we're going to have to narrow it down.

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,990
基地里面每天都有上百辆卡车来来回回
There's hundreds of trucks on that base every day.

63
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:54,791
我正打算这么做呢 你就来打断我了
That's what I was doing when you interrupted me.

64
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:57,766
下士雷的手表上面蹭上了
So, there was a trace of the vehicle's paint

65
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,997
肇事车辆的一点油漆
on Petty Officer Ray's watch.

66
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,281
可能是这两种颜色
These are our color choices.

67
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,966
上面的是烈焰红
On the top we have Inferno Red.

68
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,118
下面的是深熔融红
And the bottom we have Deep Molten Red.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,420
真不知道是谁想出这些名字的
I don't know who comes up with these names.

70
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,971
你认为呢?
What do you think?

71
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,587
我觉得上面的比较符合
I'm going to have to go with the top one.

72
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:10,592
我也这么认为
Agreed.

73
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:15,512
烈焰红只有零五至零八年有生产
So Inferno Red was only available between 2005 and 2008.

74
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,390
所以结合车灯和颜色 
So the only year in common

75
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,017
唯一符合的年份就是零五年
between the headlight lens and the color is 2005.

76
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,385
因此 我们要找的是一辆
Ergo we are looking for

77
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,971
零五年产的红色道奇公羊敞篷小卡车
a red 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

78
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,473
艾比 你是最棒的
Abby, you are the best.

79
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,191
你还是想当然
Still taken for granted.

80
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:31,028
听起来很简单 实际很难的
Just 'cause I make it look easy doesn't mean it is.

81
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,664
为什么认为
Why do you suspect

82
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,947
上士贾斯汀・邓恩有嫌疑?
Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne?

83
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,991
艾比根据厂商 型号 颜色
Abby I.D.'d the make, model and color

84
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,451
定位了肇事逃逸的卡车
of the hit-and-run vehicle.

85
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:40,287
基地里面只有一辆卡车符合条件 车主是邓恩
Only one registered on base and it belongs to Dunne.

86
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,872
我检查了大门的安检录像
I checked the gate security footage.

87
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:43,423
他的车昨天晚上没有离开过昆迪克 
His truck never left Quantico last night.

88
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,709
- 他的个人情况? - 单身
- What do we know about him? - Single.

89
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,210
高中毕业就参军
Joined the Corps right out of high school.

90
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,378
是一名直升机修理工
He's a helo mechanic.

91
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,431
原定本周末参加地中海两栖登陆
Scheduled to deploy on an LHA to the Med, later this week.

92
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,000
最可疑的是...
And most pertinent...

93
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,686
他有醉酒驾车的记录
he has a DUI in his past.

94
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,337
把他带过来
Bring him in.

95
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,142
我好喜欢案件进展神速
I love it when it all comes together so quickly.

96
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,144
我可不是 弄得我很紧张
Not me. Makes me nervous.

97
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:05,529
有点过于容易
Too easy.

98
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,281
我们走吧
Let's go.

99
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:09,700
你打算永远都不买新车了吗?
You ever going to get a new car?

100
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,185
首先 我从来没有买过新车
Well, firstly, I never buy new cars.

101
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,788
其次 我需要的是能够点燃我热情的东西
Secondly, I need something that ignites my passions.

102
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,206
这就跟女人一样
It's like a woman.

103
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,208
在许下承诺之前总要先坠入爱河吧
I need to be in love before I commit.

104
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,911
这么说你从来没有跟女人许诺过了
You've never committed to a woman.

105
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,387
军士邓恩 我们是海军罪案调查处
Sergeant Dunne. NCIS.

106
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,393
军士邓恩!
Sergeant Dunne!

107
00:05:41,432 --> 00:05:44,050
不许动 海军罪案调查处
Freeze. NCIS.

108
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,046
没错 这是我的车 但是
Yeah, that's my truck, but

109
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:59,182
我发誓不知道它怎么成这样子了
I swear, I don't know how it got that way.

110
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,634
- 你昨天晚上没有开吗? - 没有
- You didn't drive it last night? - No.

111
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,302
我好几天没开车了
I haven't used the truck in a couple of days.

112
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:04,796
那你怎么上班? 
How do you get to work?

113
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,439
走路 可以锻炼身体
I walk. Need the exercise.

114
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,708
维修站离我的住处没多远
The maintenance bay isn't that far from my quarters.

115
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,276
昨天晚上十点你在哪里?
Where were you last night, 2200 hours?

116
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:13,112
在我房间里面... 睡觉
I was in my room... asleep.

117
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,730
这周很难熬
Had a tough week.

118
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,115
简直是筋疲力尽
I was exhausted.

119
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,400
你确定昨天晚上自己没有喝醉
You sure you weren't drunk

120
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,569
然后把自己做过什么都忘得一干二净?
and you just don't remember what you did?

121
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,454
我们知道你曾经醉酒驾车
We know about your DUI.

122
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:23,489
我已经十三个月滴酒不沾了
I've been sober for 13 months.

123
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,357
我每周都要去互助会三四次
I go to three or four meetings a week.

124
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,910
如果你是无辜的 昨天晚上没有开车 
So, if you weren't driving the pickup and you're innocent,

125
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:29,962
为什么要跳窗逃跑?
why were you climbing out a window?

126
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,001
我知道自己的基本权利
I know my rights.

127
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,766
见到律师之前 我不会再说一个字
I'm not saying any more until I have a lawyer.

128
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,471
好的
Okay.

129
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,755
你可以叫自己的律师
Then you can have the lawyer of your choice

130
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:43,042
或者法官为你指定一位
or JAG will assign one to you.

131
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,931
嘿 麦基
Hey, McGee.

132
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,683
军士邓恩的右脚靴子带来了吗?
Did you bring me Sergeant Dunne's right boot?

133
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,865
抱歉 艾比 他走律师程序了 
Sorry, Abbs, he lawyered up

134
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:53,819
不允许我们搜查
and didn't give a permissive search.

135
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,856
那你有仔细看他的脚吗?
Hmm. Well, did you get a good look at his feet?

136
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:57,109
什么?
Huh?

137
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,879
你在现场做的脚印模型
Well, the footprint that you cast at the crime scene,

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,432
是标准的海军陆战队战斗靴
it's a standard-issue Marine Corps combat boot,

139
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,579
十号半
size ten and a half.

140
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:05,581
我猜他可能穿这个号码
Well, I guess he might wear that size.

141
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,061
鞋子磨损得很厉害 
It's well worn

142
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,868
并在右跟处有独特的裂缝
and has a very distinctive gash in the right heel.

143
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,504
我真的很想跟军士邓恩比对一下
I'd just really love to match it to Sergeant Dunne.

144
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,072
那得等到明天早上了
Well, you're going to have to wait till morning.

145
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:14,290
这里有什么发现吗?
Any luck here?

146
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,043
这就是我们要找的卡车
Oh, this is definitely the pickup truck.

147
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,712
轮胎跟现场泥中的车轮印吻合
The tires match the tracks that were in the dirt.

148
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,465
车辆前端找到的头发 血渍 衣物纤维
And I got hair, blood and clothing fibers

149
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,433
也跟受害者吻合
off the front end that match our victim.

150
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,469
早上就能拿到DNA结果
So, I'll get DNA confirmation in the morning,

151
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,970
那就铁证如山了
and we should have it locked up.

152
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:31,357
太好了
Great.

153
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,694
嘿 自从托尼车子坏掉以后
Hey, have you been giving Tony rides to work

154
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,145
你有接他上班吗?
since his car was wrecked?

155
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,763
没有
No.

156
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,266
今天早上有人
Somebody dropped him off

157
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,268
大老远送他到昆迪克 
all the way out at Quantico this morning.

158
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,036
他是不是在和谁约会?
Is he dating someone?

159
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,439
哦... 我可不这么认为
Oh... I don't think so.

160
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,042
哼
Hmm.

161
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:54,797
你闻起来总是那么迷人
You always smell so great.

162
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,966
让我猜猜 你今年肯定又错过
Let me guess, you missed the sexual harassment meeting

163
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,351
性骚扰大会
again this year.

164
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,586
嘿 大伙 看我在大厅里面发现了谁
Hey, everybody, look who I found in the lobby.

165
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:01,854
嘿 克拉克
Hey, Clark.

166
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,090
- 嘿 伙计们 - 早上好 凯莉
- Hey, guys. - Morning, Carrie.

167
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,475
真不敢相信我有这个荣幸
I don't think I've had the pleasure.

168
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:07,459
马拉德医生
Dr. Mallard,

169
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,795
这位是联邦调查局前任探员凯莉・克拉克

现在从事个人律师业务
Now in private law practice.

171
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:11,931
很高兴见到你 医生
Nice to meet you, Doctor.

172
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,799
- 我也是 - 凯莉几年前
- Likewise. - Carrie worked

173
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,685
负责诺福克郡那边港务局的案件
the Norfolk side of the Port Authority case

174
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,703
让福内尔看起来容光焕发了都
a few years ago, made Fornell look good.

175
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,854
磨人的工作
It was a tough job.

176
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,472
不 你们做得更好
No, you guys made it easy.

177
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,441
我不记得那个案件了
I don't remember that case.

178
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:23,809
达克 重窃罪的案件
Grand theft, Ducky,

179
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,912
啊
Ah.

180
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:28,147
什么风把你吹来了海军罪案调查处?
What brings you to NCIS?

181
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,832
我来见上士邓恩
I'm here to see Sergeant Dunne.

182
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:32,952
你是他的代表律师吗?
You're his lawyer?

183
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:34,154
告诉我们这不是事实 
Say it ain't so.

184
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,154
是的 他在哪里?
Yes, where is he?

185
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,590
上士邓恩就在穿过大厅的拘留室内
Staff Sergeant Dunne's in a holding cell across the yard.

186
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:38,924
探员麦基可以带你去见他
Agent McGee can take you to him.

187
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:39,826
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,010
很高兴见到你们
Good to see you guys.

189
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,181
- 再见 - 达克
- Bye. - Duck,

190
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,350
可以随时开始解剖海军士官雷的尸体了
you can release Petty Officer Ray's body any time

191
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,801
你已经准备好
you're ready.

192
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:51,003
老大 你有没察觉到凯莉有什么不一样吗?
You notice anything different about Carrie, boss?

193
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,305
没有戴着婚戒
No wedding ring.

194
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:53,939
就告诉过你 丈夫就像是一个手提包
Told you the husband was a handbag.

195
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,642
手提包?
Handbag?

196
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,811
一件挂在你手上但是又无用的东西
Something useless you hang on your arm.

197
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,013
哦
Oh.

198
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,032
嘿 探员福内尔 我是迪诺左
Hey, Agent Fornell, it's DiNozzo.

199
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:05,818
听好 你能不能给我一些内部消息
Listen, can you give me the skinny

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,070
关于迷人的凯莉・克拉克的?
on the ever-fetching Carrie Clark?

201
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,305
你好
Hello.

202
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:27,840
我是凯莉・克拉克
I'm Carrie Clark.

203
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:29,592
希望你别中看不中用
Didn't expect you to look like you do.

204
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:31,644
有什么问题吗?
Is that a problem?

205
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,262
如果你真如我堂弟说的那么厉害的话 没有
Not if you're as good as my cousin said.

206
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,815
好吧 至少我还没有收到过投诉
Well, I haven't had any complaints.

207
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,653
你将会收到几条罪名非常严重的控告
You're about to be arraigned on some very serious charges.

208
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,655
我压根对肇事逃逸这件事情一无所知
I don't know anything about a hit-and-run.

209
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,890
如果真是我的卡车的话 那就是别人开的车
If it was my pickup, someone else was driving.

210
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,575
知道是谁吗?
Any idea who?

211
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,614
贾斯汀 我也想相信你 但是你看起来很紧张
Justin, I want to believe you, but you seem very nervous.

212
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:55,084
你有没有什么要告诉我?
Is there something that you want to tell me?

213
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,005
昨天晚上十点钟你在哪里?
Where were you at 10:00 last night?

214
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,075
那个无关紧要
Doesn't matter.

215
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,260
这个当然重要
Of course it does.

216
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,961
- 我有不在场证明 - 好吧
- I have an alibi. - Okay.

217
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,263
你应该知道的就只有这些
That's all you need to know.	

218
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:10,182
你打不打算告诉我?
Are you going to tell me?

219
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:18,257
好吧 如果这就是你的态度
All right, if that is going to be your attitude,

220
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,475
那不妨我帮你省省钱 如何?
how about I save you some money?

221
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:21,026
军法局会免费帮你安排一位律师
JAG will assign someone to you for free.

222
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,194
等一下
Hold on.

223
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,597
这个房间装有窃听器吗?
Could this room be bugged?

224
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,867
不 不可以 这是不合法的
No, no way, that would be illegal.

225
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,935
你现在有在录下我们的对话吗?
Are you recording our conversation?

226
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,270
没有
No.

227
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,621
你是我的代表律师
You're my lawyer.

228
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:35,107
我说的任何东西 你都不能告诉任何人吗?
Anything I say, you can't tell anyone?

229
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:36,826
我们称之为律师-当事人特权
It's called attorney-client privilege.

230
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,610
你所说的都会被保密
Everything that you say is confidential.

231
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,447
所有的信息都不会被带出这间房间 除非你想
It doesn't leave this room unless you want it to.

232
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,631
作为律师的职业道德规则
Rules of ethics prohibit me

233
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:45,000
也会禁止我向他人透漏我们谈话的内容
from telling anyone what we discuss.

234
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,552
你确定吗?
You sure?

235
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,638
贾斯汀 我向你承诺
I promise you, Justin.

236
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:56,128
那个女孩被杀的时候
When that girl was killed,

237
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,515
我在三十五英里外的福尔斯彻奇市
I was 35 miles away in Falls Church.

238
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,401
你在那里做什么?
And what were you doing there?

239
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,857
把一个家伙刺死
Stabbing a guy to death.

240
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,331
你为什么要查询航班?
Why are you checking airline schedules?

241
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,283
迈阿密?
Miami?

242
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,751
你是不是非要知道所有事情?
Do you have to know everything?

243
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:21,153
是的 已经深深融入我的血液
Yes, it's in my DNA.

244
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,777
好吧 如果我不告诉你 
Well, you're gonna drive me crazy

245
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,990
你肯定会把我烦疯的 所以...
until I tell you, so...

246
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,347
这里已经没有什么工作 
Things are quiet here,

247
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,826
这个案件也将步入结案阶段
this case is wrapping up.

248
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:29,462
我会有几天假期
I've got a few vacation days coming,

249
00:11:29,464 --> 00:11:30,930
所以黛利拉和我正讨论着
so Delilah and I have been talking

250
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,848
去度一个长周末假
about getting away for a long weekend.

251
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,301
麦基 我对此印象深刻
McGee, I'm impressed.

252
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:39,004
迈阿密 南海滩 热店 石蟹
Miami, South Beach, hot clubs, stone crabs.

253
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:40,856
这不像你
It is unlike you.

254
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:44,009
我就知道我应该闭口不谈的
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

255
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,029
哦
Oh.

256
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,364
真短时间
That didn't take long.

257
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,648
你的客户终于醒悟过来了?
Your client come to his senses?

258
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,016
- 谢谢你 - 想要供认了吗?
- Thank you. - Wants to confess?

259
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,318
不
No.

260
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,069
那么 是想要庭内和解吗?
Wants to make a deal, then?

261
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,021
上士邓恩说他是无辜的 
Sergeant Dunne says he's innocent.

262
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,289
无辜的?
Innocent?

263
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,052
我们已经对比过受害现场的车痕 
We've forensically tied his pickup

264
00:11:59,053 --> 00:11:59,875
和他的卡车吻合
to the victim.

265
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,211
当我们想要找他问话的时候 他逃跑了
He ran when we tried to question him.

266
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,029
他声称他有不在场证明
He claims he has an alibi.

267
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,831
好吧 那是什么呢? 我们会去查证
Well, what is it? We'll check it out.

268
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,083
吉布斯 事情没有那么简单
Well, it is not that simple, Gibbs,

269
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,535
这是秘密
he told me in confidence.

270
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:10,836
当事人特权
It's privileged.

271
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:11,870
如果他不愿意亲自告诉你
If he doesn't want to tell you himself,

272
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,705
我无能为力
then my hands are tied.

273
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,208
还有四十八小时 要么控告他 要么释放他
We've got 48 hours to either charge him or let him go.

274
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,896
给我们一点线索
Give us something.

275
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:24,934
好吧 听好 我会自己去查证他的不在场证明
All right, listen, I will go check out his alibi myself

276
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,902
然后我会告知你结果
and I will get back to you.

277
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,241
那个家伙正面临着车祸致死罪
The guy's facing vehicular homicide

278
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,909
还有肇事逃逸罪的控告
and hit-and-run charges.

279
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,444
他还不愿意用不在场证明?
He won't use an alibi?

280
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,663
他是不是疯了?
Is he crazy?

281
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,955
艾比
Abbs.

282
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:57,525
吉布斯... 你真神奇
Gibbs... you're amazing.

283
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,331
你是怎么知道开车的其实是另有其人?
How did you know that someone else was driving the truck?

284
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,250
你发现了什么?
What'd you find?

285
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,801
这比我什么都没发现还要来得有趣
Well, it's more what I didn't find that's interesting.

286
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,837
我的意思是说 在你打给我之前
I mean, before you called, I was just trying

287
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,595
我只是在尝试把死者受害的信息
to match the victim

288
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:11,473
和车辆进行比对
to the vehicle, which I did.

289
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,841
- 然后呢? - 然后当你问我
- But? - But then, when you asked me

290
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,342
有没有可能
if there's a chance that someone

291
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,761
开车的另有其人之后
other than the owner of the truck was driving,

292
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,064
我就收集了车上所有的指纹 没有任何发现
I dusted the whole thing for prints, I didn't find any.

293
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,266
- 只有上士邓恩的吗? - 不是
- Just Staff Sergeant Dunne's? - No.

294
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,819
我的意思是 没有任何指纹 什么都没有
I mean, like none, nada, zip, zilch, nothing.

295
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,855
整辆卡车的表面
Almost the entire surface of the truck

296
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:28,606
几乎都被擦去了指纹...
was wiped clean of fingerprints...

297
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,224
车门把手 方向盘 换挡杆
the door handle, the steering wheel, the gearshift,

298
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,661
座椅调节器 所有的东西
the seat adjuster, everything.

299
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,499
现在 我就想起了我的伯父霍勒斯
Now, I got reminded o-of my Uncle Horace.

300
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,900
他总是忘记东西
He was always losing things

301
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,336
像他的眼镜 钱包 还有钥匙
like his glasses and his wallet and his keys.

302
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,954
很多次都把自己锁在了车里面
He got locked out of his own car so many times

303
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,907
所以他就在自己的车里藏了把钥匙
that he, he hid a key on his car.

304
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,711
然后我就找到了... 这个...
And then I found... this...

305
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,597
...在前轮下面
...under the front wheel well.

306
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,848
也被擦干净了?
Wiped clean?

307
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,718
哦 是的 包括里面的钥匙
Oh, yeah, including the key inside.

308
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,271
这几乎不可能是车主会做的事情
That is hardly something that the owner would do.

309
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,223
开车的另有其人
Someone else was driving the truck.

310
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,976
是的 他们还尽力让它看起来不是那么回事
Yes, and they tried to make it look like they weren't.

311
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,279
谢谢 艾比
Thanks, Abbs.

312
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,603
我不明白为什么人们要跑步健身
I don't understand why people run.

313
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,289
哦 好吧 这是有益健康的
Oh, well, it's therapeutic,

314
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,958
跑步对心血管的健康大有益处
it has great cardiovascular benefits.

315
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,276
而且 可以使得之前的内啡肽发生抽气效应
What's more, it gets the old endorphins pumping.

316
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,130
跟你讲 跑一跑能让我嗨起来
I'll tell you, running gives me a great high.

317
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,582
我指的是司机
I was referring to the driver

318
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,834
肇事逃跑的司机 帕莫先生
running from the scene of the accident, Mr. Palmer.

319
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,836
哦 对的 对的
Oh, yes, yes.

320
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,422
你知道吗 在美国肇事后逃离现场
Did you know that pedestrian hit-and-runs are

321
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,624
发生率非常高?
at an epidemic rate in this country?

322
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,259
将近百分之十一
Nearly 11%

323
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,678
在美国发生的车祸都是
of all traffic accidents in the United States are

324
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,147
肇事逃逸
hit-and-runs.

325
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,231
那位海军士官雷?
That Petty Officer Ray?

326
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,399
是的
Yes.

327
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,984
保留这具尸体再久一点
Hold on to the body for a little while longer,

328
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,018
好吧 达克?
will you, Duck?

329
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,019
你签了释放书
You signed the release.

330
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,103
有什么发生变化吗?
Has something changed?

331
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,489
是的
Yeah.

332
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,475
但是我不知道是什么
But I don't know what.

333
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,495
你好 我是吉布斯
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

334
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,446
我是凯莉・克拉克
Hi, it's Carrie Clark.

335
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,664
哦 凯莉 你有什么发现吗?
Yeah, Carrie, what do you got?

336
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,166
邓恩的不在场证明
Well, Dunne's alibi

337
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,817
查了一下 属实
checks out, it's solid.

338
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,485
- 跟我讲一下 - 我不能
- Mm-hmm, tell me. - I can't.

339
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,320
你要找到真正肇事逃逸的司机
You're going to have to start looking

340
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,039
因为不是我的客户做的
for the real hit-and-run driver because it's not my client.

341
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,092
凯莉 听着 我不能就这样相信你 好吧?
Carrie, look, I can't just take your word for it, okay?

342
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,594
跟我讲点什么
Give me something here.

343
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,956
你要自己查明白 吉布斯
You're gonna have to figure this one out on your own, Gibbs.

344
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,804
杰斯罗 发生什么事情了吗?
Jethro, is something wrong?

345
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,480
似乎今天你要跟我们在一起度过
Looks like you won't be leaving us

346
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,732
亲爱的
today after all, my dear.

347
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,188
麦基
McGee,

348
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,907
追踪一下上一个电话 可以吗?
trace the last call, will you?

349
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,476
你想知道谁打来的吗?
You want me to find out who it was from?

350
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,794
是凯莉・克拉克打来的
It was from Carrie Clark.

351
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:48,195
通常她的名字会出现在这个小窗口
Usually her name comes up on that little window there.

352
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,910
这次没有出现 只有一个号码
This time it didn't; it was just a number.

353
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:54,886
她说什么了吗?
What did she say?

354
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,871
说证实了她客户的不在场证明
Said her client's alibi checked out.

355
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,256
我不相信
I don't believe it.

356
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,839
这是一个公用电话的号码
Well, the number belongs to a pay phone.

357
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:00,893
公用电话?
Pay phone?

358
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,143
我以为现在都没有这东西了
I didn't think there were any left.

359
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:05,096
福尔斯彻奇市 洋槐路三百二十五号
325 Acacia Avenue in Falls Church.

360
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,213
就在图书馆前面
It's in front of the library.

361
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,548
凯莉有手机
Carrie has a cell.

362
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,100
为什么要用公用电话?
Why would she use a pay phone?

363
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,268
不清楚
Not sure.

364
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,220
她知道客户的不在场证明
She knows her client's alibi.

365
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,907
她知道她不能告诉我们
She knows she can't tell us.

366
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,992
你在想什么 老大?
What are you thinking, boss?

367
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,894
凯莉知道我们会好奇
Carrie knows we'll be intrigued,

368
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,080
她知道我们会追踪这个号码
she knows that we'll trace the call.

369
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,748
她是不是给我们留了一个线索?
Did she just drop a bread crumb?

370
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,084
是的 走吧 出发
Yeah. Go. Go on.

371
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,347
这就是那台公用电话
There's the pay phone.

372
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:42,249
为什么凯莉在这里打电话?
Why was Carrie calling from here?

373
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,770
图书馆 五金商店?
Library, hardware store?

374
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:49,256
看 性事良品
Oh, there we go, Great Sexpectations.

375
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,526
我高度怀疑 托尼
I seriously doubt it, Tony.

376
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,513
嘿 有一辆警车
Hey, there's a squad car.

377
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,752
是的 去看看
Yeah, let's check it out.

378
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,574
你发现凯莉离婚了没有?
Did you ever find out if Carrie was divorced?

379
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:08,376
临时分居
Ah. Trial separation.

380
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:09,577
她没有戴着戒指
She's not wearing her ring.

381
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,962
那什么意思你懂的
You know what that means.

382
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,463
结束了
It's over.

383
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,917
嘿
Hey.

384
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,669
海军罪案调查处
NCIS.

385
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,387
特别探员迪诺佐和麦基
Special Agents DiNozzo and McGee.

386
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,122
多克里 杀人案
Dockry, Homicide.

387
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,807
杀人案?
Homicide?

388
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,142
你们在忙什么?
What are you guys up to?

389
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,293
哦 就是溜大街 很无聊的海军任务
Oh, just pounding the pavement, boring Navy stuff.

390
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,646
是的 不像杀人案件这么重要的
Yeah, nothing serious like homicide.

391
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,815
谁死了?
Who's dead?

392
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,151
商店主... 唐尼・沙利文
Store owner... Donny Sullivan.

393
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,569
前天晚上被捅死了
Stabbed to death night before last.

394
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,070
员工昨天早上在楼上卧室
Body was found in the upstairs residence

395
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,272
发现了他的尸体
yesterday morning by an employee.

396
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,474
- 线索呢? - 目前还没有
- Any leads? - Nothing concrete yet.

397
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,809
你们有什么需要吗?
Anything I can help you guys with?

398
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,077
不用 我们要走了
Ah, no, we got to go.

399
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,245
他饿了
He gets hungry.

400
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,114
那倒是 回头见
It's true. See you around.

401
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:50,201
嘿 你们认识一名叫吉布斯的特别探员吗?
Hey, do you guys know a Special Agent Gibbs?

402
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:54,122
认识 我们亲切地管他叫"老大"
Oh, yeah, we affectionately refer to him as "boss."

403
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,374
告诉他希科里的儿子问好
Tell him Hickory's son said hi.

404
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,491
希科里?
Hickory?

405
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,826
他会知道的
He'll know.

406
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,715
商店主的谋杀案几乎与
The storekeeper's murder happened

407
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,516
肇事逃逸同时发生
about the same time as the hit-and-run.

408
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,302
你觉得这个跟邓恩的不在场证明有关吗?
Think this has something to do with Dunne's alibi?

409
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,688
如果邓恩参与了 那么他是怎么 
If Dunne was involved, then how'd he get

410
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,140
从昆迪克到这里来再赶回去的呢?
from Quantico to here and back?

411
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,808
他的卡车没有离开过地下室
His truck never left the base.

412
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,560
我觉得你在迈阿密的热情周末计划
I think your amorous little weekend in Miami

413
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,694
要泡汤了
just went bye-bye.

414
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,279
- 你好 我是吉布斯 - 嘿 老大
- Yeah. Gibbs. - Hey, boss.

415
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:19,864
有关邓恩的不在场证明我们可能有线索了
We might have a lead on Dunne's alibi.

416
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:23,901
尽你可能去查... 要小心 迪诺佐
Find out what you can-- discreetly, DiNozzo.

417
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,037
吉布斯 吉布斯 吉布斯 我跟你说过
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, so I told you that I dusted

418
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,206
我查了整辆卡车 寻找指纹 但是我并没有
the entire truck for prints, but I didn't.

419
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,408
我只是查了一个人会碰到的地方
I only dusted the places that a person would touch,

420
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,043
然后我意识到 如果有人
and then I realized that if someone's going

421
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,162
调整了座位旋转杠杆 并且他们确实调整了
to adjust the seat lever, which they did,

422
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:37,031
他们可能也会调整一下后视镜
they would probably also adjust the rearview mirror.

423
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,383
猜我找到了什么...
And guess what I found...

424
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,885
背面有一个刚印上去的右拇指指纹
a fresh right thumbprint on its backside.

425
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,053
拇指指纹有名字没有?
Thumbprint have a name?

426
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,172
别傻了 吉布斯
Don't be silly, Gibbs,

427
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:46,474
拇指指纹没有名字的
thumbprints don't have names.

428
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,677
人才有名字
People do.

429
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,378
我第一步就是将它和
My first pass was to run it

430
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,714
所有在昆迪克的人员进行对比
against all the personnel at Quantico.

431
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,717
而我做到这里就可以了
And that's all I had to do.

432
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,653
二等兵丹尼尔・克里夫
Private Daniel Cliff.

433
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,244
吉布斯很快就过来
Gibbs will be in, in a minute.

434
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,446
谢谢
Thank you.

435
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,415
你知道他们为什么把我带过来吗?
You know why they brought me over here?

436
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,749
不知道
No.

437
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,900
我告诉他们 在我的律师到场之前
I told them I wouldn't say anything else

438
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,368
我不会说什么别的了
until my lawyer was present.

439
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,421
我查了你的不在场证明
Well, I checked your alibi.

440
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,339
你没有撒谎
You weren't lying.

441
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,758
嘿 你不知道谁在玻璃另一面
Hey, you don't know who's on the other side of that glass.

442
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,409
我们不要再谈这件事情
Let's not discuss it again.

443
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,762
你知道你要做的是什么
You know all you have to.

444
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,930
我是无辜的
I'm innocent.

445
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,967
这个等不到明天早上吗?
Couldn't this have waited till the morning?

446
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,769
不能
Nope.

447
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,106
- 你认识他吗? - 是的
- You know him? - Yeah,

448
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,974
二等兵克里夫... 我见过他
Private Cliff-- I see him around.

449
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,392
你们俩关系好吗?
You two close?

450
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,278
不
No.

451
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:43,448
我们以前一起喝过几次酒
We hung a couple of times back when I was drinking.

452
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,932
那是很久之前的事情
That was a long time ago.

453
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,617
最近见过面吗?
Have you seen each other lately?

454
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:51,322
在洗衣间 娱乐室见过他 就这样
Run into him in the laundry, rec room, that's it.

455
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,291
你允许二等兵克里夫
You give Private Cliff permission

456
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,659
驾驶你的小皮卡了吗?

457
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,829
他妈的 才没有
Hell, no.

458
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,297
这是什么事情?
What was that about?

459
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,170
吉布斯? 好像你找到
Gibbs? Sounds like you have

460
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,555
肇事逃逸的嫌疑人了

461
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:10,224
- 你要释放我的客户吗? - 还不行
- You gonna let my client go? - Not yet.

462
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,592
拜托 他是因为任务
Come on. He's due to deploy.

463
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,094
还没把二等兵克里夫
Haven't brought Private Cliff in

464
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,262
带过来问话呢
for questioning yet.

465
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:15,813
你的四十八小时快用完了
Well, your 48-hour clock is ticking.

466
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,814
如果你明天还没有起诉我的客户
If you don't charge my client

467
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,149
你只能释放他走
by tomorrow, you have to let him go.

468
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,851
你知道吗 发生了一件有趣的事情
You know, a funny thing happened.

469
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,905
引我们去一家福尔斯彻奇的香烟商店
Sent us to a cigar store in Falls Church.

470
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,072
是吗?
Really?

471
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:28,025
是的 那是一个杀人案件的 犯罪现场
Yeah, it was a crime scene, a homicide.

472
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,996
如果你的委托人当晚
If your client wasn't driving his truck

473
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,614
没有开他的卡车
on base the other night,

474
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:37,151
他会不会是在福尔斯彻奇呢?
could he have been in Falls Church?

475
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:43,090
我只关心上士邓恩的权利
My only concern is Sergeant Dunne's rights.

476
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,492
他并没有涉嫌肇事逃逸
He wasn't involved in the hit-and-run.

477
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,137
不置可否

听着 我知道我过去取笑过你
Listen, I know I made fun of you

490
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,767
坐公交车 但是我得承认我错了
in the past for riding the bus, but I have to admit I was wrong.

491
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,352
我一直在用公共交通工具
I've been using public transportation,

492

497
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:48,745
人真的很有趣
People are fascinating.

好吧 托尼 我...

503
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:02,625
毫无所获
I came up empty.

504
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:05,511
他和死了的烟店店主没有丝毫联系
There's no connecting him to the dead cigar-store owner.

505
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,581
他有什么动机去杀那个人呢?
What would his motive be to kill the guy?

506
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,466
我发现邓恩和一个马里兰州的
Did find out Dunne exchanged a lot of calls

507

告诉福尔斯彻奇的警察

513
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,261
看看他们能否找出点联系?

Can't do that.

你可以私下里去做
You can do it off the record.

517
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:29,118
负责杀人案的警官貌似认识你
The homicide detective in charge seemed to know you.

518
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,538

519
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,273
"希科里之子问好"
"Hickory's son says hello."

520
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,542

哈 人可真有趣

这个靴子印 被发现出现在海军士官
This boot print was found at a crime scene

527
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:06,305
一样的靴子 一样的右脚跟图样
This is the same boot, the same cutout at the right heel.

528
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:07,774
你还知不知道 克里夫?
And you know what else, Cliff?

529
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,742
我们在后视镜上面找到了

你的拇指纹

531
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:13,913
怎么回事?
What happened?

532
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:16,783
天很黑
It was dark.

533
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:18,651
我看到她时已经太晚了
I couldn't see her until it was too late.

534
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:20,586
你开着邓恩上士的车做什么?
What were you doing with Staff Sergeant Dunne's truck?

535
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,088
我喝了点小酒
I had a few drinks.

536
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,506
我认识一个斯坦福的女孩
I know this girl in Stafford.

537
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:25,375
在休息室 我无意中听到邓恩说
I overheard Dunne in the rec room.

538
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:27,293
他这一周过得很烂 要早点睡
Said he had a rough week and was gonna hit the rack early.

539
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:28,461
我想我可以把他的车开走 在他发现之前
Figured I'd take his truck and be back

540
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:29,679
- 就能开回来 - 胡扯!
- before he even missed it. - Bull!

541
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,631
你怎么知道藏着的钥匙在哪里?
How'd you know about the hidden key?

542
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,349
一年前 他还酗酒的时候
About a year ago, when he was still drinking,

543
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,334
有次他喝得烂醉 把自己锁在了车外

Got the hidden key out, had me drive him home.

545
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,446

You left an injured woman to die by the side of the road?

546
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:40,441
不!
No!

547
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:41,674
我停车了

548
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:43,109
我意识到她死了
I knew she was dead,

549
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,777
我才发现事情有多糟
and I realized how bad it all looked.

550
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:47,530
我喝醉了 又开着一辆偷来的车
I was drinking, I was driving a stolen vehicle.

551
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,565
我只是很惊慌 把车开回了停车场
I just panicked and drove back to the parking lot.

552
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,617
你得相信我
You got to believe me.

553
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:54,186
这是一个意外
It was an accident.

554
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:06,198
我要拘留他 
I'll book him.

555
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,583
如果我们指控二等兵克里夫
If we charge Private Cliff

556
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,052
犯肇事逃逸罪
with the hit-and-run,

557
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,287
我们就得放邓恩上士走
we got to let Staff Sergeant Dunne go.

558
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,839
我没有打算这么做
I'm not ready to do that.

559
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:14,373
我们只有几个小时
We only have a few more hours

560
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,758
扣押邓恩
until the clock runs out on Dunne.

561
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,478
把他关到拘留室里去
Put him in a holding cell.

562
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,638
- 嘿 保罗 - 嘿 吉布斯
- Hey, Paul. - Hey, Gibbs.

563
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,206
抱歉 等我一下
Sorry. Just give me a sec.

564
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,674
我得发完这条给女儿的短信
I got to finish this text to my daughter.

565
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,242
这是她和我交流的唯一方式
Only way she'll communicate me.

566
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:36,028
那个孩子从不接电话
The kid never answers her phone.

567
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,063
都好久了
Been a long time.

568
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:39,832
你的爸爸好吗?
How's your dad?

569
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:42,067
顽固依旧
Stubborn as always.

570
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:44,871
我以为会在我的妹妹的婚礼上碰到你
Thought I might run into you at my kid sister's wedding.

571
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:46,568
哦 不 不 我不... 
Oh, no, no. I'm not...

572
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,840
不太热衷于参加婚礼
I'm not big on weddings.

573
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:49,459
我能理解
I can understand that.

574
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:52,762
谢谢你来见我
Thanks for meeting me.

575
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:56,299
嗯 我在福尔斯彻奇碰到你的探员
Yeah. I ran into your agents in Falls Church.

576
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,301
我猜 那不是巧合吧
Taking it, that wasn't a coincidence.

577
00:24:58,303 --> 00:24:59,852
- 呃 不是 - 所以
- Uh, no. - So,

578
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:01,721
你对我的杀人案件有何兴趣?
what's your interest in my homicide?

579
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:04,256
嗯 事情有点混乱复杂
Well, it's complicated, messy.

580
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,808
我们顺藤摸瓜
Following a lead.

581
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,360
抓住了一个指控无关的人
Holding someone on an unrelated charge.

582
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,445
他似乎有不在场证明
Seems to have an alibi,

583
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:11,781
但是他可能和你们死了的店主有什么联系
but he may have been involved with your dead storekeeper.

584
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:14,117
- 愿意和他一谈 - 不能谈 时机未到
- Like to talk to him. - Can't let you, not yet.

585
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,902
还得保护一个线人
Still trying to protect a source.

586
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,703
你拘留了他
You have him in custody.

587
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,605
是的 目前是的
Yeah, for the time being.

588
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,325
你的案件有什么能告诉我的?
What can you tell me about your case?

589
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:24,377
已发现沙利文是一个赌赛马的经纪人
Discovered Sullivan was a bookie.

590
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,379
把香烟店当做幌子
Used the cigar store as a front.

591
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,914
你们抓的家伙爱赌博吗?
Guy you holding like to gamble?

592
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,081
我会查到的
I'll find out.

593
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,883
谋杀案件有什么嫌疑犯吗?
You got any suspects for the murder?

594
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:34,620
有... 也没有
Yes... and no.

595
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:37,890
有超多前科的废物 温德尔・凯泽
Loser with a mile-long rap sheet, Wendell Kaiser.

596
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,642
参与了沙利文的好事
Into Sullivan big-time.

597
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:40,960
这个段子广为人知
Very public arguments.

598
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:42,478
凯泽甚至做出了恐吓
Kaiser even makes threats.

599
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,646
但是 他有无懈可击的不在场证明
However, airtight alibi.

600
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,181
谋杀发生时身在纽约
In New York at the time of the murder.

601
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:47,099
今早刚刚回来
Just got back this morning.

602
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,235
也许现在流行有不在场证明哈?
Maybe alibis are in season, huh?

603
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:50,570
好的
Okay.

604
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:51,737
吉士汉堡
Cheeseburger,

605
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,990
原味的 薯条
no dressing, fries.

606
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:58,077
我错过什么了吗? 你还没老啊
Did I miss something? You didn't even order.

607
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,679
哎 他不用是老头子的
Well, he doesn't have to.

608
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:01,664
谢谢 易兰妮
Thanks, Elaine.

609
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:05,363
你能 呃 拿来凯泽的档案吗?
Can you, uh, get me Kaiser's file?

610
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:06,319
当然
Sure.

611
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,454
我会把精华部分电邮给你的
I'll e-mail you the highlights.

612
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:10,423
你们抓的人 不会正好是个雇佣杀手吧?
Your guy wouldn't happen to be a hit man for hire, would he?

613
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,124
不 我觉得不是
No. I don't think so.

614
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:15,962
什么? 需要什么吗?
What? Need something?

615
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:19,131
是啊 一把可以切了这大块头的刀
Yeah, a knife to cut this beast.

616
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,189
这个可以
That'll work.

617
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:28,774
不 不 不
No, no, no.

618
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,476
你在开玩笑
You're not serious.

619
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:31,944
她不可能嫁会给他啊
There's no way she's married to him.

620
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:34,063
快满五年了
Almost five years.

621
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,898
花瓶娇妻的完美诠释
The very definition of a trophy wife.

622
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,117
你在看什么? 奥利维拉・钱德勒
What you looking at? Olivia Chandler.

623
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,403
那个邓恩军士
The woman who Sergeant Dunne

624
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,154
互相发短信 打电话的女人
has been exchanging texts and calls with.

625
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:43,723
这个矮个的男人
That little man

626
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:45,074
一定有一个很大
must have a big,

627
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:47,702
很大的... 银行账户 
big... bank account.

628
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:48,828
她嫁给他
She's married to him.

629
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,796
他们一起住在切维蔡斯村
They live together in Chevy Chase Village.

630
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,215
真会享受生活
Very la-dee-dah.

631
00:26:52,217 --> 00:26:54,867
她唯一的记录是酒后驾车
Only thing on her record is a DUI.

632
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:57,753
她驾驶阿斯顿马丁左冲右突 被拘捕了
She was picked up for driving erratically in her Aston Martin.

633
00:26:57,755 --> 00:26:58,871
不足为奇
So many jokes.

634
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:00,389
她开的当然是阿斯顿马丁
Of course she drives an Aston Martin.

635
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,592
我排查了交通摄像头
When I was searching traffic cameras

636
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:04,977
想看看是否能确定邓恩昨天晚上在谋杀案时
to see if I could place Dunne anywhere near the cigar store

637
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,429
出现在了雪茄店附近
the night of the murder,

638
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:08,380
找到了一些有趣的事情
I found something interesting.

639
00:27:08,382 --> 00:27:09,548
奥利维拉・钱德勒的车
Olivia Chandler's car.

640
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,485
这是雪茄店一街区外拍摄下来的画面
Now, this was taken a block from the cigar store.

641
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:13,986
因为车窗有颜色
Because of the tinted windows,

642
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:15,554
看不出谁在里面
you can't make out who's inside.

643
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:16,939
我发给了艾比
I sent it to Abby.

644
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,609
希望不大 但是也许她能增强图像
It's a long shot, but maybe she can enhance the image.

645
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:20,726
沙利文是一个赌徒
Sullivan was a bookie.

646
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:23,079
福尔斯彻奇的警方锁定了一个嫌疑人
Falls Church police had a suspect,

647
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:24,580
但是他有不在场证明
but he has an alibi.

648
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,949
多克里探员说他会将卷宗通过邮件发过来
Detective Dockry said he was going to e-mail the file.

649
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:29,669
收到了
He did.

650
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,403
- 温德尔・凯泽 - 麦基
- Wendell Kaiser. - McGee

651
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:33,506
看看邓恩上士是否嗜赌成性
see if Staff Sergeant Dunne had a gambling problem

652
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:34,790
或者与这个人的任何联系
or any connection to this guy.

653
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:37,343
迪诺左...
DiNozzo...

654
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:41,764
查查奥利维拉・钱德勒

657
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,282
需要帮忙吗?
May I help you?

658
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,584
希望如此
Oh, I hope so.

659
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,420
海军罪案调查处 特别探员安东尼・迪诺左
NCIS Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

660
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:22,838
海军罪案调查处?
NCIS?

661
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,091
我喜欢这辆车 太酷了
I love this car. It's smoking hot.

662
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:26,676
我也有意购买
I'm in the market myself.

663
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:28,177
在几款车之间摇摆不定
Between vehicles right now.

664
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,680
油耗很大 但是詹姆斯・邦德开的就是这款车
Terrible gas mileage, but that's what James Bond drives.

665
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:31,981
你知道吗?
Did you know that?

666
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:34,934
不知道 你有什么事情?
I have no idea. What do you want?

667
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:38,303
我们正在调查一名海军军官
Oh, we're investigating a Marine.

668
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:39,905
贾斯汀・邓恩上士
Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne.

669
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:40,973
你认识他吗?
How do you know him?

670
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:42,441
- 不认识 - 真的吗?
- I don't. - Really?

671
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,193
你和他经常通电话
'Cause you exchanged a lot of calls with him,

672
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:45,477
看上去你认识他
and that would suggest otherwise.

673
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:47,747
我们在戒酒会上相识
We met at an A.A. meeting.

674
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,532
相互交流 鼓励彼此
We talk to each other for support.

675

戒酒是一场持久战
Sobriety is an ongoing battle.

676
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:52,818
那你为什么说不认识他?
So why'd you say you didn't know him?

677
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,788
戒酒会的第二个"A"代表"匿名"
The second "A" in A.A. is for "anonymous."

678
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,957
我不该谈论他或其他任何人
I shouldn't be talking about him or anyone else.

679
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,508
我懂得
Gotcha.

680
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,093
你打算出趟门?
So you're taking a little trip?

681
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:04,430
我打算和好姐妹去牙买加
I'm going to Jamaica with some girlfriends.

682
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:06,515
真棒 牙买加

683
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:09,001
祝你玩得开心
Well, have yourself a nice time.

684
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:15,391
你将邓恩上士与死去的赌徒
Did you connect Staff Sergeant Dunne to the dead bookie

685
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,009
或者福尔斯彻奇嫌疑人联系上了吗?
or the Falls Church suspect?

686
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,561
不 还没有
No, not yet.

687
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,279
根据我询问过的人的说法
Based on the people I've talked to,

688
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,680
看上去邓恩不是个赌徒
it appears that Dunne's not a gambler.

689
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:23,232
还有其他可以追踪的线索
I still have other avenues to pursue,

690
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:25,735
只不过没有时间完成
I just haven't had the time to do it all.

691
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,789
- 托尼 有发现吗? - 是的
- Tony, you got something? - Oh, yeah.

692
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:31,957
你无法想象奥利维拉・钱德勒有多正点
You won't believe how hot Olivia Chandler is.

693
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,459
她不上相
Photos don't do her justice.

694
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:35,044
她和邓恩上士是怎么认识的?
What's with her and Staff Sergeant Dunne?

695
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:36,412
她声称他们只在戒酒会上
Well, she claims they're only acquaintances

696
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:37,529
有泛泛之交
from A.A. meetings.

697
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,131
但是我认为远不止如此
But I think it's more than that.

698
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:41,083
你说你有邓恩的信用卡账单 放上来
You said you had Dunne's credit card charges-- put them up.

699
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:43,302
- 为什么? - 相信我 放到屏幕上
- Why? - Trust me, put them up there.

700
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,641
好了 我们要找什么?
All right, what are we looking for?

701
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:49,975
如果他们如我所想 关系亲密
Well, if they're doing what I think they're doing,

702
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,310
肯定不会在她家见面
they're not doing it at her place.

703
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:54,230
我认为一个来自切维蔡斯的富太太
And I don't think a rich housewife from Chevy Chase

704
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:56,932
会迈着长腿一路跑到昆迪克 
is dragging those long legs all the way down to Quantico.

705
00:29:56,934 --> 00:29:58,184
好的 等一下
Okay, wait. Hold on.

706
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,986
切维蔡斯小屋
Chevy Chase Lodge.

707
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:02,605
这里 这里和这里
There, there and there.

708
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,807
三个晚上 或许更多
Three nights, probably more.

709
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:08,694
记录下来 麦基
Take it down, McGee.

710
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:13,699
四十八小时时间到了
Our 48 hours are up.

711
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,501
是的
Yep.

712
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,837
什么时候能拿回我的卡车?
When do I get my truck back?

713
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
我去看看切维蔡斯小屋
I'm going to check out the Chevy Chase Lodge.

714
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,184
将克里夫二等兵定罪为肇事逃逸
Book Private Cliff for the hit-and-run.

715
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:37,773
一个结案 还有一个还差得远
That's one case closed, another wide open.

716
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,632
是的 亲爱的 我明白
Yes, dear, I understand.

717
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:51,833
真的吗?
Do you?

718
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:53,468
- 你在听吗? - 我听到了
- Do you even hear? - I hear you.

719
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,854
不 不 不 我... 我不会...
No, no, no. I... I would never...

720
00:30:57,674 --> 00:30:59,141
... 这是你的母亲的主意吗?
Well... oh, it's your mother's idea?

721
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:00,475
是的 是我母亲的主意!
Yes, it's my mother's idea!

722
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:02,561
我为什么不感到惊讶呢?
Why does that not surprise me?

723
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:05,847
我得挂了 有位客人等着我呢
I have to go. I have a guest waiting.

724
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,517
真的有客人在等着我
I do have a guest waiting.

725
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,517
我没有胡说
I'm not making that up.

726
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,857
... 你能帮帮我吗 先生?
Uh... could you help me, please, sir?

727
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,159
这是谁? 喂?
Who is that? Hello?

728
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:18,410
好的 我等会儿再打给你
Okay. I'll call you later.

729
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:20,212
- 好吧! - 我才不会打呢
- Fine! - Like hell I will.

730
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,248
你结婚了吗?
You married?

731
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,916
没有...
Oh. No. Uh...

732
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:26,551
我是联邦探员
I'm a federal agent.

733
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,636
迪诺左
DiNozzo.

734
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,204
想问你几个问题
Like to ask a few questions.

735
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,972
好吧 联邦探员 问吧
All right, federal agent, ask away.

736
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,390
你见过这个人吗?
Have you seen this man?

737
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,374
见过
Yeah.

738
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,559
是的 见过
Yeah, sure.

739
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,711
算是常客了
Sort of a regular.

740
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:39,264
他是一个人来还是...?
So, does he come alone or...?

741
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:41,549
他想让我这么想
Well, he'd like me to think that.

742
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,486
不 他的朋友从不来大厅
No, his friend never comes to the lobby.

743
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,855
他停车 她直接去房间
He parks the car, and she goes directly to the room.

744
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:50,158
你会想 一个人或者俩人都结婚了 对吧?
So you got to figure, you know, one or both are married, right?

745
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,444
没错
Right. Yeah.

746
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:54,229
所以你从未见过她?
So you've never seen her?

747
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,581
事实上 我曾经
Well, actually, I did the old

748
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,583
敲错过一次门
knock-on-the-wrong-door routine one time.

749
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,285
她长得像这样?
She look like this?

750
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,870
是的 就是她
Yeah, that's her.

751
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,872
像这样的女人 你不会忘记
Woman like that, you do not forget.

752
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:07,592
对吧? 你能想象一晚上和...
Right? I mean, can you imagine what one night with...

753
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:12,047
我发誓 这个老女人是一个疯子
I swear, the old witch is psychic.

754
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:14,916
如果我对另一个女人有这么多幻想...
If I have so much as a thought of another woman...

755
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,134
你不必接通它
You don't have to answer that.

756
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:17,269
我必须要接 你...?!
I have to. What...?!

757
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:18,804
...有什么事情?
...do you want?

758
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:19,921
知道了 祝你好运
I got it. Good luck.

759
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:20,972
等等 你需要... 如果...
Just, do you need... if...

760
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,107
拿张名片吧 先生
Take a card, sir.

761
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,726
谢谢
Thank you.

762
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:30,982
给你
Here.

763
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:35,921
我喜欢和你喝酒 达克
Ah, always enjoy having a drink with you, Duck,

764
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:39,090
但是你不会听完交响乐绕路来这里
but this isn't exactly on your way home from the symphony.

765
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,392
你想说什么?
What's on your mind?

766
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,994
出于好奇 我正打算问你
Well, curiously, I was about to ask you that.

767
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:45,080
你看起来... 心事重重
You've seemed... troubled

768
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:48,133
自从你昨天尸检时接了那通电话
since you took that call in Autopsy yesterday.

769
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:52,804
通常你很擅长隐藏自己的感情
Usually you're a master at hiding your feelings.

770
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,122
你的职业建议是?
That your professional opinion?

771
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:55,473
和一名心理侧写师
The occupational hazard

772
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,342
工作的职业风险
of working with a profiler.

773
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,462
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

774
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:05,317
有点担心凯莉・克拉克
A little concerned about Carrie Clark.

775
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,519
- 那名律师? - 是的 她很出色
- The lawyer? - Yeah, she's good.

776
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:11,139
她让当事人被无罪释放
She got her client released without being charged.

777
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,975
可是呢...?
I sense a "but."

778
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:17,979
恩 她不至于毫无良心可言
Well, she does have a conscience.

779
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,831
这是一件好事 对吧?
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

780
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,318
她可能有意或无意
We learned some things about her client

781
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,322
引导我们去了解她客户的信息
that she may or may not have led us to.

782
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,124
是一些特殊信息吗?
Privileged information?

783
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:32,294
达克 这件事情我得万分小心
Doc, I got to be careful how I handle this.

784
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:34,829
我得为凯莉着想
For Carrie's sake.

785
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,715
弄不好她会因此吊销执照的
She could get disbarred.

786
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,383
杰斯罗 我太了解你了 
Well, I know you, Jethro.

787
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,554
你总是为别人着想 总以为自己是对的
It sounds as if she's doing the right thing, as you are.

788
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:45,173
音乐会如何?
So how was the concert?

789
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,476
柴可夫斯基第钢二琴协奏曲 演奏得极好
Great. Tchaikovsky's Second.

790
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:51,897
原来他为电影作过曲 这我还是第一次知道
I never realized that he wrote music for the movies.

791
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,793
这辆车我想要好久了
That's a car I've always had the hots for.

792
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,878
我真该买一辆的
Maybe that's what I should get.

793
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,413
都是老爷车
It's too old.

794
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,915
你怎么开啊
You can't drive a car like that.

795
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,216
太不切实际了
It's not practical.

796
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:12,334
麦基 你这个人就这毛病
That's the problem with you, McGeezer.

797
00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:13,418
什么都要切合实际
Everything has to be practical.

798
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,003
其实...
What...

799
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:17,038
我想说 从来没见你
What I mean is, I've never known you

800
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,174
冒过哪怕一丝一毫的险
to do anything even a little risqué.

801
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:23,544
托尼 你不了解我的私生活 请不要乱说
Tony, you have no idea what I do on my time off.

802
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:24,896
是的 我是不了解
You know, that's true, I don't.

803
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:25,964
那你说说也无妨?
Why don't you tell me?

804
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:30,235
有分享 有惊喜 有感动
Share. Rock me. Sock me.

805
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,858
目标人物温德尔・凯泽出现
Well, there's Wendell Kaiser.

806
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,778
你说福尔斯彻奇警局是不是也在查他呢?
Wonder if Falls Church PD is tailing him, too.

807
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,396
凯泽是他们的嫌犯
Kaiser's their suspect.

808
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59,931
他去做礼拜吗?
Is Kaiser going to church?

809
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,449
不是 例会而已
No. It's an A.A. meeting.

810
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,418
他们每天早上都会在这里集会
They meet here every morning at this time.

811
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,303
嗯? 你怎么知道?
Wait, how do you know that?

812
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:06,638
安东尼!
Anthony!

813
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,390
你来这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

814
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:09,808
你不是应该今晚才来吗?
Your meeting's not until tonight.

815
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,385
米勒教士 我... 是来... 
Reverend Miller, I, uh...

816
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:12,260
有新人要加入吗?
Bringing a new member?

817
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,561
这个...
Um...

818
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:15,814
他还在考虑这件事情 他对枪声有点儿阴影
He's thinking about it. A little gun-shy.

819
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:18,033
麦基 这是教士
McGee, the Rev.

820
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,617
加入我们吧
Please join us.

821
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,703

00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,621
我们欢迎任何人的加入
All are welcome.

823
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
托尼 这是怎么回事?
Tony, what's going on?

824
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,328
你在戒酒吗?
Do you have a drinking problem?

825
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,914
那倒没有...
No. No, I just...

826
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,250
我就是加入了他们的资助团体而已
I joined this men's support group.

827
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:37,002
每周花两个晚上在教堂大厅见面
Meets in the church hall two nights a week.

828
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,619
真的吗?
You serious?

829
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,455
是啊
Mm-hmm.

830
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,557
我懂...
I know, it...

831
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,426
这一点儿不像我的作风 可是...
it doesn't sound like me, but...

832
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:47,679
去年发生那么多事以后... 我
with the past year, I just...

833
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,981
想换换环境
wanted to shake things up a little bit.

834
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,632
认识一些新朋友
Meet some new people.

835
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,301
在健身馆有人给我提起这个组织
This guy at the gym told me about the group,

836
00:35:53,303 --> 00:35:55,904
我觉得这个主意不错
and I thought it sounded like a good idea.

837
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,023
而且... 这里... 挺有趣的
And it... it is, it's fun.

838
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:02,577
教士有天早上开车带我去了昆迪克 
The Rev drove me to Quantico the other morning.

839
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,978
他这人很有意思
Interesting guy.

840
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
他教我如何少去评判别人
He's helping me be less judgmental.

841
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,502
告诉你啊 凯泽要在这儿呆上好一阵子呢
You know, Kaiser's going to be here for a while.

842
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,320
我们先回去吧
We should get back.

843
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,816
邓恩上士 奥利维拉・钱德勒
Sergeant Dunne, Olivia Chandler

844
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,183
还有温德尔・凯泽
and Wendell Kaiser

845
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,135
他们三人都有一个共同点
all have one thing in common.

846
00:36:27,137 --> 00:36:28,937
那就是 他们都去那个一对一集会
They all go to A.A. meetings.

847
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,355
可能他们就是在那里认识的吧?
That's probably where they met.

848
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,024
上士和这位花瓶妻是恋人关系
The sergeant and the trophy wife are lovers.

849
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,642
切维蔡斯旅馆的前台职员
The desk clerk at the Chevy Chase Lodge

850
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:36,611
说他们是店里的常客
said that they were regulars.

851
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,513
就像电影 体热 里面演的一样
It's just like that movie Body Heat.

852
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:40,181
威廉・赫特和 凯瑟琳・特纳主演的哦
William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.

853
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:42,016
啊 这个女人太迷人了
God, she was really something, boss.

854
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:43,401
让人为之癫狂
A head turner.

855
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,821
好吧 说跑题了
But I digress.

856
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:49,624
总而言之他们和这对恋人一样 年轻气盛
Anyway, they were young lovers, just like these two,

857
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,709
都想打富老公的主意 谋他的财
and they wanted the rich husband's money

858
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,877
害他的命
and him out of the way.

859
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,462
另一方面 
On the other hand, you've got

860
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,997
温德尔・凯泽赌债缠身
Wendell Kaiser, who's deep in debt to his bookie

861
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,549
也想杀了债主一了百了
and needs him off his back.

862
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,584
所以他们互相借刀杀人 为对方解决问题
So they help each other out and switch murders.

863
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,136
当凯泽在纽约的时候
While Kaiser was in New York,

864
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,471
邓恩和奥利维拉一起合伙杀了他的债主
Dunne killed the bookie with Olivia's help.

865
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,840
她开车载他 她自己的车就在附近
She drove him. Her car was in the vicinity.

866
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:07,842
没有人会去怀疑他们?
Who would ever suspect them?

867
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,644
既没有联系 也没有动机
I mean, there's no connection, no motive.

868
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,180
明天邓恩上士要接受派遣去别处
Tomorrow Sergeant Dunne is going to deploy

869
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,265
而奥利维拉・钱德勒要出国去牙买加
and Olivia Chandler is off to Jamaica.

870
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,484
我猜他们离开以后
And I'm betting that while they're away,

871
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:18,153
她的丈夫会出严重车祸
her husband's going to have a terrible accident

872
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:19,821
这一切都是拜凯泽所赐
at the hands of Mr. Kaiser here,

873
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,023
而他们之间一点儿关系都没有
a man with whom he has no connection.

874
00:37:22,025 --> 00:37:24,892
两起谋杀案 而这三个人却都有不在场证明 
Two murders, three solid alibis.

875
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,394
这个想法挺有意思
Interesting theory.

876
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,197
我们知道这项指控证明起来十分困难
We know it's going to be a hard conspiracy for us to prove.

877
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,232
要万事小心 毕竟这不是我们的案件
We got to be careful-- it's not our case.

878
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,922
我有办法
There's a way.

879
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,077
找到最弱的那环就行
Find the weak link.

880
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,092
嘿 凯泽
Hey, Kaiser.

881
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:01,229
你有空吗?
You got a minute?

882
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:03,982
多克里探长
Detective Dockry.

883
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:06,601
我们的问题不是解决了吗?
I thought we were done.

884
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:09,487
沙利文的情况 我都告诉你了
Look, I told you everything I know about Sullivan.

885
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,072
没错 但是出了一点儿小问题
Yeah, well, something's come up.

886
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:13,291
跟我去局里吧 我们来谈谈
Let's go to the station. We can talk about it.

887
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,776
不了 这里就挺好
Nah, I'm not going anywhere.

888
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,778
听我说 我和沙利文的死一点关系都没有
Look, I had nothing to do with Sullivan's murder.

889
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,780
我当时在纽约 你查过的
I was in New York, man. You checked it out.

890
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:23,635
你非得逼我在你的朋友面前下手吗?
You really want to do this in front of your friends?

891
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,472
我不想跟你离开这里
I'm not going anywhere with you.

892
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:32,793
你的同伙邓恩上士和她的女友的事情 
We know about your buddy, Sergeant Dunne,

893
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:35,647
我们已经知道了
and his girlfriend.

894
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,802
现在我说了算
So let me explain how this works.

895
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:46,407
你要是第一个招供 就有机会和我们谈条件
First suspect to flip on the others gets the deal.

896
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,200
奥利维拉・钱德勒
Olivia Chandler?

897
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,770
嘿 老吉
Hey, Gibbs.

898
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,405
迪诺左说要是你不在家
DiNozzo told me that if you weren't at home

899
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,724
就来这里找你
I would probably find you here.

900
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,577
请坐
Have a seat.

901
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,666
有什么事情吗?
There a problem?

902
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,285
没有 我...
No, I...

903
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,036
我刚听说福尔斯彻奇警局
just heard that Falls Church PD

904
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:24,789
逮捕了我之前的委托人邓恩上士
arrested my former client, Sergeant Dunne.

905
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,124
是吗?
Really?

906
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:27,842
是的 他们以多项罪名起诉他
Yeah, they booked him on multiple charges,

907
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:31,596
说他预谋杀人 并杀害他人
including conspiracy to commit murder and murder one.

908
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,880
他们怎么抓到他的?
How'd they get him?

909
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:35,500
他的同伙之一
Apparently one of his coconspirators

910
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:37,251
上交了证物
turned state's evidence.

911
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:41,439
有时候好运来了... 挡也挡不住
Sometimes... you get lucky.

912
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,025
真是这样吗?
Mmm, is that what it was?

913
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:49,197
他们拿到搜查令 在邓恩家
They got a warrant and cinched the case against Dunne

914
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,098
马桶水箱里找到了凶器 是一把刀
when they found the murder weapon, a knife,

915
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,118
于是定了他的罪
in his bathroom toilet tank.

916
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,421
真不错
That's great.

917
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,421
你还好吗?
You okay?

918
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:04,579
还好
Yeah.

919
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,280
找不到不好的理由? 我做了分内之事
Why wouldn't I be? I did my job.

920
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:07,965
让他免于肇事逃逸的责罚
I got Dunne off on the hit-and-run.

921
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,384
是的 你办得很好
Yeah, you did it well.

922
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,719
那以后 他无论发生什么
Yes, and whatever happened to him after that,

923
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:12,587
都与我无关
it's not my concern.

924
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:15,623
天网恢恢 疏而不漏
Justice was served, all around.

925
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:21,012
好的 请用餐
Okay. Here you go.

926
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:23,064
要一起吃晚餐吗?
Care to join me for dinner?

927
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:27,735
肉馅糕配土豆泥 真不错
Hmm, meat loaf and mashed potatoes?

928
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:32,357
我最喜欢吃这些 我很愿意和你共享晚餐
My favorite. I would be happy to.

929
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:34,909
马上就好
Coming right up.

930
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,661
易兰妮 谢谢你
Thanks, Elaine.

931
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:44,168
看来我们还是有一些共同点的
I think that you and me have a few things in common.
