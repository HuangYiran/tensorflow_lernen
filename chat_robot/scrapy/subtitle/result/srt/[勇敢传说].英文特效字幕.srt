00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One swipe, his sword shattered.

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then "chomp"! Dad's leg was clean off.

106
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down the monster's throat it went.

107
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my favorite part.

108
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mor'du has never been seen since,

109
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge.

110
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him return.

111
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll finish what I guddled in the first place.

112
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table.

113
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum! It's just my bow.

114
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A princess should not have weapons in my opinion.

115
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave her be.

116
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Princess or not, learning to fight is essential.

117
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum? You'll never guess what I did today.

118
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I climbed the Crone's Tooth,

119
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and drank from the Fire Falls.

120
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire Falls?

121
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire.

122
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you do, dear?      - Nothing, Mum.

123
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hungry, aren't we?

124
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mum!      - You'll get dreadful collywobbles.

125
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Fergus, will you look at your daughter's plate?

126
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what?

127
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You great...      - Don't let them lick...

128
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys, you're naughty.

129
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't just play with your haggis.

130
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know you don't like it,

131
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you won't try it?

132
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just a wee sheep's stomach.

133
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's delicious.

134
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My lady.      - Thank you, Maudie.

135
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the Lords Macintosh, MacGuffin and Dingwall.

136
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their responses, no doubt.

137
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels.

138
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chew on that, you manky dogs!

139
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fergus?

140
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've all accepted.

141
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's accepted what, Mother?

142
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys, you are excused.

143
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I do now?

144
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father has something to discuss with you.

145
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fergus?

146
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida.

147
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal.

148
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - The clans have accepted.

149
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad!      - What? I...

150
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... She... Elinor?

151
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, Merida, I don't know why you're reacting this way.

152
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand.

153
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose a princess just does what she's told?

154
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A princess does not raise her voice.

155
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life.

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life.

157
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't go through with it. You can't make me.

158
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida!

159
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida!

160
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys!

161
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother. Suitors? Marriage?

162
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once there was an ancient kingdom...

163
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum!

164
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ancient kingdom.

165
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Its name long forgotten,

166
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved.

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when he grew old he divided the kingdom among his four sons,

168
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested.

169
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself.

170
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He followed his own path and the kingdom fell

171
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to war, and chaos and ruin.

172
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a nice story.

173
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not just a story, Merida.

174
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Legends are lessons. They ring with truths.

175
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum.

176
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would advise you to make your peace with this.

177
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The clans are coming to present their suitors.

178
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's not fair.      - Merida.

179
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's marriage. It's not the end of the world.

180
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're muttering.      - I don't mutter.

181
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, you do. You mutter, lass, when something's troubling you.

182
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I blame you. Stubbornness.

183
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's entirely from your side of the family.

184
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take it the talk didn't go too well, then?

185
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to do.

186
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Speak to her, dear.      - I do speak to her.

187
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She just doesn't listen.      - Come on, now.

188
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me.

189
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you say?

190
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't do this.

191
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure you can.

192
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there. That's my queen.

193
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, here we go.

194
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I don't want to get married."

195
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind"

196
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:51,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset."

197
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida, all this work, all the time spent preparing you,

198
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}schooling you, giving you everything we never had.

199
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

200
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call off the gathering. Would that kill them?

201
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the queen.

202
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can just tell the lords the princess is not ready for this.

203
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, she might not ever be ready for this, so that's that.

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just don't care how I...      - It'll be fire and sword if it's not set right.

332
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just listen!      - I am the Queen!

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfair?

336
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're never there for me.

337
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This whole marriage is what you want.

339
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do,

340
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to make me be like you.

341
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not going to be like you.

342
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're acting like a child.

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're a beast.

346
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather die than be like you!

347

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida, you are a princess,

348
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and I expect you to act like one.      - Mum!

356
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would the wisps lead me here?

357
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look around.

358
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,470

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who are you?      - Just a humble woodcarver.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand...

362

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See anything you like?

00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber?

364
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the will-o'-the-wisps, they...

365
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is one of a kind!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your broom!

368
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It was sweeping by itself.      - That's ridiculous.

369
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wood cannot be imbued with magical properties.

370
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should know. I'm a... Whittler Of wood.

371
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about this conversation starter? It's made of yew wood.

372
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tough as stone.

373
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's stuffed.

374
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Staring is rude.      - The crow's talking!

375
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not all I can do.

376
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a witch!      - Woodcarver.

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why the wisps led me here.

378
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woodcarver!      - You'll change my fate!

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woodcarver!      - You see, it's my mother.

380
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers.

381
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not going to buy anything, get out.

382

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? What was that?      - Every carving.

385
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

386
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,750

390
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every carving and one spell.

391
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure you know what you're doing?

392
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want a spell to change my mum.

393

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll change my fate.

394

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

396
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

397
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never conjure where you carve.

398
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very important.

399
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The last time I did this was for a prince.

400
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy on the eyes. Tight pants.

401
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He demanded I give him the strength of ten men.

402
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he gave me this for a spell.

403
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A spell that would change his fate.

404
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And did he get what he was after?

405
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. And made off with an especially attractive mahogany cheese board.

406
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, what do I need?

407
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a little bit of this.

408
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do.

409
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:12,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now let's see. What have we here?

410
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A cake?

411
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't want it?      - Yes! I want it.

412
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're sure if I give this to my mum,

413
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it will change my fate?

414
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me. It'll do the trick, dearie.

415
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight.

416
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that thing about the spell?

417
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you say something about

418
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the spell?

419
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}∮Mor'du, Mor'du, now the time has come for all of us to slaughter you∮

420
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}∮Mor'du, Mor'du...∮

421
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Merida.      - Mum!

422
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've been worried sick.      - You... You were?

423
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know where you'd gone or when you'd come back.

424
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know what to think. Look at your dress.

425
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Angus threw me. But I'm not hurt.

426
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're home now, so that's the end of it.

427
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honestly?      - I've pacified the lords for now.

428
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your father's out there "entertaining" them.

429
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come taste my blade, you manky bear

430
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For gobbling up my leg

431
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you, hang your noggin on a peg...

432
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made.

433
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's this?      - It's a peace offering.

434
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made it. For you. Special.

435
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made this for me?

436
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interesting flavor.

437
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you feel?

438
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What... What is that?      - Different?

439
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tart and gamy.

440
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that?

441
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's better.

442
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords

443
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and put this whole kerfuffle to rest?

444
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mother?      - I'm woozy suddenly.

445
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My head's spinning like a top.

446
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mum!      - Suddenly I'm not so well.

447
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you feel about the marriage now?

448
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida! Just take me to my room.

449
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, that's fine. That's just fine.

450
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little to the left. That's good. A wee bit to the left. That's good.

451
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good enough.

452
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, clear out of there, boys. I don't want you to spoil my shot.

453
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - My lady Queen.

454
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been waiting patiently.

455
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Milords, I am out of sorts at the moment.

456
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you shall have your answer.

457
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Presently.

458
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you'll excuse us.

459
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elinor, look!

460
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Mor'du!

461
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elinor? Are you all right, dear?

462
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. I'm fine.

463
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go about avenging your leg.

464
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. You heard her, lads.

465
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die.

466
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just take all the time you need to getting yourself right, Mum.

467
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage.

468
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was in that cake?

469
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cake.

470
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

471
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'll just tell them the wedding's off, then?

472
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

473
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bear!

474
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

475
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're... You're a bear!

476
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why a bear?

477
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell.

478
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my fault.

479
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask her to change you into a bear.

480
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted her to change you.

481
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that?

482
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's not right.

483
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no point in having a go at me. The witch is to blame.

484
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goggly old hag.

485
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eyes all over the place.

486
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unbelievable.

487
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get her to fix this.

488
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do I always get blamed for everything? It's just not fair.

489
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, follow me.

490
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And keep a sharp eye.

491
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go. Another hunt through the castle.

492
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we haven't had dessert yet.

493
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea.

494
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, you can't go out there.

495
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum! Wait!

496
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Dad. The Bear King?

497
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he so much as sees you, you're dead.

498
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another one of your entertainments to bore us to death!

499
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what exactly are we after...

500
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum!

501
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...my liege?

502
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Best to humor him. He is, after all, the King.

503
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's like a hound with that nose of his.

504
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, wait.

505
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to...

506
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

507
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

508
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

509
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're covered with fur.

510
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not naked.

511
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like anyone's gonna see you.

512
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you've done it.

513
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maudie!

514
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just calm down, lass. What is it?

515
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spit it out, Maudie!

516
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bear!

517
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it!

518
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you just listen to me?

519
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't go this way. You'll be seen.

520
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! This way!

521
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

522
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

523
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A witch turned Mum into a bear. It's not my fault.

524
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to get out of the castle. I need your help.

525
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

526
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can have my desserts for two... Three weeks.

527
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Fine. A year.

528
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that?

529
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it goes!

530
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it goes!

531
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Mum.

532
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think we should lay a trap?

533
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try shutting yours!

534
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is!

535
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure it went this way.

536
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can see my house from here.

537
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must have sprouted wings.

538
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was carried away by a giant birdy.

539
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A dragon, perhaps.      - Bear in the castle!

540
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't make sense. It cannot open doors.

541
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got big giant paws!

542
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just get inside.

543
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's locked.      - Dingwall was the last up.

544
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I propped it open with a stick.

545
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you see, Maudie? Just spit it out, Maudie.

546
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip?

547
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maudie, honey, come here! It's all right!

548
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Mum. Quick.

549
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll be fine. Won't you, boys?

550
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, we've got to hurry.

551
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'll be back soon.

552
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward.

553
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right!

554
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are these wisps?

555
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out, wisps. Come on out.

556
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lead me to the witch's cottage.

557
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here!

558
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Don't come out now that my mum's watching.

559
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was standing right here and the wisp appeared right there.

560
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest.

561
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does she think we're just going to happen upon the witch's cottage?

562
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, I know this place.

563
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The witch's cottage...

564
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's this way! Come on! Hurry!

565
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe it. I found it.

566
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. She was here.

567
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, really, she was just here.

568
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

569
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

570
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. No! No!

571
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the Crafty Carver,

572
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}home of bear-themed carvings and novelties.

573
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am completely out of stock at this time.

574
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you'd like to enquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers,

575
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pour vial one into the cauldron.

576
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you'd like the menu in Gaelic, vial two.

577
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

578
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To speak with a live homunculus...

579
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Princess, I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway

580
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and won't be back till spring.

581
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell.

582
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent,

00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unless you remember these words.

584
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fate be changed,

00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}look inside,

586
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mend the bond

587
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}torn by pride.

588
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Fate be changed... Mend the bond. " What does that mean?

589
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more time.

590
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fate be changed,

591
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}look inside,

592
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mend the bond

593
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}torn by pride.

594
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. Ta-ta.

595
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver.

596
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No! Where'd you go?

597
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Welcome to the Crafty Carver...      - What?

598
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe there's a book of spells. Look around. We'll need more vials.

599
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm off to the Wickerman Festival in Stornoway...

601
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll sort it out tomorrow.

602
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

603
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll always be right here.

604
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning.

605
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

606
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's all this supposed to be?

607
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

608
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I don't speak bear.

609
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find those by the creek, did you?

610
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're nightshade berries.

611
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:35,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're poisonous.

612
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get this water? It has worms.

613
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

614
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breakfast.

615
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion.

616
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

617
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

618
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it?

619
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

620
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, come back.

621
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, is that you?

622
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

623
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You changed.

624
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you were a...

625
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, like you were a bear on the inside.

626
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A wisp.

627
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum!

628
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it!

629
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, no!

630
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum...

631
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jings, crivens, help ma boab.

632
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, I know you're scared,

633
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're tired, you don't understand,

634
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we've got to keep our heads.

635
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just calm down. Listen.

636
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll show us the way.

637
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, look.

638
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did the wisps bring us here?

639
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time.

640
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine, Mum. Just fine.

641
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's

642
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a throne room.

643
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me?

644
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one with the princes.

645
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One,

646
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}two,

647
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}three,

648
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}four.

649
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The oldest.

650
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Split, like the tapestry.

651
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The spell. It's happened before.

652
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Strength of ten men."

653
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Fate be changed."

654
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Changed his fate."

655
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

656
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The prince became...

657
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mor'du.

658
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, we need to get back to the castle.

659
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du.

660
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bear!

661
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real bear. Forever!

662
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Mend the bond torn by pride."

663
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The witch gave us the answer. The tapestry.

664
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum, do you have a better idea?

665
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do.

666
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more talk.

667
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more traditions. We settle this now!

668
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the King.

669
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry.

670
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter.

671
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then our alliance is over! This means war!

672
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna murder each other.

673
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to stop them before it's too late.

674
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I know!

675
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry

676
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the lot of them boiling over like that?

677
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing, lass?      - It's all right, Dad.

678
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

679
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have...

680
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you see, I...

681
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have been in conference with the Queen.

682
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that so?      - Aye, it is.

683
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, where is she, then?      - She...

684
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do we know that this isn't some trick?

685
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'd never...      - This is highly irregular.

686
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you playing at?      - Where is the Queen?

687
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will not stand for any more of this jiggery-pokery.

688
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's right. Let's see her.      - Shut it!

689
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I...

690
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:19,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once there was an ancient kingdom.

691
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

692
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kingdom fell into war

693
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and chaos and ruin...

694
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've all heard that tale. Lost kingdom.

695
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, but it's true.

696
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom.

697
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a legend.

698
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Legends are lessons.

699
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They ring with truths.

700
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our kingdom is young.

701
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our stories are not yet legend.

702
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in them, our bond was struck.

703
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our clans were once enemies.

704
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when invaders threatened us from the sea,

705
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you joined together to defend our lands.

706
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fought for each other.

707
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You risked everything for each other.

708
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord MacGuffin, my dad saved your life,

709
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

710
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye, and I'll never forget it.

711
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Lord Macintosh,

712
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you saved my dad when you charged in on heavy horse

713
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and held off the advance.

714
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we all know how Lord Dingwall broke the enemy line.

715
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With a mighty throw of his spear!

716
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was aiming at you, you big tumshie.

717
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The story of this kingdom is a powerful one.

718
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad rallied your forces

719
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you made him your king.

720
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship

721
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it lives to this day.

722
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've been selfish.

723
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

724
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no one to blame but me.

725
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know now that I need to amend my mistake

726
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and mend our bond.

727
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, there is the matter of my betrothal.

728
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've decided to do what's right

729
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and...

730
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and...

731
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and...

732
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...break tradition.

733
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother,

734
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Queen, feels...

735
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in her heart

736
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I...

737
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that we be free to...

738
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...write our own story...

739
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...follow our hearts

740
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and find love in our own time.

741
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's beautiful.

742
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords.

743
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love?

744
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this,

745
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have one thing to say.

746
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is...      - A grand idea!

747
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us our own say in choosing our fate.

748
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - Aye. Why shouldn't we choose?

749
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she's the princess.

750
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not pick her out. It was your idea.

751
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you... You feel the same way?

752
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good?

753
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that settles it.

754
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let these lads try and win her heart before they win her hand.

755
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they can.

756
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say, the wee Dingwall has a fighting chance.

757
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine, then. Seems for once we agree.

758
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my idea in the first place.

759
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like your mum.

760
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You devil.

761
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone to the cellar!

762
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's crack open the King's private reserve to celebrate!

763
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring the tiny glasses.

764
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the tapestry!

765
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mend the bond...

766
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mend the bond.

767
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stitch it up. This'll change you back.

768
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just need needle and thread.

769
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum?

770
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum? Not now.

771
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Please, not now.

772
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum...

773
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elinor, clear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem.

774
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elinor!

775
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't be true! Elinor, answer me, lass!

776
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elinor!

777
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida.

778
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - Dad, no! It's not what you think.

779
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Merida, get back!      - No!

780
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Dad! Don't hurt her!

781
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

782
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merida! No!

783
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

784
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum.

785
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing. It's just a little scratch. Mum!

786
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My liege!

787
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fergus.

788

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

790
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Count your stars, lass. It almost had you. Are you hurt?

791
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your wife, Elinor.

792
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the gate!

793
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:14,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're talking nonsense!      - It's the truth!

794
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a witch and she gave me a spell. It's not Mor'du.

795
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother!

796
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll not risk losing you, too.      - No, Dad! Just listen to me.

797
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen! You can't!

798
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's your wife Elinor!      - Maudie, keep this and don't let her out.

799
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about the bear?      - Just stay put.

800
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots!

801
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mum!

802
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

803
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:18,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Mum.

804
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maudie. Maudie!

805
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you!

806
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

807
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maudie!

811
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

812
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes!

813
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

814
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You beauty!
