行尸走肉前情回顾
Previous on AMC's The Wlaking Dead.

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:05,779
别伤害我女儿 
Don't hurt my little girl.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,263
不!
No!

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,916
- 你假装自己是州长  - 你没看到你身边的魔鬼吗?
- And you pretend to be you are a governor.  - Haven't you see the devil beside you?

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,943
我已经看到了
I've seen him already.

6
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:16,990
我得和你谈谈Carel
I need to talk to you about Carol.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,924
都听我的
I'm in charge. No dead win.

8
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,876
和Michelle在一起你得多想想
In the world of Michelle you gotta think.

9
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:26,903
也许我们能找到一个更好的地方
Maybe we can find a better place. 

10
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:34,801
我要劝你们做些事
I have to talk all of you into doing something.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,233
不得不做的事
Something I know we need to do.

12
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:44,134
可我不知道该怎么说
And I don't know how to talk about it.

13
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,600
你想要我们做什么?
What do you want us to do?

14
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,034
我要你们活下去
I want you to survive.

15
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,300
我们不能在这待下去了
We're not gonna last here.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
会有成群的行尸
The biters, there'll be a herd of them.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,500
他们会把坑填平
They'll fill the pits,

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,034
从同伴身上爬过去
they'll crawl over one another.

19
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,834
足以把我们的营地踏平
There'll be enough to tear right through our camp.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,034
也许还会是人
Or it'll be people.

21
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,500
我们和外界之间已经没有阻碍了
There's nothing between us and the rest of the world.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,901
完全没有
Nothing between us and them.

23
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,867
留在这儿 我们就只有死路一条
We stay here, we'll die.

24
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:34,801
破坏了我在Martinez营地的人
The people who destroyed the camp I was in with Martinez...

25
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:38,001
他们住在一个监狱里
they live in a prison.

26
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,534
在34号公路的北侧
It's north off Highway 34.

27
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,867
他们有墙
They got walls...

28
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:47,333
篱笆
fences,

29
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,101
可以种植的土地
plots of land for farming.

30
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,068
我们可以住在那
We could live there.

31
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,567
哼哼
Uh-uh.

32
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,500
如果我们要从他们手里夺过来
If we're willing to take it from 'em.

33
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,734
我有一个不必伤害任何人的计划
I have a plan to do it without anyone getting hurt.

34
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,867
我抓住了两个
I captured two of them.

35
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,934
什么?
What?

36
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,567
当时我正在搜查监狱
I was scouting the prison

37
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,734
结果就遇到了 于是我抓了他们
and our paths crossed, so I took 'em.

38
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,168
- 你抓住了他们?  - 他们是关键人物
- You took them?  - They're the key.

39
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:23,801
他们会帮我们不费一枪一弹地夺下那个监狱
They're gonna help us take that prison without firing a shot.

40
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:27,400
我们可以占领监狱 而且不必杀掉任何人
We can have it and we don't need to kill anyone.

41
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,901
但是...
But...

42
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:36,267
我们得准备好
we need to be prepared to.

行尸走肉 第四季 第八集

46
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,823
这个监狱里的不都是坏人
The people in this prison, not all of them are bad.

47
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:19,557
但大多数都是小偷
But most of them are thieves,

48
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:22,823
或者杀人犯
murderers.

49
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,491
为什么那样的人每天都平安无事
Now why should people like that have peace of mind

50
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,990
可我们每天都要埋掉同伴?
when we're burying our own just about every day?

51
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,724
这些人把我弄伤...
These people, they mutilated me...

52
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:36,090
烧了我的营地...
burned my camp...

53
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:40,190
还杀了我女儿
killed my daughter.

54
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,758
你们看到了... 我尽力了
Now you saw me... I tried.

55
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,823
我曾想过去死
I tried to die.

56
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:49,157
因为我不想接受命运安排
'Cause I didn't want to accept that you couldn't live

57
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:51,691
不想靠屠戮别人来生存
in this world without getting blood on your hands.

58
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:54,157
现在找到了你们 我又想活下去
I found you people and I don't want to die.

59
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:56,957
我不希望你们死去
I don't want you to die.

60
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:02,524
现在我们该行动了
Now we need to move... now.

61
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:04,457
他们会发现自己人失踪了
They're gonna realize their people are gone

62
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,190
他们会为接下来发生的事做好准备
and they're gonna start getting ready for whatever's next.

63
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,157
我们要出其不意 让他们恐惧
We need to surprise them. Scare them.

64
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:13,124
怎么样?
Huh?

65
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,190
我们会赢的
And we will win.

66
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:24,024
我加入
I'm in.

67
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:26,857
- 我加入  - 我也是
- I'm in.  - Me, too.

68
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,291
收拾东西 准备出发
Pack up and get ready.

69
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,157
半小时后部署计划
We'll go over the plan in half an hour.

70
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:32,691
- 来吧  - 我们走
- Come on.  - Let's do it.

71
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,491
Megan呢?
Where's Megan?

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,424
在车里看书
She's reading in the trailer.

73
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,857
你都听见了?
You hear all that?

74
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:50,357
我们没必要为了别的住所而开战
I said we didn't have to fight for another place.

75
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,691
我知道
I know.

76
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,357
要杀人?
Killing people?

77
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:58,923
不 以暴制暴
No. Killing killers.

78
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,957
你说他们不都是坏人
You said they weren't all bad people.

79
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:03,391
可他们和坏人在一起
Well, they're with bad people.

80
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,857
我也是吗?
Am I?

81
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:12,557
我会让你活下去
I'm gonna keep you alive.

82
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,990
我会让Megan活下去
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

83
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,424
唯一对我重要的事就是
The only judgment on me I care about

84
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:20,257
你们俩是否还活着
is whether you two are still breathing.

85
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,457
你能听见很好
It's good that you heard,

86
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,391
能明白更好
that you know.

87
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:31,391
Lily... 我爱你
Lily... I love you.

88
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,857
我看不透你了
I don't know who you are.

89
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:38,890
你说有更好的地方
Hey, you told me there has to be someplace better

90
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,857
而我在帮你找到它
and that I was gonna help you find it.

91
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,124
你懂我的 Lily
You knew me, Lily.

92
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:47,024
一切都不会变的
It was always gonna be like this.

93
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,624
你也得收拾东西了
You need to pack up, too.

94
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:02,758
别碰我
Don't touch me.

95
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:06,224
放开我
Get off me.

96
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:29,190
吃点东西 这一天会很漫长
You should eat. It's gonna be a long day.

97
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,057
没人会伤害你们
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

98
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,090
我不相信
I don't believe that.

99
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,024
是吗 我可不在乎
Well, I don't care.

100
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,424
告诉我这是为什么
Just tell us what this is.

101
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,591
求你了
Please.

102
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,857
无关个人恩怨
It isn't personal.

103
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,324
那是怎么回事?
Then what is it?

104
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,291
Michonne 我希望你知道...
Michonne, I want you to know...

105
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,923
我的女儿Penny
Penny, my daughter,

106
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:57,823
她早死了 我现在懂了
she was dead. I know that now.

107
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,691
我不想伤害你
Now, I don't want to hurt you.

108
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,157
我不想伤害任何人
I don't want to hurt anyone.

109
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,823
我只想要那座监狱
I need the prison, that's it.

110
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,790
我有我要守护的人
There are people I need to keep alive.

111
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,658
你俩将是我夺回监狱的筹码
You two are gonna help me take it.

112
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,057
没有人会死
No one needs to die.

113
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,291
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

114
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,057
你不会的
No, you won't.

115
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,823
- 我要用我...  - 别说了
- I'm gonna take my...  - Stop it.

116
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,457
你想要那座监狱？
You want the prison?

117
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:22,024
是的 尽量和平
Yeah. And I'll take it as peacefully as I can.

118
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,224
- 总督...  - 别叫我总督
- Governor...  - Don't call me that.

119
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:29,557
你的人和我们的人
Your people, our people,

120
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:32,524
我们可以找到共同生存的办法
we can find a way to live together.

121
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:36,090
你要守护的这些人
These people you need to keep alive,

122
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,391
你爱他们吗?
do you love them?

123
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,224
Hershel 你是个好人
You're a good man, Hershel.

124
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:43,624
比Rick好
A better man than Rick.

125
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:46,090
你说的这些事 还有你说的方式
Everything you've said, the way you've said it,

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,557
你已经变了 Rick也一样
you've changed. So has Rick.

127
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:53,424
我们俩不会在一起生活
The two of us will never be able to live together.

128
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:55,923
我和Michonne永远不会在一起生活
Michonne and I, we'll never be able to live together.

129
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,957
- 一定能想出办法  - 我找到了办法!
- We'll find a way.  - I found a way!

130
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,724
我很努力了
I'm trying hard.

131
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:09,524
想夺回监狱有许多方式
There's all kinds of ways I could do this.

132
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,024
而选这种方式 你们会活下去 我会...
This way, you get to live and I get to be...

133
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,758
你说你会尽量和平地
You say you want to take this prison

134
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:27,057
夺下这座监狱
as peacefully as possible.

135
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:30,024
也就是说为了夺下它 你会伤害别人
That means you'd be willing to hurt people to get it.

136
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:32,524
我的女儿也在那
My daughters would be there.

137
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:35,724
你会伤害她
That's who you'd be hurting.

138
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,157
如果你能理解一个父亲的感受
If you understand what it's like to have a daughter,

139
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:45,823
怎么还会去伤害别人的女儿?
then how can you threaten to kill someone else's?

140
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:52,224
因为那不是我的女儿
Because they aren't mine.

141
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,524
准备好了吗?
Ready?

142
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:13,157
- 拿着  - 好的
- Here, take this.  - Okay.

143
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,623
我们回来之前 他们会很安全
They'll be safe here until we get back.

144
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,657
行尸们过不了这条河
Biters can't make it across the water.

145
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:27,124
既然在河边会安全 何不去河边找一个地方
If it's safe by the water, then let's just go someplace by the water.

146
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,057
- Lily  - 你不必这么做
- Lily.  - You don't have to do this.

147
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,191
所有真正安全的地方
Anyplace that's safe, really safe,

148
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,191
都被人捷足先登了
someone's already there.

149
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,524
想想Megan吧 好吗？
Think about Megan, huh?

150
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,124
我在想
I am.

151
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:44,590
在这样的环境里 她怎么办?
What's she gonna be in this world?

152
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,690
她会活得好好的
She's gonna be alive.

153
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,324
在做泥浆馅饼?
Making mud pies?

154
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:13,157
是奶油花生三明治
Peanut butter sandwiches.

155
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,124
来个临别拥抱怎么样?
How about a hug before I go?

156
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,657
我手上都是泥巴 看到了吗?
My hands are muddy. See?

157
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:33,024
哦 是啊
Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:36,857
我可不想弄脏我的外套
Well, I wouldn't want to get my coat dirty.

159
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,757
我把它弄脏了
I messed it all up.

160
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:47,091
不 你让它更好看了
No, you made it better.

161
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:10,690
我好不容易休次假
I could use a vacation.

162
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,057
别打扰我
Get away.

163
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,391
两天就行
Just for a weekend.

164
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:18,357
好的
Yeah.

165
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,690
我们的纪念日要到了
You know, our anniversary is coming up.

166
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,257
是吗?
It is?

167
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,124
就差几天
One of these days.

168
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,558
你去过大瀑布吗?
You ever been to Amicalola Falls?

169
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,590
乔治亚州最大的瀑布
Tallest waterfall in Georgia.

170
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,224
- 没有  - 小时候我爸带我去过
- Mm-mmm.  - My dad took me there when I was little.

171
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:41,324
到了顶部之后
When we were up there,

172
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:44,924
从上面往下看
all the way at the top looking down,

173
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,458
感觉就像在飞一样
I felt like I was flying.

174
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:51,257
我这就去套上马车
I'll go load up the station wagon.

175
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,790
我去给你拿点水
I'm gonna get you some water.

176
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,357
- 我自己能拿  - 我知道
- I can get it.  - I know.

177
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,491
但我想给你拿
But I'm doing it.

178
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:12,324
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

179
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:24,957
你就不能等到我们回来吗?
Man, you couldn't have waited till we got back?

180
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,124
等到Tyreese也回来?
Until Tyreese got back?

181
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,091
那我也能对付得了
I could've handled that.

182
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,491
嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey.

183
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,424
她杀了两个我们自己人
She killed two of our own.

184
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,257
她不能留在这里
She couldn't be here.

185
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,257
她不会有事的
She's gonna be all right.

186
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:42,623
她有车 有补给品 有武器
She has a car, supplies, weapons.

187
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,191
她知道如何生存
She's a survivor.

188
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:46,690
你不要自欺欺人了
Stop saying that like you don't believe it.

189
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:55,357
她杀了人 说是为了我们
She did it. She said it was for us.

190
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,458
她确实是那么想的
That's how it was in her head.

191
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,324
她一点也不愧疚
She wasn't sorry.

192
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:03,357
没错 她做了 但她是迫不得已
Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

193
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,824
我们要怎么处置那两个女孩?
What are we supposed to do about those two girls?

194
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:15,057
我答应她要照顾她们
I told her we'd look after them.

195
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:26,224
我还没告诉Tyreese
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

196
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,657
不知道他会有什么反应
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

197
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:40,824
走去试试吧
Let's go find out.

198
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,790
等等 Bob
Bob.

199
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,124
你应该去休息
You should be resting.

200
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:08,357
昨晚那么累 你也应该休息
After the night you had, so should you.

201
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,091
我正想去休息
I'm going to.

202
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,558
我打算先去C区找个空房间
On my way to find an open cell in C block

203
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,723
直到D区被打扫干净
until D gets cleaned up.

204
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:19,057
我想告诉你
I just wanted to say

205
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,424
谢谢你
thank you.

206
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,957
如果没有你和Hershel 我不知道
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Hershel

207
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:27,024
自己会在哪里
and you.

208
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:31,124
你应该谢Hershel 别谢我
Hershel, not me.

209
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,224
- 你也帮忙救了我  - 别说了
- You helped save my life.  - Stop.

210
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,623
- Bob  - 别说了
- Bob.  - Stop.

211
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,924
你把药物加到了我的输液袋
You put those meds in my IV bag.

212
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:38,391
所以现在的我
And now, in a couple minutes,

213
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,391
才能再次见到阳光
I'm gonna feel the sun on my skin.

214
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,091
所以我必须要谢谢你
So you are gonna let me thank you.

215
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,558
Sasha啊
Sasha.

216
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,590
你还很虚弱
You're not strong enough yet.

217
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,391
那就帮帮我
Then help me.

218
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,157
Tyreese 你在吗?
Tyreese. You down here?

219
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:07,091
Rick 是你吗?
Rick, that you?

220
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,690
你们一定要看看这个
You guys got to see this.

221
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,957
能等会再看吗? 我们想和你说点事情
Can we take a beat? There's something we need to talk about.

222
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:20,157
不能等 快过来
It can wait. Come on.

223
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:30,091
看
Look.

224
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,623
什么东西?
The hell?

225
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:39,391
刚刚我正在找...
I was just looking for...

226
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:41,157
原因...
answers...

227
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:43,558
然后就发现了这个
and I found this.

228
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:48,224
与杀死Karen和David的是同一个人
Same person that killed Karen and David did this.

229
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,357
还记得篱笆那里的老鼠吗?
Remember the rats at the fence?

230
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,623
她死的那天老鼠也出现了
They showed up the same day she was killed.

231
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:54,723
这里住着一个神经病
We got a psychopath living with us.

232
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,824
- Tyreese  - 得把他抓住 Rick
- Tyreese.  - We got to find him, Rick.

233
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,957
要不然我可不敢闭眼睡觉
And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.

234
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,458
Tyreese啊...
Tyreese...

235
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,690
杀死老鼠的
whoever did this,

236
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,857
和杀死Karen的不是同一个人
I don't think that's who killed Karen.

237
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,890
你怎么知道?
Why?

238
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:14,890
快走
Come on.

239
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,657
躲好!
Get back!

240
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,757
Rick啊!
Rick!

241
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,191
过来
Come down here.

242
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:40,324
我们谈谈
We need to talk.

243
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,590
我说的不算
It's not up to me.

244
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,590
这里的委员会才能做决定
There's a council now. They run this place.

245
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,857
Hershel是委员会成员吗?
Is Hershel on the council?

246
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:22,057
Michonne是吗?
What about Michonne?

247
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:26,024
她也是委员会成员?
She on the council, too?

248
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:32,491
这里不是我说的算了
I don't make decisions anymore.

249
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,590
今天就是你说了算 Rick
You're making the decisions today, Rick.

250
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,424
过来
Come down here.

251
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:43,657
我们谈谈吧
Let's have that talk.

252
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:25,624
我们能行的 明白吗?
We can do this. All right?

253
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,891
我们没法对付那么多人
We can't take 'em all on.

254
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,624
我们首先穿过指挥大楼
We'll go through the admin building,

255
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:06,224
再按计划穿过树荫
through the woods like we planned.

256
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,791
我们的人数已经没有优势了
We ain't got the numbers no more.

257
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,290
上次检查汽车上的藏身之处是什么时候?
When's the last time someone checked the stash on the bus?

258
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,257
在我们去Big Spot搜寻物资的前一天
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

259
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:15,357
那时我们的给养就不足 现在更少了
We were running low on rations then. We're lower now.

260
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,858
会有办法的 如果有情况
Yeah, we'll manage. Things go south,

261
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,858
就让大家都上车 你去通知大家
everyone heads for that bus. Let everybody know.

262
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:23,224
如果大家不知道情况发生呢?
What if everybody doesn't know when things go bad?

263
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:24,958
我们能等多久?
How long do we wait?

264
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,257
尽量等吧
As long as we can.

265
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:34,891
快把他们放了
Let 'em go right now.

266
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,424
我留在这里
I'll stay down here.

267
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:41,691
你想说什么都行
Talk as long as you want.

268
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,724
但要先把他们放了
But you let 'em go.

269
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,557
你们都有坦克了 不需要人质
You got a tank. You don't need hostages.

270
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:49,390
需要
I do.

271
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,324
坦克只是为了让你们知道 我是玩真的
This is just to show you I'm serious.

272
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,990
但我不想在我的新家上开个洞
Not to blast a hole in our new home.

273
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,324
太阳下山之前 你和他们撤出这里
You and your people, you have till sundown to get out of here

274
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,824
否则他们就没命了
or they die.

275
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,924
必须要这样吗
Doesn't have to go down this way.

276
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:09,424
我们人数更多 火力更强
I got more people, more firepower.

277
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:14,824
我们想要这座监狱
We need this prison.

278
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,757
就这么简单
There it is.

279
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:24,924
这跟以前的恩怨无关 只与现在有关
It's not about the past. It's about right now.

280
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,958
这里有孩子啊
There are children here.

281
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,824
其中几个孩子病了 要是转移 他们就活不了
Some of them are sick. They won't survive.

282
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:38,157
我有坦克
I have a tank.

283
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,624
还放你们离开
And I'm letting you walk away from here.

284
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,457
还废什么话呢?
What else is there to talk about?

285
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,157
你还好吗?
You good?

286
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:15,557
嗯
Yeah.

287
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,057
拿着
All right.

288
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:23,591
妈咪 你能来帮我挖吗?
Mommy, can you please help me dig?

289
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,390
妈咪 帮我一下嘛
Mommy, can you please help me?

290
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,057
我这就来 宝贝
I'll be right there, honey.

291
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:43,491
妈咪 好重啊
Mommy, it's too heavy.

292
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,757
听到了 马上就来
I hear you. I'll be there in a sec.

293
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,457
抱歉 宝贝 你刚刚说什么?
I'm sorry, honey. What did you say?

294
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:17,257
没事了 我自己能行
It's okay. I can do it myself.

295
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,858
Megan! Megan啊!
Megan! Megan!

296
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:02,457
妈咪! 妈咪!
Mommy! Mommy!

297
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,557
妈咪!
Mommy!

298
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,824
Megan啊!
Megan!

299
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:18,824
我可以把你们打死
I could shoot you all.

300
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,858
你们会还击 我知道
You'd all shoot back. I know that.

301
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,090
但胜利会属于我们 你们会死
But we'll win and you'll be dead.

302
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,757
一个不剩
All of you.

303
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,023
不一定非要走到那一步
Doesn't have to be like that.

304
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:31,023
就像我说的 看你们怎么选了
Like I said, it's your choice.

305
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:57,824
响声只会招致更多的行尸
Noise will only draw more of them over.

306
00:24:57,824 --> 00:25:00,891
等得越久
The longer you wait,

307
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,357
你们离开时越不容易
the harder it will be for you to get out of here.

308
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:11,524
我们得采取点措施
We got to do something.

309
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,691
你爸爸正在想办法
Your dad's got it.

310
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:15,190
他们只是在谈话
They're talking.

311
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,958
我们应该立即干掉总督
We could kill the Governor right now.

312
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,324
- 从50码之外?  - 我是个神枪手
- From 50 yards?  - I'm a good shot.

313
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:22,824
我可以让他一枪毙命
I could end this right now.

314
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:25,457
要是没打中我们就惨了
Yeah, or you could start something else.

315
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,190
你要相信他
You got to trust him.

316
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,858
你们要去哪里?
Where are you guys going?

317
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:40,224
- 去车上 一起走吧  - 不
- To the bus. Come on.  - No.

318
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:43,424
你知道的 我们得按照计划赶紧过去
You know the plan. That's where we're supposed to go.

319
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,891
Carol告诉我们要坚强
Carol told us to be strong.

320
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:48,190
我们要保护自己 他们有枪
To protect ourselves. They have guns.

321
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,324
我们也应该有枪
We should have guns, too.

322
00:25:50,324 --> 00:25:51,858
我们应该去帮忙
We should help.

323
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:58,990
距离太阳下山还有半个小时
You got maybe about an hour of sunlight left.

324
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,891
我建议你们快去收拾收拾
I suggest you start packing.

325
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:18,457
拖得越久
The longer you wait,

326
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:20,724
离开的时候越艰难
the harder it's gonna be for you to get out of here.

327
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,924
我们...
We can all...

328
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,858
我们可以共享监狱
we can all live together.

329
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:39,557
这里的房间足够所有人用
There's enough room for all of us.

330
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,824
我知道房间足够
More than enough.

331
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,457
但我的家人如果和你们共处一室
But I don't think my family would sleep well

332
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:47,324
他们晚上会睡不安稳的
knowing that you were under the same roof.

333
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,891
我们可以去别的区域住
We'd live in different cell blocks.

334
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,090
我们可以不用碰面
We'd never have to see each other

335
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,224
除非你想
till we're all ready.

336
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,390
这个方法可行
It could work.

337
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,290
你知道的
You know it could.

338
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,457
本来是可以的
It could've.

339
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,724
但现在不行了
But it can't.

340
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,290
在伍德伯里事件发生之后
Not after Woodbury.

341
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,457
在Andrea遭遇了那些之后
Not after Andrea.

342
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:14,157
我知道那样不容易
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

343
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:17,990
我知道那比站在这里
Fact is, it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder

344
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,691
互相射击要难得多
than standing here shooting at each other.

345
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,990
但我们别无选择
But I don't think we have a choice.

346
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:29,757
我们是没的选 但你们有的选
We don't. You do.

347
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:32,457
我们不会离开的
We're not leaving.

348
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,190
如果你逼我们 我们就还击
You try and force us, we'll fight back.

349
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:42,524
如你所言
Like you said,

350
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,491
枪声只会引来更多的行尸
the gunshots will just bring more of them out.

351
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,858
他们会压翻篱笆
They'll take down the fences.

352
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:49,357
没有篱笆 这里毫无用处
Without the fences, this place is worthless.

353
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:54,524
要么就一起住在这座监狱
Now, we can all live in the prison

354
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,324
要么大家都别想住
or none of us can.

355
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,691
我来搞定这破篱笆
We'll fix the damn fences.

356
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,491
不...!
No...!

357
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:24,324
你 那个扎马尾的小姑娘
You. You in the ponytails.

358
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:27,257
这是你想要的结果吗? 你们要的就是这样吗?
Is this what you want? Is this what any of you want?

359
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:30,657
你们想要的和我们一样
What we want is what you got.

360
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:30,657
我们要的 就是你们的所有
What we want is what you got.

361
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,958
至少现在是
Period.

362
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,990
你该走了 混蛋
Time for you to leave, asshole.

363
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,591
听着 我以前和他争过
Look, I fought him before.

364
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,324
但之后 我们收纳了他的老朋友
And after, we took in his old friends.

365
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:44,491
他们也变成了领导
They've become leaders in what we have here.

366
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,924
只要你们放下武器
Now you put down your weapons,

367
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:49,791
走进来...
walk through those gates...

368
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,591
就是我们的一员
you're one of us.

369
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:07,424
我们都放下芥蒂
We let go of all of it,

370
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:09,624
不用牺牲任何人
and nobody dies.

371
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,123
所有现在还活着的人
Everyone who's alive right now.

372
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:20,057
所有撑到了现在的人
Everyone who's made it this far.

373
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:22,491
我们都为了活下去
We've all done the worst kinds of things

374
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,491
不择手段过
just to stay alive.

375
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,224
但我们还是会恢复善良本性
But we can still come back.

376
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,757
我们并没有无药可救
We're not too far gone.

377
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:36,290
我们必须恢复本性
We get to come back.

378
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,157
我知道...
I know...

379
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:42,290
我们都可以改变
we all can change.

380
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:06,924
骗子
Liar.

381
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,924
不!
No!

382
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:32,990
爸爸!
Daddy!

383
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,924
你!
You!

384
00:31:26,924 --> 00:31:30,324
拿起你的武器! 开枪!
Pick up your weapon! Fight, now!

385
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,257
这不对
This isn't right.

386
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,891
- 我们本不应该这么做  - 就应该这么做
- We're not supposed to be doing this.  - We are.

387
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:51,290
他用剑把一个人的脑袋砍下来了
He chopped a guy's head off with a sword.

388
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,657
我们得待在这儿 太迟了
We have to stay here. It's too late.

389
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:11,290
听懂了吗?
You understand me?

390
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,457
跟在我身后 如果我们走散了
Stay behind me and if we get separated,

391
00:32:13,457 --> 00:32:15,224
就找个安全的地方躲起来
you just go run somewhere safe and hide.

392
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,457
听懂了吗? 你找个安全的地方躲起来
You hear me? You go someplace safe and hide

393
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:20,657
等事情结束了 我就去找你 一定会找到你的
and I will find you when this is all over. I will find you.

394
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:22,624
用车撞开栅栏
Go through the fence in your cars.

395
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,990
拿上枪 我们冲进去
Get your guns, we go in.

396
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,932
杀光他们
Kill them all.

397
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:30,035
明白! 大家冲进去!
Roger that! Move it!

398
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:05,023
快!
Go ahead!

399
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,957
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo.

400
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,791
去巴士那边 我来掩护你
Run for the bus. I'll cover you.

401
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:26,491
开炮!
Move up!

402
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:41,457
快! 离开这里!
Go! Get out of here!

403
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:58,457
- 快上车! 快点!  - Glenn还在里面 我得去救他
- Go, go! Come on!  - Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

404
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:00,858
- 我和你一起去  - 让大家上车
- I'm going with you.  - Get these people on the bus.

405
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,990
- 准备好开车离开 我马上回来  - 如果你没回来呢?
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back.  - What if you're not?

406
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,824
- 那就别等我们了  - 我不会抛下你的
- You have to go without us.  - I won't go without you.

407
00:34:04,824 --> 00:34:07,257
Beth 让大家上车 好吗?
Beth, get these people on the bus, okay?

408
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,290
这是你的任务 我们都有任务要完成
It's your job. We've all got jobs to do.

409
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,791
- Glenn!  - 到底发生了什么事?
- Glenn!  - What the hell's going on?

410
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:30,457
我们得把所有人都撤出去
We have to get everybody out of here.

411
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:18,990
Beth! Beth呢?
Beth! Where's Beth?

412
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,923
- 她去找你了  - 她去哪儿了?
- She went to find you.  - Where?

413
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:23,057
我们会找到她的 她会没事的
We'll find her. She'll be okay.

414
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:25,257
- 不  - 什么? 不行 你不能一个人去
- No.  - What? No, you're not going by yourself.

415
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,391
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

416
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,691
嘿 Maggie...
Maggie...

417
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:12,890
小心右边
On your right.

418
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:18,791
炸弹!
Grenade!

419
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,923
Sasha! Sasha! 你看到Beth了吗?
Sasha! Sasha! Have you seen Beth?

420
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,190
- 她在车上吗?  - 不 她不在...
- Is she on the bus?  - No. She's...

421
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,923
我们得蹲低一些
We gotta stay down.

422
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:42,257
拉开我的衬衫 看看有没有子弹射出的伤口
Look inside my shirt. Check my back for an exit wound.

423
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:43,957
有
