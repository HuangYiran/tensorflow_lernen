1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,780
公司給我們發了這該死的智能手機
Work gave us these stupid smartphones,

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,360
老娘根本就不懂用
and I don't know how to use it.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,020
請問您需要什么幫助
How can I help you?

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,990
我跟你說了  別再打電話給我了
I told you, stop calling me.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,480
你打錯電話了
You have the wrong number.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,510
別再煩我老婆了
Leave my wife alone.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,520
您是想離開您的老婆嗎
You'd like to leave your wife?

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,230
正在搜索您所在區域的離婚律師
Searching for divorce attorneys in your area.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,710
我可沒這么說  你這家庭破壞狂魔
That's not what I said, home wrecker!

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,090
二位  二位  那并不是真人
Guys, guys, guys, that's not a person.

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,040
那是個智能私人助理系統
It's an automated personal assistant.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,070
等你搞清楚那手機的各種酷炫功能
When you figure out all the cool stuff that phone does,

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,050
你一定會愛死它的
you're gonna love it.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,430
好吧  我們的經理也是這么說的
Yeah, that's what our manager at work said.

15
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,090
然后她宣布了一堆新的公司規章制度
And then she hit us with a ton of new corporate policies.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,320
他們要求我們把打掃的那些房子拍下來
They want us to take pictures of the houses we clean.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,380
擺明了不信任我們嘛
Which means they don't trust us.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
真煩  這樣我們就得真槍實彈地搞打掃了
Which sucks 'cause now we have to really clean the houses.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,010
至少你有了一款酷炫的新手機啊
Well, at least you got a cool new phone out of it.

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,090
我討厭這個  太復雜了
I hate it. It's too complicated.

21
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,760
在上班路上  我的屁股不小心打給伯特三次
I butt-dialed Burt three times on the way to work.

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,070
你的屁股雖然說不了話
Your butt makes up for in appearance

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,970
但至少長得不錯
what it lacks in communication skills.

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,020
那可真了不起
That's pretty impressive.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,160
我的屁股只有兩個功能
My butt has only two tricks.

26
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,170
第一個  惡心了點
One is, uh, disgusting,

27
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,390
另一個就是穿上牛仔褲看著很正
and the other is looking amazing in jeans.

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,870
既然你現在有了新手機
Now that you have a new phone,

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,340
你可以在維基視頻上關注我
you can follow me on WikiVids.

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,400
維基視頻是什么
What's WikiVids?

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,570
是個網站  我把自己煎好的蛋拍成視頻傳上去
It's a site where I post videos of the eggs I make

32
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,440
再加上一些有趣的評論
and my funny little comments about them.

33
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,840
我其實就是描述一下它們的外形
I kind of interpret what they look like.

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,630
我把這個稱作"小野洋蛋"
I call this one "Yolko Ono."

35
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,510
影射小野洋子導致列儂婚姻的破裂

36
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,510
看到那個蛋把薯餅分成兩半了嗎
See how the egg broke up the hash browns?

37
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,850
瞧瞧啊
Oh, look at that.

38
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,550
那簡直是藝術啊
Now, that is art.

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,230
你應該開個博物館
You should open up a museum

40
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,110
把這些菜端上來
where you bring these out to people,

41
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,500
人們可以去吃
and then they get to eat it.

42
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,440
那不就是個餐館嗎
Isn't that just a restaurant?

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,280
什么都被別人先想到了
Everything's been done!

44
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,810
其實  如果你那么討厭自己的手機
You know, if you hate your phone so much,

45
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,880
我們可以換一下的
we could switch phones.

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,180
我的翻蓋手機拍照很模糊的
My flip phone takes lousy pictures,

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,930
那樣的話  你就不用打掃得那么干凈了
so you don't have to clean that good.

48
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,310
是啊  我覺得我們是可以...
Yeah, I guess we could do...

49
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,990
他想要從我們這里得到東西
He wants something from us.

50
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,430
我們也要從他那里獲得一些好處
We should get something in return.

51
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,120
你是想玩  "選口袋  選口袋
You thinking "Pick-a-Pocket, Pick-a-Pocket,

52
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,370
口袋里的東西統統交出來"的游戲嗎
We Want Everything in Your Pockets"?

53
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,260
今天是個好時機  吉米穿的是多袋工作褲
It's a good day for it. Jimmy's wearing cargo pants.

54
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,530
我們能讓他跳一下嗎
Ooh, can we make him jump?

55
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,100
不行  不行  你們知道規則的
No, no, no, no, no, you know the rules.

56
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,350
一次轉身一個口袋  不許摸不許反悔
One turn, one pocket, no touching, no whining.

57
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,060
我要選
I-I'm gonna go...

58
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,900
右邊  左邊
right... left...

59
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,880
右邊  左邊
right... left...

60
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,700
右邊那只前口袋
Right front!

61
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,700
該死  怎么著我們都是拿到手機
Oh, damn, we were getting that anyway.

62
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,360
其他口袋里都有些什么
What was in the other pockets?

63
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,510
鑰匙
Keys!

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
錢包
Wallet!

65
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,230
水果派
Fruit pie!

66
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,410
天啊  我們該對水果派下手的
Oh, man, we could have had a fruit pie!

67
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,080
我想再來一個面包卷
I want another roll.

68
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,900
抱歉  曾奶奶  我做得不夠
Sorry, Maw Maw, I didn't make enough

69
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,500
不夠你們各分兩個
for both of you to have two.

70
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,120
你只能和喜旺平分了
You're gonna have to split it with Hope.

71
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,680
話說  在新的公司規章制度上
You know, there's a lot of really great stuff

72
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,420
加了很多好規定啊
in these new corporate policies.

73
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,770
一周帶薪年假
I mean, a week's paid vacation,

74
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,190
-401K -401千米
- 401K... - 401K?

75
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,190
401K為美國養老保險制度
音同410千米

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,410
免了  謝謝
No, thanks.

77
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,880
我之前跑了五千米就差點吐了
I ran a 5K once and almost puked.

78
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,550
嘿  你竟然有醫療保險呢
Oh, hey, you get health care.

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,780
實際上  這保險范圍還包括配偶
Actually, it says spouses are covered, too.

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,510
你們終于能看得起醫生了
You guys could finally go to the doctor.

81
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,600
我們可沒生病
We're not sick.

82
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,350
不必非得等生病了再去看醫生吧
You don't have to be sick to go to the doctor.

83
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,830
如果沒生病  干嘛去看醫生啊
Why would you go to a doctor if you're not sick?

84
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,190
難道是去打招呼嗎
Like, to say hello?

85
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,400
你好啊  醫生
Hello, Doctor.

86
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,300
你好  伯特  你還好嗎
Hello, Burt. How are you?

87
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,320
反正沒病
Not sick.

88
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
太好了  謝謝你順道來看我
Wonderful. Thanks for stopping by.

89
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,990
好吧
Fine.

90
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,430
好好享受你的碳水化合物吧  小胖子
Enjoy the carbs, fatso.

91
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,430
吃碳水化合物易長胖

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,040
各位  你們必須定期做檢查
Guys, you have to get checkups.

93
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,200
不然小毛病會變成大問題的
Otherwise little things, they turn into big things.

94
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,930
小洞不補  大洞吃苦
It only takes one spark to burn down the whole forest.

95
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,080
我唯一看的醫生就是殷道道
The only doctor I go to is Dr. Vajajay.

96
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,950
他是印度人  名字就是那樣的
He's Indian. That's his name.

97
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,270
他是我的婦科醫生
He looks after my hoo-hah.

98
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,690
真惡心
Gross.

99
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,910
我敢跟你保證  一點都不惡心
I assure you, it is not.

100
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,880
好了  這是勒布朗·詹姆斯和飛天巨桃
Okay, this is LeBron James and the Giant Peach.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,930
你在干什么呢
What are you doing?

102
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,820
我打算將水果和蔬菜弄成著名運動員的樣子
I'm gonna make videos of fruits and vegetables

103
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,570
然后拍些視頻
made to look like famous athletes.

104
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,240
我這里有韋恩·葡萄茨基[冰球運動員]
I've got Wayne Grapesky,

105
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,240
梨·布萊恩[貝爾·布萊恩/橄欖球運動員]
Pear Bryant.

106
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,510
我還在想一個棒球選手
Uh, I'm trying to think of a baseball player

107
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,340
可以用草莓來弄  不過
I could use for strawberries, but...

108
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,910
暫時沒什么靈感
nothing's coming to me.

109
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,920
你不覺得這不夠原創嗎
Don't you think it's a little derivative?

110
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,320
不  那是個大桃子呢
No, it's a big peach.

111
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,290
我是說這不是你自己的主意
I mean it's not very original.

112
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,520
我也是拍食物的
I do food.

113
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,710
你這是在抄襲我的創意
You're just copying my idea.

114
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,430
那又怎樣  不過是愚蠢的視頻而已
So? It's just a silly video thing.

115
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,010
愚蠢的視頻而已
A silly video thing?

116
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,560
我覺得那28位
I think the 28 people

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,850
關注"塞布麗娜每日蛋黃秀"的人
who follow "Sabrina's Yolk of the Day"

118
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,340
可不同意你的觀點
might disagree with you.

119
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,780
等一下
Wait a minute.

120
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,400
草莓·邦茲
Strawberry Bonds.

121
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,120
貝瑞·邦茲  美國職業棒球選手

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,120
我真是夠蠢的
Oh, how dumb am I?

123
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,640
你腳趾上那個斑怎么了
What's going on with your toe freckle?

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,850
我不知道
I'm not sure.

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
我有點擔心  它越來越大了
I'm worried it's getting bigger.

126
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,210
或許是因為你的腳趾變小了吧
Maybe your toe is getting smaller.

127
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,920
那也一樣令人擔憂啊
Well, that worries me, too.

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,780
不管是哪個原因
Either one of those things

129
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,830
都可能是最終釀成大禍的小火星
could be the spark that starts the fire.

130
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,920
那是塞布麗娜關于醫生的看法
That's what Sabrina said about the doctor.

131
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,340
我也在想那事  聽著
I've been thinking about that, too. Listen.

132
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,980
我覺得我的脖子響得更嚴重了
I think my neck crack's getting worse.

133
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,120
就好像有人在我腦袋底下做爆米花
Sounds like someone's making popcorn under my head.

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,570
我的耳朵也會時不時很痛
Sometimes my ear just starts hurting.

135
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,350
比如我站在某個地方
Like, I'll just be standing somewhere,

136
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,890
然后突然間
and then, suddenly, ow!

137
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,100
又疼了嗎
Did it just happen?

138
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,050
沒有  我在演啦
No, I was just dramatizing.

139
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,630
每周也就一兩次
It only happens a couple times a week.

140
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,180
你知道嗎  我有時撒尿
You know what else? Sometimes when I pee,

141
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,540
尿會分叉
it comes out in two different directions.

142
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,890
我也只是在演而已
I'm dramatizing, too.

143
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,560
我早餐后會眼皮跳
My after-breakfast eye twitch

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,870
現在有時會一直持續到午餐時間
is now sometimes lasting all the way till lunch.

145
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,380
無論我喝多少咖啡來放松自己
No matter how much coffee I drink to relax myself,

146
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,690
就是停不下來
it just doesn't stop!

147
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,900
我這樣做的時候  下巴會疼得超厲害
My jaw hurts like crazy when I go like this.

148
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,590
-那看起來就很疼  -沒錯
- Ooh, that looks painful. - It is.

149
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,490
我不想承認  但是塞布麗娜說得對
I hate to say it, but maybe Sabrina was right.

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,150
我們該去看醫生了
We need to see a doctor.

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,030
也許有些事情上她是對的
Maybe she was right about other things.

152
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,290
你真信世界上有個叫乍得的國家嗎[非洲國家]
Do you really think there's a country called Chad?

153
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,250
信啊  而且那里的每個人都帶著網球拍
Yeah, and everyone there carries a a tennis racket

154
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,450
披著一件毛衣  袖子系在肩上
and wears a sweater tied around their shoulders.

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,610
我開始焦慮了
I'm starting to get worried.

156
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,070
每項癥狀我都有
I think I have everything.

157
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,820
肌無力  有
Muscle weakness? Check.

158
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,250
疲勞  有
Fatigue? Check.

159
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,330
付款方式  有
Form of payment? Check.

160
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,800
我知道  我會眩暈嗎
I know. Do I get dizzy?

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,260
如果你一直轉圈的話
When you spin around a lot.

162
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,270
該死
Damn it!

163
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,830
維吉妮亞·吉斯
Virginia Chance?

164
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,130
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

165
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,470
中招了
Gotcha!

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,870
我喜歡這招
I love that one.

167
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,530
對我所有的新病人都玩這招
Do it to all my new patients.

168
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,450
我的理念是  沒保險的話 
My philosophy is, laughter is the best medicine.

169
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,780
開懷大笑是一方良藥
Unless you have insurance.

170
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,450
有保險的話  那藥就是最好的藥
In that case, medicine is the best medicine.

171
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,410
好了
Okay.

172
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,870
進來檢查吧
Let's go look under your hood.

173
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,460
要堅強哦
Stay strong.

174
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,520
毫迪超市

175
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,840
各位  我一般不發什么東西灑了的視頻  但是
Hey, guys, I don't usually post spill videos, but...

176
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,690
長著林肯的頭的鱷魚也不是每天都能看到的
you don't see a crocodile with Abe Lincoln's head every day.

177
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,310
各位
Guys?

178
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,210
好了
All right, well,

179
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,680
這太逗了  但我們應該
that was an amusing diversion, but we should...

180
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,040
你知道嗎  雞可以明天再漂白
Oh, you know what? We can bleach the chicken tomorrow.

181
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
咱再看一遍吧
Let's watch it again.

182
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,880
你們在看我的"今日蛋黃秀"視頻嗎
You guys watching my daily "Yolk of the Day" Video?

183
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,440
不是  吉米在維基視頻發了一段超搞笑的
No. Jimmy posted this hilarious new WikiVid.

184
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,070
你可能該去查查你的膽固醇水平了
And you should probably get your cholesterol checked.

185
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,370
讓我看看
Let me see this.

186
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,350
最好別跟食物有關
This better not be food-related.

187
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,300
我從來都不喜歡三個臭皮匠
I was never a fan of the Three Stooges.

188
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:11,870
吉米@維基視頻

189
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,320
我覺得他們滿身是汗  笨手笨腳
I found them sweaty and clumsy

190
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,270
一點也不好玩
and not very entertaining.

191
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,280
說直白點  我就是這么叫
To be clear, the Three Stooges

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,250
威爾弗里德的生殖器的
is what I called Wilfrid's genitals.

193
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,780
除非你也上年紀了
Unless you are one,

194
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,020
不然老年人都很有意思的
old people are funny.

195
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,930
是啊  我覺得挺有意思的
Yeah. I guess it's funny.

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,410
就是太沒技術含量了
It's a little simple.

197
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,490
沒技術含量
Simple?

198
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,780
是啊  當你有27個粉絲時
Yeah. I mean, when you have as many

199
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,510
他們希望你從藝術和理智層面上
as 27 followers, they want you to challenge them

200
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,140
去挑戰他們
artistically and intellectually.

201
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,770
我還以為你有28個粉絲呢
Oh, I thought you had 28.

202
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,870
我原來有
I did.

203
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,830
很抱歉  塞布麗娜
I'm sorry, Sabrina,

204
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,350
但看完跳小雞舞的修女
but between the nun that does the chicken dance,

205
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,940
彈鋼琴的小貓
the cat that plays the piano

206
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,720
和詹姆士的搞笑新視頻
and James' hysterical new videos,

207
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,380
我實在看不出來那些蛋
I don't have the time to stare at eggs

208
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,520
哪里像史蒂夫·布西密[演員]
until they look like Steve Buscemi.

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,390
好啦
All done.

210
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,470
你都成瞎子了
Oh, you've gone blind.

211
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,690
我們早就該來了
We should have come sooner.

212
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,640
我沒瞎
I'm not blind.

213
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
他們做眼部檢查時  會屏蔽你的瞳孔
When they give you an eye exam, they delete your pupils.

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,370
但好消息就是  我唯一的毛病就是我的眼睛
But the good news is, the only thing wrong with me is my eyes.

215
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,590
戴副眼鏡就沒問題啦
Nothing glasses can't fix.

216
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,140
小方子而已
It's just a slight prescription.

217
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,830
就  就好比是從標準畫質提升到高清畫質
It... it'd be like going from standard definition to high-def.

218
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,540
很抱歉你不得不...
And I'm sorry you have to make such a...

219
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,210
出這么大個洋相
spectacle of yourself.

220
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
你一旦發現自己不是將死之人
He's a lot more funny once you find out

221
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,130
他就好玩多了  你會懂的
you're not dying. You'll see.

222
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,290
盡管花了87年的時間
Well, it took 87 years,

223
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,310
塞布麗娜@維基視頻

224
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,830
但現在  我的脖子終于看起來像我的陰道了
but now, officially, my neck looks like my vagina.

225
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,460
她的脖子看起來確實像陰道
Her neck does look like a vagina.

226
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,250
塞布麗娜在哪里
Where's Sabrina?

227
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,970
她半個小時前去休息了
She took her, uh, break a half hour ago.

228
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,780
不公平  知道嗎
No fair, all right?

229
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,850
你說我的視頻"非研竄"
You said that my video was deflippititive,

230
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,820
現在你才是"非研竄"
and now you're being defibrilitive.

231
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,730
我想你要說的詞是非原創
I think the word you're looking for is derivative.

232
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,930
無所謂  好吧  如果我不能拍食物
Whatever. All right, if I can't film food,

233
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,340
那你也不能利用我的瘋狂曾祖母
then you can't take advantage of my crazy great-grandmother

234
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,930
來娛樂陌生人
to amuse strangers.

235
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,680
-那是我的創意  -拜托
- That's my thing. - Come on.

236
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,950
你和我都應該想錄什么就錄什么
You and I should both be able to record whatever we want...

237
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,970
還真是有27個粉絲的人說出來的話
Sounds like someone with 27 followers talking.

238
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,580
35個了  非常感謝你
35. Thank you very much.

239
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,360
35啊  我記得我有35個粉絲
Oh, 35. I remember when I had 35 followers.

240
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,560
都已經是  新增四個粉絲以前的事了
that was... four followers ago.

241
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,660
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

242
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,480
你的手機是粉色的
Well, your phone is pink.

243
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,830
是啊  無所謂啊  35粉
Yep. Whatever, 35.

244
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,340
都檢查完了  你的眼睛
Well, everything checks out-- your eyes,

245
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,930
你的心臟  血壓都沒問題  你很健康
your heart, blood pressure. You're in great shape.

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,560
那還不錯嘛
Well, that wasn't so bad.

247
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,640
我考慮每隔六七年
I might think about getting a regular checkup

248
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,940
做一次常規檢查
every six or seven years.

249
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,900
有的檢測其實還挺有意思的
Some of those tests were actually kind of fun.

250
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,030
再用那個小錘子給我敲一敲
Do that little hammer again.

251
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,200
太刺激了
That is wild!

252
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,900
敲身體其他部位也會這樣嗎
Does that work on other parts of the body, too?

253
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,390
這樣我就可以在臥室里用神奇的錘子了
'Cause I could really use that magic hammer in the bedroom.

254
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,310
還有一件事
Just, uh, one more thing.

255
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,390
轉身  彎腰  然后
Just turn around, bend over and...

256
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,940
保證你會保守秘密
promise you can keep a secret.

257
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,790
沒問題
All right.

258
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,950
感覺像是你的手指插進了我的后庭
And that feels like your finger in my doggy door.

259
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,730
這只是一項常規檢查  伯特
Oh, it's just a routine test, Burt.

260
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,510
如果你是想讓我的膝蓋動起來
Well, if you're trying to get my knee to move again,

261
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,660
恭喜你  它現在抖得厲害  你可以停手了
it's twitching pretty good, so you can stop now.

262
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,960
我感覺你的前列腺摸有些濕軟
Your prostate feels a little... boggy.

263
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,080
我感覺你的手指有點粗大
And your finger feels a little biggy. Oh!

264
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,350
你多久行一次房事
How of... how often do you have sex?

265
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,170
像這樣嗎  從沒有過
Like this? Never.

266
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,870
不是  是跟你老婆
No, like, with your wife.

267
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,780
行房事對你的前列腺有好處
Sex can be good for your prostate.

268
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,250
我記好了
I'll keep that in mind.

269
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,560
我還要做個結腸鏡檢查
In the meantime, I want to do a colonoscopy

270
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,070
確保你沒有更大的毛病
just to make sure this isn't a sign of a larger problem.

271
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,350
好  總不會比現在做的事更不爽吧
Fine. Can't be any worse than what we're doing now.

272
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,650
我們要從你的肛門插進一個光纖攝像機
Well, we pass a fiber-optic camera through your anus,

273
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,220
稍微查看一下里面的情況
and we have a little look-see.

274
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,870
我錯了
I stand corrected.

275
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,560
簡直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
世界如此清晰
Everything's so clear.

277
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,470
鳥兒  云兒
The birds, the clouds...

278
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,010
連對街的公交長椅我都看得到
I can even see that bus bench all the way across the street.

279
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,460
眼鏡世界全場半價
"50% off glasses at Glasses Land."

280
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,850
要是一個小時前看到的就好了
That would've been nice to know an hour ago.

281
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,490
快走  醫生說我要多行房事
Come on, the doctor said I have to have

282
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,860
讓我的結腸不那么濕軟
more sex to un-bog my colon.

283
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,690
按方抓藥  你的藥抓好了  現在該我了
You got your prescription filled; now it's my turn.

284
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,890
雖然他沒有清楚地把藥方寫下來
He didn't actually write it down,

285
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,470
但我覺得應該每日兩次  飯后服用
but I'm thinking twice daily after meals.

286
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,400
開路
Here we go.

287
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,400
簡直不敢相信世界如此清晰
I can't believe e how clear everything is.

288
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,560
海倫·凱勒[盲人作家]戴上眼鏡后
This is probably what Helen Keller felt like

289
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,960
應該也是這感覺
when she got her glasses.

290
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,370
我第一次這么興奮地復習迎考
This is the first test I'm actually excited to study for.

291
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,840
"灌輸式學習"這個詞是不是就是這么來的
I wonder if this is how they came up with the term "Cramming."

292
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,570
這邊真該好好重漆一下了
We really need to paint out here.

293
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,620
維吉妮亞
Virginia...

294
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,520
抱歉
I'm sorry.

295
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,410
這地毯真是臟死了
This carpet is really stained.

296
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,490
專心點
Focus.

297
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,880
是香蕉皮啊
Oh, that's a banana peel.

298
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,440
之前還以為是我的手鏈
I thought it was my bracelet.

299
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,330
不行  我沒法在這滾床單  伯特
No. I can't have sex in here, Burt.

300
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,360
-這屋子太惡心了  -把眼鏡摘了
- This house is disgusting. - Take the glasses off.

301
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,250
好主意
Oh, good idea.

302
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,910
不行  我做不到啊
No, I can't do this.

303
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,320
我總是在想象我看不到的一切
I just keep imagining everything I'm not seeing.

304
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,870
或許你可以專注于
Well, maybe you should start focusing

305
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,890
你眼前看到的
on what you are seeing.

306
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,680
天吶  你跳性感舞步的時候
Oh, my God... is that the face

307
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,590
就是這幅表情嗎
you make when you do your sexy dance?

308
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,840
這副眼鏡真是坑爹神器
Ah, these glasses are ruining everything!

309
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,910
老爸
Oh, hey, Dad.

310
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,540
怎么樣
How's it going?

311
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,320
我要在一個小時內喝掉一加侖瀉藥
I got to drink a gallon of laxative in an hour.

312
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,100
好消息是
On the plus side,

313
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
我三年級時吞掉的那枚水牛鎳幣
I'm pretty sure that buffalo nickel

314
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,090
終于要重見天日了
I swallowed in third grade is finally gonna resurface.

315
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,520
好吧
Okay, well...

316
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,320
去看看瘋狂的曾奶奶
time to go see if crazy Maw Maw

317
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,200
能不能讓我粉絲破50了
can help me break 50 followers.

318
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,830
曾奶奶
Hey, uh, Maw Maw,

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,770
胃又堵上了嗎
you, uh, got anything stuck in your craw today?

320
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
沒有  我只是在清理腸胃
No, I just cleaned my craw.

321
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,310
繼續說
Keep talking.

322
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,420
你的臥室怎么聞起來像我媽的口氣
Why does your bedroom smell like my mother's breath?

323
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,300
我發現地攤上有些酒漬
I found some wine stains on the carpet,

324
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,420
又洗不掉
and I couldn't get them out,

325
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,210
所以我就想讓它看起來
so I'm gonna make it look like

326
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,410
像是杰克遜·波蘭的畫作
one of those Jackson Polack paintings.

327
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
嗯  也是個辦法
Sure, that's one way of doing it.

328
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,180
有了這副破眼鏡
With these damn glasses,

329
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,670
這屋子里的所有小毛病我都看得清清楚楚
I notice every little imperfection around the house.

330
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,940
把那個綠色的記號筆遞給我
Hand me that green magic marker.

331
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,090
外面有株植物需要潤一下色
I saw a plant outside that needs a touch-up.

332
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,480
這是個好題材
That sounds very sensible.

333
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,330
維吉妮亞過度清潔  第一幕
Virginia obsessively cleaning, take one.

334
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,970
好一點了
That's a little better.

335
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,390
還行
That could work.

336
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,410
準備好了
Ready!

337
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,360
把門關上  跟下雪了似的
Shut the door. It looks like it's snowing in here--

338
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,940
空氣中灰塵太多了
there's so much dust floating in the air. Ooh.

339
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,810
我想讓你摘了眼鏡
I'd say take the glasses off,

340
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,690
但你這幅薩拉·佩林的樣子讓我很性奮啊
but the whole Sarah Palin thing is really working for me.

341
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,690
美國女政治家
戴眼鏡 曾獵殺駝鹿

342
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,420
跟我說說你獵殺過的駝鹿吧
Can you tell me about a moose you shot?

343
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,860
有人已經開始動起來了嘛
Ooh. Someone's in the mood.

344
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,250
不對  是我的胃
No, that's my stomach.

345
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,070
先前喝的結腸飲料
I think the pre-colonoscopy beverage

346
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,180
效果有點...
is doing something crazy to my... Uh-oh.

347
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
熱翔來襲
Hot soup!

348
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,720
我感覺我之前喝掉了一個瀑布
It's like I ate a waterfall!

349
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,030
看吶  今早第一大事
Look at this. First thing this morning,

350
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,960
我新增了三個粉絲
and I've already got three new followers.

351
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,040
太好了你回來了
Thank God you're here.

352
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,140
快送我去醫院
I need a ride to the hospital.

353
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,730
求助  送我去做結腸鏡檢查

354
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,750
我不想用這個牌子
I did not want to use this sign.

355
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,830
維吉妮亞呢
Where's Virginia?

356
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
請告訴我她又在瘋狂搞衛生
Please tell me she's obsessively cleaning something.

357
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,560
她把自己鎖在我們的臥室里
She's locked herself in our bedroom.

358
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,610
中大獎了
Jackpot.

359
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,920
最后一次叫你  維吉妮亞
Last chance, Virginia!

360
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,950
再等一下
Just need another minute!

361
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,370
這幅死樣子怎么出去見人
I can't go out in public looking like this.

362
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,790
維吉妮亞  開門
Hey, Virginia. Open up!

363
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,030
外面有些棕色樹葉
Saw some brown leaves outside

364
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,570
需要潤點色
that could use a fresh coat of paint.

365
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,850
真討厭
Oh, dang.

366
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,560
開個縫  讓我把手塞進去就行
Hey, I-I just want to stick my arm in.

367
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,600
曾奶奶
Hey, Maw Maw.

368
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,000
奧巴馬真是個天才
Obama's a genius.

369
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,860
一二三
And... go.

370
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,350
不許你再拍我了
You're not filming me anymore.

371
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,690
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're up to.

372
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,010
昨天我去毫迪超市了
Yesterday, I was at Howdy's.

373
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,200
曾奶奶  告訴我接下來發生了什么
Maw Maw, tell me what happened next.

374
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,890
然后我就告訴羅莎·帕克斯我挪不開
So I told Rosa Parks I couldn't move over

375
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,890
美國黑人人民權主義者

376
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,240
因為我拎了太多購物袋
because I had all these shopping bags.

377
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,200
誰知道她會小題大做
Who knew she was gonna turn it

378
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,030
鬧出這么大名堂
into such a big to-do?

379
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,980
那個滿臉褶子的瘋婆子
Hey, that crazy, wrinkled old bitty

380
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,780
偷了我的故事
is stealing all my stories.

381
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,510
坐在我的浴缸里  還戴著我的浴帽
In my bathtub, wearing my shower cap!

382
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,580
等一下  我明白了
Wait a minute. I know what's going on.

383
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,000
有人
Somebo...

384
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,000
糟了  又忘了
Oh, crap. Lost it.

385
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,690
告訴我怎么回事
Tell me what's going on.

386
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,520
他們把一切都招了
They told me everything.

387
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,870
不許再拍我
I'm cutting you off.

388
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,770
別這樣嘛  曾奶奶
Come on, Maw Maw.

389
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,110
我沒啥別的可錄了
I've got nothing else to film.

390
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,870
好了  吉米  出發了
All right, Jimmy, let's go.

391
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
我可不想錯過預約
I don't want to miss my appointment

392
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,350
再忍受一次術前準備的煎熬
and go through that prep again.

393
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,010
再拉下去  70年代就停產的那些麥片
At the end there, I was pooping out cereals

394
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,650
都要被我拉出來了
they haven't made since the '70s.

395
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,370
我一點都不喜歡這個主意
I do not like the idea of this one bit.

396
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,570
我見過的最小的攝像機是裝在手表上的
The smallest camera I've ever seen was on a watch,

397
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,250
哪怕那么小  插進去的時候都會刮傷
and that would still scrape going in.

398
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,400
把它看成一種醫療器械就好  別當它是攝像機
Yeah, well, just think of it as a medical device, not as a camera.

399
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,030
不過是一根五英尺長的小管子
It's just a little tube that's five feet long.

400
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,130
死亡概率極低
"In the unlikely event of death..."

401
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,300
天啊
Oh, my God.

402
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,190
醫生
Doc!

403
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,330
這上面說  我可能會送命
This says I could die.

404
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,500
你之前沒跟我說
You didn't tell me that.

405
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,870
就是個免責申明
That's just the disclaimer

406
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,830
所有要接受全身麻醉的病人都要簽的
for anyone going under general anesthetic.

407
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,740
別擔心  伯特
Don't worry, Burt.

408
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,770
全麻的死亡概率只有萬分之一
Only one out of every 10,000 people dies while they're under.

409
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,960
你做過多少起這種手術
How many of these have you done?

410
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,340
差不多一萬起吧
About 10,000.

411
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,450
從沒出過問題
Never had a problem.

412
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,640
吉米
Jimmy...

413
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,890
到一萬了還沒死過人
he's overdue for a death.

414
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,050
所以要輪到我了  我有預感
It's gonna be me. I can feel it.

415
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,460
帶我出去
Get me the hell out of here.

416
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
我不想死的時候  菊花里還插著攝像機
I don't want to die with a camera up my poop chute.

417
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,690
老爸  都說了死亡率低了
Dad, it says "Unlikely."

418
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,290
死亡率低  概率低的事天天都在發生
"Unlikely"? Unlikely things happen all the time.

419
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,100
邁爾克·喬丹長出了希特勒的胡子
Michael Jordan grew a Hitler mustache.

420
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
簡直莫名其妙  莫名其妙
That came out of nowhere. Nowhere!

421
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,730
吉米·吉斯又傳新視頻了
Jimmy Chance has done it again.

422
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,100
也許沒那么糟啊
It can't be that bad.

423
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,970
確實不太樂觀
Ooh. That's not good.

424
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,160
-我能擠爆它嗎  -不
- Can I pop it? Just... - No!

425
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,360
戴上眼鏡之后  我的生活變得愈發悲催
Ever since I got these glasses, they've just made my life worse.

426
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,930
先是看清了這個屋子有多不堪
First, I saw how worn-out this house was,

427
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,270
等我擦干凈家里的鏡子后
and then when I started cleaning the mirrors,

428
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,160
又發現  不堪的不止是這個屋子
I saw the house wasn't the only thing looking a little worn.

429
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,230
不是所有人都買得起新衣服
Well, not everyone can afford new clothes.

430
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
我衣服怎么了
What's the matter with my clothes?

431
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,770
沒什么
Oh. Nothing.

432
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,880
我說的是我的臉
I was talking about my face.

433
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,680
我試著往臉上涂更多的化妝品
I tried wearing more makeup

434
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,490
整理發型
and fixing my hair,

435
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,410
但胭脂水粉之下  我還是能看見
but underneath all that, I still got these little lines

436
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,420
眼角的細紋和黑眼圈
and dark circles under my eyes.

437
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,840
維吉妮亞  你還是很漂亮的
Virginia, you still look great.

438
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,320
我知道
Yeah, I know.

439
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,220
但我已經不是25歲時的水嫩樣了
But I don't look 25.

440
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,930
至少也得看著像28啊
I could pass for 28, tops.

441
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,680
可伯特在這副眼鏡之下變得更帥了
But these damn glasses make Burt look even better,

442
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,390
我知道  他最終會意識到
and I just know that eventually he's gonna realize

443
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
我會慢慢人老珠黃
I'm not the hot piece of ass I was one or two months ago.

444
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,140
人們不是常說
Don't some people say that it's what's

445
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,850
內心美才是最重要的嗎
on the inside that counts?

446
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,780
是啊  丑人都這么說
Yeah. Ugly people.

447
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,520
以前伯特和我常常一起嘲笑
Burt and I used to make fun of people

448
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,670
說這種話的人
who said things like that.

449
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,440
現在他也會嘲笑我了
Now he's gonna be making fun of me.

450
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,910
我確定他現在還沒心思想這事呢
Pretty sure he's got other things on his mind.

451
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,530
我不想死
I don't want to die!

452
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
每個父親的夢想都是活得比兒子久
It's every father's dream to outlive his son.

453
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,000
雖然我們嘴上都說不愿白發人送黑發人
We all lie and say it's the opposite,

454
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,790
但我現在把真相告訴你了  吉米
but it's time you knew the truth, Jimmy!

455
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,820
-不  -我來了  伯特
- No! - I'm coming, Burt!

456
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,240
不  不
No! No!

457
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,570
伯特
Burt!

458
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,270
這會子嚇我可不好
Whoa! Not the best time to startle me.

459
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,140
你怎么進來的
How'd you get in here?

460
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,390
和你一樣啊  走后門[后庭]
Same as you. Through the back door.

461
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,960
這個梗好
That's a good one.

462
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,520
記下來  護士
Write that down, nurse.

463
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,690
那是什么鬼東西
What the hell is that?

464
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,100
那是你老公的結腸
That's your husband's colon.

465
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,550
就在那時  老媽看見了
At that moment, my mom saw

466
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,010
老爸身上最惡心人的器官
the most disgusting part of my dad.

467
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,410
但這并沒有改變她對老爸的感情
But it didn't change how she felt about him.

468
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,070
盡管她已經快把午飯吐出來了
And even though she almost lost her lunch,

469
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,200
她卻更加清楚地明白了她與老爸之間的感情
she gained some perspective on her relationship with my dad.

470
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,340
如果在見識了老爸最惡心的部分之后
If she could still love him after seeing

471
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,400
她依然愛他
how gross he was on the inside,

472
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,180
那老爸也一定會永遠愛她
then, of course, he would love her

473
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,950
無論她如何貶低自己的容貌
no matter what she thought about her outsides.

474
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,930
一排撂倒一個就行  西部槍神
Well, that's one in a row for you, Wild Bill.

475
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,930
美國電視劇《死木》臺詞

476
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,270
我還活著
I'm alive.

477
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,600
是啊  醫生說一切正常
Yeah, and they said everything looks great.

478
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,780
其實  看著怪惡心的
Well, actually, it looks disgusting,

479
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,020
但惡心才正常  所以你會沒事的
but that's how it's supposed to look, so you're gonna be fine.

480
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,450
你長青春痘了
Wow, that is some zit.

481
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,610
挺可愛的
No, it's cute.

482
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,100
跟你還是個高中生一樣
Look like you did back in high school.

483
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,510
但這副眼鏡嘛  我就搞不懂了
I don't know about the glasses, though.

484
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,720
每一次我想吻你的時候
Every time I come in to kiss you,

485
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,420
都能從鏡片上看到我自己  不得不承認
I see my own reflection, and let's face it,

486
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,260
我已經不是當年的年輕小伙兒了
I'm not as young as I used to be.

487
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,590
我換隱形眼鏡
I'll get contacts.

488
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,210
眼鏡世界全場五折
They're having a 50% off sale at Glasses Land.

489
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,570
伯特
Hey, Burt.

490
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,800
這個是你的吧
Think this belongs to you.

491
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,110
我的水牛鎳幣
Hey! My buffalo nickel.

492
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,980
謝謝你  水行俠
Thanks, Aquaman.

493
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,030
他還沒從麻醉里緩過來呢
I think he's still feeling the anesthesia.

494
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,410
你干什么呢
Hey, what are you doing?

495
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,520
我們不是說好  不把喜旺的視頻
I thought we agreed not to put Hope

496
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,610
傳上網的嗎
in any videos that we post.

497
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,420
不是的  吉米  我不會上傳的
Oh, no, Jimmy, I'm not gonna post this.

498
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,940
我不玩了
I-I'm done with that.

499
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,340
為了這種傻不啦嘰的視頻爭來爭去太無聊了
It's dumb to compete over these silly little videos.

500
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,150
你看  我們已經不知不覺地爭了好多事了
And, look, we already inadvertently compete over

501
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,450
像是喜旺更喜歡誰啊  誰的發型更好看
Hope's affection and whose hair looks better,

502
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,220
誰是床上小霸主啊
who finishes first in the bedroom.

503
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,390
在下獨孤求敗
Undefeated.

504
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,100
可不是嘛
Yes, you are.

505
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,890
過來
Hey, you, come here.

506
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,250
吉米上傳什么視頻了嗎
Has Jimmy posted anything?

507
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,020
沒有
No.

508
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,520
塞布麗娜呢
What about Sabrina?

509
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,280
啥都沒有
No.

510
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,830
那我們現在怎么辦
What do we do now?

511
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,160
活出自己的人生
I guess we could live our lives.

512
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,590
什么人生
What lives?

513
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,650
快看
Oh, look.

514
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,120
像山羊一樣叫的人
"People screaming like goats."

515
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,430
家有喜旺

516
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,430
