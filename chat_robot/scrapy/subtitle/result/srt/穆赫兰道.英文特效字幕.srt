2
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing? We don't stop here.

3
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out of the car.

4
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The boys found this on the floor, in the back of the Caddy.

5
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, they showed me.

6
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could be unrelated.

7
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could be.

8
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Any of those dead kids wearing pearl earrings?

9
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

10
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Could be someone's missing, maybe.

11
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That what I'm thinking.

12
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just one more bag after that.

13
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just wanted to come here.

14
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}To Winkie's?

15
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This Winkie's.

16
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. Why this Winkie's?

17
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's kind of embarrassing.

18
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go ahead.

19
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I had a dream about this place.        - Oh, boy.

20
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}See what I mean?

21
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

22
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tell me.

23
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's the second one I've had. But they're both the same.

24
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's not day or night...

26
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it looks just like this.

28
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Except for the light.

29
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:59,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I'm scared like I can't tell you. Of all people...

30
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you're standing right over there.

31
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}By that counter.

32
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're in both dreams and you're scared.

33
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are, and...

34
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}then I realize what it is.

35
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's a man...

36
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}in back of this place

37
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's the one who's doing it.

38
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can see him through the wall.

39
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can see his face.

40
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I hope that I never see that face ever outside of the dream.

41
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's it.

42
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So...you came to see if he's out there.

43
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

44
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right then.

45
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's around the back.

46
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dan! Dan, are you all right?

47
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The girl is still missing.

48
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Talk to me.

49
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The same.

50
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can't believe it.

51
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.

52
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's been so nice traveling with you.      - Thank you, Irene.

53
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was so excited and nervous. It was sure great to have you to talk to.

54
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'll watch for you on the big screen.      - Okay, Irene.

55
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Won't that be the day?

56
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good luck, Betty dear.

57
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Take care of yourself and be careful.      - I will.

58
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thanks, again.

59
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty, it was so nice meeting you. All the luck in the world.

60
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you.

61
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My bags?

62
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where to?

63
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}1612, Hayvenhurst.

64
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Got it.

65
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ten bucks says you're Betty.

66
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

67
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?      - In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Pleased to meet you.        - Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Wait there and I'll go get the key.      - Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wilkins!

71
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Wilkins!

72
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If that damn dog craps in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm just gonna bank his little butt for breakfast!      - You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, I don't.       - They're allowed.

75
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just don't like them in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There was a man that lived here once that

77
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}had a prizefighting kangaroo.

78
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You just wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

79
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's go see your aunt's apartment. It's a good one.

80
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I can hardly wait.

81
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's unbelievable!        - I told you.

82
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You and your aunt probably have an understanding, so here's the key.

83
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And if you need anything, just give a holler.

84
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everybody in this building is pretty much okay with me...

85
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}or they wouldn't be here.

86
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you like, later on I'll introduce you around.

87
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

88
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell me someone was gonna be here.

89
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm so sorry.      - It's okay.

90
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

91
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There was an accident. I came here.

92
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I understand. I saw the dress.

93
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. Are you all right?

94
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What happened?

95
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A car...

96
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}a car accident.

97
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you okay?

98
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think so.

99
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was just...

100
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}taking a shower.

101
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that.

102
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna get unpacked.

103
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's your name?

104
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, I'll get out of here. We can talk later.

105
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My name is...

106
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita.

107
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you work with my aunt?

108
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, I...      - I'm sorry...

109
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's none of my business.

110
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She has pretty red hair.

111
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...

112
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that's being made in Canada, but I guess you already know that.

113
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years.

114
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unless, of course, I'm discovered and become a movie star.

115
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star...

116
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but sometimes people end up being both. So...

117
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that is, I guess you'd say, the story of why I came here.

118
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.

119
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I'm in this...

120
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}dream place! Well, you can imagine how I feel.

121
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sit down.

122
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where were you hurt?

123
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- We should call a doctor.      - No.

124
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- But this could be serious.      - No, I need to sleep.

125
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you have a concussion, you shouldn't sleep.

126
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll be okay if I sleep.

127
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just need to lie down here and sleep.

128
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see, Adam, there are some suggestions that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I know you said you would entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And that's all anybody here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What are you talking about?       - An open mind.

132
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're in the process of recasting your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we are asking you to keep an open mind.

134
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was it the last time?

135
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Okay, let's try the next one.        - He's not gonna like it.

136
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll see.

137
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Castigliani brothers! Let me introduce you around.

138
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please take a seat. This is Mr. Darby, whom you know.

139
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And this is the director, Adam Kesher.

140
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And his manager, Robert Smith.

141
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's very pretty.

142
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}May I offer you gentlemen anything?

143
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Espresso.       - Nothing.

144
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's the photo for?        - One espresso.

145
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, that's it.

146
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think you're going to enjoy your espresso this time.

147
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've done quite a bit of research...

148
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}knowing how hard you are to please.

149
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This one comes highly recommended.

150
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's the photo for?        - It's a recommendation.

151
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A recommendation to you, Adam.

152
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's not a recommendation.        - This is the girl.

153
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What girl? For what? What is this, Ray?

154
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:36,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'd be happy to put her on the list for considerations.

155
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'd be pleased to know, there's quite a bit of interest in this role.

156
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Interest? There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

157
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is the girl.

158
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Ray, take care of this.      - Hold on, hold on, Adam.

159
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hold on?

160
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no way! There's no way!

161
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Napkin.

162
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Pardon?

163
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Napkin.

164
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Of course.

165
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excuse me.

166
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that all, sir?

167
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Shit.      - Sorry. That was highly recommended.

168
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That is considered one of the finest espressos in the world!

169
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's going on here? There is no way that girl is in my movie!

170
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- This is the girl.      - Hey, that girl is not in my film!

171
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's no longer your film.

172
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is the girl.

173
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Castigliani brothers get out of that limo?

174
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- The two guys in dark suits?      - Yeah.

175
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Leave that door open.

176
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Castigliani brothers?

177
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Beat it, pal.

178
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

179
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

180
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The director doesn't want her.

181
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you want him replaced?

182
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know they said...

183
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then?

184
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then...

185
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}that means we should...?

186
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes?

187
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shut everything down? Is that something that...

188
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Do you want us to shut everything down?

189
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then we'll shut everything down.

190
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, man, that's unheard of.

191
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}An accident like that, who could have foreseen that, man?

192
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's unreal, right?

193
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Unbelievable, man.

194
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, bro? God, you look good.

195
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What have you been doing?

196
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, just...doing some stuff for this guy.

197
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you making ends meet?

198
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hardly.

199
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know, man, look at my digs.

200
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Times are tough, bro.

201
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey...man, it's not that bad.

202
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I hope you're not gonna get in any trouble.

203
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was just a thing, man. That story? That made you laugh!

204
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That was a funny story, man. Fucking car accident!

205
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hey, so that's...that's it, huh?

206
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's Ed's famous black book.in phone numbers.

207
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The history of the world...

208
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Something bit me bad!

209
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's hurt real bad! Could you come here and call on the phone, please?

210
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's hurt real bad! You gotta come in here and call the hospital!

211
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, man! I'm serious about this! I can't do everything by myself!

212
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:59,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study those lines until I know them inside out.

213
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Either right here on this fabulous leather couch...

214
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}or I'll take them with a coffee into the courtyard...

215
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}like a regular movie star.

216
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I got a real shock to find your friend Rita here.

217
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She was in the shower and I opened the door!

218
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita!

219
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What do you mean?

220
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She was in an accident.

221
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita. Your friend.

222
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, Coco unlocked the door.

223
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, she didn't see her.

224
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's sleeping.

225
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sure there's some explanation for this. I don't think we have to do that.

226
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth, we don't need the police.

227
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're awake.

228
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I think I misunderstood.

229
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought you knew my aunt and that's why you were here.

230
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just talked to my aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police.

231
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita?

232
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, I...

233
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it, Rita?

234
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I thought when I woke up...I thought sleep would do it.

235
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's wrong?

236
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I just don't know who I am.

237
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What do you mean? You're Rita.      - No, I'm not.

238
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know what my name is.

239
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know who I am.

240
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is your purse. Your name must be in your purse.

241
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You wanna know, don't you?

242
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yes, but...      - Open it.

243
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sure you don't want anything?      - Not here.

244
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Thanks.       - A drink or something?

245
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. Thanks, though.

246
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll take a cigarette, if you have one.

247
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, just reach inside my shirt pocket there.

248
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Any new girls on the street lately?

249
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

250
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I haven't seen any.

251
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A brunette?

252
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe a little beat-up?

253
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

254
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?      - Sure.

255
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You bet you will.

256
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That money...

257
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you don't know where it came from?

258
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When you think of them, the money and the key...

259
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}does it make you remember anything?

260
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's something...

261
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}something...

262
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}there.

263
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What did you say?

264
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- They fired everyone.      - Who fired everyone?

265
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Ray did! Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

266
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They closed the set. Everybody's gone. You'd better get down here.

267
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No.

268
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've gotta talk to Ray. You've gotta fix this.

269
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going home.

270
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Home?

271
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:54,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Meet me at the office, we gotta do something. You gotta do something!

272
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm going home, Cynthia.        - Adam, this isn't like you.

273
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Please, come to the office. There's gotta be something we can do!

274
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going home.

275
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wonder where you were going.

276
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mulholland Drive.

277
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mulholland Drive?

278
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's where I was going.

279
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mulholland Drive.

280
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:42,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe that's where the accident was.

281
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There must be a police report. We could call.

282
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We could call anonymously just to see if there was an accident.

283
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It'll be just like in the movies! We'll pretend to be someone else.

284
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wanna walk around, anyway.

285
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any of it.

286
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Rita, do you feel up to it?

287
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

288
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But just...

289
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}just to see.

290
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:27,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just to see if there was an accident...

291
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}on Mulholland Drive.

292
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lorraine?

293
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're home?

294
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Lorraine?

295
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now you've done it!

296
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just forget you ever saw it. It's better that way.

297
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What the hell are you even doing here?

298
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

299
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's my jewelry!

300
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That bastard. You bastard!        - He's probably upset, Lorraine.

301
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing?

302
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it!

303
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it!

304
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Adam, stop it!

305
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it!

306
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it!

307
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're hurting me! Gene!

308
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're hurting me!

309
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That ain't no way to treat your wife. I don't care what she's done.

310
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Throw him out!

311
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Throw him out!

312
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Damn you, Adam!

313
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Throw him out!

314
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out!

315
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let's hide it.

316
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's one.

317
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Los Angeles Police Department.      - I'm inquiring about an accident...

318
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}last night on Mulholland Drive.

319
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll connect you to Traffic.

320
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sergeant Baker.      - Hi, I'm inquiring...

321
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:36,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I heard a sound last night that sounded sort of like a car crash.

322
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

323
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, there was.

324
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Can you tell me what happened?      - No, I can't.

325
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Was anyone hurt?      - May I have your name, please?

326
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There was an accident.

327
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He wouldn't tell me anything else, but that was your accident, Rita.

328
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe there's something about it in the papers.

329
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee and we can see.

330
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:15,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe it happened so late it's not in today's paper.

331
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's nothing?

332
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not that I can see.

333
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's okay.

334
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thanks.

335
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane.

336
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Will that be all? Would you like your check?

337
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita, you want something?

338
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, just...just the coffee.       - We'll take our check.

339
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it, Rita?

340
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:13,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I remember something. I remember something!

341
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What is it?      - Diane Selwyn.

342
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe that's my name!

343
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}D. Selwyn. It's the only one.

344
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna call.

345
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It is strange to be calling yourself.      - Maybe it's not me.

346
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, it's me.

347
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Leave a message.

348
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's not my voice.

349
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I know her!

350
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

351
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Or if it is Diane Selwyn, she could tell you who you are.

352
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe.

353
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Maybe, maybe...

354
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Adam Kesher?

355
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Adam Kesher?      - Get lost!

356
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- This is Adam Kesher's house.      - Like hell it is! Get out now!

357
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out!

358
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Adam Kesher?

359
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out of here! He's never coming back! Ever!

360
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bastard. I guess you don't understand English.

361
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She said leave. Here's the door.

362
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Gene!

363
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out!

364
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out!

365
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Adam Kesher?

366
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?      - I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

367
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but there seems to be some problem with your credit cards.

368
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

369
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen, two guys from your bank came by.

370
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My bank?

371
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- How'd they know I was here?      - I don't know.

372
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What'd they say?

373
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They said to tell you that you're maxed out at your bank...

374
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and that your line of credit has been canceled.

375
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's unbelievable.

376
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, look...

377
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:51,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know what's going on. That is so much baloney.

378
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.      - I know, I know. Don't worry.

379
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:05,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But I'm sorry, it's my duty to inform you...

380
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:11,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}listen, man, whoever you're hiding from...

381
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}they know where you are.

382
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Right.

383
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry.

384
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello?

385
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Someone maybe shut off my money.      - I know. Where are you, Adam?

386
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Sorry, what do you mean you know?      - Somebody called...

387
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:57,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}they told me you were as good as broke. So I made a few calls.

388
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And?      - You're broke.

389
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:01,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not broke!

390
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

391
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:12,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.       - Do you know somebody called "The Cowboy"?

392
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- "The cowboy"?      - Yeah.

393
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"The Cowboy". This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you.

394
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:24,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

395
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

396
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Should I wear my 10-gallon hat and my six-shooters?

397
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Something tells me that this guy is connected to what's happening.

398
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Adam, I think you should do it, and you should do it right away.

399
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:45,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's going on, Cynthia?       - It's been a very strange day.

400
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And getting stranger.

401
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:54,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you have to ride out to the range?

402
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on...

403
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:05,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you'll go to the top of the Beachwood Canyon, there's a corral up there...

404
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:08,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- where he'll be.      - You've gotta be kidding me.

405
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Will you meet with him?

406
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:12,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah.

407
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sure. This has been that kind of a day. When?

408
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll call him right away and then I'll call you back.

409
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:26,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, you could stay at my place, if you wanted.

410
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:31,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I don't think that'd be a good idea.      - I was just offering a place to stay.

411
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:35,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia. I'll find a place.

412
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just go on and give that cowboy a yodel and get on back to me.

413
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. But you don't know what you're missing.

414
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just get along, little doggie. And call me back.

415
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:01,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's right about here. Sierra Bonita. It's not too far away.

416
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's wrong with that?

417
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not sure about this.

418
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know you're afraid of something.

419
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll be careful. I promise.

420
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:23,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Tomorrow. We'll go over there.and we'll find out.

421
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It'll be okay.

422
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's probably Coco.

423
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:51,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Yes, may I help you?        - Someone is in trouble!

424
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Who are you?

425
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:58,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

426
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:03,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's letting me stay here. I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

427
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, it's not! That's not what she said.

428
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Someone is in trouble! Something bad is happening!

429
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are and...

430
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Louise? What are you doing, Louise?

431
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've been trying to get hold of you since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

432
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That one is in my room and she won't leave!

433
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now.

434
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she meant well.

435
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:39,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Louise, this is Betty, this is Ruth's niece.

436
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was on my way over here to see Betty. Betty is a young actress.

437
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was delivering some faxed pages of a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

438
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Well, here they are, honey.      - Thank you.

439
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come along now, Louise. I'll take you home.

440
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry. It happens sometimes. Come on.

441
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, she said it was someone else who was in trouble.

442
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:04,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it, Louise! I'm taking you home. Come on.

443
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Good night, Betty.      - Good night.

444
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night.

445
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cowboy...

446
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:02,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Howdy.     - Howdy to you.

447
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Beautiful evening.

448
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:16,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you for coming all the way up here to see me from that nice hotel downtown.

449
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No problem. What's on your mind?

450
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, now. Here's a man who wants to get right down to it.

451
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kind of anxious to get to it, are you?

452
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Whatever.

453
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A man's attitude...

454
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:39,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}a man's attitude goes some ways the way his life will be.

455
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:42,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is that something you might agree with?

456
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sure!

457
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Did you answer because that's what you thought I wanted to hear...

458
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}or did you think about what I said...

459
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:56,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and answered 'cause you truly believe that to be right?

460
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:00,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I agree with what you said. Truly.

461
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What'd I say?

462
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

463
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So since you agree...

464
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you must be a person who does not care about the good life.

465
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:22,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How's that?

466
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:26,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, stop for a little second...

467
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and think about it. Can you do that for me?

468
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay. I'm thinking.

469
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:45,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, you're not. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinking.

470
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:50,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, I want you to think and stop being a smart aleck.

471
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Can you try that for me?

472
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Look, where's this going? What do you want me to do?

473
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:03,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

474
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}One.

475
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So let's just say I'm driving this buggy.

476
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:13,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me.

477
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

478
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:25,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You were recasting the lead actress. Audition many girls for the part.

479
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:31,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say:

480
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"This is the girl."

481
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The rest of the cast can stay. That's up to you.

482
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:43,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But that lead girl is not up to you.

483
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, you will see me one more time if you do good.

484
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You'll see me two more times if you do bad.

485
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night.

486
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:27,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- You're still here?      - I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

487
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:31,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Nobody wants you here!      - Really?

488
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:34,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My parents are right upstairs. They think you've left!

489
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:39,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- So? Surprise.        - I can call them. I can call my dad.

490
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:43,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- But you won't.       - If you're trying to blackmail me...

491
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's not going to work! You're playing a dangerous game here.

492
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know what I want. It's not that difficult.

493
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

494
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He trusts you! You're his best friend.

495
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This will be the end of everything.

496
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about you? What will your dad think about you?

497
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:05,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop! Just stop it! That's what you said from the beginning.

498
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If I tell what happened, they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

499
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out of here before...

500
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Before what?       - Before...

501
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I kill you.      - Then they'd put you in jail.

502
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion...

503
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"I hate you! I hate us both!"

504
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Such a lame scene.        - But you are really good.

505
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you, darling.

506
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi, there. Who are you?

507
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:04,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty?

508
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:14,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

509
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What is it, Coco?

510
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Your aunt called.

511
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was afraid of that.

512
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.

513
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:41,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just for a night or two. Until she finds her own place.

514
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth but the connection was bad...

515
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and her plane was leaving, and she got it all mixed up.

516
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:49,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I kept telling her that it was my friend Rita...

517
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas.

518
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Look at me straight, sweetie.       - Coco, she's very nice.

519
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Honey, you're a good kid...

520
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but what you're telling me is a load of horse puckey.

521
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even though it comes from a good place.

522
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:09,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm gonna trust you to sort this thing out.

523
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Thank you.      - Don't make me out to be a sucker.

524
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Louise Bonner said there is trouble in there, remember last night?

525
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:20,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, sometimes she's wrong...

526
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}but if there is trouble, get rid of it.

527
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Is everything all right?

528
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:42,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Is it bad for you that I'm here?      - No, no, everything is A-Okay.

529
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:47,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich. And my audition is in one hour!

530
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:10,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

531
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- And don't drink all the Coke.      - Good luck.

532
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When I get back, I'll keep the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

533
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty Elms, I would like you to meet...

534
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Jack Tutman, my assistant.

535
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:59,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Woody Katz, who we have cast in the part of Chuck...

536
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:02,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and will do the scene with you.

537
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bob Rooker, our director...

538
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}and Julie Chadwick.

539
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:11,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, our surprise guest, Lynne James.

540
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Alas, we can't afford her to cast our show but...

541
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:19,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}well, as casting agents go, she is the best.

542
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

543
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Very pleased to meet you.       - This is my assistant, Nikki.

544
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:33,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And the ever lovely Martha. Martha Johnson, whom you met out front.

545
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi.

546
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, shall we give it a go?

547
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:46,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Would you like a water, a coffee before we begin?

548
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I'm fine.

549
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

550
01:14:54,360 --> 01:15:00,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty, why don't you join Woody over there and we'll play the scene.

551
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:07,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bob, do you have anything you wish to say? Something to Betty before we begin?

552
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:16,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No. It's not a contest. The two of them. with themselves.

553
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So don't play it for real...

554
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:23,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}until it gets real.

555
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

556
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

557
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

558
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wanna play this one nice and close like we did with that other girl...

559
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}what's her name? With the black hair. It felt good, what do you think?

560
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:46,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's good, Woody. Just don't rush that line again. I told you...

561
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}the line where you say: "Before what?"

562
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:57,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bobby, acting is reacting. I just play off them. They all say:

563
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"They're gonna arrest you", like that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

564
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:04,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}They say it the same way. So when they say it, I just react.

565
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:05,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What's your name?      - Betty.

566
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty, look. You don't rush it, I don't rush it, okay?

567
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, we're gonna play this nice and close just like in the movies, okay?

568
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Dad's best friend goes to work.

569
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bob?

570
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}action!

571
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're still here.

572
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I came back.

573
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I thought that's what you wanted.      - Nobody wants you here.

574
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really?

575
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:50,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My parents are right upstairs. They think you've left.

576
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So, surprise!

577
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:57,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I can call them, I can call my dad.      - But you won't.

578
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're playing a dangerous game here.

579
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If you're trying to blackmail me...

580
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}it's not gonna work.

581
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know what I want. It's not that difficult.

582
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out.

583
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Get out before I call my dad.

584
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:46,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He trusts you. You're his.best friend.

585
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This will be the end of everything.

586
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What about you? What'll your dad think about you?

587
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it.

588
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That's what you said from the beginning.

589
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:14,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If I tell them what happened, they will arrest you and put you in jail.

590
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:23,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So get out of here...

591
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:25,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}before...

592
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Before what?

593
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Before...

594
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I kill you.

595
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, then they'd put you in jail.

596
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I hate you.

597
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I hate us both.

598
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm gonna take her over there.      - Yeah, big time.

599
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, there it was.

600
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:56,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby, you got a way with you. Really.

601
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bob?

602
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:03,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Very good. Really.

603
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:09,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, it was forced maybe, but still humanistic.

604
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Very good. Really!

605
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:16,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Really.

606
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, I thank you, Betty. And I really mean that, sincerely.

607
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:29,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I mean, it was...

608
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}extraordinary.

609
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You've done your aunt proud today.

610
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm going to tell her that first chance I get.

611
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:42,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, you and I are going to speak again very soon.

612
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:46,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Thank you, Mr. Brown.        - Thank you, Wally.

613
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:50,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.

614
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes, indeed. And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

615
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:58,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't you be a stranger around here. We'd love to have you here.

616
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:01,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Come on, Betty.       - Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

617
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And it was nice meeting all of you.

618
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bye.

619
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bye!

620
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's a slam-dunk! Where the hell did you find her?

621
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}God, that was awful!

622
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:25,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Not you, Betty. You were stellar, and I mean that. But poor Wally.

623
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He'll never get that picture made. Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

624
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:33,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know Woody Katz is only doing it for a favor.

625
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And the cast they have so far is terrible.

626
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:40,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, God, terrible! That poor old fool Wally.

627
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He was very nice and he seems so sweet.

628
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And Wally...Mr. Brown is a very close friend of my aunt's.

629
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:50,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

630
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I ought to, I was married to him for 10 years.

631
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:59,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And I love actors. All actors. We just get a little catty sometimes.

632
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:05,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We want to take you across and introduce you to a director who's a head above the rest.

633
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He's got a project you will kill for.

634
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Knock right out of the park!

635
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:08,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol. I'm coming back.

636
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:11,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Checking the gate! Thank you. We'll tell you what happens next!

637
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you very much for coming in. I know how busy you are.

638
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Are you kidding me? I loved the script. Just show me where to sign.

639
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I love you, but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing...

640
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}until I've seen everyone. I'll let you know as soon as I can.

641
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know you will. Because my manager is gonna be bugging you day and night. And me!

642
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:31,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- My pleasure. Now get outta here.      - You're so cruel to me. Don't you forget me.

643
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm the girl who's playing this part.      - I'll see you later.

644
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hank? Where's Hank?

645
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:41,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Who's next, Hank?      - Camilla Rhodes.

646

647

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Bring her in.      - Camilla Rhodes, next.

648
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}"Sylvia North Story". Camilla Rhodes, take one.

649
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, here we go. Let's lock it up, please.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Excellent choice, Adam.

656
01:26:57,330 --> 01:26:59,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, my goodness.

657
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I have to be somewhere.

658
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:13,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I promised a friend.

659
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- I'm sorry, I must go.      - Now?

660
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Should be around here.

661
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}2590. That's it.

662
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:50,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Up there! Does it look familiar?

663
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Don't stop!      - What is it? What do you see?

664
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:06,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Those men, in front, in the car.       - Do you know them?

665
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Keep going. Go around to the back.

666
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Selwyn, number 12.

667
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:27,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now you got me scared.

668
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You see?

669
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I told you there was nothing to be afraid of.

670
01:30:58,450 --> 01:30:59,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Betty, wait. Wait!

671
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't.

672
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No one's home.

673
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes?

674
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane?

675
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:41,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Number 17.

676
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:46,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But it said number 12.

677
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I switched apartments with her.

678
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:53,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She's in 17. It's down at the end, on the left.

679
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:01,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But she hasn't been around for a few days.

680
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We'll leave her a note.

681
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'll go with you.

682
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She still got some of my stuff.

683
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You go ahead. I gotta get that.

684
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.      - Guess I'm not.

685
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's still no one home, I guess.

686
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- What are you doing?      - Come on, help me in.

687
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:55,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, I'll open the front door.

688
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No!

689
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on.

690
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on!

691
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,840
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know what you're doing.

692
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:02,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I know what you have to do.

693
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:07,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}But let me do it.

694
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:18,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let me do it.

695
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:43,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You look like someone else.

696
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night, Betty.

697
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:10,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You don't have to wear that in the house.

698
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What?

699
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The wig!

700
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:20,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I was just looking at myself again. I'll take it off to sleep.

701
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You don't have to sleep on that couch.

702
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- No, it's okay.       - No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

703
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, just get in and get a good night sleep.

704
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:05,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's more comfortable than the couch, isn't it?

705
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Thank you, Betty.

706
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:22,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's nothing. I shouldn't have let you sleep on the couch last night.

707
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:24,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I mean...

708
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}thank you for everything.

709
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You're welcome.

710
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:45,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night, sweet Betty.

711
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good night.

712
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have you ever done this before?

713
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:45,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't know.

714
01:40:45,850 --> 01:40:47,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Have you?

715
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:04,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I want to with you.

716
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:33,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm in love with you.

717
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm in love with you.

718
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:19,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Silence.

719
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:22,180

720
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:26,160

721
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no band.

722
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no band.

723
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:37,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no orchestra.

724

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Silence!

725
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:58,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Rita?      - There's no band.

726
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:01,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Rita, wake up!

727
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

728
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, it's not okay.

729
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's wrong?

730
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:16,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go with me somewhere.

731
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:21,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's two o'clock. It's two o'clock in the morning.

734
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:31,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now?

736
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no band!

737

741
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:33,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}we hear a band.

742
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}If we want to hear a clarinet...

01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:39,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}listen...

744
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:56,170

745
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A muted trumpet.

750
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:03,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It is an illusion.

751
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Listen!

01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:06,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Where have you been?       - What do you want?

760
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:09,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}My lamp and dishes.

761
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:14,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, Diane, it's been three weeks.

762
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I put your dishes in that box.

763
01:58:39,950 --> 01:58:43,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- That's my ashtray.       - Take it.

764
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:59,710

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What was that you were saying, beautiful?

770
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:08,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I said...

771
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:11,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}you drive me wild.

772
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:26,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}We shouldn't do this anymore.

773
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:35,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't say that.

774
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:42,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't ever say that.

775
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:44,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't, Diane!

776
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:46,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Stop it!

777
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:48,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane, stop!

778
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I've tried to tell you this before.

779
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's him, isn't it?

780
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:18,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene, but just...

781
02:03:19,110 --> 02:03:22,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}watch me and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

782
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:29,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't sit so rigid, just...

783
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:31,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}just relax.

784
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:37,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, the two of you are alone and it's real comfortable.

785
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:40,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Like you've known each other forever.

786
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:44,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Even if you don't say anything, it's real comfortable.

787
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:49,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hank, can you just clear the set? There's too many people around here.

788
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:52,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Let's get this worked out.       - Clear the set!

789
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Everyone have a cup of coffee.

790
02:03:56,610 --> 02:03:59,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Everyone, please!      - Can Diane stay?

791
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:03,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yeah, sure, Diane can stay. Hank, let Diane stay!

792
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:05,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane!

793
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:14,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Now, when she starts to cry, don't pull her towards you.

794
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:21,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Let her fall into you. Just let her fall.

795
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:31,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}And when you kiss her...it's just a continuation of that move.

796
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}There's no break.

797
02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:03,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Kill the lights!

798
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:16,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't be mad. Don't make it be like this.

799
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:20,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Oh, sure, you want me to make this easy for you.

800
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:23,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No fucking way! It's not gonna be!

801
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:26,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- It's not easy for me!        - Diane!

802
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:54,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hello, it's me. Leave a message.

803
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:58,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane?

804
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:06,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Hello?      - Diane?

805
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:09,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Camilla.

806
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:13,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Diane, the car's waiting. Are you okay?

807
02:07:14,350 --> 02:07:16,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You coming?

808
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:26,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Good. It means so much to me.

809
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:30,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Go on. The car's right outside your house.

810
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:33,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's been waiting, okay?

811
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:40,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay.

812
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:44,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's 6980, Mulholland Drive.

813
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:47,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Mulholland Drive.

814
02:08:56,750 --> 02:09:00,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What are you doing? We don't stop here.

815
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A surprise.

816
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:31,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Shortcut.

817
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Come on, sweetheart.

818
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:44,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's beautiful.

819
02:09:44,380 --> 02:09:46,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}A secret path.

820
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:56,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Perfect timing.

821
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:59,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Welcome, Diane.

822
02:11:05,070 --> 02:11:08,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well...Here's to love.

823
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:22,010
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Here's to love.

824
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:28,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Here she is!

825
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I don't believe you met my mother.

826
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:43,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

827
02:11:43,690 --> 02:11:47,370
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Just call me Coco, everybody does. Pleased to meet you.

828
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Well, let's eat! I'm starving!

829
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:59,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm sorry I was late.

830
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

831
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:26,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- A small town.      - So you rolled in here from Canada.

832
02:12:29,410 --> 02:12:32,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I always wanted to come here.

833
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:36,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I won this jitterbug contest.

834
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:40,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}That sort of led to acting.

835
02:12:40,650 --> 02:12:44,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You know, wanting to act.

836
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:47,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When my aunt died...

837
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:51,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Anyway, she left me some money.

838
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:54,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- She worked here.      - In the movies?

839
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

840
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:01,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}How did you meet Camilla?

841
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:06,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- On the "Sylvia North Story".        - Camilla was great in that.

842
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:09,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I never went to Casablanca with Luigi.

843
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:12,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What a pity! Then go!

844
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:25,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I wanted the lead so bad.

845
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,120
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Anyway, Camilla got the part.

846
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:35,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}The director...

847
02:13:35,410 --> 02:13:37,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Bob Rooker?

848
02:13:37,570 --> 02:13:39,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Yes.

849
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:44,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}He didn't think so much of me.

850
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:52,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Anyway, that's when we became friends.

851
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:54,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}She helped me...

852
02:13:55,390 --> 02:13:58,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}getting some parts in some of her films.

853
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:02,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I see.

854
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:21,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I got the pool, and she got the pool man.

855
02:14:24,270 --> 02:14:28,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I couldn't believe it. I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

856
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:37,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sometimes, good things happen.

857
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}So I guess we've saved the best for last.

858
02:15:37,470 --> 02:15:40,880
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}- Do you want to tell them?      - No, you tell them.

859
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:47,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Camilla and I...

860
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:01,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}are going to be...

861
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:15,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Sorry about that.

862
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:25,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}No, I'm fine.

863
02:16:30,990 --> 02:16:33,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}This is the girl.

864
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:37,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Don't show me this fucking thing here.

865
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:41,850
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}It's just an actress' photo resume. Everybody's got one.

866
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:45,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You got the money?

867
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:47,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}I sure do.

868
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Okay, now, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.

869
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}You sure you want this?

870
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:16,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}More than anything in this world.

871
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:30,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}When it's finished, you'll find this where I told you.

872
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:46,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}What's it open?

873
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:13,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\i1}Silence!

874
