3
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,018
知道吗 你很幸运
You're lucky, you know.

4
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,337
我很少让人进我的房间
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.

5
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,936
我知道 我知道 我知道
I know, I know, I know.

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,331
简居陋室
Humble digs.

7
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,771
我不是你想的那种"内裤猎人"
Not exactly what you'd call a "panty peeler."

8
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,692
懂我的意思吗
Do you know what I mean?

9
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,214
但它正适合我
But it suits me just fine.

10
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,209
老实说 我很少在自己的床上过夜
To be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.

11
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,379
瞧 这就是我的见解:
You see, here's my theory:

12
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,792
对多数女人来说 如果一个男人乐意付出
For most women, if a guy's a good provider

13
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:44,938
而且人也不错 那么没有六块腹肌也没什么
and generally a nice chap, six－pack abs really aren't a deal－breaker.

14
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,573
不过 也不绝对
On the flip side, however,

15
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,050
即使网络男朋友坐在你旁边
even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you

16
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,848
手搭在你的肩膀上 你也不会心动
with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...

17
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,970
其实他也不会心动 对男人而言 我们只关心F.B.B 那就是:
And he will deny it. For us boys, it's all about F.B.B.

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,015
脸蛋 胸脯 屁股
Face. Boobs. Bum.

19
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,812
我只是实话实说
I'm just being honest.

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,852
人家说衣服是国际通用语言
It's been said that clothes speak the international language.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,451
我必须承认一点 我对时尚很追崇
And I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fashion whore.

22
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,219
不幸的是 我今天要去上班 所以我必须穿的低调一点
Unfortunately, today I've got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit,

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,580
但是 没问题 Gucci 去年的夏季大甩卖！
but that's all right. Gucci. End-of-summer sale.

24
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,937
很朴素 而且我能轻而易举得搭配
Very understated. And I can easily spice it up with...

25
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,633
什么 不 不 我知道你在想什么
What? No, no. I know what you are thinking.

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,110
如果你有阳刚气 就像我们这里的某人一样
If you ooze masculinity, like some of us do,

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,257
你没理由避开粉红色 帅呆了！
you have no reason to fear pink. Smashing.

28
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,770
现在 该撒古龙水了 很多男人用过头了
Now, in the cologne department, most men overdo it.

29
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,893
美国人通常是喷洒
Americans practically spray it on with a crop-duster.

30
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,337
我的原则：颈部以上不用
My rule: Nothing above the neck,

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,810
但是我却喜欢在我的大笨钟上面撒一点
though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.

32
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,570
你永远不会知道今天会发生什么
You never know where the day may take you.

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,417
差点忘了
Almost forgot.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,819
每日一词
New word for the day.

35
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,455
"卖弄: 试图吸引别人注意力的行为"
"Ostentatious: The attempt to attract attention to oneself."

36
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,975
谁 我?
Who? Me?

37
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,492
哦 我太失礼了 我还没介绍我自己
Oh, blimey. I'm so rude. I haven't introduced myself.

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,055
－我是...  －阿尔菲
－I'm... －Alfie

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,330
你知道了 阿尔菲
There you go. Alfie.

40
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,210
是你这个小精灵在我门前留的莫卡咖啡塘吗
Are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,009
没有 一定是有人暗恋你 斯尼特莫太太
No, no, no. You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

42
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,808
你真可爱 阿尔菲 但是我应该节食
You are such a doll, Alfie. But I'm supposed to be on a diet.

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,815
哦 节食吗
Oh, on a diet?

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,375
－节食? －您?
－A diet. －You?

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,895
－是的 －我不想说得太直接 露
－Yeah. －Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu,

46
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,895
但您必须知道 像您这样丰满的女孩
but you should know by now that a full-figured girl like yourself

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,779
－是每个男人的梦想 － 别再说了
－is every guy's secret fantasy. －Stop it.

48
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,009
虽然她像一摊猪油 事已至此
So she's a tub of lard. The ship's already sailed,

49
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,605
那何不让她自我感觉良好一点呢 是吧
so why not make her feel good about herself, right?

50
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,448
－哦 对了 露 －是的 亲爱的
－Oh, Lu －Yes, angel

51
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,609
我今天上夜班
I'm working the night spot,

52
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,325
而我的房间里一团糟
and my apartment is a horror show,

53
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:02,226
不过我很不好意思 总是让你在下午两点帮我打扫一下
so I'm sorry if I keep you up with the dust-busting at 2 A.M.

54
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:03,004
－哦 别担心
－Oh, don't you worry.

55
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,407
－我会很快帮你整理一下的 －不 不 您不必那样
－I'll give it a quick straighten. －Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.

56
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,205
别这么说 我乐意服侍你 阿尔菲
Nonsense. I like doing things for you, Alfie.

57
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,203
有你在我身边 我真是太幸福了
I'm a blessed man having you in my life.

58
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,159
谢谢你
Thank you.

59
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,646
钥匙在老地方
Keys are in the usual spot.

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,903
在家里你总是能听到一些人的传奇故事:
Now, back home, you're always hearing tales about some bloke

61
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,529
移民到美国 然后大把大把地捞钞票
migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money.

62
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,648
所以不久前  我打点行囊 来到这里
So not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.

63
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,803
我得承认 我有其他动机
Now, I must admit, I had a second motive.

64
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,406
人们都说世界上 最漂亮的女孩都
I'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...

65
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,882
...聚集在曼哈顿
...resided in Manhattan.

66
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,407
当你决定去搞女人时 只会关心一件事:
And when it comes to shagging birds, it's all about one thing:

67
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,760
地点 地点 地点
Location, location, location.

68
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,523
上帝 我爱死这座城市了 好啊 女孩们
God, I love this city. All right, girls.

69
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,549
看看周围 每个都那么独一无二 与众不同
Just look around. I mean, every one of them, unique, special,

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,347
就像雪花瓣
like snowflakes.

71
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,469
又是那么的丰盛...
And with such a plethora...

72
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,109
每日一词上的解释是"魅力十足 差异万千"
Calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity,

73
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,269
这样的话 一个男人怎么能 只想和一个女人厮守到老呢
well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?

74
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,907
我本人更信奉欧式生活哲理:
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.

75
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,381
酒和女人永远是第一位的...
My priorities leaning towards wine, women...

76
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,546
事实上 人生就如此
Well, actually, that's about it.

77
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,741
酒和女人
Wine and women.

78
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,902
然而 在女人之间做选择 亦是一件乐事
Although, women and women is always a fun option.

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,683
所以
So...

80
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,384
...尽情地享受生活
...to live life to the fullest,

81
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,179
我只需应付日常的开销就足够
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.

82
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,706
我不想成为墓地里最有钱的死尸
I've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.

83
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,466
我想这也许是我最喜爱的体位了
I think this might just be my favourite position.

84
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,498
我知道这是肯尼迪总统的招牌姿势
I know it was President Kennedy's.

85
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,460
他真是个潮流领导者
He was such a great leader.

86
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,465
当然 他只是用背伤作为藉口
Of course, JFK used the old bad-back excuse,

87
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,028
但我觉得 其实他知道这个体位会
but if you ask me, he knew it

88
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,249
用最小的付出 但却给人最大的快感
gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion.

89
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,929
加长轿车的后背座怎么样
What is it about the back of a limo?

90
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,606
不可推托的拥抱
Obligatory cuddling.

91
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,687
一千零一
Thousand one,

92
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,209
一千零二...
thousand two...

93
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,488
哦 嘿 我得走了 我十点要去接人
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking. I've got a 10:00 pickup.

94
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,038
你最好快点 你不会想让她久等的
You better hurry up. You don't want to keep her waiting.

95
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,558
还算不错吧
Quite the number, isn't she?

96
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,126
但是  她告诉我她老公 六个月没碰她了
Yet, she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months.

97
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,848
六个月！我的意思是 感谢上帝 幸好还有像我这样的"绅士"在
Six months. I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around

98
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,006
来填补这个空挡
to pick up the slack.

99
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,965
看看她 像赛马般的腿
Just look at her. Legs like a racehorse.

100
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,124
完美的瑜伽身心 我给她打出了我的最高分:
Perfect yoga bum. I give her my highest grade:

101
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,328
A-
A-minus.

102
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,086
你怎么跟你老公说我们今晚去了哪
Where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?

103
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,203
－看电影 －宝贝  求你 别别这样
－A movie. －Treasure, please, no, no, no.

104
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,208
你把我的预设都打乱了
Stop messing about. You'll ruin my presets.

105
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,279
－抱歉 －看什么电影
－Sorry. －What movie?

106
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,124
我不知道 有什么区别吗
I don't know. What's the difference?

107
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,369
区别在于 你告诉他越详细 他就越不感兴趣
The difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he'll be.

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,088
我说什么都无所谓
It wouldn't matter what I said.

109
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,522
菲儿决不会想到会有其他男人
It would never occur to Phil that another man

110
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,442
－再会看上我 －桃儿 亲爱的
－would ever look twice at me. －Dor, darling,

111
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,679
你想寻求恭维
you fishing for a compliment?

112
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,165
不是
No.

113
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,847
到现在 你应该知道 只有在最不经意间 我才会这样
You should know by now they only come from me when least expected.

114
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,506
吃块薄荷糖 这样菲尔就闻不到你的呼吸中有我的味道了
Now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn't smell the Alfie on your breath.

115
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,124
他闻到了我也不在乎
I don't care if he does.

116
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,563
只有一件事让我远离婚姻: 那就是已婚女人
There's one thing that puts me off marriage: It's married women.

117
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,326
桃利还不明白这个
Dorie doesn't know it yet,

118
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,045
但你不太会想再看到她了
but you won't be seeing much more of her.

119
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,604
我有点腻了的感觉
I've got that all-too-familiar feeling.

120
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,282
迟早 她会提出我满足不了的要求
Sooner or later, she'll be wanting a little bit more than I'm able to give.

121
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,260
今晚如果我跟你回家 而不是菲儿那个傻瓜
Wouldn't it be great if I was going home with you tonight

122
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,898
那不是很好吗
instead of Phil the Pill?

123
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,568
是啊
Yeah.

124
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,800
绝对是到玩消失的时间了
It's definitely time to stage a disappearing act.

125
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,480
那么下周二  老时间 老地方吗
So next Tuesday, same time, same place?

126
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,326
抱歉  亲爱的 那是时装周 我要轮班
I'm sorry, love, it's Fashion Week. I'm booked double shifts.

127
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,963
－我忙完就打电话给你 －好
－I'll call you the instant things let up. －Okay.

128
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,404
另外 我还留了一些小纪念品让你会想起我
In the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.

129
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,448
哦 桃
Oh, Dor

130
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,988
你的臀部从这个角度看实在是很迷人
Your derriere looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.

131
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,789
瞧
See?

132
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,461
出其不意的恭维
A compliment when least expected.

133
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,939
我说什么好呢  快乐得像个摇尾巴的小狗
What can I say? Happy as a pup with two tails.

134
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,901
而且我觉得也算帮了老菲儿一个小忙
And I think I've done old Phil a bit of a favour too.

135
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,941
当然 他肯定是最后一个知情的
Of course, he'd be the last to see it.

136
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,561
别指望此生能够得到任何人的报答
Never expect any thanks in this life.

137
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,683
你明白吗 那么下周二...
You know what I mean? So Tuesday...

138
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,361
...晚上10:03
...10:03 p.m.

139
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,526
我是该回我那冷冰冰的房间 空空如也的冰箱
Do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge,

140
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,488
还是快点回城里 享受热水澡 混暖的身体 在床上享用早餐呢
or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?

141
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,403
做决定 做决定...
Decisions, decisions...

142
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,600
没错 我想该去看看我的半正式的
Yeah, I think I'll pay a visit to my semi-regular,

143
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,122
准女朋友
quasi, sort of girlfriend.

144
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,326
我的宝贝茱莉.
My sweet Julie.

145
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,909
让我猜猜 出乎意料的最后一刻她来找你
Let me guess. Unexpected last-minute fare.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,472
是啊 她让我来来回回的开了几个小时
Yeah. She had me going up and down for hours.

147
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,040
那不是很有趣吗 因为那是如此...
That supposed to be funny? Because it is so very...

148
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,968
没趣
Not.

149
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,289
嗨!
Hey!

150
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,405
我不是开玩笑 阿尔菲!
I'm not kidding, Alfie!

151
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,529
我没开玩笑 有时侯我真的恨你
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.

152
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,282
是啊 你很懂得如何卖弄
You have a very ostentatious way of showing it.

153
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,122
是 我当然会
Yeah, I sure do.

154
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,159
不 亲爱的 我们能停一下吗 我只想放松一下
No, darling. Can we hit pause? I just need a second to unwind.

155
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,883
哦,我从豪华轿车里偷了半瓶伏特加酒
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.

156
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,283
你想怎么喝  加冰块吗
How do you want yours, on the rocks?

157
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,838
我就想像往常一样 阿尔菲 来吧
I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.

158
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,956
不 我已经精疲力尽了 我明天早上再补偿你
No, I'm so totally knackered. I'll make it up to you in the morning.

159
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,269
我保证
Cross my heart.

160
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,516
但是今晚  我只想好好的吃一顿 洗个热水澡
But tonight, all I'm good for is a bite to eat, hot bath

161
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,870
再好好地睡一觉
and a nice long sleep.

162
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,029
这里不是假日酒店 阿尔菲
You know, this isn't a Holiday Inn, Alfie.

163
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,831
你说什么
What's that again?

164
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,107
你今晚到底去哪儿了 说真的
Where were you tonight? Really?

165
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,874
你真该去开个餐馆 这真是太好吃了
You've got to open a restaurant. That's seriously delicious.

166
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,638
谢谢 阿尔菲 这只是辣椒而已
Thanks, Alfie. It's just chilli.

167
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,078
嗨
Hey.

168
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,957
来吧 看着我
A little eye contact, please.

169
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,676
我们之间真有感情
We have something here,

170
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,034
还是我只是你随叫随到的女人呢
or am I just a glorified booty call?

171
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,912
嗨
Hey.

172
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,232
嗨
Hey.

173
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,030
其实她想说的是
Here's what she's really saying:

174
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,432
她想要我负责 意思是: 成为 "正式的"
She wants me to commit. Translation: Become "domestified."

175
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:35,513
在一生中依属与任何人都是个错误
Now, it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life.

176
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:42,035
改变你的本性 那你就死定了
Change your nature, you're a dead man.

177
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,756
再来点红辣椒
Chilli, please.

178
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,857
不要误解我 她是很可爱
Don't get me wrong. She's adorable.

179
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:58,729
乖巧? 当然啦 但那就足够了吗
Cute? Absolutely. But is it ever enough?

180
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,576
我告诉你男人是什么 我们想要惊艳
I told you how we men are. We want showstoppers.

181
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,493
问题在于: 茱利叶还未惊艳到...
And the problem is, Julie hasn't got enough

182
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,373
足以让我当回事
of the superficial things that really matter.

183
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,975
－我不值你对我那么好 －是啊 也许真的是
－I don't deserve you. －Yeah, that's probably true.

184
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,773
我爱死你了
Too bad I love you.

185
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,377
谢谢 亲爱的
Thanks, babe.

186
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,651
－阿尔菲 阿尔菲 －怎么了
－Alfie, Alfie... －What?

187
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,013
你竟然对我说 "谢谢 亲爱的"
You're giving me the "Thanks, babe."

188
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,335
你就用"谢谢 亲爱的"来回答我！
You're giving me the "Thanks, baby."

189
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,769
－冷静点 －别让我冷静!
－Calm down. －Don't tell me to calm down!

190
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,657
－我知道你怎么想! －等等
－I know how you feel! －Wait a minute.

191
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,374
－你会吵醒...  －麦克斯
－You're gonna wake up... －Max.

192
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,974
嗨 小家伙 我们吵醒你了吗
Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?

193
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,737
是啊
Yes.

194
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,889
伙计们 吸取我的教训
Now, lads, learn from my mistake.

195
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,150
决不要跟单身妈妈交往
Never get involved with a single mum.

196
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,538
瞧 她们带着附属品
See, they come with accessories,

197
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,177
有些是...
some of which can be...

198
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,014
...不幸的 无法逃避的
...unfortunately, irresistible.

199
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,594
像刚才那一幕 提醒你我都是有保质期
Sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.

200
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,113
而女人的确比男人的保质期要短 不是吗
And women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don't they?

201
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,833
我认为这是茱利叶昨天发脾气的原因
I think that's what Julie was banging on about yesterday.

202
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,273
豪华轿车及司机
Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.

203
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,632
我以此为生
This is where I make my reasonably honest living.

204
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,256
这狠狠地打击了优雅的定义 你觉得呢
Standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn't you say?

205
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,377
我知道 相信我 这不过是一块踏脚石
I know. Believe me, it's merely a stepping stone.

206
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,136
现在只做着原地准备而已
Currently parked on one of those stepping stones

207
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,971
是我的好朋友 以及未来合伙人 马龙
is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.

208
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,610
黑色 就像洛内迪的肤色
Black. Like Lonette's skin...

209
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:10,367
...我再也触碰不到了
...which I will never again touch.

210
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,808
恐怕 你看到的他 心情很不好
I'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form.

211
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,254
瞧 马龙最近比较烦
See, Marlon's got a problem.

212
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,770
"恼人"的洛内迪
It's called Lonette.

213
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:36,698
前不久 她甩了他
And very recently, it dumped him.

214
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,591
哦 亲爱的 拜托 这次什么问题呢
Oh, dear. Come on, what was it this time?

215
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,032
凌晨三点 我在她门前乞求她
Three a.m. Begging, at her front door.

216
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,798
－有多醉 －呕吐了
－Level of inebriation? －Vomiting.

217
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:48,907
好 让我理顺一下 凌晨三点
Right. So let me get this straight. You were at her front door,

218
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,516
你在她家门口 边乞求 边呕吐
3 a.m. In the morning, begging and vomiting?

219
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,228
然后呢 她不为此感动吗
And what, she wasn't charmed by that?

220
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:02,234
阿尔菲 为什么2号车里的伏特加酒没了
Alfie? Why is there no Stoli in car number two?

221
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,511
我不知道
I've no idea.

222
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,231
我得好好地看着这个家伙了
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.

223
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,058
这矮家伙名叫闻
That little chap's name is Wing.

224
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,210
我老板 这个烂企业的老板
My boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.

225
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,013
－好好擦车 －"老板的概念"只是在我和马龙
－Wipe that car good. －Owner, that is, till me and Marlon

226
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,654
搞到贷款 把这家公司从他手里买下来之前
swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...

227
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,611
嗨 这里 鸟粪没擦掉
Hello. You miss bird shit.

228
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,131
闻
Wing.

229
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,176
他是个乱叫的疯子
He's barking mad.

230
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,054
看他和那个女人说话的样子
Check out the way he talks to the little woman.

231
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,032
她给了他青春 帮他做饭
She's given him her best years, cooked his chop suey,

232
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,958
帮他打理公司一切事务 我打赌 曾有一次
helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn't wait

233
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,348
他迫不及待地撕开她的和服 但看看现在的他
to rip off her kimono. And now look at him.

234
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,987
我开始怀疑起婚姻制度
And I'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage.

235
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,637
真是个好主意 我们搞到那笔贷款
That's a great figure, man. We swing that loan,

236
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,917
你从退休帐户上提钱 我当了摩托车
cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...

237
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,912
那一定会让闻大吃一惊的
We're gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.

238
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,505
我能预料到这些
I could've predicted this.

239
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:17,845
瞧 马龙和洛内迪的感情到了 这关键的"18个月"的危险时期
See, Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18-month

240
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:19,213
"我们的未来怎样 我们在干什么"
"Where are we going, what are we doing,"

241
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:21,454
"我们怎么了" 这些讨厌的问题
"what's happening here?" crisis point

242
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,739
会出现在任何一段感情里
that rears its ugly head in every relationship.

243
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,832
洛内迪想要结婚 家庭 孩子
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

244
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,133
马龙则还想要18个月
Marlon wanted another 18 months

245
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:32,564
以确定他不会遇上更好的
to make sure nothing better was coming his way.

246
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,830
我把事情搞砸了
I fucked up egregiously.

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,912
我看见你很茫然 不知所措
I see you're making the most of that birthday calendar.

248
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,879
等他意识到错误 希望她回到自己身边时...
By the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back...

249
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,359
一切都太晚了 －嗨 陌生人
...it was too late. －Hey, stranger.

250
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,239
嗨
Hey.

251
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,359
...卡洛
Carol.

252
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,318
－卡洛!嗨 卡洛 －嗨
－Carol. Hi, Carol. －Hi.

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,031
你看上去棒极了
You look wonderful.

254
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,268
啊 卡洛 真高兴又见到你 你保重
So, Carol, well, it's nice to see you again. You be well.

255
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,349
刚才到底怎么回事
What's up with that?

256
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,996
这么说吧 戏才刚开场就结束了
Put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.

257
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,118
－我能知道为什么吗 －算了吧
－Do I even wanna know why? －No. Come on,

258
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,392
告诉你后就没意思了
it would be less than discreet to tell you why.

259
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,636
手臂上的毛 说真的 又粗又厚...
Hair on the arms. Seriously. Long, thick...

260
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,112
你在说什么 你手上没毛吗
What are you talking about? You don't have hair on your arms?

261
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,952
－你今晚看起来真漂亮 －谢谢
－You're looking very lovely tonight. －Thank you.

262
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,428
哦 吃闭门羹了 老兄
Dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.

263
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,237
经典 不是吗
Classic, isn't it?

264
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,955
现在他得不到她 他觉得自己不能没有她
Now that he can't have her, he thinks he can't live without her.

265
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,636
有些人真是搞笑
Some people are funny.

266
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,074
马龙的尴尬处境让我想到我自己
Marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation.

267
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,639
或许...该是时候回家撩起欲火了
Maybe... Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.

268
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,232
有人给小阿尔菲开门吗
Anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?

269
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,753
哦 阿尔菲 现在不是时候 我心里很乱
Oh, this isn't a good time, Alfie. Got a lot on my mind.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,993
哦 上帝 是啊 我真的很讨厌那样
Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate when that happens.

271
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,916
开门 宝贝 你看上去美极了
Open up, baby. You look seriously beautiful.

272
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,392
－今晚不行 阿尔菲 －怎么了 告诉我
－Not tonight, Alfred. －What's the matter? Tell me.

273
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,075
我没什么...我只是... 我想我只是看到了
I don't... I'm just... Well, I guess I'm... I'm just...

274
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,869
我简直眼火爆
I'm just seeing red.

275
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,231
我是说 那个可怜人在痛不欲生
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.

276
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,029
算了吧,难道你... 你已经折磨他很长时间了
Come on, haven't you...? You've tortured him long enough.

277
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,758
阿尔菲 他应该早料到这一天的
Alfie, he should've thought about all that

278
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,759
在他和他前女友搞不清楚之前
before he was screwing around with that ex-girlfriend of his.

279
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,115
那些假臀 廉价货色
Those fake-ass, $5 titties.

280
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,189
－那些是假的吗 －醒醒吧
－Those are fake? －Hello?

281
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,911
哇 我郁闷了 那些就像...
Wow, I'm devastated. They've got, like...

282
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,350
阿尔菲 你来这里该是来安抚我的 记得吗
Alfie, you're supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?

283
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,030
我是 看他回心转意了 不是吗
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?

284
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,555
双膝跪地 边乞求 边呕吐...
Begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...

285
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,238
我不在乎
I don't care.

286
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,439
抱歉 我没那么好骗 而且我决不原谅他 也绝不会忘记
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't forgive and I definitely do not forget.

287
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,035
－我现在走行吗 小姐 －噢 是的 菲力克斯
－Is okay if I leave now, miss? －Oh, si, Felix.

288
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,734
顺道把灯关上 谢谢
And hit the lights on your way out, por favor.

289
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,978
我该走了
I better go.

290
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,890
外面要下大雨了
It's really coming down out there.

291
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,891
是啊
Yeah.

292
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,056
而且我穿着绒衣
And I'm wearing suede.

293
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,694
你得说真话 太好玩了
You're telling the truth. That's brilliant.

294
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,455
好吧 我想起来一个 我从没在太平洋里游过泳
Okay. I got one. I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.

295
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,809
－我也没有 －哦 该死
－Me neither. －Oh, shit. Okay.

296
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:20,492
哦 我从没看过一部007电影
Okay. I've never seen a James Bond movie.

297
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,331
你开玩笑 连肖恩.康纳里演的也没看过吗
You're joking. Not even a Sean Connery?

298
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,608
真的吗
You serious?

299
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,438
哇 不知道这到底算是奇迹还是悲剧
Wow, I don't know if that's magic or tragic.

300
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,618
好 五球 该我了
Okay. Five ball. My go.

301
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,219
－我从没自己铺过床 －哦 胡说
－I've never made my own bed. －Oh, bullshit.

302
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,139
不 我重复一遍 我从没自己铺过床
No, I repeat, I've never made my own bed.

303
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,654
哦 你有个什么样的妈妈啊
Well, what kind of mama you got?

304
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,979
问的好
That's a good question.

305
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,776
让我想想 恩
Let's see. All right.

306
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,574
－我告诉你一些事儿 －好
－I got something for you. －All right.

307
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,818
我从没做过...
I've never had sex...

308
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,493
我从未试过一晚上和两个人做过爱
I've never had sex with two people in one night.

309
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,176
五六个 你的最爱
Six-five, your favour.

310
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,212
懂了
Gotcha.

311
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,931
那么 阿尔菲 你一晚上最多和几个
So, Alfie, what's the most you've had in one night?

312
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,794
我们不继续玩了吗?
We've stopped playing the game, haven't we?

313
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,431
是我理解错了 还是这里有人在调情挑逗
Am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?

314
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,879
伴随记忆
Driftin' on a memory

315
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,757
我只想同你寻觅
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you

316
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,511
爱着你
Loving you

317
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,690
瞧 如果我有你这样的天分
See, if I had that kind of talent...

318
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,612
这首歌
And a song

319
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,007
－说 继续说完 －如果我有你那样的天分
－Go on, finish your sentence. －If I had that kind of talent,

320
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,498
那样的身材
and I looked like you...

321
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,979
这首歌
And a song

322
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,490
－...我就会展露我性感的一面 －哦 是吗 －在舞台上
...I would be strutting my stuff －Oh, yeah? －On a stage.

323
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,138
相信我 接下来发生的事
Trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing

324
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,757
是我今晚来时想也没想过的
from my mind when I dropped by tonight.

325
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,599
然而 我对自己说
But then I thought to myself,

326
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,074
知道吗
"You know what?

327
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,473
如果这能使她忘掉对马龙的怨恨
If this will help her get past her anger towards Marlon,

328
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,751
作为朋友 我应该帮他们 不是吗
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?

329
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,554
不遗余力
To do whatever I can to help."

330
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,636
我后来才发现
I find that, lately,

331
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,833
即使对自己撒谎 也是那么的容易
even lying to myself comes easily.

332
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,528
第二天早上 我一直无法忘却昨晚的事
The next morning, and I can't get last night out of my mind.

333
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,133
竭尽全力把注意力转移到别的事情上 任何别的事
Try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.

334
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,771
极力不再去想我好友妻子那性感到难以置信
Anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot,

335
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,289
我一生之中从未见过的完美臀部
best-ass-I've-ever-seen-in-my-life girlfriend.

336
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,374
阿尔菲 阿尔菲
Alfie. Alfie.

337
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,214
－阿尔菲！ －我该假装没听见吗
－Alfie! －Shall I pretend I can't hear him?

338
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,979
伙计
Dude.

339
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,199
－嗨 －要迟到了 要迟到了
－Hey! －Too late. Too late.

340
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,351
－嗨 你慢点 行吗 －嗨 马利 干嘛啊
－Dude, would you slow down? －Hey, Marly, what's up?

341
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,109
马力?
"Marly"?

342
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,615
嗨 听着 我得跟你谈谈 你先哪也别去
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you. You ain't going nowhere

343
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:47,253
你得告诉我昨晚怎么样了
till you tell me what went down last night.

344
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,894
－昨晚? －是 别敷衍我了
－Down last night? －Dude, don't mess with me.

345
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,456
洛内特怎么了
What happened with Lonette?

346
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,699
你听过"敲门"这个词吗
Have you ever heard the word "knock"?

347
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,373
－怎么了 －什么 没事啊 没事发生
－What went down? －What? Nothing happened.

348
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,211
－我们打了几杆桌球 －老婆在对我冷战
－We had a few shots. －Missus give me silent treatment.

349
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,069
她就不知道 她不说废话那就是上帝保佑了
Little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.

350
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,852
继续说 继续说 老兄 那有用
You keep it up. Keep it up, mate, it'll work.

351
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,897
阿尔菲 发生什么了
Alfie, what happened?

352
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,689
哦 真他妈的 老兄 瞧 我
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

353
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,939
－我昨晚多喝了几杯 －醉了吗
－I drank a lot last night. －Drunk.

354
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,377
恩 我...
Well, I...

355
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,215
我真的...想不起来了
I really... I don't remember.

356
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,220
－伙计,你一定对她做了些什么 －没有
－Dude, you did something to her. －No.

357
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,176
哦,得了,你做了 因为今天凌晨四点
Oh, yeah, you did. Because she shows up at my house,

358
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,539
她来我家了 说她希望回到我身边
at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.

359
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,338
她甚至还说如果我想要更多时间考虑
She even said that if I needed more time,

360
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,698
她完全能理解
that she understood completely.

361
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,372
真他妈神了
How fucking crazy.

362
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,739
这家伙走运了 幸亏有我 马龙赢了
Chalk one up for the blokes. Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.

363
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,856
这意味着他将无罪释放 而我也是
Which means he's off scot-free, and so am I.

364
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,734
这真是个奇迹 太神了 太神了
This is a bloody miracle. That's fantastic. Fantastic.

365
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,011
－拜托 你是怎么对她说的 － 等等
－Come on, what did you say to her? －Look, look.

366
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,888
－一切很顺利啊 －嗨 你到底说什么了
－It's all good. －Come on, what did you say?

367
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,534
我向她求婚了
I asked her to marry me.

368
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,495
你是我最好的兄弟 是吗
You know you're my best man, right?

369
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,631
这个故事的寓意
Moral of the story?

370
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,972
万事终有报！
No good deed goes unpunished.

371
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,053
今天的每日一词吗
New word for the day?

372
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,574
"恢复"
"Resilience:

373
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,896
从失望和失败中迅速痊愈的能力
The ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss."

374
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,179
反弹的能力
Capacity to spring back.

375
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,332
明白吗 我不是说为茱利找个替代品
Understand, it's not about replacing Julie.

376
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,248
我只是想回到简单的生活状态
I just wanna get back to the simple life.

377
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,094
女人对我毫无意义
Women who mean nothing to me.

378
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,688
所以我认识了一个叫犹沓的夜总会女郎
So I've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.

379
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,653
嗨 呜塔
Hello, Uta.

380
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,000
现在 作为一个追求刺激的单身汉
Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,

381
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,752
我必须遵循一些简单的原则
I have to live by some very simple rules.

382
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,639
阿尔菲.鄂尔肯斯的信条 哲学
Alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy,

383
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,037
也可能是我父亲给我的唯一忠告
which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me.

384
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,838
他说："儿子 当你看见一个漂亮姑娘...
He said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...

385
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,154
记着 在别处一定有个男人已经厌烦了她"
...just remember, somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her."

386
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,310
－你要什么 －G&T(调和酒)谢谢
－Can I help you, man? －G and T, please.

387
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,079
告诉我觉得那个欧洲痞子怎么样
Explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?

388
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,005
我觉得非常不公
I think it's incredibly unfair

389
00:29:50,006 --> 00:29:53,420
在性体验方面 男人可以比女人更为放荡 而对于女人
that it's acceptable for men to be sexually experimental, then with a woman,

390
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,990
如果她想要尝试下... 比如接吻 三人行
if she wants to try something... A kiss or a threesome.

391
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,619
你知道的 就会有人说三道四 我就不会批判她们
You know, that they'd be judged. I wouldn't judge them.

392
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,214
我觉得如果你俩要接吻 我...我会
And I think if you two were to kiss, I would... I would just...

393
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,971
我会把它看做是一件美好的事
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.

394
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,933
尽管我像很多男人一样生活放荡
Although I'm living every guy's Rat Pack fantasy,

395
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,574
有些事我还是接受不了
something feels a bit off.

396
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,851
并且让我回到了从前的生活状态
And throwing myself back into the old lifestyle

397
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,336
而且不像我想象中的那么顺畅
isn't going quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.

398
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,693
抱歉
Sorry.

399
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,293
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

400
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,296
你们继续 别管我
You carry on without me.

401
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,459
噢 亲爱的 我...
Oh, my loves, I...

402
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,338
我不知道怎么回事 平时不是这样的
I don't know what happened. This is so unlike me.

403
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,610
对 你们... 你们还是...
Yeah, you... You two just...

404
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,597
我曾以为没有比死亡更糟糕的事了
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.

405
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,073
然而 无从解释...
Then, from out of nowhere...

406
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,109
无法想像的
...the unthinkable.

407
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,309
现在我真不知道别人会怎么看你
Now I really don't get what everyone sees in you.

408
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,768
这状况总是不断地出现 一次又一次
It just keeps on happening and happening.

409
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:14,241
或者更确切地说 没反应 又继续没反应
Or more accurately, not happening and not happening.

410
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:19,125
这从来未试过 呜塔 相信我 从没有
This never happens, Uta. Honestly, never.

411
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,002
真的
Honestly.

412
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,923
浪得虚名...
Not the word around town...

413
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:30,367
"短小精干"
...peewee.

414
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:38,165
鄂尔肯斯先生 我叫米兰达.库尔浦
Mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.

415
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,247
米兰达
Miranda.

416
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,008
这个阴茎医生有点娘娘腔
The penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.

417
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:48,365
我了解到你有ED (阳痿的术语)
So I understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction.

418
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:54,959
是 我是有点 有点...你刚才说的那个
I am experiencing a little... A little... A little bit of... What you just said.

419
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:57,189
别担心 我是这方面的专家
Not to worry. That's my area of expertise.

420
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,151
那么 你最近有否经历不寻常的情感压力 鄂尔肯斯先生
So have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?

421
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,188
压力? 感情上的? 我? 不 从没
Stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.

422
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:11,591
当然 除非你把我最近和茱利的谈话也算在内的话
Well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.

423
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,572
我不能再见你了 阿尔菲
I can't see you anymore, Alfie.

424
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,949
－怎么了 你生气了吗 －不 我真没有
－Why? You angry? －No, I'm really not angry.

425
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:21,635
只是 你知道的 我们所追求的不一样
Just, you know, we want different things.

426
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,477
我不能让你在麦克斯的生活中 时不时地出现消失
And I can't have you traipsing in and out of Max's life.

427
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,038
你换发型了 是吗
You've changed your hair, haven't you?

428
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,632
你有换 不是吗 不 你换了
You have, haven't you? No, you have.

429
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,710
你是换了发型 你剪短了吗
You've changed your hairdo. You cut it?

430
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,757
看上去漂亮极了
It looks gorgeous.

431
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,030
－谢谢 －怎么会...
－Thanks. －How come...?

432
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,197
为什么我们在一起的时候 你从不梳这样的发型
How come you never had it like that when we were together?

433
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,871
我必须得走了
I really gotta go.

434
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,358
哦 我想
Well, I guess...

435
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,792
你得要回这个
...you need these back.

436
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,152
谢谢
Thank you.

437
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,196
阿尔菲
Alfie?

438
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,227
你会没事的 对吗
You gonna be okay?

439
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,669
是的 别担心 我总是很好
Yeah. No worries. I'm always okay.

440
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,671
好吧 我们来检查下你的阴茎
Alrighty, let's take a gander at that penis of yours.

441
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,910
明白
I see.

442
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,072
好
Well.

443
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,023
－看来我们让它有反应了 －好像是啊
－It seems we have lift-off. －It seems we do.

444
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,631
真好
Wunderschon.

445
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,358
这下放心了
What a relief.

446
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,754
我是指 如果他都能让我起来
Well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy,

447
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:51,478
那我在女人面前 就应该没问题了 是吧
I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn't I?

448
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,717
恩 看来生理上没什么问题
Well, there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong,

449
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,472
所以 简而言之 我们可以较为肯定的说
so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem

450
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,972
－你的问题和压抑有关 －意思是：和茱利有关
－was simply stress-related. －Translation: Julie-related.

451
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:06,151
就像我常说的 避得了初一 避不了十五
Like I always say, if they don't get you one way, they'll get you another.

452
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,111
然而
However,

453
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:16,072
－我还是发现一些不寻常的东西 －不寻常的东西?
－I did feel something a little kooky. －Kooky?

454
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,037
不用过分担心 鄂尔肯斯先生
There is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.

455
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,389
我想你可能有一个肿块...
I thought I felt a lump...

456
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,516
...在你的阴茎上
...on your penis.

457
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,633
如果幸运的话 这不算什么
But with any luck, it will be nothing.

458
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:35,315
"肿瘤"和"阴茎"出现在同一个句子中
The words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.

459
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:38,074
这可不是每天都能听到的
There's something you don't hear every day.

460
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,152
小阿尔菲获得了一份提前的圣诞礼物
And so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.

461
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,114
阴茎活组织切除
A penis biopsy.

462
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,198
我会在三天内得到检查结果... 哦 是五天
I get my test results in three days... Well, five.

463
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,069
天哪 五天 五天后就是周末了 哦 主啊
Five counting the weekend. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

464
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:57,663
我该怎么才能让自己不发疯呢
How am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?

465
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:58,984
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

466
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,780
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

467
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:03,700
我还年轻
I'm a young man.

468
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:08,302
转移注意力 阿尔菲 转移...
Shift focus, Alfie. Shift...

469
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,704
孩子们 我们走
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

470
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:20,984
向前走 孩子们 看正前方
Move along, children. Look straight ahead.

471
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,268
别看前面的陌生人 看正前方
Come on. Do not look at the man. Look straight ahead.

472
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:27,705
此时 我也许还是呆在家里好些
In the meantime, perhaps I'm safer hobbling on home.

473
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:48,028
阿尔菲 亲爱的 怎么了 你就像死而复生般
Alfie, dear, what's wrong? You look like death warmed over.

474
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:50,543
没 没 我只是 踢球时受了点伤 没事
No, I've just... I've got a bit of a football injury, that's all,

475
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:52,627
斯尼特莫太太您好 里贝曼太太 您好
Mrs Schnitman... Hello, Mrs Liberman.

476
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,262
你们看上去好极了 你们去哪
You two look lovely. Where you going?

477
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:57,263
－买东西 你要带什么吗 －不 不需要
－Shopping. You need anything? －I'm fine.

478
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:00,538
嗨
Hello.

479
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:03,346
能谈谈吗
Can I talk to you for a minute?

480
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,628
女士们 这是我朋友洛内特
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

481
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:09,861
她真可爱 不错啊 和黑人约会
She's lovely. Good for you, dating an African-American.

482
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,862
是啊
Yeah.

483
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:17,922
嗨 嗨 亲爱的 我想你
Hey. Hey, girl. I missed you.

484
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:21,764
别理我们 当我们不在 你们继续说
Don't mind us. We're not here. You kids keep talking.

485
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:24,488
－很高兴见到你们 －再见 里贝曼太太
－Very nice to meet you. －See you, Mrs Liberman.

486
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,002
女士们 买到拿不动为止！
Shop till you drop, girls.

487
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,401
你最近好吗
So how have you been?

488
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,480
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

489
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,101
对我来说
It seems to me

490
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:42,217
那些我担忧的问题看来都是杞人忧天
the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.

491
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,339
真正的问题却出乎意料
It's the ones that catch you unexpectedly

492
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,025
在一个周三的下午 犹如当头一棒
on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.

493
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:52,417
我提出和她共度难关...
I offered to face the music with her...

494
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:55,263
...但她想独自承受
...but she wanted to go it alone.

495
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:17,188
我们都知道如果这个孩子 出生时有任何白人特征
We both knew that if the baby was born with any white-boy features

496
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:19,783
洛内特和马龙就完了
it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.

497
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:23,507
更别提你们今晚的主角了
Not to mention your host for this evening.

498
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:29,668
但是站在寒风中 我感到自己心存愧疚
But standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.

499
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:31,507
思绪袭来
Thinking thoughts like,

500
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:35,025
"又失去一个没有机会相识的孩子
"Here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know.

501
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,885
你的孩子
Your own."

502
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:57,528
很快啊
Didn't take long.

503
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:08,484
天啊 你快冻僵了
Bloody hell, you're freezing.

504
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:12,323
感觉怎么样
How do you feel?

505
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,767
空虚
Empty.

506
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:33,168
那晚在酒吧 我以为我是顺手牵羊的
That night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.

507
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:37,160
没想过会搞成这样的 不是吗
Doesn't seem to have worked out that way, does it?

508
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:52,104
哦 天哪
Oh, man.

509
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,300
如果可以安然度过的话 或许这次与死亡擦肩而过
If everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality

510
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:57,578
只是个征兆
is a sign.

511
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:03,220
我该考虑做... 做一些改变了
I should think about making... Making some changes.

512
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,443
也许
Possibly.

513
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,538
－下周 －抱歉
－Next week. －Excuse me.

514
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,418
我刚是否...你是否刚看了我一眼 我留意到了你又躲开了?
Did I just...? Did you just look at me? Did I just notice you turn away?

515
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,730
如果你知道了我的检查结果 他们告诉你了的话...
Look, if you know the results to my tests, and they're telling you...

516
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,699
－鄂尔肯斯先生 －求你 求你
－Mr Elkins. －Please. Please.

517
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,978
鄂尔肯斯先生 我说了一万遍了 请你坐回去
Mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.

518
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,895
鲍尔逊先生 您周二11：30的预约取消了
Mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11:30.

519
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,216
我会没事的
I'm gonna be fine.

520
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,035
－我有这种预感 －谢谢 再见
－I just feel it. －Thank you. Goodbye.

521
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,012
一分钟就好 或者十分钟
I'll just be a minute. Or ten.

522
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,249
－没关系 您慢慢来 －我没办法
－It's all right. Take your time. －I don't have a choice.

523
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,298
我以前是小便 现在我是在滴水
I used to pee. Now I trickle.

524
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,453
－我叫乔 你呢 －阿尔菲
－I'm Joe. What's your name? －Alfie.

525
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,574
你过得如何 阿尔菲
So how you doing, Alfie?

526
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,694
－等着呢 你呢 －不爽
－Hanging in. You? －Shitty.

527
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,554
是啊 我也一样 一样
Yeah, me too. Me too.

528
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,459
－我喜欢你的领带 －哦 谢谢 我有一套
－I like the bolo tie. －Oh, thanks. I have a collection.

529
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,414
你晓得 到你老了 你就会懂得耐心
You know, when you're old, you learn to be patient.

530
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,635
是啊
Yeah.

531
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,074
过去我从没耐心去等 总是往前冲 冲啊 冲
Used to be I never had time for nothing. Go, go, go.

532
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,431
－我懂那种感觉 －是啊
－I know that feeling. －Yeah.

533
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,491
我妻子总是嚷着让我带她 去夏威夷 里诺渡假
My wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation. Hawaii. Reno.

534
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,856
我总是说 明年吧 爱维 明年
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year.

535
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,210
我有很多事没做
I got too much on my platter."

536
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,649
我总以为我时间很多
I always thought I'd have more time.

537
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,579
然而一个周日的晚上 她从烤箱里取出烤肉
Then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.

538
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,414
叫着 "汤来了" 但是重重地摔倒在厨房的地上
Yells, "Soup's on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.

539
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,618
就那样
Just like that.

540
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,651
就像迪斯科的衰亡
Dead as disco.

541
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,970
天啊 我很遗憾
Jesus, I'm sorry.

542
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,529
我试着拼凑过去的回忆
I tried picking up the pieces.

543
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,419
甚至独自去了淮基基海滩的8日游
Even went to Waikiki alone on the 8-day cruise package

544
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,376
就是她终日提起的那个
she was always yakking about.

545
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,254
爱维让我难以忘怀
Couldn't get Evie out of my mind.

546
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,274
孩子 生活教会了我两样东西:
There's two things I learned in life, kid:

547
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,278
找到自己的真爱
You find someone to love,

548
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,294
还有 把每天都当做你的末日来过
and live every day as though it were your last.

549
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,818
她是你的了 阿尔菲
She's all yours, Alfie.

550
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,499
好好享用
Enjoy.

551
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,858
你没事吧 孩子
You all right, son?

552
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,177
恩 希望如此
Yeah. I hope so.

553
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,650
瞧 如果你觉得无聊了 或者想找人聊天
Look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...

554
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,130
...可以向我倾诉
...give me a holler.

555
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,450
－你不会打的 －也许会的
－You'll never call. －Maybe I will.

556
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,799
好啊 不错 我们可以一起去酒吧 约会女孩子
All right, good. We'll go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.

557
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,153
没错
Damn right.

558
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,312
谢谢你 乔
Thanks, Joe.

559
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,792
嗨
Hey.

560
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,231
对于艾维的事我感到难过
I'm sorry about Evie.

561
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,639
我们...
We...

562
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,108
...我们并不是那么情投意合的...
...weren't all that fond of each other...

563
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,274
但我们很亲密
...but we were very close.

564
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,509
－如果你能明白我的意思 －我想我明白
－If you know what I mean. －I think I do.

565
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,679
最近我想了很多关于上帝和死亡的事
I've been thinking a lot lately about God and death.

566
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,978
如果圣经课上讲的都是真理
And how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,

567
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,871
那我真的在劫难逃了
I'm really in for it.

568
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,559
不过就目前看 我还不会和撒旦为伴
But I won't be partying with Lucifer any time soon,

569
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,597
因为我的检查结果是阴性！
because my test results were negative.

570
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,108
我能活了！我能活下去了！
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!

571
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,333
我弄坏了我的Prada鞋 但我不在乎
I ruined my Prada lace-ups and I don't care.

572
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,559
别以为我忘了 我要彻底改变生活的誓言
Don't think I've forgotten my oath to completely change my life,

573
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,592
因为我没忘记
because I haven't.

574
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,658
胡萝卜苹果汁加点小麦草
Carrot-apple with a dash of wheat grass.

575
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,414
没错
Yep.

576
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,018
现在 健康是第一位的
Health is now priority number one.

577
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,531
工作计划正快马加鞭步入正轨
Business plan moves onto the fast track.

578
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,075
－如果你这么说... －今晚在安布罗斯的预演...
－If you say so... －Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...

579
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,072
不 我当然不想说啦 等等 我还有什么
No, I definitely don't want to talk. Okay, hold on, what else have I got?

580
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,998
对 好
Okay, yeah.

581
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,797
好吧 如果我们一定要 那就要吧 但是...
All right, if we must, we must, but...

582
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,752
新的目标 新的开始
New slate. New beginning.

583
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,840
－司机 你叫什么 －阿尔菲 先生
－What's your name, driver? －Alfie, sir.

584
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,780
在这等着 阿尔菲
Wait here, Alfie.

585
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,699
你知道大概要等多长时间吗
Do you know how long you're gonna be, roughly?

586
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,982
你要到别的地方去吗
You got someplace to go?

587
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:00,783
不 不 我只是想转转活动一下喝杯茶
No, I was just gonna nip off and get a cup of tea.

588
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,094
那还不如原地待命
Look, why don't you just stay put.

589
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,036
好 还是不好
Yea or nay?

590
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,909
好 当然好 我这么认为 真的
A definite yea, I think. Really.

591
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,550
太美了 您不这样认为吗 先生
Stunning. Wouldn't you say so, sir?

592
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,109
抱歉 难道我没让你在车旁等着吗
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait by the car?

593
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,759
我想我该帮助这位女士提包
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages.

594
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,558
真的好看吗
Definite yea?

595
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,392
我是这么认为的
I think.

596
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,519
一点小问题...
With one minor...

597
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,659
－可以吗 －是的
－May I? －You may.

598
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,139
调整一下
Adjustment.

599
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,454
斗牛士 别指望 下辈子吧
Bullfighter. Another lifetime. Don't ask.

600
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,339
50岁 看上去
Fifty, if she's a day.

601
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,140
但是他们不是说50就意味着女人的第二春吗
But don't they say 50 is the new 40,

602
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,335
难道她不是个活生生的例子吗
and is she not living proof?

603
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,293
我指 看看她 保养的多么好
I mean, have a look. Beautifully preserved.

604
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,894
乳沟像荷兰隧道
And cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.

605
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,418
－好些了吗 －好多了
－Better? －Much.

606
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,420
你选择Chanel真是太有眼光了 再来双性感的粉红高跟鞋
You are so right to trust Chanel. A pair of hot-pink stilettos,

607
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,297
你就可以闪亮登场了
and you're good to go.

608
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,258
－啊 你服务还真是到家 －我们尽力做到
－Well, aren't you Mr Full-Service? －We try.

609
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,132
－他有点生气了吧 －哦 没事 这对他有好处
－He's getting a little pissy, isn't he? －Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.

610
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,776
－你的丈夫比你大很多吧 －他不是我丈夫
－Is your husband a lot older than you? －He's not my husband.

611
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,458
他戴着结婚戒指
He's wearing a wedding ring.

612
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,811
我可从没说过他不是别人的丈夫
Well, I never said he wasn't somebody else's husband.

613
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,618
－后备箱里的东西拿出来 －遵命
－Grab the stuff from the trunk? －You got it.

614
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,333
很好
Cheers.

615
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,536
女士 如果你以后需要我的服务
Ma'am, if you require my services in the future.

616
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,031
圣诞快乐 女士先生
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.

617
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,113
看看 我的朋友们 那是个真正的女人
Now that, my friends, is a real woman.

618
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,014
聪明 性感 而且...
Smart and sexy and...

619
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,388
你注意到我们之间的短暂调情吗
You noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?

620
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,872
我不禁想
Makes me think,

621
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,639
像这样层次的女人
if a woman like that, of that calibre

622
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,239
看上我这样一个人
should take notice of a bloke like me,

623
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,317
那 也许...
then, perhaps...

624
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,709
也许 我太低估我自己了
Perhaps I'm selling myself a bit short.

625
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,592
在一霎那间
In a flash,

626
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,434
我有了我的新年计划
I have my New Year's resolution.

627
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,432
瞄准更高的目标
Aim higher.

628
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,271
灾难性的. 厄运
Catastrophic. Doomed.

629
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,437
凄凉 大变更
Desolate. Cataclysmic.

630
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,910
买给他一本一日一词做圣诞礼物
Bought him a word-of-the-day calendar for Christmas.

631
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,789
大错特错
Big mistake.

632
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,999
节假日 一年中最大的商机
Holiday season, busiest time of the year.

633
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,274
我还想大赚一笔呢
I try to run a business.

634
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,477
－怎么了 出什么事了 闻先生 －你的黑人兄弟
－What's the problem, Mr Wing? －Your soul brother.

635
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,791
他辞职了
He quit.

636
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,310
在马龙留给我的信里面 他称我为他的最好的朋友
In the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...

637
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,551
但是为取消了我们的生意计划而道歉
...but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.

638
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,717
他说他现在最想做的事就是让洛内迪开心
He said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.

639
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,916
他们突然决定 要搬到北部去
They decided, on the spur of the moment, to move upstate,

640
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,113
还随时欢迎我去做客
and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.

641
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,833
也许 洛内迪说服了马龙
Somehow Lonette convinced Marlon

642
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,758
我们当面辞行 会是件很痛苦的事
it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.

643
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,037
并且会使事情更糟
And to make matters worse,

644
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,675
又是每年第二个最寂寞的夜晚
it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year?

645
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,790
圣诞夜
Christmas Eve.

646
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,309
一个有着所有熟悉的节日气氛的夜晚
A night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings

647
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,753
无助 郁闷 绝望
of hopelessness, anguish, despair.

648
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,352
不是一个适合独处的日子
Not a great time to be flying solo.

649
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,749
这就是我坚持情侣是不应该在
That's why I'm of the belief couples should never split up

650
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,110
感恩节和1月2日之间分开的原因
between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.

651
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,594
在过节的时候一定要有个伴,一定!
Always have a relationship to see you through the holidays. Always.

652
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,433
不好的是 当然 那就是要送礼物
The downside, of course, being gifts.

653
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,872
我总是怀疑其他人都
Personally, I've always suspected that everyone else

654
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,993
过着比我快乐的圣诞
is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.

655
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,476
不是说我从没真正过过圣诞
Not that I've ever actually had a Christmas.

656
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,879
说来话长了
That's a whole other Dickens story.

657
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,174
出租车
Taxi.

658
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,899
出租车
Taxi.

659
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,296
劳驾
Excuse me.

660
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,173
抱歉 兄弟 超载是违法的...
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the law for me to carry any more than...

661
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,575
感谢上帝
Thank the Lord.

662
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,935
圣诞奇迹
A Christmas miracle.

663
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,219
好吧 上来吧
All right, hop in.

664
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,337
谢谢你救了我们 我都快冻僵了
Thanks for saving us. I was freezing my little tush off.

665
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,492
别担心 你瞧 我后面已经坐满了
No worries. You know, it's pretty full back there.

666
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,693
－为什么你不... －好主意
－Why don't you... －Good idea.

667
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,014
为何不呢
Why don't I?

668
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,136
嗨 小心香槟
Hey, watch the champagne.

669
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,578
都上来啦
All in.

670
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,734
－他们不会太离谱的 －大家留点神
－They don't get out much. －You wanna watch out, you guys.

671
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,051
不然你们的圣诞袜子里的礼物会变成一块煤块的
You'll end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.

672
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,099
你是英国人
You're English.

673
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,931
我喜欢英国人
I love English.

674
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,536
－你叫什么 －阿尔菲
－What's your name? －Alfie.

675
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,794
想吸一口吗 阿尔菲
You wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?

676
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,672
不 谢谢 我正想戒掉
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

677
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,713
好吧 就一口
All right. One hit.

678
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,073
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmastime

679
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,294
美国佬有个谚语"随波逐流"
There's an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."

680
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,609
哦 是的 我是有点假期忧郁症
So, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.

681
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:26,728
但是当一个会让你意乱情迷的女孩 邀请你去聚会时
But when a girl of this mind-blowing calibre invites you to a party,

682
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,529
是时候该随波逐流了
it's time to get going and start flowing.

683
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,539
也许是来的太晚了
Maybe it's the late hour.

684
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,039
也许是蛋青酒太烈了
Maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog.

685
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,248
也许是相互间狂野的欲望
Maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire

686
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:50,082
带给了我们一个快乐的小圣诞
to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.

687
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,649
无论如何 勾引从未如此顺利
Whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly,

688
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,854
我发现我开始说出一些 不像我自己风格的话
and I find myself saying something highly out of character?

689
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,213
我正在翻修我在曼哈顿西区的房子
I'm renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.

690
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,729
但是 如果你愿意
But, say, you could...

691
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:12,416
...去我暂租的公寓挤一挤
...crash at my sublet, if you want.

692
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,333
整个假日都看到你
See you through the holidays.

693
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,090
听起来很诱人啊！
That sounds inviting.

694
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,999
那么多年来 终于时来运转了
And so it came to pass, that after all those years,

695
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,357
小阿尔菲终于在圣诞得到了他想要的
little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas.

696
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,513
圣诞假期的12天飞逝
The 12 days of Christmas were flying by

697
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,836
如此的超现实
at a surrealistic pace.

698
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,278
是的 这样的兜风很爽
Yeah, it's been quite the ride.

699
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,794
这份"礼物"是难以抗拒的
The package was irresistible.

700
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,471
一次和性感学生妹的完美演出
A showstopper with a new-school brand of sexiness.

701
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,079
她回头时 谁会不驻足观望呢
Who wouldn't get off on the way she makes heads turn?

702
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,350
再且 我们有如此之多的共同点
Plus, we have so much in common.

703
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,594
－她是那么甜美 有趣 个性出众 令人兴奋 －爱慕着你
－She's sweet, fun, original, exciting, －Adore you.

704
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,318
充满了惊喜
Full of surprises.

705
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,672
哦 我差点忘了提了 她在床上棒极了
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a cracking good bed.

706
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,151
我开始想
I began to wonder,

707
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,673
这就是我要的那个...
could this be the one...

708
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,074
那个最终吸引我的人吗
...who finally holds my attention?

709
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,636
新年快乐
Happy New Year!

710
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,232
在每一段注定失败的感情中
In every doomed relationship,

711
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,595
总会出现那种我称之为的
there comes what I like to call

712
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,509
"阿呃时刻"
"the uh-oh moment."

713
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,759
当一些特定的小事发生时
When a certain little something happens,

714
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,313
你会明白那是分手的前奏
and you know you've just witnessed the beginning of the end.

715
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,799
然后你会兴致全无 并且去思考
And suddenly you stop and you think:

716
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,554
"啊 冰山就在前面"
"Uh-oh, iceberg ahead."

717
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,358
和尼基一起 这只是那些"阿呃时刻"的
With Nikki, that was the first of many...

718
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,990
第一次
...uh-oh moments.

719
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,274
开始是琐事引起争吵
It began with petty arguments.

720
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,754
然后是间歇性的忧郁
Followed by random bouts of melancholia.

721
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,029
喜怒无常 大起大落
Major highs and manic lows.

722
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,478
这个女孩从不知道当她过分地拥有一个男人
This girl never knows when she's had one too many.

723
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,115
并且持续出现不稳定的卤莽行为时
And there had been constant displays of erratic, reckless behaviour.

724
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,914
谢谢 不 不 我无法保证会和她走到最后
And thank you, no. No, I did not have insurance.

725
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,556
但是每次当我开始感觉到 没有必要再继续下去了的时候
But whenever I begin to feel there's little reason to go on,

726
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,631
我还是会提醒自己 我们仍然有很多共同点
I'm reminded that we still have one very major thing in common.

727
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,750
若然 她不再无时无刻地吸烟
If only she didn't insist on smoking before,

728
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,711
未来
after

729
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,636
以及现在
and during.

730
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,375
你何时回家 亲爱的
What time are you gonna be home, honey?

731
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,819
听到了吗
Hear that?

732
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,930
"你何时回家 亲爱的"
"What time are you gonna be home, honey?"

733
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,970
这些近似妻子口吻的话是危险十足的
That's dangerously close to wife-speak to me.

734
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,052
因为我为"晚特餐"做特别的准备
Because I'm making something really special for din-din.

735
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,259
"晚特餐"
Din-din?

736
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,999
我等会打电话回来
I'll call later.

737
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,570
听着 你不觉得那颜色有点太刺眼了吗
Listen, are you sure you don't think that colour's a little bit intense?

738
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,778
－我觉得你有点太显眼了 －小心
－I think you're a little bit intense. －Careful,

739
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,570
你手上都是油漆
because you've got paint all over your hands.

740
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,848
而且 你穿着我最喜欢的衬衫在粉刷房间 尼基 别这样
Plus, you're wearing my favourite shirt to paint the house in, Nik. Don't...

741
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,890
抱歉 亲爱的
Sorry, baby.

742
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,092
我要走了
I gotta run.

743
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,379
不 我要走了
No, I've gotta run.

744
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:10,339
我打赌我能让你多呆一会
I bet that I can make it worth your while to stay.

745
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,933
我知道你能 但是知道吗 我要去接人
I'm sure you can. But you know what? I've got that meeting.

746
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,375
－知道吗 －是的
－Haven't I? －Yeah.

747
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,374
你知道 当像那样一个讯号 没能把你留住 你得小心了
You know you're in trouble when a sight like that can't keep you planted.

748
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,097
当我还在圣.阿尔班念高中时
When I was a boy at St. Alban's Secondary School,

749
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,659
学校组织了一次文化之旅
the school took us on this cultural trip

750
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,571
去了一个
to observe art at one of the...

751
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,857
很大很著名的伦敦博物馆
One of those big famous London museums.

752
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,655
总之 当时我在那里
Anyway, when I was there,

753
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,336
看到一尊希腊女神的大理石像时
I came across this statue of a Greek goddess in marble.

754
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,255
阿芙罗荻...阿芙罗荻特 诸如此类的
Aphrodi... Aphrodite, something like that.

755
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,935
她漂亮极了
Beautiful, she was.

756
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,819
完美的女性胴体
Perfect female form.

757
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,572
雕凿的特征
Chiselled features.

758
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,492
精美无比
Exquisite.

759
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,977
我敬畏地望着她
I stood in awe of her.

760
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,219
最后 老师叫我们集合了 我经过雕塑
Finally, the teacher calls us all over, and I'm walking past it,

761
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,453
与此之际 我留意到女神像的侧面
and on the way I notice, in the side of this Greek goddess,

762
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,693
所有的那些裂缝 缺口 瑕疵
all these cracks, chips, imperfections.

763
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,578
毁了我对她的美好印象
Ruined her for me.

764
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,171
就像尼基
Well, that's Nikki.

765
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,214
一尊美丽的雕像
A beautiful sculpture...

766
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,172
毁了
...damaged...

767
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,651
当然 只有你走近了 才能看仔细
...in a way you don't notice till you get too close.

768
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,176
我对着那个信号茫然了一会
I lost the signal for a second there.

769
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,938
但我不知道
But I don't know.

770
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,699
这只是个人的思绪翻滚而已
It's just a lot of personal stuff going on.

771
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,053
你明白我吗
You know what I mean?

772
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,692
－哦 我知道 －欢迎 阿尔菲先生
－Oh, I know. －Welcome, Mr Alfie.

773
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,454
很高兴见到你 埃尔维司 希望你不介意我进去
Good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope you don't mind me rambling on.

774
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,095
－祝你愉快 先生 －谢谢
－Enjoy your evening, sir. －Thank you.

775
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,533
如你所见 这小子的地位提高了
As you can see, the lad's moving up in the world.

776
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,973
事实是我认识了一个朋友
It's just that I've got this friend who's,

777
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,649
这么说吧 死赖着不走
let's say, outstayed his welcome.

778
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,935
完全正确
Absolutely right.

779
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,014
有些人易请难送啊 我喜欢
It's a lot tougher getting them out than getting them in. I like that.

780
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,455
你永远无法猜到我正要拜访谁
You'll never guess who I'm dropping in on now.

781
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,491
几周前我都无法相信
I wouldn't have believed it myself a couple of weeks ago.

782
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,819
你为什么不直接告诉他们
Why don't you just try being honest,

783
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,210
酒店要调整管理 注入新血
and tell your friend that the hotel is under new management

784
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,448
他们得腾出几个位子 你懂我的意思
and that they have to vacate the premises. You know what I mean.

785
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,331
那件和服
That kimono

786
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,812
因为你的低胸衣而美妙
does wonders for your decolletage.

787
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,857
－大话 －很低的领口啊
－Big word. －Big decolletage.

788
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,678
我们为何不喝一杯 然后告诉我你其他的麻烦
Why don't we have a drink and you can tell me the rest of your troubles.

789
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,673
变成我听她的话 转型了
Instead of me listening to hers. That's a change.

790
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,834
知道嘛 对很年轻的人来说 你极富智慧
You know, for someone so very young, you're terribly wise.

791
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,592
暗恋者?
Secret admirer?

792
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,390
其中之一
One of many.

793
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,398
你永远不会送花给女孩子 是吗 阿尔菲
You would never think of bringing a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?

794
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,516
这只会鼓励他们
It would only encourage them.

795
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,677
我去调酒
I'm gonna make us that drink.

796
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,233
你喜欢喝什么 亲爱的
What's your poison, sweetheart?

797
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,119
我想喝一点威士忌 谢谢 如果你有精品米尔顿的话
I'll have a spot of whiskey, please. Midleton Rare, if you've got it.

798
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,596
我喜欢不时地抛出一些名贵的品牌
I like dropping a fancy brand name in now and again,

799
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,552
让她知道 她不是我唯一的女人
let her know she ain't the only one been around.

800
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,599
为何不把这个制做成"午后苦艾酒"
Why not make this an absinthe afternoon?

801
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,272
太好了
Brilliant.

802
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,355
－不知道她在说什么 －你喝过苦艾酒吗
－No idea what she's talking about. －You've had absinthe?

803
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,193
最近没有 不 没有 再说一遍 叫什么
Not recently, no. Remind me, what is it again?

804
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,837
绿仙女 法国印象派的最爱
The Green Fairy. The French impressionists' liquid drug of choice.

805
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,678
我还给你准备了你喜欢的小蛋塔
And I got you some of those little egg thingies you like so much.

806
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,759
我提过我一旦喜欢上什么 接下来我就会
I mention I like something once, next thing I know,

807
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,558
把它放在银色托盘里
I get it on a silver platter.

808
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,517
完美 是吧
Perfect, huh?

809
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,915
我希望有一天自己能过上这样的生活
Kind of pad I plan to earn myself one day.

810
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,589
简朴优雅 而又不失时髦
Understated elegance with just a touch of the trendy.

811
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,750
她是个讲究时尚品味的人
She's a regular fashionista.

812
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,597
你不必跟她说哪件外套配哪双鞋
You don't have to tell this one which slingbacks go with which frock.

813
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,959
她拥有自己的化妆品牌公司
Owns her own cosmetics company.

814
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,315
事实上 化妆品帝国
Empire, actually.

815
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,759
从在时尚沙龙做面部美容产品起家
Started out doing facials in a fancy salon.

816
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,052
用一点洗颜泥和少许番木瓜混合
Took a handful of mud, mixed it with a dash of papaya,

817
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,480
然后投放到市场 成事 有了这一切
put it on the market, and bingo: All this.

818
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,392
这些东西都是违法的
This stuff is so illegal.

819
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,438
我从布拉格走私了一批
I smuggled a whole batch of it back from Prague

820
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,034
装在李斯特林瓶里
in Listerine bottles.

821
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,873
哦 我看了下你的工作计划
Oh, I checked out your business plan.

822
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,079
－然后呢 －印象深刻
－And? －I'm impressed.

823
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,551
－你看上去很惊讶 －一点也不
－You seem surprised. －Not at all.

824
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,990
因为在这些虚张声势下
Because underneath all that bravado

825
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,639
要打败一个比想象中聪明的家伙
beats the heart of a guy who's a lot smarter than he thinks he is,

826
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,270
但他不会像人们想象的那么骄傲
but not nearly as cocky as he'd like everybody else to believe.

827
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,759
我们这是算什么呢  算是建立在哪种基础上呢
What are we...? What exactly are we basing this on?

828
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,275
对我个性的看法
This insight into my personality

829
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,358
将心比心
That it takes one to know one.

830
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,958
什么
What?

831
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,618
我在想如果有一个机灵的小纹身艺术家在这的话
I was just wondering if there's a clever little tattoo artist out there

832
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,898
他可以把"巴布罗"改成"阿尔菲"
who could change "Pablo" into "Alfie."

833
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,768
敬聪明的小纹身艺术家
Here's to clever little tattoo artists.

834
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,892
天啊
Jesus.

835
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,652
它让我浑身发热
It made me feel all warm going down.

836
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,170
那是我做的
That's my job.

837
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,216
你知道他们说什么吗
You know what they say.

838
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,896
说什么
What do they say?

839
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:27,096
苦艾酒能让情更浓
Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.

840
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,957
哦 太好了
Oh, great.

841
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,753
瞧瞧这
Check this out.

842
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,675
再看看浴缸的尺寸
Have a look at the size of this tub.

843
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,110
她有过两个丈夫 都死了
She's had two husbands, both croaked,

844
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,033
我有种感觉 这里就是案发现场
and I have a feeling this was the scene of the crime.

845
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,949
来 亲爱的 洗个鸳鸯浴吧
Come on, baby, let's get wet.

846
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,759
如果她继续这样
If she keeps this up,

847
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,919
改变那个纹身会比她想象中快得多
we're gonna be updating that tattoo of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.

848
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,072
记得小阿尔菲最后是怎样得到他想要的圣诞礼物的吗
Remember how little Alfred finally got what he wanted for Christmas?

849
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,913
期望值别太高
Be careful what you wish for.

850
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,030
还有其他
There's something else.

851
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,474
打盹了吗
Dozed off?

852
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,755
是啊
Yeah.

853
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,275
我想要醒着等你的
I tried waiting up for you.

854
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:13,028
－接待拖了很长时间 是吧  － 非常久 我筋疲力尽了
－Your meeting ran late, huh? －Very. I'm knackered.

855
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,957
还淋湿了
And wet.

856
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,670
但是
But...

857
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,151
我想我们还是应该谈谈 尼基
...I do want us to have a little chat, Nikki.

858
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,391
好啊
Okay.

859
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,595
当然
Sure.

860
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,155
不如我们边吃夜宵边谈吧
Why don't we talk over a midnight snack.

861
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,715
我做了烤牛肉和约客郡布丁
I made roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.

862
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,239
那是你小时侯的最爱 是吗
That was your favourite as a young lad, right?

863
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,113
愿意的话 再看看我把家里布置得如何
And check the place out, if you please.

864
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,716
－你的小姑娘辛苦劳作了一番 －我留意到了 看起来很好
－Your little girl worked her fanny off. －I noticed. It looks brilliant.

865
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,232
做得很棒
Really smashing.

866
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,572
－尼基 －阿尔菲 我在想
－So, Nik... －Alfie, I've been thinking.

867
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,772
你瞧这些可爱的小土豆了吗
Will you look at these cute little potatoes?

868
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,777
是 我知道我最近脾气不好
Okay. I know I have been a real handful lately.

869
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,576
我不知道 这和我不放心你
I don't know, I think it has to do a lot with me feeling displaced...

870
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,139
不完全信任你有关
...and not totally trusting.

871
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,254
亲爱的 直说吧
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

872
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,817
我以后会变好的
I am gonna do better.

873
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,055
我保证
I promise.

874
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,895
从现在开始起我会按时吃药治疗
I am gonna take my medication religiously from now on.

875
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:38,213
一切都会好起来的
And everything, everything is gonna be easy and breezy.

876
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,576
听上去不错吧 亲爱的
Sound good? Honey?

877
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,773
来 过来坐啊 等着你开餐
So come, come and sit. A feast awaits.

878
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,577
我吃过了 尼基
I already ate, Nik.

879
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,775
那好
Of course.

880
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,170
不用担心 就当是把剩菜放起来
No worries, we'll have leftovers.

881
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,857
我可以放点牛肉当饭吃
I can whip up a little corned beef hash for brunch.

882
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,329
怎么了 阿尔菲
What's the matter, Alfie?

883
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,536
没什么 我只是...
Nothing. I just...

884
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,710
我脑子很乱...
I've got a lot on my mind and...

885
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,770
－我觉得有点... －什么
...I'm feeling a bit... －What?

886
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:21,734
冷漠 距离 疏远 还有什么
Cold? Distant? Remote? What?

887
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,374
哦 尼基这一切都是胡扯
Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.

888
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,496
一切来得太快了
Everything happened so quickly.

889
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,898
－我在这方面不合适 －哪方面
－I'm not the best at this sort of thing. －What sort of thing?

890
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,539
我...
I...

891
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,779
不知道该怎么说
...don't know exactly how to say it.

892
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,297
当然能说 阿尔菲
Sure you do, Alfie.

893
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,529
甩女孩子你很有经验
You've had plenty of experience dumping girls.

894
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,012
别担心
Don't worry.

895
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,458
我早打算走了
I'm already gone.

896
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,339
真是奇怪
Strange.

897
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,854
即使你知道感情走到头了...
But even when you know it has to end...

898
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,770
但当这一切真的结束时...
...when it finally does...

899
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,652
你还是无法避免地感到痛苦
...you always get that inevitable twinge

900
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,332
我做得对吗
Have I done the right thing?

901
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,654
我必须承认...
I must admit...

902
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,375
我很怀念那种伴侣关系
...I do miss the companionship.

903
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,417
尼基是很惊艳
Nikki was a showstopper.

904
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:53,619
但是像我又老又丑的Gladys阿姨曾说的
But as me ugly old Aunt Gladys used to say,

905
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,493
外表不代表一切
"Looks aren't everything."

906
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,377
我以前觉得那只是废话
I used to think that was a load of bollocks,

907
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,532
但是最近我一直在想...
but just lately I've been thinking...

908
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,414
...也许那个老太婆说的是对的
...maybe the old bat had something.

909
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,232
茱利?
Julie?

910
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,258
阿尔菲 嗨
Alfie, hi.

911
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,713
真没想到啊
What a surprise.

912
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,593
－天啊 我很久没见到你了 自从... －是啊
－God, I haven't seen you since... －Yeah.

913
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,670
你看上去真不错
You look... You look amazing.

914
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,468
谢谢 你也是 你看上去也很好
Thanks. You too. You look good too.

915
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,590
我感冒刚好
I'm getting over a cold.

916
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,915
－不过没事了 对吧 －我很好 我一直都很好
－But you're okay otherwise? －I'm fine. I'm always fine.

917
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,038
见到你很高兴
It's good to see you.

918
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,918
我也是
And you.

919
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,596
嗨 我以前...
Hey, you know, I was...

920
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,233
我很抱歉我们之间发生的那些事
I'm sorry about what happened between us.

921
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,309
也很遗憾我们之间那样结束了 这不...
And I'm sorry how it all ended up. It wasn't...

922
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,955
这不太妥当
It wasn't good.

923
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,593
麦克司走了 我也见不到你 我感觉差极了
I felt bad about not seeing Max and about not seeing you.

924
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,517
－过去的事情就别提了 －好
－It's water under the bridge. －Good.

925
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,673
你知道
You know...

926
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,599
我在想...
...I'm wondering...

927
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,430
也许我们...
Maybe we...

928
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,832
我不能保证什么
You know I can never promise anything.

929
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,000
但是你愿意 如果你愿意
But if you want, if you like,

930
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,353
也许我们可以从新开始
maybe we could see each other again.

931
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,196
我觉得可以
It would be okay by me.

932
01:13:22,196 --> 01:13:24,720
不仅仅是可以 而是很乐意
It would be more than okay, it would be great.

933
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,359
－阿尔菲 我... －怎么
－Alfie, l... －Yeah?

934
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,310
这是亚当
This is Adam.

935
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,559
嗨 你好
Hey, how are you?

936
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,232
－嗨 你好 亚当 －好啊
－Hey, how you doing, Adam? －Pretty good.

937
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,152
－亚当 －是啊
－Adam. －Yeah.

938
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,071
遇见你太好了
It was great running into you.

939
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,231
－你看上去很棒 －谢谢
－You look fantastic. －Thanks.

940
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,915
几点了 我得走了
What time is it? I've gotta go.

941
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,554
我有个接待要迟到了 很高兴见到你 亚当
I'm late for a meeting. Nice to meet you, Adam.

942
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,310
茱利?
Julie?

943
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:14,597
茱利?
Julie?

944
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,832
－麦克司好吗 －哦 很好
－How's Max? －Oh, really good.

945
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,475
替我问好
Will you say hi?

946
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,433
－好的 －或者不必了
－Sure. －Or not.

947
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,752
保重
Be well.

948
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,332
嗨
Hello.

949
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,616
嗨
Hello.

950
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,939
闻太太 一切还...
Mrs Wing, is everything...?

951
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,898
闻先生
Wing.

952
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:36,692
你怎么哭了
Why are you crying?

953
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,532
我没哭 出去
I'm not crying. Get out.

954
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,855
－你确定吗 －我没事 出去 阿尔菲
－You sure? －I'm fine. Get out, Alfie.

955
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,729
抱歉 我只是想看看能否借辆车
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see if I could borrow a car.

956
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,056
她离开我了
She leave me.

957
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,339
什么
Sorry?

958
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:54,729
如花 她走了
Blossom leave me.

959
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:59,052
如花 那是你太太的名字吗 如花
Blossom? Is that your wife's name, Blossom?

960
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,215
我做错什么了 阿尔菲  因为爱她吗
What I do wrong, Alfie? Love her?

961
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:08,654
瞧 老兄 快点 你能找回她的
Look, mate. Come on, you can win her back.

962
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:12,059
哄哄她 给她送花 巧克力
Woo her. Send flowers and chocolates.

963
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,654
写诗
Write a poem.

964
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,374
－你这么做的吗 －事实上 不 我从没做过
－That what you do? －Well, actually, no, I've never done that,

965
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,937
但是那应该可行
but it may be a way to go.

966
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,656
如花押什么韵
What rhyme with Blossom?

967
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:30,009
我会用 无瑕
I would try "awesome."

968
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,858
好
Okay.

969
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,813
你总是带来惊喜
You never cease to amaze.

970
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,976
嗨
Hey.

971
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,172
很高兴见到你 洛
Great to see you too, Lon.

972
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,536
我应该打电话来的 嗨 山姆
I guess I should have rung. Hey, Sam.

973
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,135
恩 事先知会一下更好
Well, that would have been a plan.

974
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,813
哦 抱歉 我只是
Well, you know, I'm sorry, it was just...

975
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,731
不错啊
It's nice.

976
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,858
瞧 洛内特
Look, Lonette...

977
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:14,580
这真是很尴尬 你瞧 因为
This is so uncomfortable, I know. Because...

978
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,652
你不必那么小声 马龙不在
You don't have to whisper. Marlon's not here.

979
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,779
我真的很怀念你们俩
I really miss you both.

980
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:29,052
我刚刚在想 也许 ...
And I just wondered, maybe...

981
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:32,470
也许我和你可以忘了以前的一切
Maybe me and you could put it all behind us,

982
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:36,383
当作什么事都没发生 像从前那样 你知道吗
pretend like it never happened, and then move forward, you know?

983
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,146
我只是
I just...

984
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:42,584
你知道的 阿尔菲
You know, Alfie...

985
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,341
...你来这里不太好
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.

986
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:55,946
你们俩没有孩子
You two didn't have a baby.

987
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,780
你们有孩子
You did have a baby.

988
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:05,340
不 你前面那一句是对的(言指孩子是阿尔菲的)
No, you were right the first time.

989
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:36,904
回想起那天在诊所 我记得
Thinking back to that day at the clinic, I remember

990
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:40,989
我想要从洛内的眼中看出 我是否能理解她
trying to look in Lon's eyes to see if I could even begin to understand

991
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:45,659
看她经历了什么 但她并不愿看着我
what she was going through, and how she wouldn't look at me.

992
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,620
我想那时我是知道的
And I think I knew then.

993
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,867
我只是不愿承认而已
I just didn't want to admit it to myself.

994
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,464
所以
So classically...

995
01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:00,065
...我沉默不语
...I said nothing.

996
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,949
我知道这孩子还是有可能
I knew there was a good chance the baby

997
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,660
是马龙的
could be Marlon's.

998
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,869
至少我希望是
At least, I hoped.

999
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,427
对我而言...
This is a lot...

1000
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:19,506
我也很希望 洛
...for me too, Lon.

1001
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,705
马龙选择留下
Marlon stayed.

1002
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,982
现在是吧
For now.

1003
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,544
我能补偿什么吗
Is there anything I can do?

1004
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:09,624
你又可以补偿什么 阿尔菲
What are you gonna do, Alfie?

1005
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,299
嗨
Hey.

1006
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:02,059
你知道 我从没...
You know, I never...

1007
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,581
－我从没想过... －你从没想过伤害任何人
－I never meant... －You never mean to hurt anybody.

1008
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:12,146
但你做到了 阿尔菲
But you do, Alfie.

1009
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:46,989
我想我需要有个朋友倾诉
I felt I needed a friend to talk to.

1010
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,589
问题是 好像突然之间我没有了朋友
Problem was, they were suddenly in short supply.

1011
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:55,823
我不记得当时是否在车里 我只是...只是...我就停在那里
And I don't remember being in the car. I just... I just... I was stopped.

1012
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,789
然后大哭起来
And I'm crying.

1013
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:02,147
－为那个孩子哭吗 －事实上 我也不知道
－Crying for the little one? －I don't know exactly.

1014
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,026
也许是吧
Maybe for him.

1015
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,625
我想 更多的是为我和
Mostly, I think, for me.

1016
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,820
马龙的友情
And Marlon.

1017
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:17,580
从未有人用那种眼神看着我
I never had anybody look at me quite like that before.

1018
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:24,621
相信我 我感觉他恨死我了
And believe me, I've had some looks that could kill.

1019
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:31,781
他站在洛内迪旁边 我没有 从没有...
He stood by Lonette. I could've never, ever...

1020
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:35,100
除非你真正爱上了一个人 你才会明白你想要什么 
You don't know what you'll do till you really love someone.

1021
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:40,483
那 接下来呢
Well, now what?

1022
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:45,285
你想挽救吗
You gonna shoehorn yourself into the situation?

1023
01:24:45,285 --> 01:24:46,638
不
No.

1024
01:24:46,725 --> 01:24:50,434
你做了你唯一能做的 你表现的像个绅士
You did the only thing you could do. You behaved like a gentleman.

1025
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:52,922
我从没被人那样指责
I've never been accused of that before.

1026
01:24:52,965 --> 01:24:56,321
别太得意 你的行为也不怎么光彩
Don't get all choked up. You also behaved like a scheming,

1027
01:24:56,325 --> 01:25:00,204
背后捅刀子 卑鄙无耻 狗娘养的小人
backstabbing, so-low-you-can-look-up-a-snake's-asshole son of a bitch.

1028
01:25:00,645 --> 01:25:04,160
下次拉裤链时 要三思
Next time, think before unzipping.

1029
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:09,315
没事了 你已经搞砸了
It's all right. You screwed up.

1030
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:11,915
那么 接下来你有什么打算
So, what are you gonna do?

1031
01:25:12,165 --> 01:25:14,474
解决问题吗
Run to the bridge?

1032
01:25:15,045 --> 01:25:17,195
问题是...
The question is...

1033
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:22,596
... 你的余生会怎样呢
...what's gonna happen with the rest of your life?

1034
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:52,958
如果我说 上几个周发生的事没令我手足无措的话
I'd be lying if I didn't admit the events of the past few weeks

1035
01:25:53,165 --> 01:25:55,759
那我肯定是在撒谎
have knocked me for a bit of a loop.

1036
01:26:02,285 --> 01:26:05,004
好啦 好啦 好啦
All right, all right, all right.

1037
01:26:16,445 --> 01:26:17,798
嗨 伙计
Hello, mate.

1038
01:26:18,385 --> 01:26:20,298
今晚要些什么
And what can we do for you this evening?

1039
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:22,057
－这个多少钱 －五块半
－How much are one of those? －Five-fifty.

1040
01:26:22,225 --> 01:26:24,819
你要马上放到水里
And you'll need to put them in water immediately.

1041
01:26:25,105 --> 01:26:27,175
好的 我要这个
Right, I'll have that.

1042
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:33,883
我改变主意了
Second thought.

1043
01:26:34,245 --> 01:26:36,520
事实上 有点特别用途
Actually, this is sort of a special thing.

1044
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,719
－什么场合 －再说一遍
－What's the occasion? －Say again?

1045
01:26:39,885 --> 01:26:44,322
－求婚吗 －不 不是
－Proposal? －No. No, no.

1046
01:26:45,485 --> 01:26:51,513
也许 我是想让我们的感情加深一点
Well, I do want to extend an offer to maybe have a go at it for a bit,

1047
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:53,482
调剂一下 诸如此类
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

1048
01:26:53,605 --> 01:26:56,802
知道了 表白！
I get it. Commitment issues.

1049
01:26:57,925 --> 01:27:01,122
告诉我 她或他是怎么样的人
Tell me what she, or he, is like,

1050
01:27:01,285 --> 01:27:03,082
我们会找到合适的花的
and we'll find the appropriate bloom.

1051
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,757
恩 她是...
Well, she is...

1052
01:27:09,845 --> 01:27:13,474
你知道吗 她很爱冒险
You know what, she's adventurous.

1053
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:20,036
－浮华 －而且非常性感
－Frivole. －And very sexy.

1054
01:27:21,245 --> 01:27:23,713
我想选"美好人生"吧
I'm thinking Dolce Vita.

1055
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:27,475
有点调皮 不拘礼节
A little mischievous. You know, cheeky?

1056
01:27:27,845 --> 01:27:30,917
极致诱惑 再配上
Avalanche, with a touch

1057
01:27:31,205 --> 01:27:34,515
爱慕之情
of mio amore.

1058
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:38,562
除此之外 更多的是...
And then under it all, she's just...

1059
01:27:38,885 --> 01:27:42,798
她的甜美
She's just kind of sweet.

1060
01:28:07,545 --> 01:28:09,103
利滋?
Liz?

1061
01:28:09,465 --> 01:28:12,457
－嗨 －是我 亲爱的
－Hello? －It's me, my love.

1062
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:19,304
嗨 我没想到你今晚会来 我以为你在上班
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight. I thought you were working.

1063
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:22,224
我取消了 所以我今晚休息
I had a cancellation, so I took the night off.

1064
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:24,864
听着 我想我们可以早点起来 然后离开城市
Listen, I thought we should get up early, get out of the city,

1065
01:28:24,865 --> 01:28:26,901
到乡间去 看看我们是否能
go to the country and see if we can stay

1066
01:28:27,265 --> 01:28:30,145
－住在你常提到的B&B酒店 －我很乐意 但是我不能
－at that B&B you're always on about. －I'd love to, but I can't.

1067
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:31,863
明天早上我要和投资人吃早餐谈生意
I have an investors' breakfast in the morning.

1068
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:34,898
－周末呢 －太好了 那样更好
－How about on the weekend? －Brilliant. Better.

1069
01:28:34,945 --> 01:28:37,618
好吧 我想你也许...
All right. I thought you may...

1070
01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:41,504
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

1071
01:28:42,145 --> 01:28:45,182
不是吧 阿尔菲
No. Alfie.

1072
01:28:45,505 --> 01:28:49,783
－哦 好贴心的举动 －亲爱的
－Oh, what a sweet gesture. －Milady.

1073
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:54,943
这可不是那些行货 都是我精挑细选的
They're not out of some plastic bucket. I handpicked, like, every bud.

1074
01:28:55,145 --> 01:28:57,784
－我看得出来 －而且我看上去还是有那么点
－I can see that. －And apparently, I have a bit of a flair

1075
01:28:58,025 --> 01:28:59,617
组合鲜花的天赋
for flower arranging.

1076
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:02,824
我太感动了
I'm impressed.

1077
01:29:02,825 --> 01:29:06,619
－都说不出话了 －很好 哄你开心我做到了
－Talk about being blown away. －Good. Mission accomplished.

1078
01:29:09,105 --> 01:29:11,300
我喜欢给你惊喜
I like surprising you.

1079
01:29:12,465 --> 01:29:14,535
恩 你的确做到了
Well, you certainly have done that.

1080
01:29:15,825 --> 01:29:20,138
那么 既然你要早起 那我走了
All right, then. Well, you're up early, so I'm off.

1081
01:29:20,145 --> 01:29:22,581
－我们明晚见 对吗 －是的
－I'm gonna see you tomorrow night? －Yeah.

1082
01:29:24,365 --> 01:29:27,038
我们见面时 有些事...
When we speak, there's some things...

1083
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:29,644
有些事我想认真和你谈谈
Some thing I really wanna talk to you about.

1084
01:29:29,645 --> 01:29:31,476
什么 亲爱的
What, honey?

1085
01:29:32,045 --> 01:29:37,516
我要等到那完美的一刻才说 先透露着这么些
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect moment, and that's all I'll say.

1086
01:29:39,285 --> 01:29:41,003
我明早给你电话
I'll ring you in the morning.

1087
01:29:41,005 --> 01:29:44,084
阿尔菲 谢谢你的花 我今晚乐极了
And, Alfie, thank you for the flowers. They made my evening.

1088
01:29:44,085 --> 01:29:45,564
真的
Really?

1089
01:29:47,445 --> 01:29:51,677
既然这样 也许我应该留下
In that case, maybe I'll stay.

1090
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:57,197
我不想...
I don't...

1091
01:29:59,445 --> 01:30:01,595
不要 这不太好
No, it's not a good idea.

1092
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:08,681
有男人在房间里 是吗
There's a guy in there, isn't there?

1093
01:30:12,405 --> 01:30:13,599
天啊
God...

1094
01:30:22,245 --> 01:30:23,837
走吧
Go.

1095
01:30:30,085 --> 01:30:31,757
别这样
Don't do this.

1096
01:30:36,245 --> 01:30:40,691
他哪里比我好呢
What's he got better than me?

1097
01:30:40,692 --> 01:30:41,960
阿尔菲 求你
Alfie, please.

1098
01:30:42,005 --> 01:30:45,235
告诉我 求你了
Tell me. Please?

1099
01:30:47,285 --> 01:30:51,324
真的 我真想知道 他哪里好 告诉我
Really, I would like to know. What's he got? Tell me.

1100
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:55,444
我想知道他哪里比我好 求你告诉我
I want to know what he's got. Please tell me.

1101
01:30:56,445 --> 01:31:00,040
来啊 来 来 马上告诉我
Come on. Come on. Come on, just tell me.

1102
01:31:00,285 --> 01:31:02,162
马上告诉我 说啊
Just tell me, come on.

1103
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,639
他哪里比我好!!!
What's he got better than me?!

1104
01:31:15,645 --> 01:31:17,840
他比你年轻
He's younger than you.

1105
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:48,239
"他比你年轻"
"He's younger than you."

1106
01:31:49,965 --> 01:31:53,196
我必须承认 我没预料到这个
I've gotta admit, I didn't see it coming.

1107
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:57,518
她让我毫无防备 不是吗
She caught me off-guard, all right.

1108
01:32:00,085 --> 01:32:03,680
你也说不清 是吗
You couldn't tell, though, could you?

1109
01:32:05,845 --> 01:32:11,522
如同你现在看到的 我宁愿若无其事一样
As you've learned by now, I'm rather skilled at hiding my feelings.

1110
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,602
你瞧 爱情这玩意
You see, the thing with feelings is they have

1111
01:32:18,605 --> 01:32:23,300
当你毫无防备的时候 却悄悄地让你措手不及
this quiet way of sneaking up on you when you least expect it.

1112
01:32:25,265 --> 01:32:27,381
你明白我意思吗
You know what I mean?

1113
01:32:27,665 --> 01:32:29,576
是的
Yeah.

1114
01:32:32,025 --> 01:32:33,617
就像利滋
Like with Liz.

1115
01:32:33,945 --> 01:32:37,858
谁会想到 在所有我认识的女人中
Who would've thought, of all the women I've known...

1116
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:43,814
这个让我放下防备的 却给了我致命的一击
...the one I let my guard down with delivers the knockout punch.

1117
01:32:46,925 --> 01:32:48,483
讽刺
Ironic.

1118
01:32:51,245 --> 01:32:53,554
日历上的话
Calendar word.

1119
01:33:01,325 --> 01:33:02,838
桃利
Dorie.

1120
01:33:07,605 --> 01:33:10,836
－嗨 －嗨 阿尔菲
－Hi. －Hello, Alfie.

1121
01:33:12,405 --> 01:33:16,284
－我很久没见你了 －也许是你很久没打电话给我了
－I haven't seen you in ages. －Maybe because you stopped calling.

1122
01:33:17,685 --> 01:33:20,438
我知道 事情变得有些...
I know. Things were getting a bit too...

1123
01:33:20,565 --> 01:33:23,079
别费心解释了 我不想听解释了
Don't bother explaining. I'm way past needing excuses.

1124
01:33:23,445 --> 01:33:28,120
好吧 不 你知道我想说什么吗
All right. No, you know what? I want to explain.

1125
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,355
什么 你玩厌我了吗
What? You had your fill of me?

1126
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:33,837
又遇到了比我漂亮的吗 我不想听 阿尔菲
Someone cuter came along? I don't need to hear it, Alfie.

1127
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:34,844
－瞧 桃利 －真的
－Look, Dorie... －Really.

1128
01:33:34,845 --> 01:33:36,164
瞧 桃利
Look, Dorie...

1129
01:33:39,685 --> 01:33:41,243
发生在我身上的是...
What happens with me is...

1130
01:33:41,565 --> 01:33:43,484
我不知道 我变得...
I don't know, I get...

1131
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:48,364
当一切变得...不是指亲密 就是之类的事
When it gets too... Not close but something like that,

1132
01:33:48,805 --> 01:33:53,754
我开始觉得  不是喘不过气
I start to feel... Not stifled,

1133
01:33:54,085 --> 01:33:57,680
不是被束缚了 好吧 类似这样的感觉
not trapped, but something like that.

1134
01:33:57,925 --> 01:34:00,564
然后我...然后...
And I... And...

1135
01:34:01,285 --> 01:34:03,560
你知道 你懂我意思吗
You know? You know what I mean?

1136
01:34:07,045 --> 01:34:10,196
这会....这会意味点什么吗
Did that make...? Did that make any sense?

1137
01:34:11,885 --> 01:34:15,480
我想 你现在应该比我更明白这点
I think it has to make sense to you more than me at this point.

1138
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:19,956
是啊 很公平
Yeah, fair enough.

1139
01:34:20,045 --> 01:34:22,878
我要走了 他等着我呢
I need to go. He'll be waiting for me.

1140
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:24,483
桃利
Dorie.

1141
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,717
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1142
01:34:47,285 --> 01:34:49,116
祝你好运 阿尔菲
Good luck, Alfie.

1143
01:35:06,565 --> 01:35:08,874
我从一开始就警告她们
I warned them all from the beginning.

1144
01:35:09,445 --> 01:35:12,994
我总是这么说
I always said something along the lines of,

1145
01:35:13,285 --> 01:35:15,162
我必须提醒你
"I must advise you,

1146
01:35:15,205 --> 01:35:19,403
我始终坚持着一个忠告
I am stamped with an invisible warning.

1147
01:35:19,525 --> 01:35:23,996
我永不忠诚于一 我永不结婚
I will not commit. I will never marry."

1148
01:35:30,565 --> 01:35:32,710
尽管我尽力了
Despite my best efforts,

1149
01:35:32,711 --> 01:35:39,842
我还是为我的始乱终弃 开始感到有点内疚悔意
I'm beginning to feel some small cracks in my faux finish.

1150
01:35:40,645 --> 01:35:44,717
当我回首生活的点滴时
You know, when I look back on my little life,

1151
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,439
以及那些我认识的所有女人
and all the women I've known...

1152
01:35:49,845 --> 01:35:52,757
...我不禁想
...I can't help but think about...

1153
01:35:54,645 --> 01:35:57,398
...她们为我所做的一切...
...all that they've done for me...

1154
01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:00,884
...而我却只付出极少
...and how little I've done for them.

1155
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:04,514
她们那么关心我 爱我...
How they looked after me, cared for me...

1156
01:36:05,205 --> 01:36:08,515
可我却从未回报过她们
...and I repaid them by never returning the favour.

1157
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:12,683
是啊
Yeah.

1158
01:36:12,885 --> 01:36:16,002
我还自以为是占尽便宜
I used to think I had the best end of the deal.

1159
01:36:20,085 --> 01:36:25,680
我到底得到了些什么
What have I got really?

1160
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:28,879
有几个臭钱
Some money in my pocket.

1161
01:36:29,245 --> 01:36:33,760
名牌服饰 有辆炫车
Some nice threads. Fancy car at my disposal.

1162
01:36:33,785 --> 01:36:36,060
和单身生活
And I'm single.

1163
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:42,040
无牵无挂 鸟一样无拘无束
Unattached. Free as a bird.

1164
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:47,400
不依赖任何人
I don't depend on nobody.

1165
01:36:47,525 --> 01:36:49,641
也没人依赖我
Nobody depends on me.

1166
01:36:50,885 --> 01:36:53,001
一个人过着生活
My life's my own.

1167
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:01,878
但心里不踏实
But I don't have peace of mind.

1168
01:37:09,165 --> 01:37:12,043
如果你不是那样想 你便一无所有
And if you don't have that, you've got nothing.

1169
01:37:15,405 --> 01:37:16,804
所以
So...

1170
01:37:18,285 --> 01:37:21,595
所以 什么才是答案 我不断问自己
So, what's the answer? That's what I keep asking myself.

1171
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:28,115
意义又何在呢
What's it all about?

1172
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:32,355
你明白我吗
You know what I mean?

1173
01:37:57,798 --> 01:38:02,798
