{\pos(192,275)}但是我认为  就算今天  他们也能告诉我们一些特别的东西
{\pos(192,288)}But I think they have something special to tell us right now,

37
0:02:18.40 --> 0:02:22.71
{\pos(192,275)}因为他们比其他任何人更能教会我们货币的巨大威力
{\pos(192,288)}because they, more than anyone, taught us the awesome power of money,

38
0:02:22.72 --> 0:02:27.79

{\pos(192,288)}Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

52
0:03:57.96 --> 0:04:00.00
{\pos(192,275)}但其成效并不尽如人意
{\pos(192,288)}But the sums hadn¹t been adding up.

0:04:11.88 --> 0:04:14.52
{\pos(192,275)}这个工厂是卡莱尔市最大的雇主之一
{\pos(192,288)}This factory is one of Carlisle¹s biggest employers.

{\pos(192,275)}不久前  人们担心工厂为了降低成本会将生产转移至海外
{\pos(192,288)}Not so long ago, people worried the company would shift production overseas to cut costs.

56
0:04:28.72 --> 0:04:34.67
{\pos(192,275)}200万磅的政府补偿帮助让倍耐力留在了英国
{\pos(192,288)}A £2 million government grant has persuaded Pirelli to invest in Britain instead.

{\pos(192,275)}当我们有一项大投资时
{\pos(192,288)}When we have a major investment, the confidence in people

59
0:04:42.16 --> 0:04:44.55
{\pos(192,275)}当地经济将从中受益
{\pos(192,288)}And the local economy benefits.

60
0:04:44.56 --> 0:04:47.11
{\pos(192,275)}不仅仅是倍耐力的雇员
{\pos(192,288)}And it's not only Pirelli employees.

{\pos(192,275)}还有依靠该工厂的数百个供应商和承包商
{\pos(192,288)}We have hundreds of suppliers and contractors who depend on this factory

62
0:04:52.64 --> 0:04:56.43
{\pos(192,275)}当倍耐力支出增加时  他们也从中受益
{\pos(192,288)}and they benefit also when Pirelli increases its spend.

63
0:04:56.44 --> 0:04:59.84
{\pos(192,275)}而他们也会导致货币回流至当地经济
{\pos(192,288)}And also they recycle that money into the local economy.

64
0:05:01.16 --> 0:05:03.07
{\pos(192,275)}听上去很神奇...
{\pos(192,288)}It might seem surprising...

65
0:05:03.08 --> 0:05:08.59
{\pos(192,275)}政府在担心不断攀升的国家债务时  投向私人企业的援助款
{\pos(192,288)}a handout to a private company, when the government's so worried about the mounting national debt,

0:05:08.60 --> 0:05:11.51
{\pos(192,275)}至今已超过1万亿英镑
{\pos(192,288)}now more than a trillion pounds.

67
0:05:11.52 --> 0:05:13.75
{\pos(192,275)}但凯恩斯洞若观火
{\pos(192,288)}But Keynes was quite clear.

68
0:05:13.76 --> 0:05:18.15
{\pos(192,275)}"有些时候我们需要介入让资本主义为我们服务
{\pos(192,288)}There are times when we need to step in to make capitalism work for us,

69
0:05:18.16 --> 0:05:21.31
{\pos(192,275)}哪怕是正在花我们没有的钱"
{\pos(192,288)}even when that means spending money we don¹t have.

70
0:05:21.32 --> 0:05:25.59
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯的意思是  有可能得让政府
{\pos(192,288)}What Keynes said was that it was possible for government

71
0:05:25.60 --> 0:05:30.87
{\pos(192,275)}介入以使市场运作得更好
{\pos(192,288)}to come in and make markets work better.

72
0:05:30.88 --> 0:05:37.04
{\pos(192,275)}有一种说法经常被提起  凯恩斯从资本家手中救出了资本主义
{\pos(192,288)}One way that it¹s often put is that Keynes saved capitalism from the capitalists.

73
0:05:39.32 --> 0:05:44.04
{\pos(192,275)}然而凯恩斯的批评者认为  是政府的错误才导致了问题
{\pos(192,288)}Though for Keynes¹ critics, it¹s mistakes by governments that really cause the trouble.

74
0:05:45.56 --> 0:05:49.99
{\pos(192,275)}当我们发现经济严重失衡的事例时
{\pos(192,288)}When we find instances of economies being seriously knocked out of equilibrium,

75
0:05:50.00 --> 0:05:53.79
{\pos(192,275)}它通常是政府错误政策的后果
{\pos(192,288)}it¹s generally been as a result of government policy mistakes.

76
0:05:53.80 --> 0:05:56.71
{\pos(192,275)}但凯恩斯并未给出有说服力的论据
{\pos(192,288)}But Keynes didn¹t really make a convincing case

77
0:05:56.72 --> 0:05:59.87
{\pos(192,275)}来说明即使当经济失衡时
{\pos(192,288)}that even when an economy was knocked out of equilibrium,

78
0:05:59.88 --> 0:06:06.20
{\pos(192,275)}政府介入行为将比任由经济自行改善要做得更好
{\pos(192,288)}that government action could do better than allowing the economy to essentially mend itself.

79
0:06:10.32 --> 0:06:12.47
{\pos(192,275)}所以凯恩斯若非经济的救世主
{\pos(192,288)}So Keynes was either an economic saviour,

80
0:06:12.48 --> 0:06:14.83
{\pos(192,275)}就是把我们引向歧途的人
{\pos(192,288)}or the man who led us all astray.

81
0:06:14.84 --> 0:06:17.71
{\pos(192,275)}但无可争议的是  他改变了我们的世界
{\pos(192,288)}But there¹s no argument that he changed our world

82
0:06:17.72 --> 0:06:19.59
{\pos(192,275)}以及我们看待世界的方法
{\pos(192,288)}and the way we think about it.

83
0:06:19.60 --> 0:06:23.71
{\pos(192,275)}80年前  他是争议的焦点  如今他又成为了争议的焦点
{\pos(192,288)}He was at the centre of the debate 80 years ago and he¹s back there again today.

84
0:06:23.72 --> 0:06:26.63
{\pos(192,275)}我们肩上的重担没有了...
{\pos(192,288)}A great weight is lifted from us...

85
0:06:26.64 --> 0:06:29.83
{\pos(192,275)}这是仅存的凯恩斯的演讲资料
{\pos(192,288)}This is the only known film of Keynes speaking.

86
0:06:29.84 --> 0:06:32.51
{\pos(192,275)}汇率不会大幅下降
{\pos(192,288)}There's no danger of the exchange falling too far.

87
0:06:32.52 --> 0:06:37.07
{\pos(192,275)}生活成本也不会大幅上升
{\pos(192,288)}There's no danger of a serious rise in the cost of living.

88
0:06:37.08 --> 0:06:41.87
{\pos(192,275)}这是经济学的一个节目  关于如何共享世界资源
{\pos(192,288)}It's a broadcast about economics, how to share out the world's resources.

89
0:06:41.88 --> 0:06:44.27
{\pos(192,275)}同时  英国贸易...
{\pos(192,288)}Meanwhile, British trade...

90
0:06:44.28 --> 0:06:46.83
{\pos(192,275)}对凯恩斯来说  这不是干巴巴的科学
{\pos(192,288)}But for Keynes, this was no dry science.

91
0:06:46.84 --> 0:06:49.59
{\pos(192,275)}而是如何将世界变得更好
{\pos(192,288)}It was about changing the world for the better.

92
0:06:49.60 --> 0:06:55.39
{\pos(192,275)}如果我们回顾那些于20世纪作出了重大贡献的英国人
{\pos(192,288)}I think if we're looking at Britons who made a real difference in the 20th century,

93
0:06:55.40 --> 0:06:58.99
{\pos(192,275)}最明显的莫过于温斯顿·丘吉尔
{\pos(192,288)}the most obvious name would be Winston Churchill.

94
0:06:59.00 --> 0:07:01.72
{\pos(192,275)}紧随其后的就是梅纳德·凯恩斯
{\pos(192,288)}John Maynard Keynes is really not far behind.

95
0:07:05.48 --> 0:07:07.87
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯在伦敦的这个房子里过了许多年
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes spent years in this house in London,

96

{\pos(192,288)}helping to save capitalism from the Great Depression, funding the war against the Nazis,

98

0:15:04.12 --> 0:15:09.04
{\pos(192,275)}凡尔赛合约迫使欧洲的一个大国跪下了
{\pos(192,288)}The Versailles Treaty brought one of the great powers of Europe to its knees.

194
0:15:12.44 --> 0:15:16.40
{\pos(192,275)}正如凯恩斯所预计的  德国经济陷入混乱
{\pos(192,288)}As Keynes predicted, the German economy descended into chaos.

195
0:15:18.48 --> 0:15:23.15
{\pos(192,275)}他们的债务如此之大  以至于他们不断印制钞票用于还债
{\pos(192,288)}Their debts were so impossibly large, they ended up printing the money to pay the bills

196
0:15:23.16 --> 0:15:28.08
{\pos(192,275)}而这迅速导致了高通胀和完全失去价值的货币
{\pos(192,288)}which quickly led to hyperinflation and a thoroughly worthless currency.

197
0:15:30.36 --> 0:15:33.23
{\pos(192,275)}高通胀不仅摧毁了经济
{\pos(192,288)}Hyperinflation didn¹t just destroy the economy.

198
0:15:33.24 --> 0:15:38.23
{\pos(192,275)}也摧毁了德国社会的基础 - 民众的希望
{\pos(192,288)}It destroyed the fabric of German society, people¹s hopes, too.

199
0:15:38.24 --> 0:15:41.47
{\pos(192,275)}有故事说  有人取出了他们的全部积蓄
{\pos(192,288)}There are stories about people taking out all of their savings

200
0:15:41.48 --> 0:15:45.83
{\pos(192,275)}买了一枚用于自杀遗书上的邮票
{\pos(192,288)}to buy a single postage stamp for a suicide letter.

201
0:15:45.84 --> 0:15:50.35
{\pos(192,275)}当凯恩斯警告凡尔赛合约将导致灾难性后果时
{\pos(192,288)}When Keynes warned that the Versailles Treaty would bring a catastrophe here,

202
0:15:50.36 --> 0:15:53.27
{\pos(192,275)}甚至他的推崇者都认为他过于夸张
{\pos(192,288)}even his admirers might have thought he was exaggerating.

203
0:15:53.28 --> 0:15:55.51
{\pos(192,275)}但很快他们就不这么认为了
{\pos(192,288)}But they didn¹t think that for long.

204
0:15:55.52 --> 0:15:59.44
{\pos(192,275)}胜利万岁! 胜利万岁!
{\pos(192,288)}Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

205
0:16:00.96 --> 0:16:05.00
{\pos(192,275)}就在凡尔赛合约签订的14年后  希特勒上台
{\pos(192,288)}Just 14 years after the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler came to power.

206
0:16:08.40 --> 0:16:10.72
{\pos(192,275)}二战转眼即至
{\pos(192,288)}World War II wasn't far away.

207
0:16:17.32 --> 0:16:23.32
{\pos(192,275)}正如凯恩斯所预测的  将经济利害关系弄错的代价是惨痛的
{\pos(192,288)}As Keynes had predicted, the price of getting economic relations wrong was calamity.

208
0:16:24.28 --> 0:16:28.63
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯预见过赔款过于沉重  应该进行调整
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes foresaw that the reparations were too onerous, would have to be adjusted

209
0:16:28.64 --> 0:16:33.15
{\pos(192,275)}那就相当于埋下导致下一次欧洲混乱的种子
{\pos(192,288)}and that actually you were laying the seeds of the next European conflagration.

210
0:16:33.16 --> 0:16:36.28
{\pos(192,275)}他认为那是极其短视的  他是对的
{\pos(192,288)}He thought it was unbelievably short-sighted. He was right.

211
0:16:40.92 --> 0:16:43.75
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯会怎么看今天的欧洲?
{\pos(192,288)}So what would Keynes make of Europe today?

212
0:16:43.76 --> 0:16:48.51
{\pos(192,275)}他将再次看到强国对弱国的经济政策指手画脚
{\pos(192,288)}Well, once again he might see strong countries dictating economic terms to the weak,

213
0:16:48.52 --> 0:16:51.75
{\pos(192,275)}尽管这一次是像德国这样的强国
{\pos(192,288)}though this time it's strong countries like Germany itself

214
0:16:51.76 --> 0:16:54.79
{\pos(192,275)}主张危机重重的国家  如希腊
{\pos(192,288)}insisting that crisis-ridden nations, like Greece,

215
0:16:54.80 --> 0:16:59.04
{\pos(192,275)}应签署严厉的削减预算条款以换取紧急援助
{\pos(192,288)}sign up to tough budget cuts in exchange for emergency loans.

216
0:17:01.04 --> 0:17:05.83
{\pos(192,275)}报纸已经展示了由于经济危机所带来的恶劣程度
{\pos(192,288)}The newspapers show the depth of ill will that¹s built up as a result of the crisis.

217
0:17:05.84 --> 0:17:10.99
{\pos(192,275)}德国人称希腊为毫无用处的乞丐
{\pos(192,288)}You¹ve got the Germans talking about the Greeks as no-good scroungers.

218
0:17:11.00 --> 0:17:16.95
{\pos(192,275)}而在希腊  再也不禁止将德国领导人比作纳粹了
{\pos(192,288)}But in Greece, well, there¹s no more taboo any more about comparing German leaders to Nazis.

219
0:17:16.96 --> 0:17:20.99
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯也许会说他们正重蹈那场错误战争的覆辙
{\pos(192,288)}But Keynes might say they were harking back to the wrong war.

220
0:17:21.00 --> 0:17:26.55
{\pos(192,275)}讽刺的是  加诸希腊的苛刻条件可能会让他想到
{\pos(192,288)}The tough conditions being imposed on Greece might remind HIM, ironically,

221
0:17:26.56 --> 0:17:29.47
{\pos(192,275)}凡尔赛合约加诸德国的条件
{\pos(192,288)}of the deal imposed on Germany at Versailles.

222
0:17:29.48 --> 0:17:31.83
{\pos(192,275)}当时欧洲的主流观点
{\pos(192,288)}The dominant thinking in Europe at the moment

223
0:17:31.84 --> 0:17:36.71
{\pos(192,275)}我相信如今对希腊又犯了同样的错误
{\pos(192,288)}is exactly repeating the mistakes I believe, certainly for Greece,

224
0:17:36.72 --> 0:17:39.27
{\pos(192,275)}如同一战结束时所犯的错误
{\pos(192,288)}as was made at the end of the First World War.

225
0:17:39.28 --> 0:17:43.55
{\pos(192,275)}结论是  如果你因别人无法做到而迁怒于他  会以悲剧收场
{\pos(192,288)}There comes a point, if you visit on countries things they can never deliver, it will end in tears.

226
0:17:43.56 --> 0:17:46.04
{\pos(192,275)}如果你观察当今欧洲正在发生什么
{\pos(192,288)}If you look at what's happening in the Eurozone today,

227
0:17:46.04 --> 0:17:48.51
{\pos(192,275)}希腊大街上的暴动者
{\pos(192,288)}you have riots on the streets of Greece,

228
0:17:48.52 --> 0:17:51.91
{\pos(192,275)}西班牙大罢工  葡萄牙大罢工
{\pos(192,288)}general strikes in Spain, general strikes in Portugal.

229
0:17:51.92 --> 0:17:56.84
{\pos(192,275)}你会发现  这不正是因为我们吸取历史教训么?
{\pos(192,288)}You can see, well, aren't we just failing to learn the lessons of history here?

230
0:18:02.08 --> 0:18:04.75
{\pos(192,275)}如果凯恩斯今天能和我一起在柏林
{\pos(192,288)}If Keynes could join me in Berlin today,

231
0:18:04.76 --> 0:18:08.55
{\pos(192,275)}他肯定能体会欧元区危机的复杂性
{\pos(192,288)}he¹d surely appreciate the complexity of the crisis in the Eurozone

232
0:18:08.56 --> 0:18:14.59
{\pos(192,275)}他能理解为什么普通德国民众觉得希腊应该付出代价
{\pos(192,288)}and he¹d understand why ordinary Germans feel it's time for Greece to pay its own way.

233
0:18:14.60 --> 0:18:20.24
{\pos(192,275)}但是他也能理解  过分强迫希腊财政紧缩可能会自毁长城
{\pos(192,288)}But he also understood that imposing too much austerity could be self defeating.

234
0:18:22.72 --> 0:18:27.95
{\pos(192,275)}我认为他会说 "让我们使希腊强大, 然后他们便能偿还欠债"
{\pos(192,288)}I think he would have said, "Let's make Greece strong, so then they can repay their debt."

235
0:18:27.96 --> 0:18:30.79
{\pos(192,275)}只要债务人偿付  债权人就开心了
{\pos(192,288)}As long as a debtor pays, the creditor is happy.

236
0:18:30.80 --> 0:18:33.95
{\pos(192,275)}可一旦债务人陷入困境
{\pos(192,288)}But as soon as a debtor gets into difficulties,

237
0:18:33.96 --> 0:18:38.47
{\pos(192,275)}而他又是一个重要的债务人的话  债权人也会麻烦缠身
{\pos(192,288)}and if he's a very important debtor, the creditor has also problems.

238
0:18:38.48 --> 0:18:40.60
{\pos(192,275)}因为他不能要回自己的钱
{\pos(192,288)}Because he won't get his money back.

239
0:18:42.56 --> 0:18:45.63
{\pos(192,275)}面对今天影响着欧洲人们的危机
{\pos(192,288)}Faced with the crisis affecting the people of Europe today,

240
0:18:45.64 --> 0:18:49.16
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯毫无疑问会给出一些解决办法
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes would undoubtedly have come up with some solutions.

241
0:18:52.00 --> 0:18:54.63
{\pos(192,275)}事实上  凡尔赛合约签订的数年后
{\pos(192,288)}In fact, years after the Treaty of Versailles,

242
0:18:54.64 --> 0:18:58.23
{\pos(192,275)}他公布了一个计划  是各国更好的合作
{\pos(192,288)}he'd unveil a plan for countries to work better together.

243
0:18:58.24 --> 0:19:01.15
{\pos(192,275)}但首先  在一个更基本的问题
{\pos(192,288)}But first, there was a more basic question,

244
0:19:01.16 --> 0:19:04.04
{\pos(192,275)}如何引导经济本身?
{\pos(192,288)}how to steer the economy itself?

245
0:19:07.92 --> 0:19:10.91
{\pos(192,275)}掌控经济  使其更好的为我们服务
{\pos(192,288)}To tame the economy, to make it work for us,

246
0:19:10.92 --> 0:19:14.95
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯意识到  首先要明白经济是如何运行的
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes realised you first had to understand how it worked.

247
0:19:14.96 --> 0:19:19.59
{\pos(192,275)}上世纪20年代  理解经济的工具—经济学还很年轻
{\pos(192,288)}And the tool for doing that - economics - was still young in the 1920s,

248
0:19:19.60 --> 0:19:22.15
{\pos(192,275)}但是却有着极大的野心
{\pos(192,288)}but it had grand ambitions.

249
0:19:22.16 --> 0:19:25.27
{\pos(192,275)}人们希望可以预测经济走势
{\pos(192,288)}People hoped you'd be able to predict the movement of economies,

250
0:19:25.28 --> 0:19:27.95
{\pos(192,275)}如同预测行星运动一样
{\pos(192,288)}like you could predict the movement of the planets.

251
0:19:27.96 --> 0:19:34.07
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯也被这个观点所吸引  但他最终意识到经济不是行星
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes was drawn to that idea as well but he came to the conclusion economies weren't like planets.

252
0:19:34.08 --> 0:19:36.39
{\pos(192,275)}经济更像人类
{\pos(192,288)}They were more like people.

253
0:19:36.40 --> 0:19:39.47
{\pos(192,275)}无法准确预知它们接下来会走向何方
{\pos(192,288)}You never really knew what they were going to do next.

254
0:19:39.48 --> 0:19:45.11
{\pos(192,275)}事实上他注意到  每当经济看上去可以准确预测的时候
{\pos(192,288)}In fact, he noticed, the times when economies looked most predictable,

255
0:19:45.12 --> 0:19:49.68
{\pos(192,275)}通常也是事情即将错得离谱的时候
{\pos(192,288)}were usually the times when things were about to go disastrously wrong.

256
0:19:54.96 --> 0:19:57.67
{\pos(192,275)}正如我们在2008年所感受的一样
{\pos(192,288)}It certainly felt like that in 2008,

257
0:19:57.68 --> 0:20:03.19
{\pos(192,275)}在经历了史上最长的繁荣后  金融系统突然崩盘
{\pos(192,288)}when the world financial system imploded after one of the longest booms in history.

258
0:20:03.20 --> 0:20:05.95
{\pos(192,275)}许多人现在声称这是可预见的
{\pos(192,288)}Many claim now to have seen it coming,

259
0:20:05.96 --> 0:20:11.67
{\pos(192,275)}但在当时  更多人相信好日子会一直持续下去
{\pos(192,288)}but at the time, many more behaved as if the good times would go on and on.

260
0:20:11.68 --> 0:20:15.27
{\pos(192,275)}不会有繁荣和衰退交替
{\pos(192,288)}No return to Tory boom and bust.

261
0:20:15.28 --> 0:20:18.27
{\pos(192,275)}对未来经济发展太过确信
{\pos(192,288)}Being too sure about the economic future

262
0:20:18.28 --> 0:20:22.15
{\pos(192,275)}是凯恩斯80年前警告过我们的又一个错误
{\pos(192,288)}was another mistake that Keynes had warned about 80 years ago.

263
0:20:22.16 --> 0:20:26.24
{\pos(192,275)}因为他也犯过同样的错误
{\pos(192,288)}Because he'd made the same mistake himself.

264
0:20:37.08 --> 0:20:40.07
{\pos(192,275)}一战结束后  他从财政部辞了职
{\pos(192,288)}After resigning from the Treasury after World War I,

265
0:20:40.08 --> 0:20:45.16
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯回到了剑桥大学的国王学院
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes retreated to the sanctuary of his old college, Kings in Cambridge.

266
0:20:50.00 --> 0:20:54.80
{\pos(192,275)}他是一个讲师  后来成为财务人员  主管学院的财务
{\pos(192,288)}He was a lecturer and later a bursar, looking after the college's finances.

267
0:21:02.48 --> 0:21:05.23
{\pos(192,275)}他对概率论非常感兴趣
{\pos(192,288)}He had a special interest in probability theory,

268
0:21:05.24 --> 0:21:10.28
{\pos(192,275)}它是数学的一个分支  试图根据过去以预测未来
{\pos(192,288)}a branch of mathematics that tries to predict the future from the evidence of the past.

269
0:21:15.68 --> 0:21:20.43
{\pos(192,275)}当没有学习和写作的时候  凯恩斯经常在资本市场赌博
{\pos(192,288)}When he wasn¹t writing or studying, Keynes was often betting on the financial markets.

270
0:21:20.44 --> 0:21:24.79
{\pos(192,275)}他需要钱  他认为投机是赚钱的好方法
{\pos(192,288)}He needed money and he thought speculation was a good way to get it.

271
0:21:24.80 --> 0:21:28.31
{\pos(192,275)}同时也是检验他的信条的一个好方法
{\pos(192,288)}But it was also a great way for him to test his belief

272
0:21:28.32 --> 0:21:31.19
{\pos(192,275)}即概率论和统计学
{\pos(192,288)}that probability theory and statistics

273
0:21:31.20 --> 0:21:34.39
{\pos(192,275)}能有助于对市场运行进行预测
{\pos(192,288)}could help you predict the way markets were going to move.

274
0:21:34.40 --> 0:21:36.76
{\pos(192,275)}他得到的成果好坏不一
{\pos(192,288)}He had very mixed results.

275
0:21:51.28 --> 0:21:55.19
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯很年轻时就是一个投资者  他每天早上坐在床上
{\pos(192,288)}In his early years as an investor, Keynes sat in bed every morning

276
0:21:55.20 --> 0:22:00.47
{\pos(192,275)}查看大量货币 股票 债券和商品的统计数据
{\pos(192,288)}poring over reams of statistics about currencies, shares, bonds and commodities.

277
0:22:00.48 --> 0:22:05.68
{\pos(192,275)}当他确信找到了市场运行的方式时  他就参与交易
{\pos(192,288)}When he was sure he'd worked out which way the market would move, he'd make the deals.

278
0:22:12.32 --> 0:22:17.72
{\pos(192,275)}剑桥学者大卫·钱伯斯花了大量的时间研究凯恩斯的投资策略
{\pos(192,288)}Cambridge academic David Chambers has spent a lot of time studying Keynes' investment strategies.

279
0:22:21.68 --> 0:22:27.63
{\pos(192,275)}他有经济学知识  他对数字和统计有巨大的兴趣
{\pos(192,288)}Given this economic knowledge that he had, this great thirst that he had for numbers and statistics,

280
0:22:27.64 --> 0:22:33.47
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  他相信自己能定义并描述经济周期
{\pos(192,288)}he believed I think that he could define, delineate, the business cycle.

281
0:22:33.48 --> 0:22:37.67
{\pos(192,275)}其结果便是他能够选择
{\pos(192,288)}And as a consequence of that he would be able to pick

282
0:22:37.68 --> 0:22:41.23
{\pos(192,275)}何时进入股票市场  买入股票
{\pos(192,288)}when was the right time to be in the stock market, to own shares,

283
0:22:41.24 --> 0:22:46.35
{\pos(192,275)}何时离开股票市场转向债券市场
{\pos(192,288)}and when was the right time to come out of the stock market into bonds,

284
0:22:46.36 --> 0:22:49.84
{\pos(192,275)}尤其是国债市场又或者套现
{\pos(192,288)}government bonds in particular, or, alternatively, cash.

285
0:22:52.16 --> 0:22:58.12
{\pos(192,275)}但凯恩斯的精细计算都没能指出那迫在眉睫的灾难
{\pos(192,288)}But none of Keynes's elaborate calculations pointed out the disaster just around the corner.

286
0:23:00.80 --> 0:23:06.39
{\pos(192,275)}1929年危机前夕  华尔街看上去还像是繁荣市场的牛尾
{\pos(192,288)}Wall Street before the crash in 1929 looked a lot like the tail end of our market boom.

287
0:23:06.40 --> 0:23:09.43
{\pos(192,275)}投资者认为好日子没有尽头
{\pos(192,288)}Investors could see no end to the good times.

288
0:23:09.44 --> 0:23:15.11
{\pos(192,275)}根据最新的数学模型  他们认为所有因素都已考虑在内
{\pos(192,288)}Armed with the very latest mathematical models, they thought they had everything covered.

289
0:23:15.12 --> 0:23:17.51
{\pos(192,275)}突然  牛市泡沫破裂
{\pos(192,288)}Then the bubble burst.

290
0:23:17.52 --> 0:23:22.27
{\pos(192,275)}世界市场崩盘  凯恩斯投资失败  和数百万的其他投资者一样
{\pos(192,288)}World markets collapsed and Keynes lost money, along with millions of others,

291
0:23:22.28 --> 0:23:24.67
{\pos(192,275)}成为大萧条的铺路石
{\pos(192,288)}paving the way for the Great Depression.

292
0:23:24.68 --> 0:23:27.67
{\pos(192,275)}他不再对预测未来有信心
{\pos(192,288)}His confidence in predicting the future was gone.

293
0:23:27.68 --> 0:23:32.87
{\pos(192,275)}他一定为没有预测到大萧条而深感自责
{\pos(192,288)}He would have bitterly reproached himself for not foreseeing the Great Depression.

294
0:23:32.88 --> 0:23:36.47
{\pos(192,275)}为什么他当时认为未来不是这样的
{\pos(192,288)}But he came to the view that the future is not like that,

295
0:23:36.48 --> 0:23:41.15
{\pos(192,275)}如果有人预测正确
{\pos(192,288)}that anybody who happens to predict it right

296
0:23:41.16 --> 0:23:45.68
{\pos(192,275)}那么更有可能是基于运气而不是基于判断
{\pos(192,288)}is likely to be doing so on the basis of luck rather than judgment.

297
0:23:49.56 --> 0:23:53.16
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯的投机时代并没有结束
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes¹ speculating days weren¹t quite over.

298
0:23:57.56 --> 0:24:02.79
{\pos(192,275)}数年后  他认为有可能要在国王学院的小礼堂存放数百吨小麦
{\pos(192,288)}Years later, he thought he might have to store hundreds of tons of wheat in King¹s College chapel,

299
0:24:02.80 --> 0:24:06.11
{\pos(192,275)}因为他的一宗商品交易投资失败
{\pos(192,288)}after a commodity trade went wrong.

300
0:24:06.12 --> 0:24:10.35
{\pos(192,275)}但是他改变了他的投资方法  他成为了一个富有的人
{\pos(192,288)}But he did change the way he invested, and became a wealthy man.

301
0:24:10.36 --> 0:24:15.32
{\pos(192,275)}他从经济运行方式中得到了教训  而我们今天仍在与其做斗争
{\pos(192,288)}He¹d learned lessons about the way economies work that we still struggle with today.

302
0:24:16.84 --> 0:24:22.84
{\pos(192,275)}人们无法摆脱经济的不确定性  因为经济是由人而不是数字构成
{\pos(192,288)}That you can never get rid of uncertainty and that economies are made up of people, not numbers.

303
0:24:24.28 --> 0:24:29.59
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯比其他任何人更希望经济学能成为一门现代科学
{\pos(192,288)}More than anyone, Keynes wanted economics to be respected as a modern science.

304
0:24:29.60 --> 0:24:33.59
{\pos(192,275)}但是他知道  经济学永远也不可能成为由一组确定的公式组成的科学
{\pos(192,288)}But he knew it was never going to be a science you could reduce to a set of equations,

305
0:24:33.60 --> 0:24:35.75
{\pos(192,275)}可以有准确预测的科学
{\pos(192,288)}iron predictions,

306
0:24:35.76 --> 0:24:41.64
{\pos(192,275)}因为经济学家总是要处理一些附加因素-人性
{\pos(192,288)}because economists were always going to have one extra thing to deal with, human nature.

307
0:24:42.64 --> 0:24:45.91
{\pos(192,275)}如果你不知道未来
{\pos(192,288)}If you don't know about the future and you're trying to get a fix

308
0:24:45.92 --> 0:24:48.95
{\pos(192,275)}你想弄清楚同一时间不同地点都在发生什么
{\pos(192,288)}on what's taking place anywhere in time,

309
0:24:48.96 --> 0:24:51.83
{\pos(192,275)}你知道你必须听从群众
{\pos(192,288)}you know, you would defer to the crowds.

310
0:24:51.84 --> 0:24:54.67
{\pos(192,275)}如果群众都走向特定方向 那么他们应该就是对的
{\pos(192,288)}If the crowd is moving in a certain direction, they must be right.

311
0:24:54.68 --> 0:24:57.31
{\pos(192,275)}群众买什么  我就应该买什么
{\pos(192,288)}"The crowd's buying. What are they buying? I must buy, too."

312
0:24:57.32 --> 0:24:59.51
{\pos(192,275)}群众卖什么  我就应该卖什么
{\pos(192,288)}"The crowd's selling, I must sell, too!"

313
0:24:59.52 --> 0:25:02.40
{\pos(192,275)}这非常直觉  非常符合群体效应
{\pos(192,288)}And it's very animal. It¹s very herd.

314
0:25:04.92 --> 0:25:09.47
{\pos(192,275)}从众心理帮助凯恩斯理解了
{\pos(192,288)}This idea of herd psychology helped Keynes make sense of the economic bubble

315
0:25:09.48 --> 0:25:13.32
{\pos(192,275)}经济泡沫如何在1929年前夕不断的被吹大
{\pos(192,288)}that blew up in the years before the great crash of 1929.

316
0:25:15.08 --> 0:25:20.64
{\pos(192,275)}它也能很好的解释2008年的金融危机
{\pos(192,288)}It can also do a pretty good job explaining our own great financial crash in 2008.

317
0:25:23.36 --> 0:25:27.99
{\pos(192,275)}正常情况  任何经济学教材都会说
{\pos(192,288)}In normal times, any economic textbook now or in Keynes¹ time

318
0:25:28.00 --> 0:25:32.15
{\pos(192,275)}价格上升  人们减少购买
{\pos(192,288)}would say if the price of something goes up, people buy less of it.

319
0:25:32.16 --> 0:25:34.59
{\pos(192,275)}价格下降  人们增加购买
{\pos(192,288)}If the price goes down, they buy more.

320
0:25:34.60 --> 0:25:39.71
{\pos(192,275)}这是市场运行的方式  但是凯恩斯认识到  当有泡沫时
{\pos(192,288)}That's how markets work. Except, Keynes realised, when you have bubbles.

321
0:25:39.72 --> 0:25:43.07
{\pos(192,275)}人性的另一面将占接管理性
{\pos(192,288)}Then a different side of human nature takes over.

322
0:25:43.08 --> 0:25:46.35
{\pos(192,275)}他会告诉我们 "房价在上升
{\pos(192,288)}It's the side that says,"Oh, house prices are going up.

323
0:25:46.36 --> 0:25:50.83
{\pos(192,275)}股票在上升  我应该买更多  因为价格会继续上涨"
{\pos(192,288)}"Shares are going up. I shall buy more because the price is going to go up again."

324
0:25:50.84 --> 0:25:54.75
{\pos(192,275)}当然  价格确实上升了  但是这成为了一个自我实现的螺旋
{\pos(192,288)}Which, of course, it does. It becomes a self-fulfilling spiral.

325
0:25:54.76 --> 0:25:57.12
{\pos(192,275)}价格越来越高
{\pos(192,288)}Prices go up and up and up and up.

326
0:25:58.24 --> 0:26:01.96
{\pos(192,275)}而最终  泡沫会破裂
{\pos(192,288)}Eventually, the bubble will burst. It always does.

327
0:26:03.72 --> 0:26:05.91
{\pos(192,275)}2008年前夕
{\pos(192,288)}In the years before 2008,

328
0:26:05.92 --> 0:26:10.07
{\pos(192,275)}我们是否忘记了凯恩斯告诉过我们的从众心理
{\pos(192,288)}did we forget what Keynes had taught us about herd psychology,

329
0:26:10.08 --> 0:26:13.24
{\pos(192,275)}泡沫  以及经济的不确定性?
{\pos(192,288)}bubbles and the uncertainty of economic life?

330
0:26:14.64 --> 0:26:18.31
{\pos(192,275)}银行家  投资者  政治家和我们
{\pos(192,288)}Did the bankers, investors, politicians and the rest of us

331
0:26:18.32 --> 0:26:23.03
{\pos(192,275)}是不是只是盲目自信的认为好时光将继续?
{\pos(192,288)}simply get too confident in thinking the good times would go on forever?

332
0:26:23.04 --> 0:26:28.67
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  因为人们开始真正静下来思考什么是风险
{\pos(192,288)}I think inasmuch as people actually sat down and thought about what were the risks,

333
0:26:28.68 --> 0:26:34.27
{\pos(192,275)}什么是不确定性  才发现大部分人显然是愚蠢的
{\pos(192,288)}what are the uncertainties, then clearly a large number of people were manifestly found wanting.

334
0:26:34.28 --> 0:26:36.87
{\pos(192,275)}当然  如果你不知道你在做什么
{\pos(192,288)}And, of course, if you don't know what you're doing,

335
0:26:36.88 --> 0:26:41.04
{\pos(192,275)}毫无疑问  你会惨淡收场  而这正是确实发生的
{\pos(192,288)}it's not surprising that you end up being smashed to bits and that's precisely what happened.

336
0:26:51.20 --> 0:26:54.71
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯的观点  国家不应该求助于其邻国
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes¹s big ideas, that countries shouldn¹t beggar their neighbours,

337
0:26:54.72 --> 0:26:59.95
{\pos(192,275)}市场不可预测  都是出自于他的自身经历
{\pos(192,288)}that markets were unpredictable, all came out of his own experience.

338
0:26:59.96 --> 0:27:04.27
{\pos(192,275)}大萧条还导致形成了了他最重要的观点
{\pos(192,288)}Now the Great Depression produced his most important idea yet,

339
0:27:04.28 --> 0:27:08.83
{\pos(192,275)}增加了他掌控经济的需求的紧迫性
{\pos(192,288)}and added real urgency to his need to tame the economy.

340
0:27:08.84 --> 0:27:12.51
{\pos(192,275)}他意识到  经济可能会衰退
{\pos(192,288)}What he realised was, economies might sink

341
0:27:12.52 --> 0:27:16.35
{\pos(192,275)}且不会自动回归正常
{\pos(192,288)}and then not automatically float back up.

342
0:27:16.36 --> 0:27:22.04
{\pos(192,275)}在今天的西方经济形势下  这听起来很熟悉
{\pos(192,288)}Looking around the western economies today, that does sound a bit familiar.

343
0:27:25.48 --> 0:27:29.03
{\pos(192,275)}30年代早期  外面的世界都非常悲观
{\pos(192,288)}In the early '30s, the outside world was deep in gloom,

344
0:27:29.04 --> 0:27:33.11
{\pos(192,275)}领取失业救济金的排队越来越长  到处都有工厂破产倒闭
{\pos(192,288)}with dole queues lengthening and factories closing everywhere,

345
0:27:33.12 --> 0:27:35.72
{\pos(192,275)}但是凯恩斯的生活是幸福的
{\pos(192,288)}but Keynes¹ life was blissful.

346
0:27:37.28 --> 0:27:42.27
{\pos(192,275)}这时他已经成名  他那些前卫的布鲁姆斯伯里帮的朋友甚至都被他震惊了
{\pos(192,288)}By now he was famous, and he'd shocked even his avant-garde Bloomsbury friends

347
0:27:42.28 --> 0:27:44.95
{\pos(192,275)}因为他和一个俄罗斯芭蕾舞演员结婚了
{\pos(192,288)}by marrying a Russian ballerina.

348
0:27:44.96 --> 0:27:47.96
{\pos(192,275)}而在此之前  他一直是同性恋
{\pos(192,288)}Up till then, he¹d been gay.

349
0:27:52.40 --> 0:27:58.03
{\pos(192,275)}艺术 写书 恋爱  这就是凯恩斯的全部生活
{\pos(192,288)}Art, books, love affairs, for Keynes this was what life was all about.

350
0:27:58.04 --> 0:28:03.91
{\pos(192,275)}但是他知道  可能比他的布鲁姆斯伯里帮朋友们更知道是继承的财产
{\pos(192,288)}But he understood, probably more keenly than his Bloomsbury friends with their inherited wealth,

351
0:28:03.92 --> 0:28:06.71
{\pos(192,275)}帮助他保持了正常的生活
{\pos(192,288)}that money kept the whole thing afloat.

352
0:28:06.72 --> 0:28:11.35
{\pos(192,275)}如果没有正常运行的经济  就不可能有文明的社会
{\pos(192,288)}You couldn¹t have a civilised society without a well-functioning economy.

353
0:28:11.36 --> 0:28:14.63
{\pos(192,275)}周一早上  当他回到现实生活的时候
{\pos(192,288)}When he was back in the real world on Monday morning,

354
0:28:14.64 --> 0:28:18.60
{\pos(192,275)}他发现英国经济完全失控了
{\pos(192,288)}he could see the British economy wasn¹t working at all.

355
0:28:21.12 --> 0:28:23.91
{\pos(192,275)}英国经济已经衰退了很长一段时间
{\pos(192,288)}Britain had been in a slump for years.

356
0:28:23.92 --> 0:28:28.03
{\pos(192,275)}传统经济学家认为  如果工人降低工资
{\pos(192,288)}Classical economists said that if workers would just agree to wage cuts,

357
0:28:28.04 --> 0:28:32.72
{\pos(192,275)}商人就会继续投资  创造工作机会  经济就会重新繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}businessmen would invest again, create jobs, and the economy would revive.

358
0:28:33.68 --> 0:28:39.31
{\pos(192,275)}但是凯恩斯不这么认为  他认为复苏受到了悲观情绪的制约
{\pos(192,288)}But Keynes disagreed. He thought the way to recovery was being blocked by pessimism,

359
0:28:39.32 --> 0:28:41.64
{\pos(192,275)}或者说是受意志消沉的制约
{\pos(192,288)}or low animal spirits.

360
0:28:42.88 --> 0:28:45.83
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯洞悉这一切的深层原因是
{\pos(192,288)}The big insight of Keynes behind all of this

361
0:28:45.84 --> 0:28:49.55
{\pos(192,275)}市场经济缺乏自我稳定机制
{\pos(192,288)}was that a market economy is not self-stabilising.

362
0:28:49.56 --> 0:28:52.67
{\pos(192,275)}当你情感上经历巨大变化
{\pos(192,288)}When you get very big changes in animal spirits, in sentiment,

363
0:28:52.68 --> 0:28:55.91
{\pos(192,275)}人们生产未来出售的产品
{\pos(192,288)}the people who are producing to sell in the future

364
0:28:55.92 --> 0:29:00.99
{\pos(192,275)}突然开始担心有可能未来没有需求了  他们就开始停止生产
{\pos(192,288)}suddenly worry that actually maybe there won't be the demand in the future, so they stop producing.

365
0:29:01.00 --> 0:29:04.84
{\pos(192,275)}想要跳出低产出的循环是很困难的
{\pos(192,288)}To get out of that low output trap can be very difficult.

366
0:29:08.68 --> 0:29:13.39
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯认为经济持续衰退
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes realisation that an economy could stay sunk indefinitely

367
0:29:13.40 --> 0:29:16.72
{\pos(192,275)}毫无疑问是对传统思维的巨大突破
{\pos(192,288)}was a radical break with conventional thinking.

368
0:29:19.44 --> 0:29:24.27
{\pos(192,275)}传统经济学认为  只要时间足够长  经济会好起来的
{\pos(192,288)}The classical approach said the economy would get better, we just had to give it time.

369
0:29:24.28 --> 0:29:28.75
{\pos(192,275)}但是在凯恩斯看来  明显没有任何好转
{\pos(192,288)}But looking around, it seemed obvious to Keynes that it wasn¹t getting any better

370
0:29:28.76 --> 0:29:31.75
{\pos(192,275)}而且为什么不好起来的原因也再明显不过了
{\pos(192,288)}and it seemed blindingly obvious why it wasn¹t.

371
0:29:31.76 --> 0:29:36.23
{\pos(192,275)}每次有人失业  加入失业救济领取队伍  他们获得的可支配收入越少
{\pos(192,288)}Every time someone lost their jobs and joined the dole queue, they had less money to spend,

372
0:29:36.24 --> 0:29:38.71
{\pos(192,275)}意味着他们买更少的商品
{\pos(192,288)}so that would mean fewer goods were bought.

373
0:29:38.72 --> 0:29:41.03
{\pos(192,275)}意味着可能更多的人会失业
{\pos(192,288)}It would probably mean more job losses.

374
0:29:41.04 --> 0:29:45.51
{\pos(192,275)}会进入一个螺旋形下降的趋势  看不到明显的出路
{\pos(192,288)}You could get caught in a downward spiral with no obvious way out.

375
0:29:45.52 --> 0:29:48.55
{\pos(192,275)}今天我们认为这是很显而易见的
{\pos(192,288)}Now it seems equally obvious to us today,

376
0:29:48.56 --> 0:29:52.00
{\pos(192,275)}但是当时  这些都是全新的
{\pos(192,288)}but back then it was all very new.

377
0:29:53.36 --> 0:29:59.08
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯认为  商业世界的悲观情绪会传染给每个人
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes thought the low animal spirits in the business world were now infecting everyone.

378
0:30:03.08 --> 0:30:08.80
{\pos(192,275)}1931年  他通过无线广播中号召大家行动
{\pos(192,288)}In a radio broadcast in 1931, he made a dramatic call for action.

379
0:30:11.40 --> 0:30:14.51
{\pos(192,275)}交易和就业的下降
{\pos(192,288)}The slump in trade and employment

380
0:30:14.52 --> 0:30:18.03
{\pos(192,275)}是有史以来最严重的
{\pos(192,288)}are as bad as the worst which have ever occurred.

381

{\pos(192,288)}was probably his most important contribution to economic thinking.

389
0:30:51.44 --> 0:30:57.07
{\pos(192,275)}但是  他不仅仅只是理解经济  他希望能使其更好的运行
{\pos(192,288)}But he didn¹t just want to understand economies, he wanted to make them work better.

{\pos(192,275)}其中最有争议性的应该是  政府可以花他们还没有的钱
{\pos(192,288)}but the most controversial was that governments should spend money they haven¹t got.

392
0:31:05.48 --> 0:31:08.47
{\pos(192,275)}在我看来  当今政治最大的争议在于

413
0:32:58.56 --> 0:33:01.95
{\pos(192,275)}常规情况下  人们想经营这个工厂

0:33:06.88 --> 0:33:09.31
{\pos(192,275)}但是现在不是常规时期

0:34:13.36 --> 0:34:17.55
{\pos(192,275)}降低利率  鼓励借款和消费

430
0:34:20.12 --> 0:34:24.11
{\pos(192,275)}但悲观情绪严重时  这些措施就不够充分了
{\pos(192,288)}But when animal spirits are really low that might not be enough.

{\pos(192,275)}公司看不到新增投资的意义
{\pos(192,288)}Companies might not see the point of making new investments,

{\pos(192,275)}如果政府借款创造了工作机会  人们将消费更多
{\pos(192,288)}If the government borrowed to create jobs, people would spend more,

437
0:34:52.44 --> 0:34:55.95
{\pos(192,275)}信心提升  经济复苏
{\pos(192,288)}confidence would rise, and the economy would recover.

{\pos(192,275)}以经济观点来看  需要的就是增加经济中的需求量
{\pos(192,288)}But in economic terms what you need is more demand in the economy

444
0:35:16.36 --> 0:35:18.48

{\pos(192,288)}Ever since, it¹s been the celebrated example

485
0:38:08.96 --> 0:38:12.28
{\pos(192,275)}刺激萎靡经济的政策的经典案例
{\pos(192,288)}of a Keynesian effort to boost flagging economies.

506
0:39:59.16 --> 0:40:02.35
{\pos(192,275)}由于人们出乎意料的在这里住了下来
{\pos(192,288)}But because people stayed, which they didn't anticipate,

507
0:40:02.36 --> 0:40:04.39
{\pos(192,275)}而且家人也和他们一起生活

{\pos(192,275)}政府支出是如何推动了私人消费和投资的
{\pos(192,288)}extra government spending CAN trigger private spending and investment, too,

511
0:40:15.52 --> 0:40:18.55
{\pos(192,275)}从而增加经济效益
{\pos(192,288)}adding to the economic benefits.

512
0:40:18.56 --> 0:40:21.04
{\pos(192,275)}这就是凯恩斯所称的乘数效应
{\pos(192,288)}It's what Keynes called "the multiplier".

{\pos(192,275)}第二年年末  他们住进了一个小镇  一个功能齐全的小镇
{\pos(192,288)}By the end of the second year, they lived in a town, a full town,

{\pos(192,275)}有零售商店和餐厅
{\pos(192,288)}fully operating town with retail stores and restaurants

515
0:40:31.68 --> 0:40:37.80
{\pos(192,275)}有医疗设施和娱乐设施  这一切在不到两年的时间内都发生了
{\pos(192,288)}and medical facilities and recreational facilities. It happened in less than two years.

{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯主义的批评者经常说  收益是短期的  而成本是长期的
{\pos(192,288)}Critics of Keynesian spending plans often say the benefits are fleeting and the costs permanent.

517
0:40:45.68 --> 0:40:48.20
{\pos(192,275)}但是博尔德城已经扎根并繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}But Boulder City took root and thrived.

518
0:40:51.32 --> 0:40:54.47
{\pos(192,275)}对于那些生活在此的人来说  如果没有罗斯福新政
{\pos(192,288)}Those who still live here say if it hadn¹t been for the New Deal,

519
0:40:54.48 --> 0:40:57.24
{\pos(192,275)}这里仍然是一片荒漠
{\pos(192,288)}this would still be desert.

520
0:41:02.80 --> 0:41:05.31
{\pos(192,275)}胡佛大坝也许帮助了当地经济
{\pos(192,288)}Hoover Dam might have helped the local area,

521
0:41:05.32 --> 0:41:10.48
{\pos(192,275)}但罗斯福新政终结了大萧条实际上则是一则神话
{\pos(192,288)}but it¹s actually a myth that the New Deal ended the Great Depression.

522
0:41:12.60 --> 0:41:18.39
{\pos(192,275)}一场世界大战耗费了政府所有的额外支出
{\pos(192,288)}It took a world war and all the extra government spending that went with that, finally,

523
0:41:18.40 --> 0:41:21.12
{\pos(192,275)}最终也将经济带出低迷
{\pos(192,288)}to bring the economy out of the doldrums.

524
0:41:25.04 --> 0:41:29.87
{\pos(192,275)}你也许怀疑  世界大战是否真的是检验凯恩斯论据的最好方法
{\pos(192,288)}You might wonder whether a world war was really the best test of Keynes¹ arguments.

525
0:41:29.88 --> 0:41:32.87
{\pos(192,275)}但是从那以后  所谓的凯恩斯主义政治
{\pos(192,288)}But ever since then, so-called "Keynesian policies"

526
0:41:32.88 --> 0:41:36.59
{\pos(192,275)}就指政府面临危机的时候该做什么
{\pos(192,288)}have been what governments do when faced with emergencies.

527
0:41:36.60 --> 0:41:42.12
{\pos(192,275)}2008年金融危机是最近很长一段时间里面最大的危机
{\pos(192,288)}And the crisis of 2008 was the biggest emergency anyone had seen for a long time.

528
0:41:43.44 --> 0:41:45.40
{\pos(192,275)}当全球金融系统崩溃
{\pos(192,288)}When the global financial system crashed,

529
0:41:45.40 --> 0:41:49.60
{\pos(192,275)}世界面临又一场大萧条的可能
{\pos(192,288)}the world faced the real possibility of another Great Depression.

530
0:41:50.76 --> 0:41:53.52
{\pos(192,275)}多年来  政府一直指望自由市场
{\pos(192,288)}Governments had been preaching the free market for years.

531
0:41:54.64 --> 0:42:00.03
{\pos(192,275)}但当面临经济灾难时  他们转投过气的凯恩斯主义
{\pos(192,288)}But faced with this economic disaster they reached again for the old Keynesian levers.

532
0:42:00.04 --> 0:42:02.07
{\pos(192,275)}这是一个经典的凯恩斯主义的回答
{\pos(192,288)}It was a classic Keynesian response.

533
0:42:02.08 --> 0:42:06.19
{\pos(192,275)}当个人和企业都停止支出时
{\pos(192,288)}When individuals and businesses stop spending money,

534
0:42:06.20 --> 0:42:09.19
{\pos(192,275)}如果政府也同时停止支出
{\pos(192,288)}if the government also stops spending money at the same time,

535
0:42:09.20 --> 0:42:11.88
{\pos(192,275)}会发生什么?  基本上经济会崩溃
{\pos(192,288)}then what happens? The economy, basically, crashes.

536
0:42:13.48 --> 0:42:16.75
{\pos(192,275)}目标旨在提振信心或提升乐观情绪
{\pos(192,288)}The aim was to boost confidence, or animal spirits,

537
0:42:16.76 --> 0:42:20.51
{\pos(192,275)}为使得人们更易于借款  投资和消费
{\pos(192,288)}by making it easier to borrow, invest and spend.

538
0:42:20.52 --> 0:42:25.16
{\pos(192,275)}利率降至有记录以来的最低值  0.5%
{\pos(192,288)}Interest rates were slashed to just half of one percent, the lowest on record.

539
0:42:26.16 --> 0:42:28.51
{\pos(192,275)}我们现在都在一个未知的领域
{\pos(192,288)}We¹re all now in uncharted territory.

540
0:42:28.52 --> 0:42:31.03
{\pos(192,275)}当利率下降至最低值时
{\pos(192,288)}Then, when interest rates couldn¹t go much lower,

541
0:42:31.04 --> 0:42:35.67
{\pos(192,275)}英格兰银行为经济直接注入了数百亿英镑
{\pos(192,288)}the Bank of England started pumping billions of pounds directly into the economy.

542
0:42:35.68 --> 0:42:40.11
{\pos(192,275)}接下来几个月  账面上有750亿英镑
{\pos(192,288)}It¹s literally creating £75 billion in the next few months

543
0:42:40.12 --> 0:42:43.59
{\pos(192,275)}还会流向市场
{\pos(192,288)}to get money moving around the economy again.

544
0:42:43.60 --> 0:42:46.91
{\pos(192,275)}甚至增值税也被暂停征收了
{\pos(192,288)}Even VAT was temporarily cut.

545
0:42:46.92 --> 0:42:52.91
{\pos(192,275)}通过鼓励投资  商品和服务的价格将下降  进而刺激经济增长
{\pos(192,288)}It'll make goods and services cheaper and by encouraging spending it will help stimulate growth.

546
0:42:52.92 --> 0:42:56.27
{\pos(192,275)}2009年  尽管全球经济仍在挣扎
{\pos(192,288)}In 2009, with the global economy still tottering,

547
0:42:56.28 --> 0:43:01.55
{\pos(192,275)}各国首脑聚集伦敦  为全球经济体签署一项凯恩斯主义的援助计划
{\pos(192,288)}leaders gathered in London to endorse a Keynesian rescue plan for the entire world.

548
0:43:01.56 --> 0:43:04.79
{\pos(192,275)}这是各国共同协作的时代
{\pos(192,288)}This is the day that the world came together

549
0:43:04.80 --> 0:43:07.99
{\pos(192,275)}共同击退全球经济危机
{\pos(192,288)}to fight back against the global recession.

550
0:43:08.00 --> 0:43:12.19
{\pos(192,275)}我认为解释全球贸易萎缩很困难
{\pos(192,288)}I find it very hard to explain the collapse in world trade,

551
0:43:12.20 --> 0:43:17.31
{\pos(192,275)}从08年末至09年春天  全球贸易下降15%
{\pos(192,288)}of over 15% between the end of '08 and the beginning of spring '09,

552
0:43:17.32 --> 0:43:22.87
{\pos(192,275)}除了用野兽精神  或者信心  很难找到其他合适的词汇了
{\pos(192,288)}in terms of anything other than an extraordinary collapse of "animal spirits", or confidence.

553
0:43:22.88 --> 0:43:26.96
{\pos(192,275)}2009年有些情况出现转机  但远不是全部
{\pos(192,288)}Now some of that was turned around in 2009, but by no means all.

554
0:43:31.52 --> 0:43:36.23
{\pos(192,275)}就连2009年的大援助计划和其表象也相去甚远
{\pos(192,288)}Even that great rescue plan of 2009 wasn¹t quite what it seemed.

555
0:43:36.24 --> 0:43:41.91
{\pos(192,275)}首相布朗的所有谈话中说明  英国自身的刺激政策实际上非常小
{\pos(192,288)}For all Gordon Brown¹s talk, Britain's own stimulus plan was actually one of the smallest,

556
0:43:41.92 --> 0:43:46.31
{\pos(192,275)}因为我们的政府已经比其他发达国家有更高的负债
{\pos(192,288)}because our government was already borrowing more than any other advanced economy.

557
0:43:46.32 --> 0:43:51.99
{\pos(192,275)}因此  尽管是一个像布朗一样的凯恩斯主义首相 也不会认为我们能借更多的钱
{\pos(192,288)}So even a Keynesian Prime Minister like Gordon Brown didn¹t think we could borrow a lot more.

558
0:43:52.00 --> 0:43:55.32
{\pos(192,275)}他的继任者认为我们应该借更少
{\pos(192,288)}His successor thinks we should borrow much less.

559
0:43:56.32 --> 0:44:02.79
{\pos(192,275)}我们现任首相在基本的观点上都不认同凯恩斯主义
{\pos(192,288)}We now have a Prime Minister who, on one fundamental point, appears to disagree with Keynes.

560
0:44:02.80 --> 0:44:07.23
{\pos(192,275)}政府在处理常规衰退时的一些措施
{\pos(192,288)}Some of the normal things that governments can do to deal with a normal recession,

561
0:44:07.24 --> 0:44:11.47
{\pos(192,275)}例如借款  减税  增加政府支出
{\pos(192,288)}like borrowing to cut taxes or increasing spending.

562
0:44:11.48 --> 0:44:14.15
{\pos(192,275)}这些都不再有效  因为他们使得负债增长
{\pos(192,288)}These things won't work because they lead to more debt,

563
0:44:14.16 --> 0:44:16.87
{\pos(192,275)}从而可能导致危机加剧
{\pos(192,288)}which would make the crisis worse.

564
0:44:16.88 --> 0:44:21.27
{\pos(192,275)}解决债务危机的唯一办法是偿还债务
{\pos(192,288)}The only way out of a debt crisis is to deal with your debts.

565
0:44:21.28 --> 0:44:26.27
{\pos(192,275)}我怀疑  凯恩斯可能不会用当今首相同样的措施
{\pos(192,288)}I suspect that Keynes probably wouldn't have used exactly the Prime Minister's formulation.

566
0:44:26.28 --> 0:44:28.44
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  在某些程度上
{\pos(192,288)}I think that Keynes would have accepted at some point

567
0:44:28.44 --> 0:44:32.79
{\pos(192,275)}我们要掉头转向更平衡的预算
{\pos(192,288)}that you have to head back towards a more balanced budget,

568
0:44:32.80 --> 0:44:36.07
{\pos(192,275)}特别是  不想把债务都留给后代的时候
{\pos(192,288)}particularly if you don't want to stack debts on future generations.

569
0:44:36.08 --> 0:44:40.83
{\pos(192,275)}我觉得应该注意的是  像英国这样的国家
{\pos(192,288)}To me the remarkable thing is that countries like the UK,

570
0:44:40.84 --> 0:44:42.87
{\pos(192,275)}有选择
{\pos(192,288)}that have a choice,

571
0:44:42.88 --> 0:44:46.75
{\pos(192,275)}自愿实施财政紧缩政策
{\pos(192,288)}are voluntarily putting themselves through austerity

572
0:44:46.76 --> 0:44:51.27
{\pos(192,275)}而且  我们几乎确定的知道会发生什么
{\pos(192,288)}and, almost certainly, we will know, we know what will happen.

573
0:44:51.28 --> 0:44:54.35
{\pos(192,275)}经济会越来越弱
{\pos(192,288)}The economy will get weaker.

574

582
0:45:29.44 --> 0:45:34.35
{\pos(192,275)}意味着凯恩斯主义的常规方法已经失效

{\pos(192,288)}that we just have not seen before and maybe it's fine,

585
0:45:40.48 --> 0:45:45.15
{\pos(192,275)}但是没有其他国家有过如此高的负债水平

{\pos(192,288)}without very much thought for what was going around them.

{\pos(192,288)}that we couldn't do this again.

612

0:47:46.56 --> 0:47:50.99
{\pos(192,275)}我们不能回到战前的经济危机
{\pos(192,288)}That we had to... We couldn't go back to the kind of economic crisis

614
0:47:51.00 --> 0:47:54.08
{\pos(192,275)}因为我们无法再次承受战争
{\pos(192,288)}we'd had before because we couldn't afford another world war.

615
0:47:58.28 --> 0:48:02.35
{\pos(192,275)}世界各地的代表齐聚华盛顿山度假酒店

616
0:48:02.36 --> 0:48:05.11
{\pos(192,275)}其他地方仍在激烈交战
{\pos(192,288)}elsewhere there was still ferocious fighting.

617
0:48:05.12 --> 0:48:10.11
{\pos(192,275)}但是一旦战争结束  凯恩斯知道  为了世界经济繁荣
{\pos(192,288)}But once the war was over, Keynes knew, for the world economy to prosper,

618
0:48:10.12 --> 0:48:14.59
{\pos(192,275)}各国需要比以前更紧密的合作
{\pos(192,288)}countries would need to work together much more closely.

619
0:48:14.60 --> 0:48:18.63
{\pos(192,275)}只有两个代表团在会议上有绝对影响力
{\pos(192,288)}Only two delegations at the conference really counted

620
0:48:18.64 --> 0:48:21.88
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯的英国代表团和美国代表团
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes¹ British team and the Americans.

{\pos(192,275)}防止汇率剧烈波动
{\pos(192,288)}to prevent currencies fluctuating too wildly against each other.

623
0:48:29.32 --> 0:48:35.11
{\pos(192,275)}他们同意应该有一个机构  后来成为世界银行和国际货币基金组织
{\pos(192,288)}They agreed that institutions, that later became the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,

624
0:48:35.12 --> 0:48:39.28
{\pos(192,275)}扶植第三世界国家的贸易和发展
{\pos(192,288)}should be there to foster trade and growth in poorer economies.

625
0:48:40.64 --> 0:48:43.11
{\pos(192,275)}这其中最大的收获是我们的认知
{\pos(192,288)}Well, the big gain from it was the recognition

626
0:48:43.12 --> 0:48:47.39
{\pos(192,275)}国家之间应该相互协作解决他们的宏观经济问题
{\pos(192,288)}that countries need to work together to resolve their macro-economic problems.

627
0:48:47.40 --> 0:48:50.91
{\pos(192,275)}按独立解决问题的方式处理是不够的
{\pos(192,288)}It's just not enough to pretend that you can do it as an island.

628
0:48:50.92 --> 0:48:54.48
{\pos(192,275)}地理上你也许是孤岛  但是经济上不是
{\pos(192,288)}You may be an island geographically but you're not economically.

629
0:48:57.40 --> 0:49:00.00
{\pos(192,275)}但是在关键问题上  凯恩斯失败了
{\pos(192,288)}But on one crucial issue, Keynes failed.

630
0:49:00.96 --> 0:49:04.47
{\pos(192,275)}美国人坚持  像他们这样的出口大国
{\pos(192,288)}The Americans were adamant that rich exporting countries, like them,

631
0:49:04.48 --> 0:49:09.27
{\pos(192,275)}不应该扩大内需  减少出口来平衡世界贸易
{\pos(192,288)}shouldn¹t have to spend more and export less to balance world trade.

632
0:49:09.28 --> 0:49:12.52
{\pos(192,275)}大额贸易赤字的弱国必须加快发展
{\pos(192,288)}It was weak countries with big trade deficits that had to shape up.

633
0:49:14.52 --> 0:49:17.95
{\pos(192,275)}如果布雷顿森林的每个人都接受凯恩斯的逻辑
{\pos(192,288)}If everyone at Bretton Woods had accepted Keynes' logic,

634
0:49:17.96 --> 0:49:20.99
{\pos(192,275)}所有参与方合作才能保持全球经济平衡
{\pos(192,288)}that it takes ALL sides to keep the global economy in balance,

635
0:49:21.00 --> 0:49:24.60
{\pos(192,275)}今天的世界也许会更好
{\pos(192,288)}the world today might be in a lot better shape.

636
0:49:29.60 --> 0:49:33.96
{\pos(192,275)}这个古老的东德电视塔是德国统一的标志
{\pos(192,288)}This old East German television tower is a symbol of reunified Germany.

0:49:35.28 --> 0:49:39.60
{\pos(192,275)}这些天  对欧盟的感情越来越淡
{\pos(192,288)}But these days feelings of European unity are in short supply.

638
0:49:42.56 --> 0:49:47.55
{\pos(192,275)}各国部长在柏林  为在欧元区国家强制实施紧缩政策作斗争
{\pos(192,288)}Ministers here in Berlin want struggling Eurozone countries to impose tough measures

639
0:49:47.56 --> 0:49:50.27
{\pos(192,275)}使其经济恢复正常
{\pos(192,288)}to get their economies into shape.

640
0:49:50.28 --> 0:49:52.87
{\pos(192,275)}大国乐于提供帮助
{\pos(192,288)}The stronger countries have been willing to help

641
0:49:52.88 --> 0:49:58.04
{\pos(192,275)}如提供大额贷款  我不认为凯恩斯会觉得这样就行了
{\pos(192,288)}by offering massive loans, but I don¹t think Keynes would have thought that was enough.

642
0:50:00.92 --> 0:50:05.71
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯认为  全球经济的运行  必须是双向的
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes thought, for the global economy to work, it had to be a two-way street.

643
0:50:05.72 --> 0:50:09.43
{\pos(192,275)}所以  那些已经向其他国家大力举债的小国
{\pos(192,288)}So the weak countries, that had run up a lot of debt with the rest of the world,

644
0:50:09.44 --> 0:50:12.99
{\pos(192,275)}他们也必须更具有竞争力  学习偿还贷款
{\pos(192,288)}they did have to become more competitive, learn to pay their way.

645
0:50:13.00 --> 0:50:17.39
{\pos(192,275)}但是出口大国  他们也必须有所作为
{\pos(192,288)}But the rich exporters... Well, they had to do their bit as well...

646
0:50:17.40 --> 0:50:21.27
{\pos(192,275)}增加进口  减少出口
{\pos(192,288)}spending more on other countries' goods and exporting less,

647
0:50:21.28 --> 0:50:23.71
{\pos(192,275)}稍微不那么有竞争力
{\pos(192,288)}becoming a bit less competitive.

648
0:50:23.72 --> 0:50:28.79
{\pos(192,275)}现在  凯恩斯的这部分建议在德国并没有有效实施
{\pos(192,288)}Now that¹s a bit of Keynesian advice that doesn¹t go down well here in Germany at all.

649
0:50:28.80 --> 0:50:32.11
{\pos(192,275)}如果你说  德国应该减少出口  降低竞争力
{\pos(192,288)}If you say Germany should export less or become less competitive,

650
0:50:32.12 --> 0:50:34.79
{\pos(192,275)}民众意见将是"你疯了"
{\pos(192,288)}the popular view is, "That's mad!"

651
0:50:34.80 --> 0:50:38.35
{\pos(192,275)}为什么其他人已经很弱的情况下  我们还要变弱？
{\pos(192,288)}Why getting us weak when others are already weak?

652
0:50:38.36 --> 0:50:40.56
{\pos(192,275)}毫无疑问  这是一个错误的结论。
{\pos(192,288)}And, certainly, that's the wrong conclusion.

653
0:50:44.28 --> 0:50:47.44
{\pos(192,275)}已经有征兆表明  德国正在向这个方向努力
{\pos(192,288)}There are signs of movement on Germany¹s side of the street.

654
0:50:52.64 --> 0:50:55.56
{\pos(192,275)}国内汽车销售上升
{\pos(192,288)}Domestic car sales have been going up.

655
0:50:57.68 --> 0:51:02.08
{\pos(192,275)}但是出口仍然是德国经济政策的核心支柱
{\pos(192,288)}But exports are still a central plank of the country¹s economic policies.

656
0:51:04.20 --> 0:51:09.12
{\pos(192,275)}汽车出口在过去两年上升1/3
{\pos(192,288)}And car exports are up by almost a third in the past two years.

657
0:51:10.88 --> 0:51:13.83
{\pos(192,275)}德国消费者最近已经开增加消费
{\pos(192,288)}German consumers have been spending more lately.

658
0:51:13.84 --> 0:51:18.68
{\pos(192,275)}但是仍不足以为困境中的国家如希腊提供足够的机会
{\pos(192,288)}But not enough to provide much of a selling opportunity for struggling countries like Greece.

659
0:51:21.88 --> 0:51:26.51
{\pos(192,275)}一个很流行的方法是告诉德国普通家庭"请多消费
{\pos(192,288)}That's a very popular approach, to tell German private households, "Please, spend more.

660
0:51:26.52 --> 0:51:28.95
{\pos(192,275)}不要对钱这么吝啬"
{\pos(192,288)}"Don't be so greedy with your money."

661
0:51:28.96 --> 0:51:31.31
{\pos(192,275)}但是我认为这是错的
{\pos(192,288)}Er, but I think that's, that's wrong.

662
0:51:31.32 --> 0:51:35.47
{\pos(192,275)}因为人们看着他的收入  然后说"我无法承受"  这是事实
{\pos(192,288)}Because people look at their income and say, "I can't afford it, simply." And that's true.

663
0:51:35.48 --> 0:51:39.79
{\pos(192,275)}我的意思是  过去几年工资上升幅度很小
{\pos(192,288)}I mean we have had very weak wage increases during the past years.

664
0:51:39.80 --> 0:51:43.15
{\pos(192,275)}这才是问题的关键  你必须有更高的工资
{\pos(192,288)}And that's the point where you have to have higher wages.

665
0:51:43.16 --> 0:51:45.52
{\pos(192,275)}才能支出这些工资
{\pos(192,288)}And these higher wages you could certainly spend.

666
0:51:45.52 --> 0:51:50.68
{\pos(192,275)}当德国的消费比过去增大时  才能对我们有所帮助
{\pos(192,288)}And then German consumption would be much stronger than it was in the past and that will help us.

667
0:51:55.68 --> 0:51:59.19
{\pos(192,275)}高通胀的记忆仍然在刺痛德国人
{\pos(192,288)}Memories of hyperinflation are still raw in Germany.

668
0:51:59.20 --> 0:52:05.12
{\pos(192,275)}很少人愿意为了他们羸弱的欧洲邻居  放弃他们辛苦赢得的经济稳定
{\pos(192,288)}Few want to put their hard-won economic stability at risk for their weaker European neighbours.

669
0:52:06.08 --> 0:52:09.48
{\pos(192,275)}在国际范围内  国家之间的差距更加明显
{\pos(192,288)}The divisions between countries at a global level are even clearer.

{\pos(192,275)}对于凯恩斯期待的真正的全球经济合作  强国和弱国为了共同利益进行合作
{\pos(192,288)}Leaders pay lip service to Keynes¹ dream of a truly co-ordinated global economy,

671
0:52:15.84 --> 0:52:19.07
{\pos(192,275)}各国领袖都还在做表面文章
{\pos(192,288)}where the strong work with the weak for the benefit of all.

672
0:52:19.08 --> 0:52:22.35
{\pos(192,275)}但是有一些小的证据表明他们开始做一些实事
{\pos(192,288)}But there¹s little sign of them actually doing it.

673
0:52:22.36 --> 0:52:24.83
{\pos(192,275)}我认为凯恩斯看到我们的世界
{\pos(192,288)}I think that Keynes would look at our world

674
0:52:24.84 --> 0:52:27.83
{\pos(192,275)}欧元区问题  银行危机
{\pos(192,288)}the troubles in the Eurozone, the banking crisis

675
0:52:27.84 --> 0:52:30.67
{\pos(192,275)}会说  这是一个非常令人害怕的地方
{\pos(192,288)}and say it was a pretty scary place,

676
0:52:30.68 --> 0:52:35.19
{\pos(192,275)}没有布雷顿森林体系里他主张的检查和平衡
{\pos(192,288)}without many of the checks and balances that he argued for at Bretton Woods.

677
0:52:35.20 --> 0:52:37.79
{\pos(192,275)}但是他也会说  他确实说了
{\pos(192,288)}But he'd also say - he DID say...

678
0:52:37.80 --> 0:52:41.71
{\pos(192,275)}真正的全球经济是令人振奋的
{\pos(192,288)}that a really global economy was tremendously exciting,

679
0:52:41.72 --> 0:52:45.19
{\pos(192,275)}有巨大的潜能帮助我们提高生活水平
{\pos(192,288)}with huge potential to improve all of our lives.

680
0:52:45.20 --> 0:52:48.63
{\pos(192,275)}如果政府能够找到实施方法
{\pos(192,288)}If governments could only work out how to put into practise

681
0:52:48.64 --> 0:52:51.83
{\pos(192,275)}将他一直坚持的基本理念付诸实施
{\pos(192,288)}that basic insight that he kept coming back to.

682
0:52:51.84 --> 0:52:54.59
{\pos(192,275)}我们就真的团结在一起了
{\pos(192,288)}We really are all in it together.

683
0:52:54.60 --> 0:52:58.15
{\pos(192,275)}更好的国际机构当然是好事
{\pos(192,288)}Sure, it would be great to have better multinational institutions

684
0:52:58.16 --> 0:53:00.27
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯是这方面的先驱
{\pos(192,288)}and Keynes was a pioneer in that.

685
0:53:00.28 --> 0:53:05.55
{\pos(192,275)}他信奉  为了维护国际金融秩序  这类机构是非常有用的
{\pos(192,288)}He was a big believer. In order to fix the international financial system that would be very helpful.

686
0:53:05.56 --> 0:53:11.07
{\pos(192,275)}如果有人具备了凯恩的的吸引力和影响力
{\pos(192,288)}And maybe somebody with the sort of magnetism and gravitas

687
0:53:11.08 --> 0:53:14.07
{\pos(192,275)}他能够在某种程度上促进事件的发展
{\pos(192,288)}and stature of Keynes could somehow catalyse that.

688
0:53:14.08 --> 0:53:16.84
{\pos(192,275)}但是凯恩斯却是非常罕见的人物
{\pos(192,288)}But he is a rare person indeed.

689
0:53:19.20 --> 0:53:21.75
{\pos(192,275)}他留下了一笔非凡的遗产
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes left an extraordinary legacy.

690
0:53:21.76 --> 0:53:24.59
{\pos(192,275)}他不仅改变了经济学
{\pos(192,288)}He didn¹t just transform economics,

691
0:53:24.60 --> 0:53:28.00
{\pos(192,275)}也改变了全球无数人的生活
{\pos(192,288)}he changed the lives of billions of people around the globe.

692
0:53:29.28 --> 0:53:31.71
{\pos(192,275)}其中包括很多1880年代出生的人
{\pos(192,288)}There aren¹t many people born in the 1880s

693
0:53:31.72 --> 0:53:35.79
{\pos(192,275)}你经常会在当前的辩论中听到他们的名字
{\pos(192,288)}whose name you hear as often as Keynes in current debates.

694
0:53:35.80 --> 0:53:39.79
{\pos(192,275)}他关于国家不应向邻国乞讨的观点
{\pos(192,288)}His ideas that countries shouldn¹t beggar their neighbours,

695
0:53:39.80 --> 0:53:42.23
{\pos(192,275)}关于经济是不可预测、可能陷入困境的观点
{\pos(192,288)}that economies were deeply unpredictable,

696
0:53:42.24 --> 0:53:46.79
{\pos(192,275)}都改变了我们思考世界的方式
{\pos(192,288)}could get stuck in slumps, have changed the way we think about the world.

697
0:53:46.80 --> 0:53:50.16
{\pos(192,275)}但是凯恩斯目前能为我们做什么?
{\pos(192,288)}But what can Keynes actually do for us right now?

698
0:53:52.52 --> 0:53:56.03
{\pos(192,275)}回到坎布里亚郡  很显然  凯恩斯帮助了他们
{\pos(192,288)}Back in Cumbria, it¹s clear what Keynes has done for them.

699
0:53:56.04 --> 0:54:00.31
{\pos(192,275)}政府干预帮助他们保持了倍耐力工厂的运营
{\pos(192,288)}Government intervention will help keep Pirelli¹s tyre factory open,

700
0:54:00.32 --> 0:54:02.99
{\pos(192,275)}提供了大量的就业机会
{\pos(192,288)}and provide a lot of employment.

701
0:54:03.00 --> 0:54:08.19
{\pos(192,275)}在主流政治圈中并没有很多人质疑凯恩斯下述基本原理
{\pos(192,288)}In the political mainstream, there aren¹t many who challenge Keynes¹ basic message

702
0:54:08.20 --> 0:54:11.56
{\pos(192,275)}不能放任经济自由发展
{\pos(192,288)}that you can¹t leave economies to drive themselves.

703
0:54:13.20 --> 0:54:17.35
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯是20世纪一个非常有影响力的人物
{\pos(192,288)}Keynes was a very dominant force in the 20th century

704
0:54:17.36 --> 0:54:20.91
{\pos(192,275)}我猜他在21世纪还会保持这种影响力
{\pos(192,288)}and my guess is he will remain a dominant force in the 21st century,

705
0:54:20.92 --> 0:54:25.32
{\pos(192,275)}因此我认为他将成为有史以来最伟大的经济学家之一
{\pos(192,288)}which is why I think he will go down as one of the greatest economists the world has produced.

706
0:54:26.56 --> 0:54:30.47
{\pos(192,275)}80年前  建造这个大坝  缓和了大萧条
{\pos(192,288)}80 years ago, building this dam eased the Great Depression.

707
0:54:30.48 --> 0:54:33.15
{\pos(192,275)}当今政府举债的成本比以往都要低
{\pos(192,288)}With the government borrowing more cheaply than ever before,

708
0:54:33.16 --> 0:54:37.91
{\pos(192,275)}你也许会认为  罗斯福新政类似的投资在今天也可以起到显著作用
{\pos(192,288)}you might think the case for New Deal-type investments was equally strong today.

709
0:54:37.92 --> 0:54:42.87
{\pos(192,275)}但是考虑到已有的国家债务  没有人可以肯定继续举债
{\pos(192,288)}But given the sheer volume of public debt, no-one can promise that piling on more borrowing

710
0:54:42.88 --> 0:54:45.31
{\pos(192,275)}将成为神奇的疗方
{\pos(192,288)}will be a miracle cure.

711
0:54:45.32 --> 0:54:49.03
{\pos(192,275)}典型的凯恩斯主义方案被认为是
{\pos(192,288)}What is thought of as a typical Keynesian solution

712
0:54:49.04 --> 0:54:53.71
{\pos(192,275)}举债  举债...消费  消费...还有减税
{\pos(192,288)}to get more debt, borrow money, spend, spend, spend and cut taxes.

713
0:54:53.72 --> 0:54:56.35
{\pos(192,275)}今天使用这些需要更审慎
{\pos(192,288)}That needs to be used more judiciously here,

714
0:54:56.36 --> 0:55:00.11
{\pos(192,275)}因为  最终仍需要偿还债务
{\pos(192,288)}because, at the end of the day, you¹ve got to get rid of this debt.

715
0:55:00.12 --> 0:55:02.99
{\pos(192,275)}这是一个持久的过程
{\pos(192,288)}This is a very long haul.

716
0:55:03.00 --> 0:55:07.15
{\pos(192,275)}我认为  没有人可以避开这个过程来提升经济
{\pos(192,288)}I don't think anything just boosts your way and zooms your way out of this.

717
0:55:07.16 --> 0:55:09.36
{\pos(192,275)}没有神奇的解决方案
{\pos(192,288)}There just is no magic bullet.

718
0:55:11.80 --> 0:55:16.11
{\pos(192,275)}那么凯恩斯最后的重要观点  各国应该紧密合作对当今世界有何影响?
{\pos(192,288)}And what of Keynes¹ final big idea, that countries are all in it together?

719
0:55:16.12 --> 0:55:21.51
{\pos(192,275)}自从布雷顿森林体系建立  各国逐渐接受我们必须合作才能繁荣的观点
{\pos(192,288)}Since Bretton Woods, the world has grudgingly accepted that we have to co-operate to prosper.

720
0:55:21.52 --> 0:55:24.72
{\pos(192,275)}但是我们仍在摸索如何将其付诸行动
{\pos(192,288)}But we¹re struggling to make it work in practise.

721
0:55:25.68 --> 0:55:28.00
{\pos(192,275)}他会很担心  非常担心
{\pos(192,288)}He'd be worried. He'd be very worried.

722
0:55:29.08 --> 0:55:33.11
{\pos(192,275)}他将对世界各国发展不平衡非常关注
{\pos(192,288)}He'd have been very concerned about the growth of inequality worldwide.

723
0:55:33.12 --> 0:55:37.99
{\pos(192,275)}他将对是否有国家开始向邻国乞讨非常关注
{\pos(192,288)}Er, he'd be very concerned that there was a return to beggar my neighbour policies.

724
0:55:38.00 --> 0:55:43.43
{\pos(192,275)}我毫不怀疑  他会警告我们会有地方性战争
{\pos(192,288)}I have no doubt that he would be warning of regional war

725
0:55:43.44 --> 0:55:45.79
{\pos(192,275)}及其带来的全部危害
{\pos(192,288)}and all its dangers.

726
0:55:45.80 --> 0:55:48.71
{\pos(192,275)}他将很害怕
{\pos(192,288)}He'd be very frightened

727
0:55:48.72 --> 0:55:52.79
{\pos(192,275)}导致一战和二战的经济环境
{\pos(192,288)}that the circumstances that led to war in 14/18 and 39/45

728
0:55:52.80 --> 0:55:57.40
{\pos(192,275)}正在逐步出现在我们面前
{\pos(192,288)}were, on a slow-burn basis, unfolding in front of us again.

729
0:55:58.84 --> 0:56:01.63
{\pos(192,275)}也许凯恩斯现在能为我们做的
{\pos(192,288)}Maybe the biggest thing Keynes could do for us now

730
0:56:01.64 --> 0:56:07.15
{\pos(192,275)}就是让我们注意那些引导他一生的品质
{\pos(192,288)}would be to remind us of the traits that guided him all of his life...

731
0:56:07.16 --> 0:56:09.83
{\pos(192,275)}想象力和乐观主义
{\pos(192,288)}imagination and optimism.

732
0:56:09.84 --> 0:56:14.67
{\pos(192,275)}他如果能来到现代  一定会很乐于研究这些复杂的问题
{\pos(192,288)}He came along and was willing to examine these profound problems

733
0:56:14.68 --> 0:56:17.19
{\pos(192,275)}以一种前所未有的方式
{\pos(192,288)}in ways that no-one had done before.

734
0:56:17.20 --> 0:56:21.43
{\pos(192,275)}他最大的遗产是对人性坚定的信念
{\pos(192,288)}His great legacy is that fundamental belief in humanity,

735
0:56:21.44 --> 0:56:24.59
{\pos(192,275)}对政府和社会能力坚定的信念
{\pos(192,288)}that fundamental belief in the ability of government and society

736
0:56:24.60 --> 0:56:30.80
{\pos(192,275)}政府能全心全意为那些贫困和需要帮助的人服务
{\pos(192,288)}to dedicate itself to helping those that are less fortunate and need our help.

737
0:56:40.60 --> 0:56:46.20
{\pos(192,275)}1946年  凯恩斯在其深爱的苏克塞斯当斯遭受了致命的心脏疾病
{\pos(192,288)}In 1946, Keynes suffered a fatal heart attack in his beloved Sussex Downs.

738
0:56:49.24 --> 0:56:53.12
{\pos(192,275)}享年62岁  他留下了改变世界的遗产
{\pos(192,288)}Just 62, he left a legacy that changed the world.

739
0:56:54.24 --> 0:56:56.63
{\pos(192,275)}但是他也留下了一个谜
{\pos(192,288)}But he also left an enigma.

740
0:56:56.64 --> 0:57:01.39
{\pos(192,275)}他认为他能掌控经济让其为我们服务
{\pos(192,288)}He thought we should try to tame the power of money to make it work for us,

741
0:57:01.40 --> 0:57:05.16
{\pos(192,275)}但是他也告诉我  经济本质上是不可预测的
{\pos(192,288)}but he also taught us that economies were fundamentally unpredictable.

742
0:57:07.72 --> 0:57:11.20
{\pos(192,275)}这是一对我们今天仍在处理的矛盾
{\pos(192,288)}It¹s a contradiction we¹re still grappling with today.

743
0:57:15.60 --> 0:57:20.63
{\pos(192,275)}为政府积极作为铺平道路  凯恩斯做得比其他任何人更多
{\pos(192,288)}More than anyone, Keynes paved the way for activist government.

744
0:57:20.64 --> 0:57:24.95
{\pos(192,275)}他说  你能够也应该让世界经济更好运行
{\pos(192,288)}He said you could and should make the world economy work better.

745
0:57:24.96 --> 0:57:29.59
{\pos(192,275)}二战后重建全球经济体系的那代人
{\pos(192,288)}The generation that rebuilt the global economy after the war

746
0:57:29.60 --> 0:57:32.19
{\pos(192,275)}都可以看成是凯恩斯的孩子
{\pos(192,288)}really were children of Keynes.

747
0:57:32.20 --> 0:57:36.63
{\pos(192,275)}但今天再读他  他的另一个观点的重要性不言而喻
{\pos(192,288)}But when you read him today, there's another equally powerful message that comes through,

748
0:57:36.64 --> 0:57:41.07
{\pos(192,275)}经济生活的不确定性和不可预测性
{\pos(192,288)}about the great unpredictability, uncertainty, of economic life.

749
0:57:41.08 --> 0:57:45.31
{\pos(192,275)}永远不要认为你已经度过了这个阶段  繁荣和衰退的对立已经结束
{\pos(192,288)}You should never think you¹ve got it covered, that you¹ve abolished boom and bust.

750
0:57:45.32 --> 0:57:47.63
{\pos(192,275)}他们仍然是巨大的谜团
{\pos(192,288)}That¹s the great paradox.

751
0:57:47.64 --> 0:57:50.47
{\pos(192,275)}凯恩斯一方面让经济学家们自信
{\pos(192,288)}The man who did most to make economists arrogant

752
0:57:50.48 --> 0:57:54.19
{\pos(192,275)}他们可以按照自己的意愿改造世界
{\pos(192,288)}in their capacity to bend the world to their will,

753
0:57:54.20 --> 0:57:59.28
{\pos(192,275)}另一方面也给出了自我怀疑的最好理由
{\pos(192,288)}also gave them or should have given them the best reasons for self-doubt.

754
0:58:04.68 --> 0:58:09.67
{\pos(192,275)}下一时段的货币权力  凯恩斯最大的对手-哈耶克
{\pos(192,288)}Next time on the Power Of Money, Keynes' great adversary, Friedrich Hayek,

755
0:58:09.68 --> 0:58:12.39
{\pos(192,275)}他从完全相反的角度看待同样的问题
{\pos(192,288)}who looked at the same facts and drew exactly the opposite view...

756
0:58:12.40 --> 0:58:16.04
{\pos(192,275)}市场必须自由  政府应该减少干预
{\pos(192,288)}the market needed to be set free and government should back off.

757
0:58:17.84 --> 0:58:20.75
{\pos(192,275)}公开大学已经制作了6集1分钟短片
