DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST

00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,610
编剧 导演 罗伯特・布列松
Screenplay, Adaptation and Direction by
ROBERT BRESSON

5
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,760
我不认为这样忠实地记录下每天发生的事
I don't think I'm doing anything wrong
in writing down daily,

6
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,920
有任何过错
with absolute frankness,

7
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,470
这些生活中微不足道的秘密
the simplest
and most insignificant secrets

8
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,640
往往会失去它们起源的途径
of a life actually lacking
any trace of mystery.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,290
昂布里库尔（法国加来省的一个小镇）
Ambricourt

10
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,950
这是我的教区 我的第一个教区
My parish. My first parish.

11
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,990
难道我必须要为了工作
Must I believe that it's only for duty's sake

12
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,300
隐瞒自己虚弱的健康状况吗
that I refuse to acknowledge my poor health?

13
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,500
自行车对我来说无疑是有用的
My bicycle is very useful,

14
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,070
但倘若我腹内空空 骑上坡路时就会头晕目眩
but I can 't ride uphill on an empty stomach without feeling faint.

15
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,560
我不再吃肉或是蔬菜
I deliberately cut out
meat and vegetables,

16
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,230
实在饿得昏头 才拿些面包蘸着酒果腹
eating only small quantities of wine-soaked bread whenever I feel dizzy.

17
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,930
我在酒里放许多糖
I add a lot of sugar to the wine.

18
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,370
面包也一直放到变硬为止
I let my bread harden
for several days.

19
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,370
多亏了这个习惯 我的脑子经常清醒
Thanks to this diet,
my head is clear,

20
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,880
身体也感觉强壮了些
and I feel much stronger.

21
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,950
法布雷加斯先生今天早上来到了圣器收藏室
Old Fabregars came to the sacristy this morning.

22
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,260
暂且不论我祷告所需要的报酬
Aside from the fee for my ti me,

23
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,340
天知道是什么
God knows, Mr. Fabregars,

24
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,200
我想您是希望能使用免费的布料
I 'd like you to have use
of the draperies for free.

25
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,200
我想是吧
I should think so.

26
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,040
不过是一堆碎布和补丁拼凑起来的东西
A lot of old moth-eaten rags held together by patches.

27
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
这些能花多少钱？
What could they have cost?

28
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,790
蜡烛得花不少钱
Candles are very expensive.

29
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,380
你自己就有
You do have a soft time of it.

30
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,120
没道理剥削我们穷人
There's no excuse
for exploiting the poor.

31
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,120
你可真是爱财如命啊 神父
You like your money easy, Father.

32
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,390
我们对所有人都是公平的
We charge everyone the same.

33
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,460
在我看来事情很简单
As I see it, it's simple:

34
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,470
我只求一件事
I ask one thing. It's only just.

35
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,900
让我可怜的妻子体面地下葬
Let my poor old wife be buried decently.

36
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,010
按普通流程来就行
The usual service.

37
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,730
所以我绝不会多付一个子 你明白了吗？
And for that I'll not pay
a penny more, you hear?

38
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,250
去拜访托西神父的时候 我依旧心绪不宁
I was still distraught when I went to see the priest ofTorcy.

39
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,860
上帝 我真希望像他一样身体健康 心情愉快啊
God, I wish I had his health and mental balance!

40
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,100
你应该把那家伙赶出去
You should have shown him the door.

41
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,530
把他赶出去 就是这样
Yes, shown him the door.

42
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,970
说起来 我认识这个法布雷加斯
Besides, I know Fabregars.

43
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,750
这老头很有钱
The old guy has plenty.

44
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,140
你们这些年轻的教士啊
You young priests!

45
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,780
你们这些年轻人现在还有什么风范吗
What have you young men got in your veins these days?

46
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,950
我那时代 人们培养的是教会人才
In my time they made men ofthe church,

47
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,220
教区的领袖 真正的首领
leaders of parishes, real masters!

48
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,830
现在教会派给了我们一些唱诗班小毛孩
Seminaries these days send us choirboys,

49
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,420
小叫花子 总是自以为做得有多认真
young ragamuffins who think they're working harder than anyone

50
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,940
其实他们什么事都没做成
because they never manage to finish anything.

51
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,930
碰到第一个难题
At the first sign of difficulty,

52
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,300
他们就哭哭咧咧说教区和他们想的不一样 乱扔东西发泄一通
they say the priesthood isn't what
they expected and drop everything.

53
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,430
我什么也不会摔的 我保证
I will not drop everything, I assure you.

54
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,580
在消除罪恶之外
Besides exterminating the devil,

55
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,050
你另外一个使命就是要做到受人爱戴
your other dream is to be loved for whoyou are.

56
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,520
但一个真正的教士是永远不会讨人喜欢的
A true priest is never loved.

57
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,450
教会才不会管你是不是受人爱戴呢 我的孩子
The church doesn't care a whit
whetheryou're loved, my son.

58
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,250
要受人尊敬 让人们听话
Be respected, obeyed.

59
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,320
守规矩 天天循规蹈矩
Keep order all day long,

60
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,590
但第二天 混乱无序还是会出现
knowing full well disorder will win out tomorrow,

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,090
因为在这个可悲的世界上 一个晚上就会把白天所有的工作付诸流水
because in this sorry world,
the night undoes the work of the day.

62
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,410
"天天循规蹈矩"
"Keep orderall daylong. "

63
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,340
当我在削土豆的时候
The priest of Torcy's words came back to me

64
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,720
托西教父的话回荡在我耳边
as I peeled potatoes for my soup.

65
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,210
我的助手从我身后过来了
The right-hand man came up from behind.

66
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,860
好消息啊 神父
Good news, Father.

67
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,090
是我能用上电灯了吗？
I'm getting electric light?

68
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,730
镇政委批准了你的请求
The council agreed to your request.

69
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,100
他们会负担费用 为您通上电的
It will install electricity for you at its own expense.

70
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,300
只是还需要走一些程序
There remain just the usual formalities.

71
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,500
会等很久吗？ 两到三个月 最多四个月就好了
- Will it take long? - Two or three months. Four at the most.

72
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,010
我很想和他谈谈他的卡巴莱歌舞
I'd have loved to tell him a thing or two about his cabaret.

73
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,610
他每周日都举办一次舞会
He puts on a dance every Sunday

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,980
称之为"家庭舞会"
and calls it "The Families'Ball, "

75
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,390
男孩子们在舞会上把女孩子灌醉
where boys have fun getting young girls drunk.

76
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,250
日安 神父
Good day, Father.

77
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,190
我没敢说
I didn't dare.

78
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,660
最单纯的事情无疑做起来应该最容易
The simplest tasks are by no means the easiest.

79
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,100
一个糟糕的夜晚
An awful night.

80
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,470
当我闭上眼睛 悲伤汹涌而来
As soon as I closed my eyes, sadness overwhelmed me.

81
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,710
这个早上 我做了所有我能做的 以表达我的同情和善意
I'd have done anything this morning
for a word of compassion or kindness.

82
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,440
我本非常期待教授教理课程
I was expecting a lot from catechism class,

83
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,010
孩子们正在准备圣餐礼
the children preparing for holy communion.

84
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,080
年轻的女孩子们使我感到希望 尤其是塞拉菲塔・杜孟谢尔
The girls had given me hope,
especially Seraphita Dumouchel.

85
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,620
圣餐礼是
Communion is

86
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,850
是 是传递
to re - to receive -

87
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,600
你来回答
How about you?

88
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,530
是用来传递
It's to receive -

89
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,960
通过圣礼上的圣餐传递耶稣的仁爱
Receive Jesus in the sacrament of the Eucharist.

90
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,600
那么耶稣是怎么创造圣餐的呢
And how did he establish the Eucharist?

91
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,540
为了创造圣餐
To establish the Eucharist,

92
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,190
耶稣掰开面包分给他的门徒们 说道
Jesus broke bread and gave it to his disciples, saying,

93
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,990
"拿来吃吧 这是我的身体"
"Take and eat. This is My body."

94
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,460
他拿起酒杯说道 "拿来喝吧 这是我的血"
He took wine and said, "Take and drink. This is My blood.

95
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,230
"你们应当如此行 为的是纪念我"
Do this in remembrance of Me."

96
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,960
今天的课就到这里 塞拉菲塔 过来拿你的成绩
That will do for today's class.
Seraphita, come forward for a good mark.

97
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,970
其他人可以走了
The others may go.

98
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,130
你急着希望见到耶稣吗？
Are you anxious to make your communion?

99
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,130
为什么不？
Why not?

100
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,900
反正它迟早会来的
It'll come soon enough.

101
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,200
你听得懂我上的课 也听得很认真
Yet you understand me, and you listen so well.

102
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,370
因为您的眼睛漂亮极了
It's because you have such beautiful eyes.

103
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,990
她们合伙捉弄了我
They had plotted it together.

104
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,580
为什么她们对我如此敌意？我对她们做错了什么吗？
But why such hostility? What had I done to them?

105
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,160
露易丝小姐天天来参加弥撒
Miss Louise attends holy mass every day.

106
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,730
如果她不来 教堂就一个人都没有了
Without her, the church would be empty.

107
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,640
她在庄园里担任家庭教师 那儿距我们这里有不少距离
Her position as governess at the manor
dictates a certain distance between us.

108
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,440
今天早上的时候 我发现她把脸埋入掌中
This morning she buried her face in her hands,

109
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,710
在祈祷的时候 我看到她脸上似乎是哭过了的神情
but at the blessing, I could see she'd been crying.

110
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,160
您一定非常孤独
You must feel very lonely.

111
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,060
夫人对我很好
Her ladyship is very kind,

112
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,900
但夏塔尔小姐并不喜欢我 对我呼来唤去的
but Miss Chantal enjoys humiliating me
and treats me like a servant.

113
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,870
她是你唯一的学生吗？
Is she your only pupil?

114
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,700
伯爵夫人有过一个儿子 但他死了 她很喜欢他
The countess had a son, but he died.
She adored him.

115
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,470
庄园里没人再提过他了
No one at the manor ever mentions him.

116
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,280
下个周四我会去转告伯爵的
I'll call on the count next Thursday.

117
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,680
拜访庄园的事让我忧心忡忡
This visit to the manor
has me quite worried.

118
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,550
如果能给伯爵留下好的第一印象
A good first impression could spell success for my plans

119
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,490
关于青年俱乐部和运动项目的计划 想必就能顺利一些了
for a youth club and sports program.

120
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,690
伯爵的影响力和财力能帮助我完成计划
The count's influence and wealth
could help me to achieve them.

121
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,190
(您需要的那块土地)平脊 粮仓也空空如也
The land is barren and the barn empty.

122
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,860
正是如此
That's true.

123
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,560
我不是要拒绝您 神父 但至少请给我点时间考虑
I'm not saying no, Father,
but give me time to think it over.

124
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,050
据说他对农民们很苛刻 他领土上也没有教民
He's said to be hard on his farmers,
and he's no model parishioner.

125
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,310
为什么他一下子变得如此吝啬？
Why has he so quickly become
the so desperately rare

126
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,360
他会是朋友 同盟 还是合作伙伴？
friend, ally and companion?

127
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,810
佩格雷奥特夫人会为您做好的 我已经告诉她了
Mrs. Pegriot will prepare it for you.
I've let her know.

128
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,080
我没有敢告诉他我的胃只能消化干面包
I didn't dare tell him my stomach only tolerates dry bread.

129
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,760
尽管这只兔子能抵上我付给管家半天的工资
I won't taste his rabbit stew,

130
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,800
我也无福消受
for which I'll have to pay the housekeeper a half day's wages.

131
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,130
我会托一个唱诗班孩子把它送给法拉特太太 她一定会高兴的
I could have a choirboy take it to old Mrs. Ferrant. She'd be delighted.

132
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,600
神父先生 我决定接受你的请求
Father, I approve of all your ideas.

133
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,370
噢 我的请求
Oh, my ideas.

134
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,950
但我提醒你 最好不要付诸实践
But I warn you against
putting them into practice.

135
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,310
我不明白
I don't follow.

136
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,280
这里的人们风气可不太好
The people here are malicious.

137
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,080
相信我 我知道的
Believe me, I know.

138
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,350
如果说要我给点建议的话
If I may offer a bit of advice,

139
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,690
我想 别动作太快
well, don't be in too much of a hurry.

140
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,620
别一下子就露出你的手段来
Don't show your hand at once.

141
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,690
没什么事是马上要办的 让他们先表现出来
Let them take the first step. There is no urgency.

142
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,600
只是那些都是我发自内心想做的
It's just that these things are dear to my heart.

143
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,270
在我的领土上
As for my land and my barn,

144
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,870
我不会阻止你的
I wouldn't discourage you.

145
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,400
等我们达到某些实质的认同的时候
We'll discuss them later

146
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,670
我们再来好好谈谈吧
when we get down to working out
something practical together.

147
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,080
你看去来气色不太好
You're not looking at all well.

148
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,820
你得多注意身体
You should take care of your health.

149
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,120
我的胃动不动就会发作
My stomach is very temperamental.

150
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,510
我有些迟疑 是否应该提到您的女儿
I hesitate, sir, to mention your daughter.

151
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,070
我的女儿？怎么了吗？
My daughter? What is the matter?

152
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,200
我想她十分不快活
I'm concerned about her sadness.

153
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,970
脸上始终闷闷不乐
Her face is far from cheerful.

154
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,750
她表情看起来沉重而僵硬
There is something hard and rigid in her expression

155
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,610
看起来不符合她的年龄
far beyond her years.

156
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,620
夏塔尔不高兴？你一定是在开玩笑
Chantal sad? You must be joking.

157
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
会不会是有人触怒了她呢？
Could someone be rubbing her the wrong way?

158
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,660
或许她希望从露易丝小姐那儿得到更多理解
Would a little more understanding from Miss Louise -

159
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,330
你胡说
You're mad.

160
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,340
我提到了露易丝小姐显然使得伯爵非常不悦
The mention of Miss Louise's name seemed to upset him terribly.

161
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,990


162
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,860
为什么？
Why?

163
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,760
在得出结论后 我抓住时机
I seized the first opportunity to return to the manor...

164
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,370
快速返回了庄园
a decision I had arrived at quickly.

165
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,630
仆人很快就来应门
The servant was several moments in coming.

166
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,990
我很清楚我会遇到伯爵
I was sure I'd meet the count,

167
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,180
他通常星期三下午在家
who was usually at the manor
Thursday afternoons.

168
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,330
然而我却见到了伯爵夫人
But I met the countess instead.

169
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,990
我的出现一定使她十分惊奇
I must have surprised her.

170
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,830
我打扰到您了吗？
Am I disturbing you?

171
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,030
一点也没有
Not at all.

172
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,100
我知道她非常孤僻
I knew she was withdrawn

173
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,330
一直将自己封闭在对死去的孩子的回忆里
and entirely absorbed
in the memory of her dead child.

174
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,820
她走了过来 对着一张椅子示意我坐下
She approached, motioning to a chair.

175
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,790
看到您我就想 您来一定是有原因的
On seeing you, I felt you had come
with some purpose in mind.

176
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,190
不然还会是什么呢
None other than to pay a call.

177
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,090
这么说的话 您并不打算说出原因了
And that you also meant
to keep it to yourself.

178
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,670
我向您保证不是这样
I assure you.

179
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,700
那么是我理解错了
I see I was wrong.

180
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,860
您的教民们可让您非常头疼啊 神父
Your parishioners worry you
a good deal, Father.

181
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,500
然而这只是个小小的教区而已啊
Yet it's such a small parish.

182
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,210
仅仅在地图上显得小而已 夫人
Small on the map, madam.

183
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,810
你对被委以重任的事想必还很陌生吧
It's a strange task
you've been entrusted with.

184
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,810
是的 夫人
Yes, madam.

185
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,680
我们所知的生活只是多小的一部分啊
How little we know what a human life really is.

186
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,780
尽管来的时候我还感觉很正常
Though I'd arrived feeling fine,

187
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,860
突然我发觉我没法跟上伯爵夫人的谈话了
I found myself suddenly incapable
of holding a conversation

188
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,990
甚至无法回答她的问题
or even answering questions.

189
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,560
来的时候我确实走得很快
It's true that I'd walked very quickly.

190
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,200
遇到病怏怏的法拉特太太的时候 交谈花了我不少的时间
I'd lost a lot of time with the ill Mrs. Ferrant.

191
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,500
神父先生！上帝 这是怎么了？
Father! Heavens, what's the matter?

192
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,240
您看起来非常痛苦
You seem to be suffering terribly.

193
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,270
痛在哪里？
Where is the pain?

194
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,750
这里  我的胃
Here, in the pit of my stomach.

195
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,410
不过没事 一点没事
But it's nothing. Nothing at all.

196
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,980
原谅我 夫人 我必须得离开了
Forgive me, madam, I must take my leave.

197
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,350
我病得十分严重
I'm seriously ill.

198
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,580
六个月前 我第一次遭受了病痛的袭击
I was first truck by this disease six months ago.

199
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,720
我去见了德尔本德医生
I went to see Dr.Delbende.

200
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,130
他是个老头 据说非常冷酷 现在已经退休了
He's an old man, rumored to be brutal, who's now retired.

201
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,390
托西神父让我来找他看病
The priest ofTorcy informed him I would be coming.

202
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,770
他用厚实而并不干净的手摸了摸的我胃部
He palpated my stomach at length
with thick and unclean hands.

203
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,640
他刚刚打猎回来
He'd just returned from hunting.

204
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,340
感觉不舒服的话就过来 记得给我打电话
When things get you down, come and pay me a call.

205
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,610
我不会告诉别人的 托西神父和我说起过你
I wouldn't say that to everyone,
but the priest in Torcy has spoken of you.

206
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,740
我喜欢你的眼睛
And I like your eyes.

207
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,650
忠实的眼睛
Faithful eyes.

208
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,190
一只狗的眼睛
Dog's eyes.

209
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,820
你 托西还有我都是一类人 古怪的一类人
You and Torcy and I are of the same race, an odd race.

210
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,830
和这些健壮的人是同一类人
The idea that I belonged
to the same race as these hefty men

211
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,990
这种事我从来没想到过
would never have occurred to me.

212
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,700
哪类人？ 靠得住的人
- What race?
- The race that holds on.

213
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,770
为什么靠得住？没人确切知道
And why does it hold on? No one quite knows.

214
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,080
还在读书的时候 我买过一辆摩托车
As a school boy I came up with a motto for myself:

215
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,910
"勇敢地面对它"
"Face up to it."

216
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,280
面对什么？我问你
Face up to what? I ask you.

217
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,980
不正义？
Injustice?

218
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,460
我可不是要到四处喋喋不休讲些关乎正义的事
I'm not one to go around babbling about justice.

219
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,750
我从没奢求过正义会实现在我身上
I don't expect it for myself.

220
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,000
我得问谁寻求正义？我不信上帝
From whom should I ask it? I don't believe in God.

221
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,490
我没什么经验
I'm not very experienced,

222
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,970
但我依旧能辨认出他语气里那种被深刻伤害过的声调
but I always recognize the tone
that gives away a deeply wounded soul.

223
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,830
不要太逞强了
You're not up to much.

224
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,210
看看吧
Just look at that.

225
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,070
谁都能看出来你食不果腹
Anyone can see you've not
always had enough to eat.

226
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,980
现在已经太晚了
Well, it's too late now.

227
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,130
还有酒精 那是什么情况？
And the alcohol - what about that?

228
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,280
酒精？
Alcohol?

229
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,000
当然不是说你酗酒
Not what you've drunk, of course.

230
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,500
是说远在你出生之前 就被喝下的酒
What was drunk for you,
long before you came into the world.

231
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,790
塞拉菲塔让我很忧虑
Seraphita worries me a lot.

232
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,880
有时候我想 她是不是很讨厌我
I wonder sometimes if she hates me.

233
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,320
她以超常的成熟折磨着我
She torments me with such exceptional maturity.

234
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,240
早上好 塞拉菲塔
Morning, Seraphita.

235
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,940
那天下午我归还了她的书包 然而她的家人待我非常粗鲁
I returned her book bag that afternoon.
I was received very roughly.

236
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,840
是的 我责备自己 祈祷得如此少而微弱
Yes, I scold myself for praying so little and so poorly.

237
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,910
然而我有时间祈祷吗
But do I have time to pray?

238
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,980
在去热思夫雷的路上 我遇到了托西教父
I met the priest from Torcy
on the road to Gesvres.

239
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,420
他让我搭车回到了教区住所
He gave me a ride back to the rectory.

240
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,360
除非主教急缺神父
The bishop must be hard up for priests

241
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,650
才会把一个教区托付给你
to put a parish in your hands.

242
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,300
我可以给你建议 但那又有什么用？
I could burden you with advice, but what's the point?

243
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,800
我做老师的时候就知道一些了不起的学生解开了最难的难题
I've known pupils who'd solve the toughest problems,

244
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,940
就像你这样 几乎是在泄愤
just like that, out of spite.

245
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,440
我哪里做错了呢？
Where have I gone wrong?

246
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,230
你太大惊小怪了
You're too fussy.

247
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
就像只被关在瓶子里的大黄蜂
Just like a hornet in a bottle.

248
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,380
但我认为你有一个祈祷者的灵魂
But I think you have the spirit of prayer.

249
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,950
修道士可比我们粗鲁多了
Monks are more shrewd than us.

250
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,080
另外 你几乎没有日常的常识
Besides, you have no common sense.

251
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,380
你的伟大计划只是空壳
Your great schemes don't hold water.

252
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,520
人们都知道 通常是说得越少越好
As for knowledge of men, the less said the better.

253
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,420
真诚地面对你的新教区吧
Face-to-face with your new parish,

254
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,160
不要装模作样的
you cut an odd figure.

255
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,140
所以呢？
And so?

256
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,640
所以？没什么 继续干呗
So? Well, carry on.

257
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,830
我还能说什么？
What else can I say?

258
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,290
又是一个糟糕的夜晚
A bad night.

259
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,290
凌晨三点 我提着灯笼来到了教堂
At 3:00 a.m., I took my lantern and went to the church.

260
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,540
我从没这么努力地祈祷过
I never endeavored to pray so much.

261
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,140
起先非常安静 平缓
At first quietly, calmly,

262
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,310
接着 一种近乎绝望的祈愿使我的心颤抖了起来
then with an almost desperate will
that made my heart tremble.

263
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,200
这天早上我收到了一封信 信纸看起来很廉价
This morning I received a letter
written on cheap paper,

264
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,400
并且没有署名
unsigned.

265
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,710
"一位好心人建议您能提出调换教区"
"A well -wisher advises you
to seek a transfer to another parish.

266
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,680
"越快越好"
The sooner, the better.

267
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,980
"我为您感到由衷的抱歉 但我必须重复: 快走"
I feel sorry for you,
but I repeat: Get out."

268
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,640
我发现了件奇怪的事
I made a strange discovery:

269
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,890
我认出了信的笔迹和它一致
The handwriting was identical.

270
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,310
另一个糟糕的晚上
Another terrible night.

271
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,320
雨下得如此之大以至于我不敢去教堂
It was raining so hard I didn't dare go to the church.

272
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,660
我无法祈祷
I couldn't pray.

273
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,310
我非常清楚 想要祈祷的愿望就是一种祈祷
I know very well that
the desire to pray is already prayer,

274
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,810
而上帝并不会要求更多
and that God couldn't ask for more.

275
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,110
但它并不是一种任务
But it wasn't a question of duty.

276
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,310
那时 我需要祈祷就像我需要空气
At that moment, I needed prayer
like I needed air in my lungs

277
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,980
血液需要氧气那样
or oxygen in my blood.

278
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,990
在我身后已经不再是熟悉的
Behind me, there was no longer
familiar day-to-day life

279
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,030
日日夜夜寻常的生活了
which one can leave behind in one fell swoop.

280
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,040
我的身后一无所有
Behind me there was nothing,

281
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,330
而在我前方 则是一睹隔绝的墙
and before me was a wall.

282
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,770
一堵黑色的隔绝的墙
A black wall.

283
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,310
突然间 仿佛有东西把我的胸砸得粉碎
Suddenly something seemed to shatter in my breast,

284
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,720
整整一个小时我都承受着这样的痛苦
and I was seized by a trembling that lasted over an hour.

285
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,000
如果这只是我的错觉呢？
What if it had only been an illusion?

286
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,900
连圣贤们都知晓他们有犯错 失败的时刻
Even the saints knew
their hour of failure and loss.

287
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,780
我在床脚边躺了下来
I lay face-down at the foot of my bed.

288
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,710
我只想彻底地表达接受
I only wanted to show complete acceptance

289
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,380
和投降
and surrender.

290
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,220
同样的孤独 同样的寂静
The same solitude, same silence,

291
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,850
然而这次 再也没有希望能穿越这层障碍了
but this time, no hope in breaking through the obstacle.

292
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,920
不 没有障碍物 什么也没有
There 's no obstacle. Nothing.

293
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,560
上帝已经遗弃了我
God has left me.

294
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,500
这点我已经确信
Of this I'm sure.

295
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,070
我并没有松懈
I haven't slackened in my duties.

296
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,450
我的身体不可思议地恢复起来 这让我工作变得轻松了一些
The incredible improvement
in my health makes my work easier.

297
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,700
德尔本德医生？你确定吗？
Dr. Delbende?
Are you sure?

298
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,130
德尔本德医生的尸体在巴赞伯爵的树林中被发现了
Dr. Delbende was found at the edge
of the woods near Bazan court,

299
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,600
他的头颅飞得很远 已经冷了
with his skull blown out,
already cold.

300
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,800
他滚进了一个边上排着一列树的土沟里
He rolled to the bottom of a tree-lined ditch.

301
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,610
人们推测他的枪卡在枝桠间走火了
It's thought his gun got caught in the branches

302
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,380
于是子弹飞了出去
and went off.

303
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,830
托西神父在他朋友的尸体边守了两夜
The priest from Torcy kept vigil for two nights by his friend's corpse.

304
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,440
他显然看起来非常悲伤
He was visibly anguished.

305
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,780
有流言开始传出 说德尔本德医生是自杀死的
It was rumored that Dr.Delbende had committed suicide.

306
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,500
你不认为德尔本德医生是
You don't think Dr.Delbende might have -

307
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,740
他非常沮丧
He was very disheartened.

308
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,820
他一直坚信患者们会回来找他看病
He believed up to the very end that his patients would return.

309
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,290
他的年轻的同事们四处流传 说他甚至不懂得防腐剂
His younger colleagues spread the word
that he knew nothing of antiseptics,

310
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,450
所以他的患者们都离开了
and his patients fled.

311
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,890
那些付费的患者 当然 不是其他的那些
The paying ones, of course. Not the others.

312
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,190
但事实是 他已经不再信仰天主教了
But the truth is he'd lost his faith

313
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,690
而他又无法停止他的信仰
and couldn't get over not believing.

314
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,330
我并没有权力听他这般推心置腹的话
I was in no condition to listen to his confidences just then.

315
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,080
它们如盐洒在了我的伤口上
They were like molten lead poured on an open wound.

316
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,820
我从未感到如此痛苦
I have never suffered so much

317
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,010
到死 我也不会再有这样的经历了
and likely never will again, 
even when I die.

318
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,750
如果他真的是自杀
If he really killed himself...

319
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,380
你是否
do you think -

320
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,400
如果有其他人要问我这个
If anyone else were to ask me that!

321
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,190
我会回答 "只有上帝才能裁决"
God is the only judge.

322
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,460
德尔本德医生是个公正的人
Dr.Delbende was a just man,

323
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,030
而上帝正是公正的裁决者
and God is judge of the just.

324
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,170
不管怎么样 我们正在战争期间
We're at war, after all.

325
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,710
总得面对敌人
One must face the enemy.

326
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,240
"勇敢地面对它"就像他说的那样 你记得他的摩托车吧？
"Face up to it," as he used to say.
You remember his motto?

327
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,750
不 我并没有失去我的信仰
No, I haven't lost faith.

328
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,530
这一突然且残酷的考验
This abrupt and cruel or deal

329
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,890
也许震慑了我的神经和理智
may have upset my reason, my nerves.

330
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,060
但我的信仰仍在 我能感受到
But my faith remains. I can feel it.

331
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,170
我有所感觉 站起身来
I stood up with the feeling,

332
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,110
似乎听到有什么人在叫我
the certainty, that I had heard someone calling me.

333
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,660
然而我并不会发现任何人
Yet I knew I wouldn't find anyone.

334
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,500
你会信守诺言的吧？
You'll keep your word?

335
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,410
年轻的女士 我会按我说的去做
Young lady, I will do what I promise.

336
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,450
我惊呆了
I was overwhelmed.

337
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
我从来不懂得人们 我也永远不会懂得了
I know nothing of people and never will.

338
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,510
我跑去了托西神父那里
I ran to Torcy.

339
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,490
然而神父并不在家
Father is away.

340
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,490
没有个十天八天 他是不会回来的
He won't be back for eight or ten days at least.

341
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,000
我失望极了 只好靠着我身后的那堵墙
I was so disappointed. I had to lean against the wall.

342
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
您知道我不能在这儿接待您
You know I can't receive you here.

343
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,740
你承诺了要做的事
What you promised to do

344
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,600
你今天必须得做到
must be done today.

345
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,040
明天已经太晚了
Tomorrow will be too late.

346
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,270
她已经知道我去过您的住所了
She knew I'd been to the rectory.

347
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,480
她简直狡猾得像只狐狸！
She is as sly as an animal!

348
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,750
我曾经信任过她 当你习惯她的眼神
I trusted her. You get used to her eyes.

349
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,220
你以为她是善良的
You imagine they're kind.

350
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,120
现在我简直想挖出她的那双眼睛
Now I'd like to tear out those eyes of hers

351
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,190
用脚踩在它们上面 就像这样！
and stamp on them with my foot, like this!

352
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,660
你不害怕上帝吗？
Have you no fear of God?

353
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,530
我要杀了她！
I'll kill her!

354
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,970
杀了她 或者杀了我自己！
Kill her or kill myself!.

355
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,970
你不能呆在这里
You mustn't stay here.

356
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,810
只有一个地方 我才能听你说
There's only one place I can listen to you.

357
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,680
跪下
On your knees.

358
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,220
我不想忏悔
I don't want to confess.

359
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,460
你很清楚 我所要的只是公正

360
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,730
自从那个魔鬼般的女人来到我们家里
Ever since that beastly woman came to the house -

361
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,910
冷静
Stay calm.

362
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,800
我很冷静
I am calm.

363
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,900
我希望你像我一样冷静
I wish you could be as calm as I am.

364
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,750
那天晚上我听到他们说的了
I heard them last night.

365
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,880
我在他们的窗户外
I was under their window.

366
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,320
他们甚至都不拉上窗帘！
They don't even draw the curtains!

367
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,490
我知道他们想方设法要摆脱我
I know they'll get rid of me somehow.

368
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,720
下周二我就离开这里
I am to leave next Tuesday.

369
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,400
妈妈认为这样非常适合 也很实际
Mama finds it very proper and practical.

370
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,770
她居然说适合！简直好笑
Proper! It's enough to make you laugh.

371
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,410
她对他们所有的话都毫不怀疑
But she believes anything they tell her,

372
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,500
简直就像青蛙吞苍蝇
like a frog swallowing flies.

373
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,770
不要这样谈论你的母亲
Don't speak of your mother that way.

374
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,010
这样显得你并不爱她
You don't love her.

375
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,010
你甚至..  继续说 我恨她！You even -
- Go on. I hate her!

376
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,920
我一直都恨她
I've always hated her.

377
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,260
她是个傻子 还是个懦夫
She's a fool and a coward.

378
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,790
从来不会为自己的幸福起来反抗
Never could stand up for her own happiness.

379
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,890
你为什么要这样看我？
Why do you look at me like that?

380
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,730
让我一个人静一静
Leave me alone.

381
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,890
如果你爱你父亲
If you loved your father,

382
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,400
你就不应该这样反抗他
you wouldn't be in this state of revolt.

383
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,770
我对他已经没有敬爱了
I no longer respect him.

384
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,340
我恨他们 我恨他们所有人
I think I hate him. I hate them all.

385
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,580
我要报仇 我要跑得远远的
I'll get my revenge. I'll run away.

386
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,250
我要羞辱我自己 并且要让他知道
I'll disgrace myself and make sure he hears of it.

387
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,250
然后他就会和我一样痛苦
Then he'll suffer as I have.

388
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,980
从她的唇间我似乎能读懂
It seemed I could read on her lips

389
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,250
一些她并未明说的意思
other words that went unspoken.

390
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,150
你不能这么做
You'll do no such thing.

391
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,430
我知道那并不是真正让你生气的原因
I know that's not what's really tempting you.

392
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,530
把那封信给我
Give me that letter.

393
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,240
你口袋里的那封信
The letter you have in your pocket.

394
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,740
我所说的话我自己来承担
I said whatever came to me,

395
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,140
然而很奇怪的是 我能够确信我是对的
and yet, strangely enough, I was sure I was right.

396
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,280
把它给我
Give it to me.

397
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,690
她并没有坚持 把信交给了我
She didn't try to resist, and handed me the letter.

398
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,630
你一定是魔鬼！
You must be the devil!

399
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,860
致我的父亲（也可以理解为神父或上帝）
TO MY FATHER

400
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,570
我没有读那封信 就扔进了火中
I threw the letter into the fire, unread.

401
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,160
任何一个神父都不会如此发抖着遭受这样的苦难
Hers was a distress no priest
should approach without trembling.

402
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,070
在她的眼睛里 我看到了自杀的勇气
I thought I read suicide in her eyes.

403
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,780
但也许那只是转瞬即逝的冲动
But perhaps it was only a fleeting impulse

404
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,140
那种狂热才使它变得可疑
whose very fervor made it suspect.

405
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,590
我只是一个可悲的 无用的神父 别无其他
I was nothing but a miserable, unworthy priest.

406
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,550
我根本不该接待夏塔尔小姐 也不该听她说话
I shouldn't have received Miss Chantal or listened to her.

407
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,160
现在上帝正在惩罚我
God was punishing me.

408
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,420
我知道 一言既出驷马难追
I knew my words could not be taken back

409
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,800
而正是如此 我必须看着它走向覆灭
and that I had to see it to the end.

410
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,800
我害怕她会做出些冲动的事
I fear she may do something rash.

411
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,310
那是她被逼到绝路才会做的事
That's the last thing she'd do.

412
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,670
她非常害怕死亡
She's terribly afraid of death.

413
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,670
夫人 那可是想要结束自己生命的情绪啊
Those are the ones who kill themselves.

414
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,510
一定已经有人和你说过 "这种事在你的个人经验之外"
Someone must have told you that.
It's outside your personal experience.

415
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,960
你自己害怕死亡吗？
Are you yourself afraid of death?

416
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,420
是的 夫人
Yes, madam.

417
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,490
但是 我必须诚恳地说
But let me be quite frank:

418
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,040
自杀是很困难的
To die is difficult.

419
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,500
尤其是为了名誉
Especially for the proud.

420
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,040
比起我自己的死 我更害怕你们的死亡
I fear my death less than yours.

421
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,090
我丈夫想让谁留在这里都可以
My husband can keep whomever he likes here.

422
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,700
另外 那个家庭教师没钱养活自己
Besides, the governess has no money.

423
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,460
或许他是有些过于殷勤 太过亲近
Perhaps he's been too attentive, too familiar...

424
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,970
但我想 我不在乎
but suppose I don't care?

425
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,080
这些年各种各样的背叛
After putting up all these years with countless infidelities,

426
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,580
以及古怪的屈辱 我都尝过了
suffering absurd humiliations,

427
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,050
现在 我 作为一个老女人
shall I now, as an old woman -

428
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,620
已经顺从一切了
to which I'm well resigned -

429
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,520
而叫我睁开眼睛 撕咬争斗 抓住机会 有什么意思？
open my eyes, put up a fight,
take chances? Forwhat?

430
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,450
难道我得关心我女儿的荣誉比关心我自己的更多吗？
Shall I care more about my daughter's pride than my own?

431
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,990
让她自己承担自己做的事 就像我一样
Let her put up with it as I have.

432
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,820
夫人 请您小心点
Madam, be careful.

433
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,260
小心什么？
Of what?

434
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,870
小心谁？小心你？
Of whom? Of you?

435
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,730
不要夸大
Let's not overdramatize.

436
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,840
这些想法不会左右我的决定 我的过去没有什么让我羞耻的
Such thoughts don't dictate my conduct.
There's nothing in my past to blush about.

437
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,340
如果祈祷让我们懂得耻辱 那么它就是罪恶
Blessed is sin if it teaches us shame.

438
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,140
你只会说教！难道你是想让我担忧这些事吗？
Nothing but words! Are you trying to worry me?

439
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,740
你做不到 我会注意到的
Well, you won't.I have too much sense.

440
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,530
总之 我们所作所为都会受到裁决 我做错了什么吗？
Anyway, we'll be judged by our acts. What have I done wrong?

441
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,170
你把一个孩子丢出了她的家
You're throwing a child out of her home,

442
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,730
并且你明白那是无法挽回的
and you know it's forever.

443
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,600
那只是我丈夫的愿望
It's my husband's wish.

444
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,140
如果他错了
If he's wrong -

445
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,740
何况他相信她会回来的
He believes she'll come back.

446
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,170
你也这么认为？
And do you believe that?

447
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,220
上帝会惩罚你的       惩罚我？
- God will break you.
- Break me?

448
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,750
他已经惩罚了我
He has broken me already.

449
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,930
他带走了我的儿子
God took my son from me.

450
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,490
他还能对我做什么？
What more can he do to me?

451
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,260
我已经不再怕他了
I no longer fear him.

452
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,930
上帝只是暂时带走他
God took him away for a time,

453
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,670
而你的铁石心肠
but your hardness -

454
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,870
住嘴
Silence.

455
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,140
不 我要继续说
No, I will not be silent.

456
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,510
你心肠如此冰冷 你永远都无法再接近他
The coldness of your heart
may keep you from him forever.

457
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,950
这是亵渎！上帝从不复仇
That's blasphemy! God does not take revenge!

458
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,750
这不过是对凡人的说辞
Those are mere human words,

459
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,020
对你并不适用
with no meaning except for you.

460
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,280
你是在说我的儿子会恨我吗？
Are you saying my son might hate me?

461
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,260
你们再也不会有机会见到或者了解彼此了
You will no longer see or know each other.

462
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,490
没有任何罪恶会遭受这样的惩罚
No sin could make such a punishment just.

463
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,360
真是胡扯
This is madness!

464
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,960
这只是疯子的妄想
A sick man's dreams.

465
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,110
当我在这位蛮横的女人面前 无力地靠在身后的墙上时
With my back against the wall before this imperious woman,

466
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,380
我看起来简直像个罪人 正徒劳地为自己辩解
I looked like a guilty man trying in vain to justify himself.

467
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,480
也许我就是那样
Perhaps that's what I was.

468
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,810
你听到我说的话了吗？你听明白了吗？
Did you hear me? Did you understand?

469
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,620
不 夫人 我没有听见
No, madam, I didn't hear.

470
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,420
坐下 你现在没法去任何地方
Sit down. You're in no condition to go anywhere.

471
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,250
我说的是 这世界上没有任何一种罪恶会得到这样的惩罚
I was saying that no sin on earth could make such punishment just.

472
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,430
没有什么东西会将我们同我们爱的事物分开
Nothing can part us from those we have loved

473
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,100
比生活重要 甚至比救世还重要
more than life, more than salvation itself.

474
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,030
爱比死亡更强大 你的圣经就是这么说的
Love is stronger than death. Your scriptures say so.

475
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,670
我们并没有发明爱
We did not invent love.

476
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,940
它有它自己的规则
It has its order, its law.

477
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,410
上帝是它的主宰
God is its master.

478
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,480
他无法主宰爱
He is not the master of love.

479
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,750
他是爱的化身
He is love itself.

480
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,620
如果您懂得爱 就不要将自己置身于爱之外
If you would love, don't place yourself beyond love's reach.

481
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,590
真是疯了！你对我就像对待犯人一样说话
This is insane! You speak to me as you would to a criminal.

482
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,120
难道我丈夫的背叛
Do my husband's infidelities

483
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,500
我女儿的冷漠和逆反都不算什么吗？
and my daughter's indifference and
rebellion and hat red count for nothing?

484
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,830
你尽管斥责这些都是我的过错好了！
You might as well say it's all my fault!

485
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:56,670
谁都无法预先知道 谁能摆脱邪恶的念头
No one knows what can come
ofan evil thought in the long run.

486
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,580
我们身上隐匿的罪恶会污染空气 从而污染他人
Our hidden faults poison the air others breathe.

487
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,810
你要是抱着这种想法 你是活不下去的
You'd never get through the day if you dwelt on such thoughts!

488
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,850
我是这样坚信的 夫人
I believe that, madam.

489
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,850
我相信如果上帝赋予我们清晰的理念
I believe if God gave us a clear idea

490
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:17,260
让我们在善恶之间 紧密团结
of how closely we are bound to each other in good and evil,

491
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,030
我们的确是活不下去的
we truly could not live.

492
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,960
俯允赐教 这种被隐匿的罪恶是什么？
Pray tell, what is this hidden sin?

493
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,570
你必须顺从
You must resign yourself.

494
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,940
打开你的内心
Open your heart.

495
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,200
顺从？顺从什么？
Resign myself? To what?

496
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,510
难道我还不够顺从吗？
Am I not resigned?

497
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,690
如果我不顺从的话 我早就已经死了！
If I weren't, I'd be dead.

498
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,310
顺从？我已经太过顺从了！
Resigned? I've been too much so.

499
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,820
我真该杀了自己
I should have killed myself!.

500
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,120
我并不是说要放弃
That's not the resignation I mean.

501
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,320
那又怎样？我去参加弥撒
Then what? I go to Mass.

502
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,400
我想过要放弃一切宗教仪式 那和我不相称
I could have given up worship
altogether. Indeed, I thought ofit.

503
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,240
你怎么敢这样对待上帝
How dare you treat God like that!

504
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,330
我曾活得平静 我似乎已经在平静中死去了
I lived in peace, and I should have died in peace.

505
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,400
已经不可能了
That is no longer possible.

506
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,580
上帝对我来说已经无足轻重
God has ceased to matter to me.

507
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,440
你为什么再要强迫我承认我是恨他的 蠢货？
What will you gain by making me
admit I hate Him, you fool?

508
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,310
你现在已经不恨他了
You don't hate Him now.

509
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,220
你和他现在面对面Now at last you are face-to-face.

510
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,850
坦诚相见了
He and you.

511
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,240
你对我发誓     我不会发任何誓
- Do you swear -
- You can't bargain with God.

512
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,580
你可以无条件地屈服于他
You must yield to Him unconditionally.

513
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,010
但我能保证
But I can assure you

514
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,090
这世界上并没有天堂与地狱
there isn't one kingdom for the living and one for the dead.

515
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,290
只存在上帝的王国 不管死者还是活人 我们都包容于其中
There is only the kingdom of God, and we are within it.

516
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,220
在这一小段时间前 你知道我在想什么吗？
You know what I was wondering a moment ago?

517
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,990
也许我不该告诉你
Perhaps I shouldn't tell you.

518
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,160
我正在对自己说
I was saying to myself,

519
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,140
如果这世界上有上帝所无法掌控的地方
"If therewere, in this world orthe other,
some place free from God,

520
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,000
如果到达那里必须永远地遭受死亡 每一秒
if it meant suffering a death
every second, eternally,

521
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,880
我会带着我的儿子到那儿去
I'd carry my son to that place,

522
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,840
然后对上帝说道
and I'd say to God:

523
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,580
"尽管做你能做的最坏的事来惩罚我们吧！"
'Do Your worst and crush us!"'

524
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:23,850
这可怕吗？
Is that monstrous?

525
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,890
你是什么意思 不可怕？
What do you mean, no?

526
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,860
因为我也一样
Because I too...

527
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,060
有时也会这样想
have felt that way at times.

528
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,860
德尔本德医生的形象出现在我面前
Dr. Delbende's image was before me.

529
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,640
他那衰老却坚定的目光正注视着我
His old, unflinching eyes were on me.

530
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,400
那种我害怕注视的目光
Eyes which I feared to read.

531
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,010
如果哲学家与异教徒们也拥有上帝的话
If our God were the god of the pagans or philosophers,

532
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,880
尽管他也许会去最高的天堂中避难
though he might take refuge in the highest heavens,

533
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,380
我们的苦难也会将他唤回人间
our misery would drag him down.

534
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,290
但就像你所知道的的 我们的上帝并没有躲藏
But as you know, ours did not wait.

535
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,460
你能对他施以拳脚
You might shake your fist at him,

536
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,790
向他脸上吐痰
spit in his face,

537
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,560
用荆条鞭打他
whip him with rods,

538
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,270
最后将他钉在一个十字架上
and finally nail him to a cross.

539
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,790
那又有什么关系呢？
What would it matter?

540
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,900
已经结束了     我需要对他说什么话？
It is already done.
- What must I say to him?

541
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,480
说
Say:

542
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,570
愿您的王国降临
Thy kingdom come.

543
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,110
愿您的王国降临
Thy kingdom come.

544
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,180
愿您的旨意施行
Thy will be done.

545
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,480
我做不到
I can't.

546
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,050
我仿佛已经失去他好几次了
It's as if l were losing him twice over.

547
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,350
您所愿望降临的王国既是您的也是他的
The kingdom whose coming
you have just wished for is yours and his.

548
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,830
那么就让这个王国降临吧！
Then let that kingdom come!

549
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,710
我就像我所做的那样仇恨并侮辱过上帝
I must have hated God to insult him as I did.

550
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,250
现在这种仇恨已经在我心中死去了
I might have died with that hatred on my heart.

551
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,590
一小时前 我的生活还井然有序
An hour ago, my life seemed to me in order,

552
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,650
所有事物都各就其位
each thing in its place.

553
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,430
您说的一切都没能在我这儿留下任何痕迹
You have left nothing standing.

554
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,460
就像您将生命交给上帝那样
Give it to God just as it is.

555
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,840
你没有理解
You can't understand.

556
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,570
你认为我是如此顺从
You think I'm so quickly meek!

557
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,880
我的骄傲依然会让我
The pride still left in me-

558
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,410
将您所有的傲气交出来
Give him your pride along with everything else.

559
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,050
把所有都交给他
Give Him everything.

560
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,670
真是疯了
What madness.

561
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,240
原谅我
Forgive me.

562
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,810
上帝并不是行刑者
God is no torturer.

563
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,740
他希望我们怜惜自己
He wants us to be merciful with ourselves.

564
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,280
我做的事已经定了 无法挽回了
What's done is done.There's nothing I can do.

565
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,630
愿平和与你同在
Peace be with you.

566
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,310
我必须立马离开庄园前往东巴斯勒
I had to leave immediately there after for Dom basle

567
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,920
到家的时候已经很晚了
and arrived home very late.

568
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,500
老花匠克洛维斯将一个小盒子交给了我
Clovis, the old gardener, gave me
a parcel from the countess.

569
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,370
是伯爵夫人给我的 我知道那是什么
I knew what was in it.

570
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,570
那枚小小的圣牌 已经空了 链子也已经坏了
The small medallion, now empty,
and its broken chain.

571
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,210
在那里面还有一封信
There was a letter as well.

572
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,310
"亲爱的神父 我对那个年轻的生命无望的回忆 "
" Dear Father, the hopeless
memory of one young child

573
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,510
"将我与所有事物隔绝开来 使我饱尝孤独"
had me isolated from everything
in a terrifying solitude,

574
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,480
"而现在看来 另外一个孩子将我从中拯救了出来"
and it seems as if another child
has drawn me out of it.

575
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,820
"我希望这样称呼您为孩子没有让您觉得屈尊"
I hope I don't hurt your pride by calling you a child.

576
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,660
"您是上帝的孩子 愿上帝永远这样呵护您"
You are one, and may God keep you so always.

577
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,870
"我自问着您为何要做这些事"
I ask myself how you did it,

578
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,170
"或者说 我不再自问了"
or, rather, I have ceased to ask.

579
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,740
"怎么样都好"
All is well.

580
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,910
"我并不相信顺从就能解决一切"
I didn't believe resignation was possible,

581
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,440
"事实上我从未真正顺从过"
and in fact it's not resignation that's come over me.

582
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:47,580
"我没有顺从过 而我感到很幸福"
I'm not resigned - I'm happy.

583
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,320
"我不渴望任何东西"
I desire nothing.

584
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,120
"今晚我必须得把这些想法告诉你"
I had to tell you these things this very evening.

585
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,330
"因为我们再也不会交谈了 对吧？"
We shall never speak ofthem ever again, shall we?

586
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,960
"永远不"
Never.

587
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,100
"这样很好 ‘永远不’ "
It is good, that word 'never.'

588
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,640
"在你所表达的话语里"
I feel it expresses, beyond words,

589
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,580
"我感受到了你带给我的平静"
the peace you have given me."

590
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,500
伯爵夫人在当晚去世了
The countess died last night.

591
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,410
我大汗淋漓地跑着来到了庄园
I arrived at the manor streaming with sweat.

592
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,150
伯爵假装没有看见我
The count pretended not to see me.

593
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,660
她从床上摔了下来 砸坏了夜桌上的东西
She fell out of bed, breaking objects on the night table.

594
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,420
是心绞痛 毫无疑问
Angina pectoris, no doubt.

595
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,460
她已经感到身体不适好几个月了
She hasn't been quite herself
for some time.

596
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,040
在她的脸上 我期待着能看到 也许是笑容On her face I had hoped to see -
I don't know-perhaps a smile.

597
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,440
但她并没有微笑
But she wasn't smiling.

598
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,390
当我抬起手为她祝福时 我的胳膊几乎抬不起来
My arm was like lead in raising it to bless her.

599
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,510
两点的时候我离开了庄园
I left the manor about 2:00,

600
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,140
教义课堂也比我预期结束得要晚得多
and catechism class ended
much later than I thought it would.

601
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:46,550
回家的路上 我看到长长的送葬车队
Upon returning, I found 
a continuous parade of cars,

602
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,800
而庄园中满是窃窃私语的声音
and the murmur ofvoices filled the manor.

603
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,270
我本想整晚呆在伯爵夫人身边的
I'd have liked to spend the night at the countess 'side,

604
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,940
然而修女们在那儿守着
but the nuns were there,

605
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,500
而伯爵的舅舅卡侬先生要和她们一起 整夜守着伯爵夫人
and the canon, the count's uncle,
had decided to keep watch with them.

606
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,880
我并不敢坚持自己的愿望
I didn't dare insist.

607
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,750
我最后一次进入了她的房间
I entered her room for the last time.

608
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,830
那个下午我们争执的回忆
The memory of our struggle

609
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,270
如此清晰地让我回想起来 以至于我几乎要晕倒过去
came back so vividly that I thought I would faint.

610
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,220
我掀开了她脸上遮盖的薄纱
I parted the muslin veil

611
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,720
用手指摩挲她冰冷的前额
and brushed her forehead with my fingers.

612
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,560
我曾对她说过 "愿平和与你同在"
I had said to her,"Peace be with you, "

613
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,760
而她将跪着接受了这份平静
and she'd received that peace on her knees.

614
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:06,230
多么不可思议 人会将自己不曾拥有的东西作为礼物馈赠给别人！
What wonder, that one can give what one doesn't possess!

615
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,200
噢 我们空手所创造的奇迹啊！
Oh, miracle of our empty hands!

616
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,070
当我路过的时候我似乎听到了窃窃私语
I thought I heard murmuring as I passed.

617
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,870
他们似乎在谈论着我
They seemed to be talking about me.

618
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:55,190
您见过我的侄女吗？
You saw my great-niece here?

619
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,860
是的 加侬先生
Yes, Canon.

620
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,090
在这里 以及教堂
Here, and in the church.

621
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,790
她想引起您的注意 我毫不怀疑
She worked her way around you, I've no doubt.

622
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,630
不 事实上我对她十分严厉
I treated her harshly.

623
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,370
真的 我想我甚至伤害了她
Indeed, I think I humiliated her.

624
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,740
你认为你影响到她了吗？
Do you feel you influence her?

625
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,750
暂时还没有
Not at the moment.

626
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,550
但我想她不会忘记我曾反对过她 我不能欺骗上帝
But she won't forget I stood up to her
and that you cannot deceive God.

627
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,610
她和您的见面中得到的印象和您非常不同
Her version of your meeting is very different.

628
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,890
夏塔尔小姐为人高傲 早晚会为自己的谎言而羞愧
Miss Chantal is too proud
not to blush one day at such a lie.

629
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,760
她会感到羞愧的
She'll feel ashamed,

630
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,560
她需要感到羞愧
and she needs to feel ashamed.

631
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,360
那么你呢？
What about you?

632
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,360
噢 我
Oh, me...

633
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,470
你忽视自己的病情
You neglect your health.

634
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,010
我的胃很不好伺候
My stomach is very touchy.

635
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,410
它只能消化面包 水果和酒
It digests only bread, fruit, wine.

636
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:54,040
就您现在的状况 我担心酒对您只有害处没有好处
In your state, I fear wine
 may do more harm than good.

637
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,740
幻想的健康并不是健康
The illusion of health is not health.

638
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,220
神父
Father,

639
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:05,730
关于教区的管理 我们之间也许没有一致的看法
there probably aren't two things
we agree on about how to run a parish,

640
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,360
但这是您的教区 您有权管理
but this is your parish to run as you see fit.

641
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:12,160
我只能听您的
One has only to hear you.

642
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,600
我并不需要知道您和去世的伯爵夫人之间发生了什么
I needn't know what happened
between you and the late countess,

643
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,240
但我希望能消除关于此的危险流言
but I wish to cut short some foolish and dangerous talk.

644
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,580
我的侄女正尽力地散布流言
My nephew is moving heaven and earth.

645
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,080
主教是个单纯的人 非常当真
The bishop, a simple man, takes him seriously.

646
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,220
她将你们的对话用一两句话概括给了他听
Sum up in a line or two your conversation of the other day.

647
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,190
我并不是想要揭露什么
I'm not asking you to be inaccurate,

648
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:44,700
因为我相信您 作为一个神父
still less to reveal anything
confided to you as a priest.

649
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,700
除了给主教过目 我不会拿去给任何人看
The paper won't leave my pocket except
to be placed before his grace's eyes.

650
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:54,310
您不相信我？
You distrust me?

651
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,080
我不知道这样的流言是如何产生的
I don't see how there could be
any report of such a conversation.

652
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,010
不可能有人目击到
There were no witnesses.

653
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:05,980
只有伯爵夫人自己才可能把这件事告诉别人
The countess alone
could give authority for that.

654
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,590
很好 不要再想刚才的话了
Very well. Let's drop the idea.

655
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,730
如果您愿意的话 我们明天再见
We'll meet again tomorrow, if you agree.

656
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,800
我想让您和我的侄女当面谈一下
I meant to prepare you
for your conversation with my nephew.

657
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:25,430
你不说那种满口空话的人
You're not one of those
who can speak and yet say nothing,

658
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,740
但不幸的是 那正是如此
but unfortunately that's what is called for.

659
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,280
我做了什么错事吗？他们有什么反对我的证据呢？
But what have I done wrong?
What have they got against me?

660
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,580
你做了的就是做了
That you are what you are,

661
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,720
什么也改变不了 我的孩子
and nothing can be done about that, my child.

662
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,130
人们并不恨你的单纯 恰恰相反的是他们要躲避你
People don't hate your simplicity -
they shield themselves from it.

663
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,420
你的单纯像火一样烤着他们呢
It's like a flame that burns them.

664
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,200
我按我所承诺来到了庄园
I went to the manor as I'd promised.

665
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,310
夏塔尔小姐来应门 这让我警惕了起来
Miss Chantal came to the door,
which made me suspicious.

666
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,790
她几乎将我推进了小客厅
She almost pushed me
into the drawing room.

667
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,620
百叶窗紧闭着
The shutters were closed.

668
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,340
伯爵夫人的扶手椅
The countess 'armchair

669
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:36,440
尾部烧黑了的原木 都还在那天的位置
and the blackened logs
were still in the same place.

670
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,820
年轻的女士 我时间并不多
Young lady, I've very little time.

671
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:51,720
我会站着说话
I will speak standing up.

672
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,260
为什么？
Why?

673
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,930
我的位置并不在这里 你的位置也不在这里
My place is not here,
and neither is yours.

674
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,660
你害怕死亡吗？
Are you afraid of the dead?

675
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,990
家庭教师今晚就走了
The governess is packing and leaves this evening.

676
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,790
你看 我得到了我想要得到的结果
You see, I get what I want.

677
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,390
这样的成就让你满足
Little good it will do you.

678
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,190
如果你一直保持这样 你总能找到仇恨的对象
If you stay as you are,
you'll always find someone to hate.

679
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,930
但你真正恨的人只有你自己
But the only person you really hate is yourself.

680
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,170
如果我得不到我想要得到的 我会恨我自己！
I'd hate myself the same if didn't get what I wanted.

681
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,230
我必须得到幸福！否则
I must be happy! Otherwise -

682
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,670
不管怎样 这都是他们的错
Anyway, it's their fault.

683
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,440
为什么要把我关在这个阴森森的地方？
Why keep me cooped up in this ghastly place?

684
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,080
血液明明已经在我的血管里沸腾 我却无法大声说出来
Blood pounding in my veins, but never allowed to raise my voice!

685
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,350
我还必须低声下气 整天只能专注在针线活上
Hunched all day over boring needle work, biting my tongue!

686
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:57,520
简直太可怕了
It's awful!

687
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,230
我能感觉到
That's when I can feel - I don't know -

688
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,590
有一种奇特的力量在我内心聚积起来
this extraordinary force building up inside me.

689
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,470
似乎用尽生命的长度也无法将这种热情消耗殆尽
Life itself won't be long enough to let it all out.

690
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,170
你自己这样的言行难道不觉得羞耻吗？
Aren't you ashamed of such chatter?

691
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,920
伯爵随后就从外面走了进来
The count arrived just then from the fields,

692
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,760
叼着他的烟斗 看起来非常自在
smoking his pipe
with a contented air.

693
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,760
我女儿把那份Has my daughter given you

694
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:38,990
我岳父葬礼的清单交给您了吗？
the papers from my father-in-law's funeral?

695
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,700
我想这次就照着那份清单上办
I should like this one to be the same.

696
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,570
她没给我      您没碰到她吗？
- She gave me nothing. - Didn't you see her?

697
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,510
神父在和我谈别的事
Father and I spoke of other things.

698
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:53,040
你应该交给他全权处理
You ought to give him a free hand.

699
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,920
那些繁文缛节都荒唐极了
All these complications are ridiculous.

700
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,120
您还得为家庭教师签张支票
You should sign the governess' check, too.

701
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,150
记得吗 她今晚就要走了
Remember she's leaving this evening.

702
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,390
她不呆到葬礼结束吗？
She's not staying for the funeral?

703
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,460
这样大家都会觉得奇怪的
Everyone's sure to wonder why.

704
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,160
觉得奇怪？
Everyone?

705
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,630
没人会注意到她的
I'd be surprised if anyone noticed her absence.

706
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,300
六个月的工资？简直荒唐
And six months' wages? That's ridiculous!

707
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,610
她应该好好休息一下
She deserves a bit of a break.

708
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,940
在这儿的日子可不有趣
Life here hasn't been much fun.

709
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,540
您的支票簿放在桌子上
Your checkbook is in the desk.

710
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,540
等会儿
Later, later.

711
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,580
随您的便
Very well.

712
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,020
我只是希望您不要特意去找她商量
I only wanted to spare you having to discuss it with her.

713
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,050
她心情不太好
She's quite distressed.

714
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,130
神父 我坦率地告诉您
Father, I may as well be frank.

715
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,490
我非常敬重神职人员
I respect the clergy.

716
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,330
我的家人和您前任的关系都很不错
My family's always been on good terms with your predecessors,

717
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:45,130
但仅仅是出于尊重和友谊
terms of mutual respect and friendship.

718
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,100
他们绝不会干涉我家的私事
But no priest shall meddle in my family affairs!

719
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,910
我并不是自愿插手您的家事
We get involved sometimes against our will.

720
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,880
您没有意识到自己已经不由自主
You have been unwillingly, or at least unknowingly,

721
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:03,820
造成了多大的不幸
the cause of a great misfortune.

722
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,450
我希望您不要再与我女儿交谈了
I don't wish you to speak to my daughter again.

723
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,820
我说了什么会导致不幸？
How have I caused a misfortune?

724
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,360
我舅舅一定对您说过了
My uncle must have explained.

725
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,030
我不赞成您的轻率举动
Suffice it to say that I disapprove of your indiscretions.

726
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:21,070
您的性格与习惯对教民来说是危险的
Your character and your habits are a danger to the parish.

727
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,330
我的习惯？
My habits?

728
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,540
祝您日安 神父
I bid you good day, Father.

729
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,200
伯爵夫人的遗体在今天早上下葬了
The countess was buried this morning.

730
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,000
她长久的痛苦已经功德圆满 而我的痛苦则刚刚开始
Her long ordeal is over. Now mine begins.

731
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:44,250
当我为她祈祷时 这种又愉快又恐惧的心情是从何而来的呢？
Where did that mixture of joy and fear
come from when I'd blessed her?

732
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:46,390
这种奇怪的柔情？
That strange tenderness?

733
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,720
她已经属于那个看不见的世界
She already belonged to the unseen world.

734
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,620
我的眼前下意识地浮现出她的眉头
Without realizing it, I'd glimpsed on her brow

735
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:58,360
她已然归于死的平静
a reflection of the peace of the dead.

736
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,160
对此必须应当付出代价
One must surely pay for that!

737
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,880
尽管我应该撕掉这些
Though I thought I must destroy those pages

738
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,470
狂热中写下的话语
written in a moment of true delirium,

739
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,420
然而我必须对我自己做出指控
yet I would bear witness against my own self

740
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,150
正是我遭受这难言的苦难
that my difficult ordeal,

741
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:26,390
我可怜的生命中最大的绝望
the greatest deception of my poor life -

742
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,990
我无法想到会有更痛苦的事
for I couldn't imagine worse -

743
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,500
我发觉我既不能顺从自己的欲望
found me lacking in both resignation

744
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,900
也没有足够勇气面对
and courage,

745
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,770
我想要--
and that I was tempted to -

746
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,800
您是来指责我的吗？    别孩子气了
- Did you come on my account?
- Never mind that, my boy.

747
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:10,560
如果我想指责你 我会这么做的
I do as I please.

748
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,940
你得稍微注意一下穿着
You should pay a little attention to how you dress.

749
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,240
比如说你这件披肩
That cape, for instance.

750
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,080
还有 注意你自己的身体
And then there's your health.

751
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,170
我对我的身体无能为力   你当然可以
- I can't control that.
- Yes, you can.

752
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,680
你的饮食习惯真是荒唐
Your diet's absurd.

753
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,380
是的 我必须和你好好谈谈你的饮食习惯
Indeed, I must give you a good talking to about that.

754
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:29,280
等你意识到问题的时候 你会吓一跳的
And you're surprised when you feel ill!

755
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,830
要是我像你这样晚才发觉 我会胃抽筋的
I'd get stomach cramps too if late as you do!

756
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,700
对于你的灵魂来说 其实也一样
As for the inner life, my lad, I'm afraid it's the same thing:

757
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,500
你没有好好为你自己祈祷
You don't pray enough.

758
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,370
你太痛苦以至于放弃祈祷了 我是这样认为的
You suffer too much to pray. That's how I see it.

759
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,200
但是 我不能祈祷啊
But I can't pray.

760
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:49,610
如果你无法祈祷 那就对着别人这样说吧！
If you can't pray, just repeat the words!

761
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,150
听着 我不觉得我看错了你
Listen, I don't think I've been wrong about you.

762
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,810
你试着回答看看
Try to answer this.

763
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,160
我对我们的职业思考了很多
I've thought a lot about vocation.

764
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,090
我们都接受上帝的召唤
We've all received the calling,

765
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:04,920
只是不同人方式不同
only not in the same way.

766
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,490
把事情简单化吧
And to simplify things,

767
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,400
我试着把我们置身于上帝的世界 像福音书里那样
I try to put each of us in his place - in the Gospels.

768
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,140
总之 我曾想... 幻想过 In short, I think-or I imagine-

769
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:18,370
如果 我们的灵魂能拖动躯体
if our soul could drag
this wretched body of ours

770
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,880
回到两个世纪前的洪荒之初
back up that slope of 2,000 years,

771
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,450
那么它会被引导到那个最恰当的地方
it would lead it straight to the very place where-

772
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:28,540
什么？怎么了吗？
What? What's the matter?

773
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,710
你在哭？
Are you crying?

774
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,020
我没有意识到自己正在哭
I hadn't realized I was crying.

775
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,900
在托西神父的话语中 我仿佛回到了橄榄园(耶稣受难前祈祷和被捕的地方)
The truth is that I always return to the olive grove.

776
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:50,430
一瞬间我感到熟悉 仿佛灵魂受到触动
It was a very familiar and natural movement for my soul.

777
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,170
而直到那时我才意识到
I'd never realized it until that moment.

778
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,770
突然间 上帝通过这位年老的神父口中
Suddenly, Our Lord had shown me grace

779
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,880
向我呈现了恩典
and revealed through my old master's lips

780
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,980
我所做的选择已经永远无法改变
that nothing would tear me from my chosen place in eternity.

781
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,890
我已然是这神圣的苦难的囚徒
I was a prisoner of the Holy Agony.

782
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,030
我不认为你是那样的人
I didn't think you were such a child.

783
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,230
你的神经会被粉碎的
Your nerves are shot to bits, my son.

784
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,260
好了 我们不要再呆在这儿了
That's enough, now. We can't stay here all day.

785
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:57,910
也许是上帝想要怜惜你呢
After all, maybe God means to keep you in misery.

786
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:01,840
但这并不会左右对我们的裁决
But trials never warp our judgment

787
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,170
当我们的灵魂受到质疑的时候when the welfare of souls is in question.

788
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,410
我已听说关于你的流言了
I've been hearing some disturbing things about you.

789
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,880
没关系 我知道人们是恶毒的
But no matter. I know how malicious people can be.

790
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,190
但你对待伯爵夫人也太蠢了...简直像出戏！
But the foolish way you dealt
with the countess - melodrama!

791
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,590
我不明白
I don't understand.

792
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,220
关于圣牌的那回事
That business with the medallion.

793
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,730
圣牌？
The medallion?

794
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,770
别傻了！有人看到了 没什么神奇的
Don't be silly! There was a witness.
Nothing miraculous about it.

795
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,240
谁看见的？    伯爵夫人的女儿
- Who saw us? - Her daughter.

796
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,540
你说那是顺从？
You call that resignation?

797
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,170
你强迫她把她儿子的遗物扔进壁炉里！
Forcing a mother to burn the one relic of her dead child.

798
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,150
简直像遗嘱上的故事！
It's like a story from the old testament!

799
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,550
还说什么永远的分离！
And to speak of eternal separation!

800
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,660
你不能这样要挟他人的灵魂 孩子
One doesn't blackmail souls, my child.

801
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:51,150
那是您所认为的 我可以告诉您
That's your version of what happened. I could tell a different one.

802
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,990
事实并不是这样
But it's essentially true.

803
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,070
你不能说得更详细些吗？
Is that all you can say?

804
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,570
是的
Yes.

805
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,510
不管怎样 不要再见那个女儿了 她是个魔鬼
Whatever happens, don't see
the daughter again. She's a demon!

806
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,380
我不会拒绝见她的
I won't close my door to her.

807
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:18,710
只要我还在这里做神父 我就不会拒绝接见任何人
I'll close my door to no one while I am the priest here.

808
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,260
她声称你和她最后打了起来
She claims her mother
fought you to the last,

809
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,450
你使她非常伤心 几乎发狂
and that you left her upset and spiritually distraught.

810
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,530
那是真的吗？
Is that true?

811
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,630
不是
No.

812
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,890
你抛弃了她
You left her-

813
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,930
我将她交给了上帝
I left her with God.

814
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,530
你对她的严辞也许让她死时受到了折磨
The memory of your harsh words
may have tormented her as she died.

815
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,210
她死得非常安详
She died in peace.

816
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,740
你怎么知道？
How would you know?

817
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,620
不管怎样 她已经去世了
In any case, she's dead now.

818
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,590
你还能希望人们能怎么想？
What do you expect people to think?

819
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,950
那样对于心脏有问题的人来说总不是好事
Scenes like that aren't good for someone with heart trouble.

820
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:09,070
我不是要引诱你说到那封信
I wasn't even tempted to speak of the letter.

821
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,070
我把它交还给区长了
I returned to the rectory.

822
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:16,940
我并不痛苦  甚至感到如释重负
Instead of suffering, it felt like
a great weight had been lifted.

823
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,820
与托西神父的会面就像
That meeting with the priest
from Torcy was like a rehearsal

824
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,250
即将与我的院长们会面的一次彩排
for those I was to have very shortly with my superiors.

825
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,350
我几乎高兴地发现 我并没有说什么过激的话
I'd discovered, with something bordering
on joy, that I had nothing to say.

826
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:36,820
两天以来 我一直担心会被指责做了些我并没做的事
For two days, I'd feared being accused
of something I hadn't done...

827
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,330
那样会让我无法保持沉默
and honesty would have forbidden me to remain silent.

828
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:47,110
而现在 我能让所有人判断我的行为
But now, I could let everyone judge my actions for himself.

829
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,100
我得到了解脱
I was very relieved as well

830
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,880
不再担心夏塔尔小姐对我
to think Miss Chantal could have been sincerely mistaken

831
01:14:56,350 --> 01:15:00,620
和伯爵夫人的谈话产生任何遗漏而导致的误解
as to the real meaning of our talk,
which she may well have misheard.

832
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,650
我可怜的孩子！
My poor child!

833
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,550
原来是这样
So that's how it is.

834
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:36,320
我不明白怎么了 我什么也不懂
I didn't understand yet.
I didn't understand anything.

835
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:39,290
我想自己方才享受的片刻平静
Except that the strange peace I'd just enjoyed

836
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,930
也许只是一个新的不幸的预兆
was the harbinger of a new misfortune.

837
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,870
那根本不是酒 那简直是毒药
This isn't wine. It's some monstrous poison.

838
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:47,770
我只有这个
It's all I have.

839
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,400
你应该来问我要
You should have asked me.

840
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,600
如果我知道我会的 我发誓
I swear.

841
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,730
住嘴！看看你都喝了些什么 没死真是万幸
Silence! With that stuff inside you, it's a wonder you're not dead.

842
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,510
幸好我过来了一趟
I'm glad I came. 

843
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,260
来 坐下
 Come, sit down.

844
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:06,260
不
No.

845
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,720
我的声音像往常那样瑟瑟发抖
My voice trembled in my chest as it always did

846
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,950
内心的声音告诉我不能动摇
whenever something inside told me I had to stand my ground.

847
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,560
没有任何力量能让我坐下
No force in the world could have made me sit.

848
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,730
听着 我不是对你发火
Listen, I'm not angry with you,

849
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,460
我也不认为你酗酒
and I don't take you for a drunk.

850
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:24,870
我们这些乡下人
We country people of these parts

851
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,380
多少都是些酒鬼的后代
are all more or less drunkards' children.

852
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,010
德尔本德医生已经对你指出了吧
Delbende put his finger on the trouble right off.

853
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,570
你父母在你出生时就烂醉如泥
You were born pickled in the stuff, my poor friend.

854
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,150
我相信 你完全不知情
I'm sure you had no idea.

855
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,080
但你渐渐的也开始依靠酒来支持...什么酒呀！
But you slowly drifted into expecting
from wine - and what wine! -

856
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:46,630
也许你能从中得到些许勇气和力量
the strength and courage you might
have gotten from a good roast.

857
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,590
我提醒你的是 尽管你并不有意要冒犯上帝
Mind you, you've not been offending God.

858
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:53,330
但既然我已经警告你了 你现在就在冒犯他
But now you've been warned, and you'd offend Him now.

859
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,660
我愣愣地看着他
I looked at him distractedly.

860
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,000
他看起来又强壮又坚实
He's a strong and steady man.

861
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,040
一个名符其实的上帝的仆人 他正在勇敢地面对
A true servant of God. He too has faced up to it.

862
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:07,480
我们似乎在一条看不见的大路上
It was as if we were bidding farewell to each other

863
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,380
正在互相道别
across some invisible highway.

864
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,010
现在 你也不要再胡思乱想了
Above all, don't let your imagination run away with you.

865
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,920
我只有一句话
I've only one thing to say:

866
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,650
你依然是个很不错的小教士
You are a wonderful little priest in spite of everything.

867
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,330
我并不想重伤那位可怜的死去的女士
And with no malice to the poor woman who died -

868
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:21,860
请不要说了
Please don't.

869
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,260
是的 我们不要再谈论那件事了
You're right. We'll not speak of that.

870
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,640
现在 请开始好好工作
And now, work.

871
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,240
做些小事 一点点地来 不要心急
Do little things, from day to day, while you wait.

872
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:41,910
小事看起来无足轻重 但它们能带来安宁
Little things don't seem like much, but they bring peace.

873
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,990
还有 开始祈祷吧
And try to pray.

874
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,710
坚持祈祷
Persevere.

875
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,290
向圣母祈祷
Pray to the Holy Virgin.

876
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,720
她是人类的慈母
She is, of course, the mother of mankind,

877
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,730
但也是天主的女儿
but she is also its daughter.

878
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,890
在旧世界 痛苦的世界里
The ancient world, the world before grace,

879
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,160
她在襁褓中摇晃着
rocked her in its cradle.

880
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,610
几个世纪 他都保护着
For centuries its old hands protected

881
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,900
这个奇妙的不知姓名的女孩
the wondrous young girl
whose name it didn't even know.

882
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,280
这个小女孩就是天使中的皇后
A little girl, this queen of the angels,

883
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,850
至今仍是 你不要忘记
which she still is to this day. Never forget that.

884
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,610
谢谢
Thank you.

885
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,490
请为我祝福
Give me your blessing.

886
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,390
不 应该由你来
No, it's your turn today.

887
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,390
给您 神父
Here you are, Father.

888
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,530
不 谢谢 我没事
No, thanks. Nothing.

889
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,260
会好的
It will pass.

890
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,260
这会让您很快好起来的
This will put you right again.

891
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,150
感觉好多了吗？
Feeling better?

892
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,420
好多了 谢谢
Much better, thank you.

893
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,530
我得回家了
I should have gone home.

894
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:12,800
我的胃稍微好了点 但我觉得有些晕眩
My stomach hurt less. I just felt a slight dizziness.

895
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,970
我一定是树林里晕倒了
I must have fainted the first time
beyond the Auchy woods.

896
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,550
在我意识中 我努力挣扎着要起来
I thought I was still struggling upright,

897
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,090
然而我只能感到脸颊触碰着冰冷的土地
and yet I could feel the frozen earth against my cheek.

898
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:14,120
"他们会看到我这样半死不活的" 我想道  "又会引起新的流言"
"They'll find me half dead, " I thought. Yet another scandal.

899
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,400
我想我开始呼救了起来
I think I called out.

900
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,770
我可怜的脑袋已经无法忍受这种痛苦了
My poor head couldn't stand it anymore.

901
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:32,340
托西神父所描绘的圣母形象
The image of the Holy Virgin as described by the priest

902
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,480
清晰地出现在我的面前
was constantly before me.

903
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,520
崇高的女人 她的双手
A sublime creature. Her hands -

904
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,420
我正紧紧盯着她的手看
I stared at her hands.

905
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:46,620
它们时而出现 时而消失
Now I'd see them, now they'd disappear.

906
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,260
我的痛苦几乎达到了顶点
As my pain grew more extreme,

907
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,530
我抓住其中的一只 攥入我的手心
I took one of them in mine.

908
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,260
那是一只贫苦孩子的手
It was the hand of a poor child,

909
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:59,100
一只因为辛勤劳作而变得粗糙的手
already roughened by hard work and washing.

910
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,640
饿闭上了眼睛
I closed my eyes.

911
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,240
重新睁开眼睛的时候 我几乎害怕
I feared, when opening them again,

912
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,720
看到那张脸 所有人都对着那张脸屈膝下跪
to see the face before which every knee must bend.

913
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,580
我看到了它
I saw him.

914
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:17,190
那一张毫无光泽的孩子的面孔
It was a child's face, without the slightest radiance.

915
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,770
我是在水塘里打的水 那里的水比较让人放心
I filled it at the pond. It seemed safer.

916
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,950
他们都在房子里
They're all there in the house.

917
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:45,050
我出来把奶牛们牵回厩的
I had gone out to bring the cows in.

918
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,080
您不该让自己变成现在这样的
You shouldn't let yourself get in such a state!

919
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,620
幸好我碰见了您
It's lucky I found you.

920
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,720
我以为您已经死了
I thought you were dead.

921
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:58,130
我得起来    你现在这样哪儿也去不了
- I have to get up. - You can't go home looking like that.

922
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,930
我怎么了？
What's wrong with me?

923
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,270
你呕吐了
You've vomited.

924
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:06,770
吐得满脸都是 我想你是不是吃了什么浆果
It's smeared all over your face as if you'd been eating black berries.

925
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,990
你在发抖 让我来吧 我习惯了
You're shaking. Let me do it. I'm used to it.

926
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:29,660
哎呀 又来了 和上星期在婚礼上做同样的事
My, my. Another thing entirely
from last week at the wedding!

927
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,300
明天到我的住所来
Come to the rectory tomorrow.

928
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:35,470
我会好好解释的
I'll explain.

929
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,300
上帝啊 不要这样
Heavens, no!

930
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:40,140
我说了您太多坏话
I've said too many awful things about you.

931
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,970
糟糕的话
Terrible things.

932
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,980
我知道您没有恶意
I know you didn't do this on purpose.

933
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,750
他们也许在您的酒里放了些什么
They probably put some powder in your glass.

934
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,020
他们那样做是闹着玩
They do things like that for fun.

935
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:02,060
不过幸好这次有我在 他们不会得逞了
But thanks to me, they won't have their fun this time.

936
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:12,100
我陪您走完这段路
I'll take you as far as the road.

937
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:52,110
快回家吧
Hurry home now.

938
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,780
我昨晚做梦梦到您了 您看起来很可怜
I had a dream about you last night. You looked miserable.

939
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,410
我醒来后都哭了
I woke up crying.

940
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:29,240
布料硬邦邦的 水也变成了红色
The cloth was stiff, and the water had turned red.

941
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,420
我意识到我流了许多血
I realized I'd lost a lot of blood.

942
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:40,350
我惊恐极了 死亡几乎随时将至
I was so surprised- fear of death came only later -

943
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:44,360
我决定乘一早的火车去里尔
that I decided to take the first train to Lille in the morning.

944
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,400
公鸡打鸣后 我醒了过来 感到好多了
At the cock's crow, I woke feeling fine.

945
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:57,580
又吐了一阵血
Another bit of hemorrhaging. More like spitting blood.

946
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,540
我害怕死亡
Fear of death.

947
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:06,790
感觉像是我整个身体正围绕着胸口的一个点颤动着 非常奇怪
Strange how my whole body seems
to quiver around one point in my breast.

948
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,600
黎明对我来说简直太过美好
Dawn is always so sweet to me.

949
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,410
祝福这美好的早晨！
Bless mornings!

950
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,480
我开始祈祷
I pray better.

951
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,620
我听说您明早就要离开了
You're going away tomorrow, I hear.

952
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:17,950
是的
Yes.

953
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,360
您还会回来吗？
Will you be coming back?

954
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,570
要看情况
That depends.

955
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:32,370
由您自己决定？
It depends... on you?

956
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,940
由我在里尔的医生决定
On the doctor I'm to see in Lille.

957
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,140
我想
I thought -

958
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,160
那是奥利佛的摩托车
That's Olivier's motorcycle.

959
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,540
我的表兄
My cousin.

960
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,380
请来帮帮我
Help me

961
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,380
既然您现在在这里
as long as you're here -

962
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,850
尽管这违背您父亲的意思 我还是要这样要求您
against your father's will, I might add.

963
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,940
您当然可以有所保留
You sure keep your cards hidden.

964
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:45,410
我能问问您是怎么看待我的吗？
May I ask what you think of me?

965
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,910
神父是不能提出对个人的见解的
A priest has no opinions.

966
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,450
但你能看到我 也能听到我You have eyes and ears

967
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,130
您也像任何普通人一样了解我
and make use of them like everyone else, I suppose.

968
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,190
我并没有了解到任何东西
They would tell me nothing about you.

969
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,800
为什么？
Why not?

970
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,200
您总是如此不安
You're always restless,

971
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,840
企图隐瞒您内心所想
hoping to conceal the truth of your soul

972
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,540
或者干脆忘了它
or perhaps to forget it.

973
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,840
我不害怕真理
I'm not afraid of the truth.

974
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:25,250
你要是敢打我
And if you're daring me -

975
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,290
我不是要打你
I'm not daring you.

976
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,620
除非你遇到了死亡的威胁 我才会倾听你的忏悔
I'd only agree to hear your confession
if you were in danger of death.

977
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,760
我想 赦免也会很快
Absolution will come in due time, I hope,

978
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,900
通过他人降临的
and from someone else's hand.

979
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,100
您没什么可掩藏的
That wasn't hard to predict.

980
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,200
上帝马上就会将您调离这里
Father will be sure to have you transferred.

981
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,100
在这儿 所有人都认为你是个酒鬼
Everyone here takes you for a drunkard.

982
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,300
如果您仅仅想知道我对生命的看法
If you only knew what I think of life.

983
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,900
在我生命中 所有的东西我都想得到 我也一定会努力得到它们
I want everything. I'll try everything.

984
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:59,940
我知道许多人到死都没能做到
I know plenty of others have died
without managing to do that.

985
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,940
如果生命让我无法得偿所愿 那就这样吧
If life disappoints me, so be it.

986
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:05,140
我会为了罪恶而罪恶的
I will sin just for sin's sake.

987
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,820
那时候上帝就会来带走你
That's the moment you'll find God.

988
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:16,190
我想狠狠地侮辱您一番
I feel like -  don't know -insulting you!

989
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,460
您自认为能违背我的想法来断定我的命运？
You think you can decide my fate against my will?

990
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,500
如果我这样做 我会诅咒自己的
I'll damn myself if I please.

991
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,300
我是以灵魂来回答你的
I answer for you, soul for soul.

992
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,770
您刚才不是在说 究竟是什么撞碎了您的幻想吗？
Are you just saying whatever strikes your fancy?

993
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:41,020
您和我母亲说话的时候 我正巧在窗边听到了
I was at the window when you spoke with Mother.

994
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:45,830
突然之间 她说话变得那么温和
All ofa sudden, her expression became so gentle.

995
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:51,000
我并不相信鬼魂与奇迹的说法
I don't believe in miracles any more than I do in ghosts,

996
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,290
但我至少了解我的母亲
but I think I knew my mother.

997
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,630
她在意措辞就像鱼儿在意温度一样敏感
She cared for fine phrases like a fish cares for apples.

998
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,680
你们之间有什么秘密？
Do you have some secret?

999
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:06,210
我不想提起这个
A lost secret.

1000
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:10,750
你太想找到它 反会失之交臂You too will find it and lose it in turn,

1001
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,380
而其他人会在你身后将这个秘密传递下去
and others will pass it on after you.

1002
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,120
神父 你到哪里去？
Where are you going, Father?

1003
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,250
去马塞尔格乘火车
To Mazargues, to catch the train.

1004
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,320
您有骑过摩托车吗？想试试看吗？
Ever ridden on one of these? Want to try?

1005
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,190
来吧
Come on.

1006
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,240
您不怕吗？
You're not frightened?

1007
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,020
为何此时我感到奇迹般的年轻？
How could I feel so miraculously young then?

1008
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,990
是的 就像我的同行者这样年轻
Yes, as young as my companion.

1009
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,120
事情突然变得非常简单
Things suddenly seemed simple.

1010
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:02,160
年轻人都是被祝福的
Youth is blessed.

1011
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:05,800
你有权做冒险的事 甚至你做冒险的事都会被上帝祝福
It's a risk you take, and even that risk is blessed.

1012
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:08,300
抓紧了！
Hold on!

1013
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,530
我觉察到一种无法言明的征兆
By some premonition I can't explain,

1014
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,370
我想 上帝并不希望我在还没
I understood that God didn't want me to die

1015
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,570
尝试这种冒险之前就死去
without knowing something of this risk.

1016
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:24,780
而当这个时刻到来时 我的献身也能功德圆满
just enough for my sacrifice to be complete when it's time came.

1017
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,950
你就要走了 真是可惜 我还可以再载你一程的
Too bad you're leaving. We could have done this again.

1018
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:55,380
我很喜欢你 我们能成为朋友的
I like you. We could have been friends.

1019
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,180
我 成为你的朋友？
Me, your friend?

1020
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,860
当然
Of course.

1021
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,950
我知道你不是他们传言那样的人
Not that I haven't heard plenty about you.

1022
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:09,560
我舅舅嘲笑你是个下贱又百无一用的小神父
My uncle thinks you're a filthy, good-for-nothing little priest.

1023
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,330
我想你不会介意他怎么想吧
I don't suppose you care what he thinks.

1024
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:21,370
你大概不知道 我投靠了国外的阵营
You probably don't know I'm in the Foreign Regiment.

1025
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:24,340
阵营？
The Regiment?

1026
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,040
我是说军队
The Legion, I mean.

1027
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:31,920
如果你能看看自己的样子
If you could only see yourself.

1028
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,350
看看我自己？
See myself?

1029
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,190
你脱下身上的黑袍 和我们这些年轻人完全是一样的
Without that black robe, you'd look like any one of us.

1030
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,850
我一眼就看出来了
I could see that right off the bat.

1031
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,060
您不是这个意思
You don't mean it.

1032
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,930
我正是这个意思
I certainly do.

1033
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,390
什么？一个青年神父？
What? A priest?

1034
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,670
我们那儿就有很多神父
There are plenty of priests out there.

1035
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:54,770
我原来的指挥官先前就是个神父 之后我们才发现这一点
My major's orderly was one. We only found out afterwards.

1036
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,380
之后？
Afterwards?

1037
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,100
他阵亡之后
After his death.

1038
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,920
他是怎么阵亡的？
How did he die?

1039
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,520
死在了一头骡子身上 他像根香肠一样横在骡背上
On a mule, strung up like a sausage,

1040
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,660
子弹打穿了他的腹部
a bullet through his belly.

1041
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,760
我不是问这个
That's not what I meant.

1042
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:13,120
听着 我不会对你撒谎的
Look, I won't lie to you.

1043
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,630
这些家伙们死前都乐意好好炫耀一番
The guys like to show off when their time has come.

1044
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:20,630
他们那种表达方式 你也许会称之为亵渎
They have an expression or two
you'd probably call blasphemy.

1045
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:24,330
但上帝并没有拯救士兵们 且正是因为他们是士兵他才没有救他们
But if God doesn't save all soldiers
precisely because they're soldiers,

1046
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:27,000
所以 尊敬又有什么用？
then what's the use?

1047
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:31,770
多说句亵渎的话也无所谓 然后 砰
One more blasphemy for good measure, and then... bam.

1048
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:34,580
道理是一样的 不成功便成仁
It's always the same motto: "All or nothing."

1049
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,840
我敢打赌 就你来说
I bet you yourself-

1050
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:43,950
我想我舅舅说你没什么社交能力是对的
You know, my uncle's right when he says
you have no social skills.

1051
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,590
承认吧 我们的世界和他们的不一样
Admit it, our world isn't theirs.

1052
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,600
我不排斥他们的世界
I don't reject theirs.

1053
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,130
但他们的世界没有爱
But it lacks love.

1054
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,470
我们这些年轻人不像你这么了解他们
Our chaps don't have your wisdom in the matter.

1055
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,100
上帝不过代表他们所鄙视的正义
God seems to them to stand for a justice they despise -

1056
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:03,240
这种正义对他们而言毫无荣耀
a justice without honor.

1057
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:07,980
只有他们自己认定的法则才值得他们去努力
Their own law has the merit of costing a lot, an awful lot.

1058
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:12,090
像个祭坛 他们赋予它意义
It's like a sacrificial altar.

1059
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:15,150
其实它不过是块巨大的石块
Just a stone, no larger than any other.

1060
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:53,960
拉维尼医生 医学院教授
DR. LAVIGNE    PROFESSOR, FACULTY OF MEDICINE

1061
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,640
我径直向车站走去
I walked straight ahead toward the station.

1062
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:53,410
半当中 我走进了一座不知名的教堂
I entered an old church. I didn't even know its name.

1063
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:10,240
过去祈祷时 我从未感到身体动起来如此艰难
I'd never felt such a violent, physical revulsion to prayer.

1064
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:14,310
即使我祈愿也无能为力
My will was helpless in the face of it.

1065
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:47,630
这样您就能安心写您的布道词了
This way you can go on quietly writing your sermon.

1066
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:00,220
我年轻的时候的那些神父们吃得可多了
When I was young, priests used to eat too much.

1067
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,680
看看您 简直瘦得像只猫
Now you're as skinny as alley cats.

1068
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:06,390
当然啦 刚开始总是很累人的
Beginnings are always hard.

1069
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,330
别担心 您这个年纪 未来的日子还长着呢
Never mind. At your age you have your whole life before you.

1070
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:14,160
我告诉自己应该冷静 我得保持沉默I knew to keep calm, I had to keep silent.

1071
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:27,640
癌症
Cancer.

1072
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:30,650
胃癌
Stomach cancer.

1073
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:35,250
当这个词进入我的耳朵的时候 我觉得整个大脑都空了
The words had rung in my ears but left my mind empty.

1074
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,190
我本以为会是肺结核
I had expected something else: tuberculosis.

1075
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:46,130
但我只是皱了皱眉 就像听到了个并不太严重的问题似的
I think I just frowned, like when hearing of a difficult problem.

1076
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:51,130
过了好久我似乎才能意识到 我很快就要因此死去了
It took me a long time to realize I was to die from a disease

1077
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,230
在我这样的年纪 几乎是不会发生的
that rarely strikes people of my age.

1078
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:21,860
杜普路易太太为我送来了杯黑咖啡后就离开了
She left me alone with a cup of black coffee.

1079
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,760
我感觉并不太糟 甚至睡着了一小会儿
I felt well and even fell asleep for an instant.

1080
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:52,400
当我醒来...
When I woke...

1081
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,060
上帝 我必须将它写下来
God, I must write it down.

1082
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,980
我想念前几天的早晨
I think of my last few mornings this week,

1083
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:19,360
鸡鸣过后 窗外看起来如此平和
of the cock's crow and my peaceful window.

1084
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,070
纯净 且生机勃勃！
How fresh and pure it all was!

1085
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,120
尽管我努力告诉自己
Even though I kept telling myself

1086
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:45,690
这几周里 我什么也没变
nothing had changed inside me over the last weeks,

1087
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:51,520
这种渴望回家的念头...几乎使我感到羞愧
the idea of going home with this...thing... made me feel ashamed.

1088
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:39,410
药物及相关
DRUGS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS

1089
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:42,610
阿伯特・迪福雷蒂是我被派往教区之前
Abbot Dufrety had studied with me at the seminary

1090
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:44,870
在神学院的同窗好友
before being assigned to a small parish.

1091
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,610
我知道他如今已经不再从事神职I knew he'd taken a leave from the ministry

1092
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,520
据说只是因为生病而辞职的
only because of illness.

1093
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:14,100
他只穿了件衬衫
He was in shirtsleeves,

1094
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:17,780
下身穿着我们袍子下的棉裤
in those cotton pants we wear under our cassocks,

1095
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,400
光着脚穿着拖鞋
and bare foot in his slippers.

1096
01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:23,580
你应该早点告诉我你要过来 我在镇上有个办公室
You might have let me know. I have an office in town.

1097
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,650
我只是偶尔住这儿 这里真是太破了
I only camp out here. The place is disgusting.

1098
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,700
我想多吃点 但我吃不进去
I'm supposed to eat a lot, but I don't have much appetite.

1099
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,570
还记得在神学院吃的豆子吗
Remember those beans at the seminary?

1100
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,750
这里更糟 烧菜都只能在这儿做
The worst is, the cooking has to be done right here.

1101
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:57,750
只能忍着油烟味
I've taken a dislike to the smell of frying.

1102
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:01,790
在别的地方 我会狼吞虎咽的
Anywhere else, I'd gobble up the stuff.

1103
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:08,020
你来真是太好了
Nice of you to come.

1104
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,460
老实说我吓了一跳
Frankly, I'm a bit surprised.

1105
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,760
以前你有点想不太开
You used to be a bit narrow-minded in those days.

1106
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:19,540
抱歉 我得去洗把脸
Excuse me. I'll just clean up a bit.

1107
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:23,280
今天我过得很不错 这可不是常有的
I've had a good day, which doesn't happen often.

1108
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:26,750
你还能期待什么呢？积极的生活足够好了
What do you expect? An active life is good for one.

1109
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,180
但你不要以为我已经变得粗俗了
But don't think I've turned into an ignoramus.

1110
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:33,760
我最近读了很多 从来没读得这么勤快过
I read voraciously. I've never read so much.

1111
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,090
我这儿还有些笔记 等会儿给你看
I've got some notes here. I'll show you.

1112
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:41,990
希望你留下来吃个晚饭 我们能好好聊聊
I hope you'll stay for dinner. We can have a nice chat.

1113
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:46,590
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1114
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:06,810
来 把它喝下去
Here, drink this.

1115
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:15,690
你能怎么办？我们血管中流淌的血液就已经腐坏
What do you expect? We've got rotten blood in our veins.

1116
01:46:17,470 --> 01:46:21,630
一个医生曾对我说过 "知识分子从小就营养不良！"
A doctor told me once, "Intellectuals, undernourished since childhood!"

1117
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,840
这很有道理 你说呢？
Explains a lot, don't you think?

1118
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,310
别以为我只是在为自己找借口
Don't think I'm just making excuses for myself.

1119
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:33,340
我非常相信这个说法
I believe in utter honesty,

1120
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,040
无论对他人还是对我自己都是对的
with others and with myself.

1121
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,950
出疗养院后 我就想着要锻炼自己
When I left the sanatorium, I wanted to test myself.

1122
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,630
所以我找了工作
I looked for a job.

1123
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,420
但我意志和胆量都不够
It was a question of willpower and guts. Guts, mostly.

1124
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,530
提醒你 我并不是要你学我这样做
Mind you, I'm not telling anyone to follow me.

1125
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:54,400
我经历了非常痛苦的日子才缓了过来
There are bad times.

1126
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:57,930
这期间 倘若我忘了对为我牺牲的人
And if it hadn't been for a feeling of responsibility

1127
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:01,670
本应有的那些责任感的话...
towards someone who sacrificed her life for me -

1128
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:06,870
好吧 这个事情是纯粹客观的
Well, we can talk about that quite objectively.

1129
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:10,780
她对我没有任何索求
She counts for nothing in my intellectual life.

1130
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:15,880
别觉得太惊奇 别感到困惑 ！
And don't think it was a bolt
from the blue, a bewilderment!

1131
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:20,050
你惊讶吗？
You're surprised?

1132
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:24,430
没有
No.

1133
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:26,090
但以你这样的处境
But in your place,

1134
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:29,060
倘若我必须违背我在接受神职时作出的宣誓
if I'd broken my ordination promises,

1135
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:33,030
我情愿那是因为对一个女人的爱情
I'd rather it had been for love of a woman,

1136
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:39,040
而不是你所说的客观的理性的生活
than for what you call your intellectual life.

1137
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:41,010
我不同意你的说法
I don't agree.

1138
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:45,110
你不知道你在说些什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

1139
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:47,510
我的理性生活
My intellectual life -

1140
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,020
你怎么了？
What's the matter?

1141
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,660
回答我！
Answer!

1142
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:09,070
我不想死在这儿！
I don't want to die here!

1143
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:12,210
让我离开，到哪儿去都行！
Get me out of here, anywhere!

1144
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,080
我能怎么办？
What can I do?

1145
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:17,170
我一个人搬不动他
I can't carry him by myself,

1146
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:19,750
我们也不能叫看门人来帮忙
and we can't ask the concierge for anything.

1147
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:42,610
别动 神父先生
Don't move, Father.

1148
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:45,040
会好的
It will pass.

1149
01:48:57,230 --> 01:49:00,890
迪福雷蒂先生有些惊慌 他先去药店了
Mr. Dufrety panicked a bit and ran off to the pharmacy.

1150
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,530
您对我的看法也许很糟糕
I'm afraid you must think poorly of me.

1151
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:13,100
房间又脏又乱 没人打理
The room isn't tidied up and everything's dirty.

1152
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,610
我每天五点就去上班
You see, I leave to work at 5:00 in the morning,

1153
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:21,780
我已经没力气去做这些家务活了
and I just don't have the strength anymore.

1154
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:28,980
您做什么工作？
What is your work?

1155
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,780
我是个清洁工
I'm a cleaning lady.

1156
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:37,030
最累的就是要从一个地方扫到另一个地方
The most tiring part is rushing from one place to another.

1157
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,600
他的生意如何？
But what about his business?

1158
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,740
他们说那儿有钱可赚
They say there's money in it,

1159
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,440
但他借钱来置办办公室和打字机
but he had to borrow for the office and the typewriter.

1160
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,180
他没法回避这些事
Besides, he can't get around much.

1161
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,120
你们结婚了吗？
Are you married?

1162
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:04,850
没有
No.

1163
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:08,260
是我反对结婚的
I was the one against it.

1164
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:13,030
为什么？
Why?

1165
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,830
因为他就是这样的人 您难道没有看出来吗？
Because of what he is, don't you see?

1166
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:21,030
在疗养院的时候我希望他能好起来
I always hoped he'd get well at the sanatorium.

1167
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:25,380
所以 倘若他想要重新开始生活
And then, if he ever wanted to make a fresh start,

1168
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,540
我绝不会挡他的路
I wouldn't be in the way, I told myself.

1169
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:37,180
他是怎么想的？
And what did he think of that?

1170
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:39,590
没什么
Nothing.

1171
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,290
他只是以为我不想结婚
He thought I didn't want to.

1172
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:47,370
您为什么要问这些？
Why do you ask?

1173
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,600
出于友谊
Out of friendship.

1174
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:05,820
药剂师是对的 他刚刚嘲笑了我
The pharmacist was right. He just laughed at me.

1175
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:08,920
说真的 一次小小的昏厥都会吓到我
It's true: The smallest fainting spell terrifies me.

1176
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:19,590
听着
Listen.

1177
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,470
我得和你谈谈
I must talk to you.

1178
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:26,030
时间不多了
There's little time.

1179
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:29,440
和我谈什么？谈谁？
Talk to me about what? About whom?

1180
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,410
你
You.

1181
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:44,690
"他同意去见托西神父"
"He's agreed to meet with the priest in Torcy.

1182
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:49,030
我的老院长
My old master -"

1183
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:01,530
凌晨四点左右 我仍无法入睡 便去了他的房间
Around 4:00, unable to sleep, I went to his room

1184
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:05,090
发现我可怜的同窗躺在了地上 不省人事
and found my poor colleague unconscious on the floor.

1185
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:07,830
我们将他搬回床上
We carried him back to bed,

1186
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,730
他吐了大量的血
where upon he vomited up streams of blood.

1187
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,570
然后他渐渐停止吐血了
But the hemorrhaging ended.

1188
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:17,870
当我们等待医生到来时 我可怜的朋友依稀恢复了知觉
While we waited for the doctor, our poor friend regained consciousness,

1189
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:20,050
但他没有说话
but he didn't speak.

1190
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:23,310
豆大的汗珠布满了他的眉间与双颊
Heavy beads ofsweat covered his brow and cheeks,

1191
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:26,910
脸上的表情显得非常痛苦
and his expression told of great anguish.

1192
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:30,280
他的脉搏逐渐变得愈加虚弱
His pulse was rapidly growing weak.

1193
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:34,160
他示意他想要他的念珠
He motioned that he wanted his rosary,

1194
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,090
我在他的裤子口袋里找到了它
which I found in his pants 'pocket.

1195
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,720
他将念珠紧紧贴住胸口
From then on, he held it pressed against his chest.

1196
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:41,160
看上去恢复了些许力气
He seemed to recover some strength

1197
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:44,860
以几乎听不见的声音 请求着宽恕
and in an almost inaudible voice asked for absolution.

1198
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:48,800
他的脸变得平和了 甚至发出了微笑
His face grew calm. He even smiled.

1199
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:52,210
尽管无论出自人性还是出自友情我都应该拒绝他
Though neither humanity nor friendship would permit me to refuse,

1200
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:56,610
要求我作为神父履行他的要求
while discharging my duties, I explained to my unfortunate comrade

1201
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:59,580
我告诉了他我的犹豫
my hesitation at granting his request.

1202
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:02,990
他似乎并没有听见
He didn 't seem to hear me.

1203
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:07,060
然而过了一会儿 他将他的手放在我手上
But a few moments later, he laid his hands on mine

1204
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:12,090
眼神示意着我上前去
while his eyes entreated me to draw closer to him.

1205
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:15,230
他非常清晰地
He then said, very distinctly,

1206
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:18,000
用极其缓慢的语调if extremely slowly,

1207
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:21,900
一字一句地说道
these exact words:

1208
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,710
"有什么关系？一切都是恩典"
"What does it matter? All is grace. "

1209
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,510
我想 这之后 他就去世了
I believe he died just then.

1210
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,510
