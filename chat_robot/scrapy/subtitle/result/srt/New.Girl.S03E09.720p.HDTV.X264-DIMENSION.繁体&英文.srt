1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,420
我在考慮今晚的約會
Oh, hey. I was wondering about date night tonight.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,200
你想不想就在家呆著呢
Um, do you want to just stay in?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,600
你明白我的意思吧
'Cause you know what that means.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,680
-浪漫晚餐  然后看國土安全  -滾床單
- Romantic dinner and Homeland? - Sex on the couch.

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,970
-你的想法更好  -其實看國土安全也不錯
- Or your thing. - Actually, Homeland sounds great.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,760
還是你的想法更好
Or your thing.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,340
尼克
Hey, Nick, um...

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,770
我昨晚跟弗格森洗澡的時候
Last night when Furguson and I were in the shower,

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,930
我恍然大悟了
I had an epiphany.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,170
是時候回到現實了
It's time to get back in the game.

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,170
我該去見見女人
You know, meet some women.

12
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,070
人類的女人
Human women.

13
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
-人類  還有其他類的女人么  -女人
- Human? Is there any other kind? - Human.

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,160
我想今晚你能不能幫我照看弗格森
Anyway, I was wondering if you'd watch Furguson tonight

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,020
我想出去跟工作伙伴們喝幾杯
while I go out for some drinks with some work buddies.

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,250
就一會就好  你記得6點給他吃藥就行
Just for a little while. You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,900
-我們今晚要約會  -杰茜
- We're having date night tonight. - Jess...

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,200
溫斯頓要出去見女人了
Winston wants to go out to meet human women.

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,520
還不帶貓
Without the cat.

20
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,290
哦  這樣哦
Oh, yep, yep.

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,240
好的  好的  尼克會照看你的貓
Yep, yep. Nick will watch the cat.

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
有個問題  喂藥是從嘴喂還是從屁屁喂
Question, are those mouth pills or butt pills?

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,870
就一片藥
Just one pill.

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,380
從屁屁喂
Just one butt pill.

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,510
-給你  -不用了  我不想碰它
- Here you are. - Nah, I'm not touching that thing.

26
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,680
不想  好吧
No? Okay.

27
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,330
-謝了  哥們  -客氣
- Thanks, man. - Yeah. You got it.

28
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,180
你們今晚就在家了嗎
Hey, guys. Just hanging at home tonight?

29
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,680
不啊  我們要約會
No, actually, we have a date tonight.

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,250
我剛做了酥皮水果餡餅
'Cause I just made some cobbler.

31
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,200
桃子餡的
Some peach cobbler

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,740
我還弄了香草冰淇淋
and slow-churned vanilla bean ice cream,

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,660
今晚教練要約會希希
and Coach is asking Cece out on a date tonight, and...

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,780
誰想來一口嗎
does anybody want a bite of this, 'cause it's...?

35
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,980
剛出鍋的哦
It's fresh out of the oven.

36
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,830
燙爆了
It's piping hot!

37
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,900
但愿教練提前跟你打招呼了
Well, I hope Coach at least ran this by you first.

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,780
教練來找我了  很講義氣
Coach came over, he followed the bro code.

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,260
我們聊得挺好的
Actually went really well.

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,670
我正要找你呢
Yeah. Just the man I wanted to see.

41
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,090
-那正好  -是啊
- You found me. -Yeah, I did.

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,320
親  我有個問題問你
I got a question for you, playa.

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,760
放馬過來吧
Drop the bomb, man!

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,910
我能約希希去約會嗎
Can I ask Cece out on a date?

45
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,120
好啊  等等  你說什么
Yeah! Wait, what?

46
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,800
對希希是大好事啊  教練那么帥
Wait, that's so great for Cece. Coach is super hot.

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,830
最佳損友
Wrong crowd.

48
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,940
我看出來了
I see that now.

49
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,310
盡管如此  你已經跟希希吹了
Be that as it may, you blew it with Cece,

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,510
你應該不介意這事兒吧
so you have to be fine with this.

51
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,040
-我可以啊  -真的嗎
- I am. - You are?

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,890
-我絕對沒問題  -是嗎
- I promise I am. - You are?

53
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,670
-我百分之百沒事  -你沒事嗎
- 100% fine. - You're fine?

54
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,720
-我完全沒事的  -真的么
- Yeah, I'm absolutely fine. -Really?

55
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,170
這對希希好  對教練也好  皆大歡喜啊
It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach, it's good for America.

56
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,540
可能又弄出一個泰格伍茲呢
Who knows? We might even get another Tiger Woods out of this situation.

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,740
那多好啊
Wouldn't that be nice?

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,140
我可能就是想多了
I'm probably getting ahead of myself.

59
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,520
希希還不一定答應呢
Who knows if Cece will even say yes?

60
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,820
她答應了
She said yes!

61
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,460
我們今晚要去斯臺普斯中心看球
We're going to the Staples Center to watch a game tonight.

62
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,520
你確定你沒事嗎
Are you still... Are you cool with this?

63
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,650
只要你說出那個詞
I mean, 'cause all you have to do is say the word, man,

64
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,360
我一定收手
and I'll back off, for real.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,920
不啊
N... No, man.

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,860
加油  就約她
Come on. Date that thing.

67
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
-好啊  -多約幾次
- Yeah! All right! -Yeah! And then date it again.

68
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,830
-可不光是約個會  -約個一整晚哦
- It's not gonna date itself. - Yeah, date it all night long.

69
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,260
我有點緊張了
I'm kind of nervous!

70
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,960
沒錯  我緊張了
Yeah, I'm nervous.

71
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,490
我非常緊張
Yeah, I'm really nervous. Um...

72
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,740
她那么美  又超級酷
I mean, she's beautiful and she's super cool.

73
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,350
你簡直無法想象
And it's just, like... Like, you don't even know.

74
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,390
-我百分百知道  -沒錯  你知道
- I 100% know. - Yes, you kno... You know.

75
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,870
因為我  她都悔婚了
She stopped the wedding because of me, so I'm just saying.

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,540
然后我卻辜負了她  因為我自己的原因
And then I ruined it 'cause I had my own thing.

77
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,070
瑪麗亞跟我分手
Malia broke up with me and that kind of,

78
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,110
弄得我可不淡定了
like, threw my head for a loop,

79
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,650
-所以我現在可脆弱了  -別  別擔心
- so I'm super vulnerable right now. - Oh, wait. Don't-don't worry.

80
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,700
就好像  我也不知道
It's like... I don't know.

81
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,920
我覺得特沒安全感
Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,970
別這樣  你可是教練啊
Come on. You're Coach.

83
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,760
-你是獨一無二的教練  -沒錯
- You're the Coach. - Yeah.

84
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,790
你可是一流的  記住  你是一流的
You're the prize. Remember, you're the prize.

85
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,490
你是一流的
You're the prize.

86
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,180
我可是教練
I'm Coach!

87
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,250
沒錯  你可是教練
Yeah, you're Coach.

88
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,160
-那她可是手到擒來  -好吧
- She doesn't stand a chance! - Oh, yeah, well...

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,490
我要好好調教調教她
She's gonna get it good!

90
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,010
你其實可以不那么操之過急的
Yeah! Or you could take it slow!

91
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,310
-不  我要提槍上陣  -你要提槍上陣
- Nah, I'm gunning it! - Oh, oh! Y-You're gonna gun it.

92
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,740
-我要提槍上戰場  -你來真的嗎
- I am gunning it. Yes. - You're gonna gun it for real?

93
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,180
頭等艙的屁股今晚要坐在教練牌椅子上
That first-class ass is sitting in Coach tonight.

94
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,350
收起小桌板  哥要帶她起飛啦
And best believe, my seat will be in an upright and locked position.

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,020
謝了  施密特
Thanks, Schmidt.

96
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,260
弟兄們
Oh... boy.

97
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,400
他要提槍上陣了
He's gonna gun it.

98
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,360
不知道你們聽到沒
I don't know if you heard that,

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,900
但他說他要提槍上陣了
but he said he's going to gun it.

100
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,750
-他真的不像沒事  -在他說
- He's really not fine. - When he says,

101
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,850
"我沒事"的時候  他一定會有事的
"I'm fine," He's about to get un-fine.

102
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,400
施密特
Aw, Schmidters.

103
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,970
一定會有別的開放表演場有更堅固的凳子
There's gonna be other open mics with sturdier stools.

104
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,480
我沒事
I'm fine.

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,780
我知道你沒事
I know you're fine.

106
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,380
到時候他們就能見識到你的說唱水準
Then they'll see your rap skills. Then...

107
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,330
住手  你剛剛說你沒事的
Hey. Stop! You just said you were fine!

108
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,110
你剛剛說你沒事的
You just said you were fine!

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,200
讓我死吧
Let me die!

110
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,480
我了解施密特
I know Schmidt.

111
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,230
他會全力去破壞那場約會的
He's gonna try and stop that date from happening.

112
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,130
-好吧  -所以只能把他控制住
- Okay. - So the strategy is containment.

113
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,510
-好吧  -我們得把他鎖起來
- Okay. - Okay? We got to lock him up.

114
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,180
像對嬰兒一樣分散他的注意力
Distract him like a baby.

115
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,880
要是他不乖  我們就動用武力
If he gets out of line, we got to get physical.

116
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,310
我們要對嬰兒動武嗎
We're gonna get physical with a baby?

117
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,050
別質疑我  我可是專業的
Please don't question me. I'm a pro.

118
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,060
或者我們可以幫他走出來
Or we could help him move on.

119
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,260
帶他出去  讓他喝醉  沒準能遇上新歡呢
Take him out, get him drunk, maybe meet someone new?

120
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,020
不  我們得把他關在安全的地方
No. We just got to keep him in a safe place.

121
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,910
真希望我弄到了那狗籠
I wish I had that dog cage.

122
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,210
-搞沒搞錯  -看到有狗籠賣你就買一個
- What? - When you see a dog cage for sale, you buy it.

123
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,270
杰茜  今晚又泡湯了  真的很對不起
Hey, Jess, about tonight, I'm so sorry.

124
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,950
沒事的沒事的
Yeah. No, it's okay.

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,610
要約會的話可以等我嫁...
We'll have date night when we're marrie...

126
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,800
-個烏哎  乖乖隆個咚  -你剛剛是說
- da, burp a durp a durp. - What did you just...

127
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,500
假日  等到圣誕假日的時候
Merry. When we're very merry Christmas.

128
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,790
算了不管了
All right, moving on.

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,830
我仔細想了想教練和希希
I'm having second thoughts about Coach and Cece.

130
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,250
也許我該阻止他們約會
Maybe I should stop their date.

131
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,930
變聰明了
Smarten up!

132
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,190
謝謝你
Thank you. Um...

133
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,480
你弄到那個狗籠了嗎
did you get a chance to get that, uh... the dog cage?

134
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,460
-沒  我覺得這不好  -你沒弄到嗎
- No. I feel bad. - You didn't?

135
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,240
-那是個辦法  -我知道
- That was the solution. - I know it was.

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,080
是的  杰茜  我剛剛打電話給他了
Yeah, Jess, so I j... I just... I just buzzed him up.

137
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,050
我  他約我出去  我答應了
I... He asked me out on a date, and I said yes.

138
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
反正我們倆都剛剛分手
We're both going through a breakup right now,

139
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,870
這挺好的  不是嗎
which is good, right?

140
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,780
沒錯
Totally.

141
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,310
提槍上陣
Gun it. You gun it!

142
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,760
他到啦
He's here.

143
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,810
頂多跟他親親抱抱
Don't go past second base.

144
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,140
好的  拜拜
Okay. Bye.

145
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,170
你看上去...  真美
Wow. Uh, y-you look... amazing.

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
你看上去...
You look...

147
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,370
太美了
This.

148
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,080
我舉大拇指因為你看上去...
I give you this 'cause you look...

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,770
這個  這個和這個
This, this and this.

150
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,310
全都送給你  不  這樣不大好...
I'll give you all these. No. Not...

151
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,880
我...  能去看球我好激動
I'm, uh... I'm really excited about the game.

152
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,790
好耶
Yeah!

153
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,360
很好  很好
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,860
我去拿包
I'm gonna go get my purse.

155
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,090
看看你自己
Look at you!

156
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,770
你是最棒的  你是最棒的
You're the prize! You're the prize!

157
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,070
振作起來
Get it together.

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,730
你好嗎
Hey. What's up, man?

159
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,190
咋樣  咋樣  咋樣
That's what's up, that's what's up, that's what's up.

160
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,200
真的很謝謝你們陪我
Really appreciate this, guys.

161
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,860
你們餓了嗎
Are you guys hungry?

162
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,900
-一直很餓  -沒錯
- Always. - Yeah.

163
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,530
太好了  我去斯臺普斯中心買點吃的
Great. I'm gonna go get some food from the Staples Center.

164
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,530
位于洛杉磯中心城區的多功能體育中心

165
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,550
放松  冷靜點
Hey, easy. Chill out.

166
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,030
你是對的  你是對的  明智的決定
You're right, you're right. Great call.

167
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,150
你好  溫斯頓
Hey, Winston.

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,900
你怎么啦
Hey. What happened to you?

169
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,000
我以為你去派對了
I thought you were supposed to go to a party.

170
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,640
是啊  時間久得
Yeah, it's been so long

171
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
我都忘了該如何與女士聊天了
that I think I forgot how to talk to women.

172
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,560
你從未好奇過這里是否有人殺過人嗎
You ever wonder if someone in here has killed someone?

173
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,540
弗格森是他的名字  沒錯  他是我的貓
Furguson is his name. Yeah, he's my cat.

174
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,940
你看他戴著牛仔帽
Here's him in a cowboy hat.

175
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,420
天吶  親愛的  你的腳是有多大啊
Good Lord, darling, how big are your feet?

176
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,310
你知道嗎  沒關系
You know what? It's fine.

177
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,630
我可以獨自過一生
I'll be alone my whole life.

178
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,000
漢克·阿倫每次全壘打時也是一個人
You know, Hank Aaron was alone for every home run he hit.

179
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,600
只要還有弗格森陪著我
As long as I got Furguson.

180
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,490
說到這  我的貓呢
Speaking of which, where is that cat?

181
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,650
弗格森
Furguson!

182
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,280
這就奇怪了  我一叫他就會過來的
That's strange. He usually comes when I call him.

183
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,010
尼克  你是不是忘了關窗戶
Nick, you left the window open?

184
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,320
天吶  這下完了
Oh, my God. No.

185
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
-尼克  -什么事
- Nick! - What?

186
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
他一直想要踢開窗戶去抓鴿子的
You know he always trying to kick it with those pigeons.

187
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,480
尼克  是你放跑他的
Nick, you let him out.

188
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,100
我不是有意的  只是不小心打開了窗戶
I did... I didn't mean to. I just opened the window.

189
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,430
兄弟  我就拜托你一件事
Man, I asked you to do one thing!

190
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,560
-溫斯頓  我很抱歉  -這是你的錯
- Winston, I'm really sorry. - This is your fault, man!

191
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,780
我很內疚  溫斯頓
I feel terrible, Winston.

192
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
你得幫我找回他
You're gonna help me find him!

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,850
溫斯頓  別走啊  溫斯頓...
Winston, don't leave... Winston...

194
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,930
好吧  我來了  兄弟
Okay, I'm coming, buddy.

195
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,440
杰茜  不好意思  你得
Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna

196
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,200
-留下來看著施密特  -不
- have to stay here and keep an eye on Schmidt. - No.

197
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,530
你不能留我跟他單獨在一起
You can't leave me here with him.

198
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,060
沒錯  她說得對
No, she's right.

199
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,740
你可不能這么做  萬一我失控了呢
You can't do that. What if it gets rough?

200
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,190
尼克  我能感覺到他正在水深火熱之中
Nick, he is in pain. I can feel it.

201
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,140
-你走試試看  -留下來
- Don't you go! - Stay!

202
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,310
我好怕怕  哥們
I am so scared, man!

203
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,580
那你想要我怎么做  杰茜
What do you want me to do, Jess?

204
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,320
-留下  -你敢走試試看  -別吵啦
- Stay. - Don't you dare go. - Everybody settle!

205
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,900
這是我的錯  溫斯頓  我跟你一起去
Look, this is my fault. Winston, I'm coming with you.

206
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,340
好的
Okay.

207
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,040
施密特  振作起來吧
Schmidt, just get it together.

208
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,730
杰茜  我很抱歉  你在這看好他
Jess, I'm sorry. Just keep him here

209
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,960
將他的注意力從約會上移開  我得走了
and keep his mind off the date. I got to go.

210
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,190
抱歉啊
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,020
我們走
We got to go.

212
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,720
去找那只該死的貓吧
Let's find that damn cat!

213
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,410
你覺得教練和希希現在正在做什么
What do you think Coach and Cece are doing right now?

214
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,600
-我可不知道  -他們可能已經坐下來
- I don't know. - They probably just sat down.

215
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,480
第一次互相摸大腿了
Touching thighs for the first time.

216
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,880
-我要去阻止他們的約會  -不
- I'm gonna go stop that date! - No!

217
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,340
你就這么一點點本事嗎
Is that literally all you have?

218
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,790
天吶  我們完蛋了
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

219
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,140
-尼克  -尼克
- Nick! - Nick!

220
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,630
想想看
Uh, think.

221
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,090
教練給我留了破綻
Coach gave me an out.

222
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,500
他說  "只要你說出那個詞  我就收手"
He said, "Just say the word and it's off."

223
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,110
不管了  我要去說出那個詞
And you know what? I'm just gonna say the word.

224
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,620
不要  別這樣
No! No!

225
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,520
你去打電話  你去跟他說
You call, you say the word.

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,830
不  施密特
No, Schmidt!

227
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
天吶  你不能這樣對希希
God, you can't do that to Cece.

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,460
她剛跨過你這道坎
She's just starting to move on.

229
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,270
我們只要熬過今晚就好了
All we have to do is get through the night.

230
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,950
只要熬過今晚就好
Just get through the night.

231
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,310
你只要不去想她就好
Just have to get your mind off her.

232
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,780
你想先做什么
What do you want to start with?

233
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,590
Play it now

234
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,210
Play it now, my baby

235
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,750
Cracklin' Rosie, get on by

236
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,020
你這是  這是干嘛
What's- what's happening?

237
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,610
也許你不該穿鞋子跳  我也不知道
Maybe just go no shoes. I don't know.

238
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,920
這是十年級的時候  所以
Okay, and this one's tenth grade, so...

239
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,050
這個是伊萬·G寫的
This one's from Evan G.

240
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,930
伊萬·G是水球隊的隊長
Evan G. Was the captain of the water polo team.

241
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,320
"你好呀杰茜  我們都喜歡午餐"
"Hey, Jess, we both like lunch."

242
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,590
這倒是事實
That's true.

243
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,290
靠過來一點  兄弟
Oh, lean in... aw, dude...

244
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,260
Play it now, play it now

245
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,550
My baby

246
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,010
Cracklin' Rosie, get on board

247
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,340
《律師本色》劇情

248
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,180
卡穆琳·曼海姆給一個被狂歡節小丑騷擾的女人
Camryn Manheim represents a woman who was heckled

249
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,340
做代表  然后迪倫·麥克德莫特說...
by a carnival clown, and Dylan McDermott says...

250
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,140
-我沒法不想希希  -行
- I can't stop thinking about Cece! - Okay!

251
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
尼克還說這有用呢  坐下
Nick said this would work. Sit down.

252
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,660
-別想希希了  -我坐下了
- Stop thinking about Cece. - I'm gonna sit down.

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,070
你看這皮革
Look at this leather.

254
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,580
它是褐色的  這么的光滑
It's so smooth, brown.

255
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,840
就像希希一樣
It's just like Cece.

256
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,340
這樣說真奇怪
That's weird.

257
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,240
你說得對  我該躺一會兒
You're right. I'm just gonna lay down for a little bit.

258
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,380
好的
Okay.

259
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,110
這感覺太棒了
Oh, yeah, this feels good.

260
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,470
行了
Okay.

261
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,290
你在做什么  施密特
What are you doing, Schmidt?

262
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,950
-什么都沒做  你走吧  -不不不

-你走吧  -好的
- Just go away. - Okay...

264
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,690
施密特  聽我說
Schmidt, hey.

265
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
不行  我得把你弄出去
No! We're getting you out of here,

266
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,940
我們再給你找一個妹子  好嗎
and we're gonna get you a new woman, okay?

267
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,610
尼克說了要待在家里
Nick said to stay home.

268
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,530
尼克不會什么都知道的  施密特
Well, Nick doesn't know everything, Schmidt.

269
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,420
別這樣了  這太惡心人了
And please stop this. This is so disgusting.

270
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,530
我都沒法直視你了
I can't even look at you.

271
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,390
這太惡心了  你這樣很奇怪
Come on, this is gross. This is getting really weird.

272
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,460
拜托  讓我再親一口
Please! Just one more kiss!

273
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,980
你親的是家具  蠢貨
No, you're kissing a sectional, you dummy!

274
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,100
好吧
All right.

275
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,730
這樣是對的  你做得對
That was the right move. You did good.

276
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,490
弗格森  弗格森
Furguson! Furguson!

277
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,490
弗格森
Furguson!

278
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,310
快回來  兄弟
Come here, buddy!

279
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,920
快來啊  你這個小壞蛋
Come on, you little son of a bitch!

280
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,420
我們應該再圍著公園轉一圈
We should do another lap around the park.

281
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,930
我猜現在那些玩飛碟的小破孩應該走了
I bet those mean-ass kids playing Frisbee are gone by now.

282
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,990
溫斯頓  我們所有地方都找過了
Winston... we've looked everywhere.

283
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,670
你要干...  溫斯頓
What are you do...? Winston.

284
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,910
該死
Damn it!

285
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,970
我真不該去那個派對的
I should've never gone to that party.

286
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,780
不  派對是個好東西
Nah, the party was a good thing.

287
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,610
-你應該多參加點派對  -真的嗎
- You should go to more parties. - Really?

288
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,310
我被  我也不知道
I got shot down by, I don't know,

289
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,970
16個女人拒絕了
16 or so different women.

290
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,330
然后我回家來卻發現
And then I come home to find out

291
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,900
你弄丟了我最好的朋友
that you have misplaced my best friend.

292
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,770
-弗格森變成你最好的朋友了  -對
- Furguson's your best friend now? - Yes!

293
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,040
你知道自己在說什么嗎
Would you listen to yourself?

294
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,510
太可悲了
This is pathetic.

295
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,000
"可悲"有點太嚴重了
"Pathetic" is harsh.

296
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,570
我不是...
I didn't mean...

297
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,910
朋友才不會說朋友可悲呢
Friends don't call friends pathetic.

298
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,000
如果朋友和貓洗澡
Well, what do friends do

299
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,010
他的朋友該說什么呢
when their other friend is taking a shower with a cat?

300
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,650
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,860
我收到一條短信
I just got a text.

302
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,800
有人找到他了
Somebody found him.

303
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,370
真的嗎
No way!

304
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,420
-對  -弗格森
- Yes. - Furguson?

305
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,350
對  別拍手
Yes! Don't do that at all.

306
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,040
如果貓還活著  我們就和解了
If that cat's alive, we're made up.

307
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,370
你喜歡那貨嗎
How you liking that merch?

308

310
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,960
沒錯  沒錯
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,580
想吃咸味脆餅吧
You want a pretzel?

312
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,160
不用了  這樣很好  謝謝
No, I'm-I'm fine, thanks.

313
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,150
剛才不是提問  帥哥
It wasn't a question. Hey, yo, slice!

314
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,150
給我來七個熱乎的
Let me get about seven of them hot things!

315
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,690
你怕我沒錢嗎
You worried about the money?

316
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,240
沒問題  我有錢  寶貝
It's cool, I got it, babe.

317
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,130
教練今年收成好
Coach had a good year today.

318
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,390
好吧  我同意跟你約會的時候
Yeah, when I-I agreed to go out with you,

319
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,180
可沒想到這種事
this isn't exactly what I expected.

320
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,680
我知道  大家都這么說  大家都這么說
I know, I hear that a lot, I hear that a lot.

321
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,700
看這個
Ha-ha! Look at that.

322
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,260
教練收到好多短信啊
Coach is blowing up.

323
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,820

我沒法跟這些人渣瞎混
I can't mingle with this trash.

327

曾經滄海難為水
I've been to the mountaintop.

328

好了  聽著  看著我
Okay, look. Look at me.

329
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,650
你要向前看  原來那個施密特哪去了
You are moving on. Now, where's the old Schmidt?

330
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,600
我剛搬來的時候  你可是來者不拒的
When I moved into the loft, you used to pull so many ladies.

331
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,830
你從前就是個傳奇
You were legendary.

332
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,350
那時  颶風施密特無堅不摧
That year, uh, Hurricane Schmidt did-did demolish

333
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,360
-橫掃很多海灘社團  -對
- a number of beach communities. - Right.

334

好了  咱們去跟那邊那個姑娘聊聊
All right, we're gonna go talk to this girl over here.

335
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,330
她還在用翻蓋手機  杰茜
She's on a flip phone, Jess.

336
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,770
她要么很窮  要么就是穿越了
I mean, she's either poor or a time traveler.

337
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,210
你好  這是我的朋友施密特
Hi! This is my friend Schmidt.

338
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,390
他又可愛又聰明
And he's sweet and he's smart.

339
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,010
他的工作我不太懂
And he has a job that I don't really understand,

340
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,150
但是薪水應該很高
but seems to pay him well.

341
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,550
-施密特  坐下  -好

聽我說  你是個美麗的女人
Look, you're a beautiful woman.

344
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,140
換種活法  我們肯定會成情人  但是
In another life, we certainly would've been lovers, but...

348
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,600
-你真可憐...  -請別打斷我
- Oh, you poor thing... - Please don't interrupt me.

349
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,460
看到那邊那個一直偷瞟的女人嗎
Now, do you see that bug-eyed woman over there?

350
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,440
我得把她甩開
I need to ditch her

351
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
這樣我才能實現自己的命運
so that I can go fulfill my destiny.

352
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,470
她看別處的時候跟我說一聲
Now, tell me when she looks away.

353
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,300
正在看我們
Not now.

354
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,240
還不行  稍等
Not now. Wait.

355
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,300
就現在
Now.

356
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,370
只可惜相遇太晚
What might've been.

357
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,640
施密特  站住
Hey, Schmidt! No!

358
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,810
你猜他會變成什么樣
What do you think he's gonna look like?

359
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,690
我也不知道  我只想帶他回去
I don't know, I wanna get him back.

360

弗格森  我想死你了  小伙伴
Furguson, I missed you so much, little buddy.

365

他倆心有靈犀
They're very connected, those two.

366
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,230
我懂  我自己也養了一頭野獸
I can relate. Got a beast of my own.

367
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,750
霍金親  醒醒

尼克  你知道松鼠長什么樣子
Nick, you know what a squirrel looks like.

371

你去過戶外  哥們

372
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,610
我在努力辨別它的氣味
Trying to just figure out the smell, I guess.

373
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,820
這家伙最聽話了
This guy's the best.

374
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,610
我寧愿和他一起在家看實習醫生格蕾
I'd rather stay home and watch Grey's with him

375
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,080
也不愿去酒吧

我也對女人沒興趣了
I am so done chasing women.

380
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,130
那真是太糟了
That's too bad.

381
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,930
太可惜了
Yeah, it's too bad.

382
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,840
你們餓嗎

那你有杯裝的布丁嗎

我的杯子從來不裝布丁

389

是嗎
No.

390
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,110
她這么說是好事還是壞事
Is that a good thing or a bad thing that she doesn't?

391

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,840
我要三個甜牛奶巧克力
I will take three of the, ooh, the dulce de leches.

405
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,540
再來點焦糖的
How about some caramels?

406
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,070
你們有沒有能代表"抱歉我出軌了
Do you have anything that says "I'm sorry for cheating on you.

407
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,600
請不要和我朋友上床"的品種
Please don't sleep with my friend"?

408
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,360
當然沒有  很好
Of course you don't. Wonderful.

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,890
看這些試吃品
Ooh, look at that-- samples.

410
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,730
你和誰短信呢
Wha...? Who are you texting right now?

411
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,320
你說什么呢
Uh, wh-what are you talking about?

412
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
我沒在發短信  我只是...
I'm not texting. I was just, uh...

413
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,020
你此時此刻就在發短信
You're texting right now.

414
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,770
不  我只是...
Nah, I'm just, uh...

415
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,700
無論你在和誰發
Okay, you know what? Whoever you are texting,

416
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,730
如果你想和他們一起的話
if you want to be with them,

417
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,780
你應該走開去和他們一起
you should just go off and be with them.

418
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,530
你真愛吃醋
You're so jealous.

419
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,870
好吧  老娘夠了
Okay, yeah, you know what-- that's it!

420
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,810
老娘不伺候了
That is the last straw!

421
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,950
拜拜您那
I'm out of here.

422
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,290
希希...
Cece...

423
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,970
伯蒂  你一直是巴士司機嗎
So, Bertie, have you always been a bus driver?

424
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,400
我之前管理一家鞋店
I used to manage a shoe store.

425
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,980
后來  我辭職了
Then I, uh, quit,

426
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,430
有過幾年黑暗的生活
had a few dark years.

427
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,350
-賣過一陣基督徒的T恤  -好吧
- Sold Christian T-shirts for a while. - Okay.

428
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,660
我把輸卵管結扎了  可不便宜
Got my tubes tied. Not cheap.

429
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,240
-這談話真透明  -閉嘴  尼克
- This is a real honest conversation. - Shut up, Nick.

430
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,810
重新振作起來  煥然一新
Pulled myself out of that personal hell, and... voila.

431
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,630
-哇  -我喜歡
- Wow. - You know,

432
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,210
駕駛巴士
I like driving a bus.

433
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,430
可以在儀表盤上放我喜歡的東西
Get to put whatever I want on the dash.

434
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,210
驅走黑暗
Keeps the darkness away.

435
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,120
你明白嗎
You know?

436
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,060
我還...
I also, uh...

437
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,780
我在畫畫
I paint.

438
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,080
你喜歡畫畫
You paint?

439
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,600
那是艘船
It's a boat.

440
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,650
我能看出來那是條船
Oh, I can see it's a boat.

441
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,270
好吧
All right, well, uh...

442
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,200
我最好把胃藥吃了
I better take my stomach medicine.

443
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
我三點半就得起床
I got to get up at 3:30.

444
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,850
-早上嗎  -我是開公交車的
- Is that a.m.? - I drive a bus.

445
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,900
你就不能閉嘴吃你的破三明治嗎  尼克
Will you eat your damn sandwich, Nick.

446
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,420
我不愛吃這個
I don't like it.

447
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,210
你呢  溫斯頓  你喜歡吃嗎
What about you, Winston? Do you like it?

448
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,900
我不會對你撒謊的  伯蒂
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bertie.

449
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,990
有的地方確實硬得咬不動
Sometimes it was a little hard to chew.

450
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,990
你可以吸一吸讓它變軟點
Well... you can suck on it to make it soft.

451
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,520
你們倆是擦出火花了嗎
Wow. Is something happening between you two?

452
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,610
-伙計  她太真實了  -很好
- Dude, she is so real. - Okay, good.

453
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,700
你能幫我一把嗎  你知道你欠我的
Would you do me a favor? Now, you owe me.

454
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,250
溫斯頓  我樂意之極  任你差遣
Winston, I would love to. Anything.

455
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,390
說真的  任你差遣
I mean it. Anything.

456
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,020
-那好  -我欠你的
- Okay. - I owe you.

457
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,500
我需要你...
I need you...

458
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,550
今晚幫我把弗格森帶回家
...to take Furguson home tonight for me

459
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,610
而我就留在這了
while I just stay here and,

460
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,850
你懂的  碰碰運氣
you know, see where this goes.

461
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,670
沒問題  這可是重要的一刻
Yes. This is a big moment.

462
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,690
-是啊  -我為你驕傲
- Yeah. - I'm proud of you.

463
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,890
聽著  弗格森  我要做成年人該做的事了
Listen, Furguson, I'm about to do what adults do.

464
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,040
-祝我好運吧  -別嘰歪了
- Hey, wish me luck. - I think that's enough.

465
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,130
-祝我好運  -這只貓可太肥了
- Wish me luck. - Oh, this is a fat cat.

466
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,100
這決定有點唐突  要不我...
It's a tough decision. Do I...?

467
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,650
我還是走吧
I'll just leave...

468
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,160
-呆著吧  你給我呆著  -好的
- Stay here, stay here. - Okay. Yeah!

469
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,620
希希  等等  請等一下
Cece, wait! Please wait!

470
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,200
我是在和我媽媽發短信
I was texting my mom!

471
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,580
-蠢貨  -閉嘴
- Dork. - Shut up!

472
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,970
拜托了
Oh, come on!

473
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,530
你真覺得我會相信你
Do you really expect me to believe that?

474
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,790
不  我保證...  我  我媽媽
No. I-I promise... I... My mom--

475
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,610
她和我發短信是因為我...
she was texting me because I was...

476
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,310
因為我太緊張這次約會了
I was super nervous about this date.

477
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,180
-你媽媽  -你看
- Your mom? - Look.

478
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,060
拿下她們  寶寶
"Go get 'em, Booboo"?

479
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,150
那個指的是我  我是寶寶
That's me. I'm Booboo.

480
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,220
為什么你跟我說話
Why do you need inspirational quotes

481
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,430
還需要你媽媽的勵志名言
from your mom just to talk to me?

482
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,850
對不起  我...
I'm sorry. I...

483
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,790
我只是  我剛從一段戀情中走出來
I'm just... I'm coming out of this relationship,

484
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,610
然后有點...  我只是...
and, like... I just...

485
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,720
我不知道  我覺得我不知道怎么...
I don't know. I feel I don't know how to...

486
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,410
我不知道該怎么從頭再來了
I don't know how to do this anymore.

487
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,950
我明白你的感覺
I know how you feel.

488
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,040
你明白
You do?

489
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,940
是的
Yeah.

490
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,720
現在我就想給咱倆買幾杯酒喝
I just want to buy us some drinking

491
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,870
然后開始對你上下其手  妹子
and get up on you, girl.

492
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,930
你看  你又開始胡言亂語了
You see, you're doing it again.

493
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,310
見鬼  我知道
Damn it! I know.

494
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,660
對不起
Sorry.

495
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,640
斯密特
Hey! Schmidt!

496
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,940
斯密特  你在干什么
Schmidt, what are you doing?!

497
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,450
你拿著那么多巧克力干嗎
Why do you have all that chocolate?

498
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,120
我要去把她贏回來
I'm going to go win her back!

499
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,010
你知道我在哪能買到漂亮的蠟燭嗎
Do you know where I can get a pretty candle?!

500
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,030
別這樣  斯密特  到車上來
No. Come on, Schmidt, get in the car.

501
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,450
上車吧
Get in the car.

502
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,990
我愛她  杰茜
I love her, Jess.

503
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,430
我必須要告訴她
I have to tell her.

504
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
你不能
Well, you can't.

505
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,680
你必須放她走
You have to let her go.

506
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,670
我知道
I know.

507
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,080
你說的對  我知道
Look, you're right. I know.

508
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,620
那很好  來吧  上車吧
Okay, good. Come on, get back in the car.

509
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,120
我還知道用不了30秒
I also know that in about 30 seconds,

510
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,190
我會再次從你眼前逃跑
I'm gonna run away from you again,

511
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,750
而且這一次  我會甩掉你
and this time, I will lose you.

512
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,160
我會順著小巷子  穿過公園
I'll go down alleys, I'll cut across parks.

513
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,610
我會在各種影子里  潛行  躲藏
I will live in the shadows, just slithering, lurking,

514
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,320
穿梭于黑暗之中
trolling the darkness.

515
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,410
杰茜  你只有一種辦法阻止我
Jess, there's only one way for you to stop me.

516
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,410
無論是什么  我都會做
Well, I'll do it, whatever it is.

517
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,370
開你的車撞我
Hit me with your car.

518
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,960
什么  不  不
What?! No! No!

519
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,690
那是你阻止我的唯一辦法
It's the only way for you to stop me!

520
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,800
不  那太瘋狂了  施密特
No! That's crazy, Schmidt!

521
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,950
快  杰茜  就現在  我是活該
Come on, Jess. Now, do it! I deserve it.

522
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,120
我背叛了你最好的朋友
I cheated on your best friend,

523
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,840
我試圖讓你和尼克分開
I tried to break up you and Nick.

524
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,540
-踩油門  -不
- Hit the gas. - No! No!

525
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,260
杰茜  要么你這么做  要么我就跑了
Jess, you do this, or I'm gonna run.

526
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,620
-我不想這么做  -我數三下
- I don't want to! - I'm gonna give you to the count of three.

527
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,120
-不  我不想  施密特 -三
- No, I don't want to! Schmidt! - Three.

528
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,310
二  為了希希
Two. Do it for Cece.

529
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,130
我的上帝
Oh, my God!

530
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,900
那算什么意思
What the hell was that?!

531
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,880
你讓我開車撞你
You told me to hit you with the car!

532
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,370
-你個該死的竟然開車撞我  -你讓我撞的
- You friggin' just hit me with your vehicle! - You asked me to.

533
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,930
我沒想到你真的會那么干
I didn't think you were really gonna do it.

534
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,920
我就是輕輕碰了你一下
I barely tapped you.

535
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,350
這是我最喜歡的卡其布休閑褲
This is my favorite utility khaki!

536
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,190
那就別在你不想讓我開車撞你的時候
Well, then don't tell me to hit you with my car

537
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,050
跟我說讓我開車撞你
if you don't want me to hit you with my car!
