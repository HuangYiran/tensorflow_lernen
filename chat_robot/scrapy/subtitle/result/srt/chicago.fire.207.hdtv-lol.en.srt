1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,210
I need to be assured thatthis means that 51 is safe.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,110
Yes,it does.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,750
Previously on chicago fire.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,170
I didn't campaign for your job,wally.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm giving up my job to save 51.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,140
I'm benny's wife.The boys miss him.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,820
He hasn't been home in months.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,420
They need to see their father.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,910
I saw your name on the applicant list.

10
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,210
I was in a bad place,man.

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,800
You'd make a hell of a cop though.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,420
My wife moved out back in august.

13
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,560
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah,what are you gonna do?

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,760
This is torture.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,650
The point is,they talkabout you all the time.They miss you.

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,720
I think i know what you're going through.

17
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,970
You can twist yourself up inknots trying to understand it,

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,570
But ultimately i don't thinkit's for us to figure out.

19
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,140
There's a protein in ourblood called osteopontin.

20
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,280
- Your levels are higher than expected.
- Meaning what?

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,470
Sometimes it's an indicatorfor asbestos poisoning.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,560
The scans will be read by a radiologist,

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,900
And they'll get backto you with the results.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,890
I thought the results were instant.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,130
Let's see,you're beingscreened for lung cancer.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,890
I'm sure someone willlet you know by tomorrow.

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,280
Go long,go long.

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,930
Touchdown.

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,710
Broken glass,flag on play.

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,840
No way.That was a touchdown.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,210
Of course it was.

32
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,970
Should i come back later,or.

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,260
Nope,we were just,uh,cleaning.

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,410
Yeah,just dusting.

35
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,790
Why do you need afootball to help you clean?

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,220
Busted.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,180
My house.I decide who's busted,all right?

38
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,330
Ben,i'm sorry.

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,160
Wait,hold on.Give me a look.

40
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,720
Maybe it's time g.i.joe goes into retirement.

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,390
- No!
- Wait,wait,okay,okay.

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,830
listen,gabby sees thiskind of thing every day.

43
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,170
If you guys can do the dishes,then she'll get himback into fighting shape.

44
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you say?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,170
Okay.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,550
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

47
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,710

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,670
Ii just wanted to know if you were aware that he has a wife and kids.

50
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,070
Yeah,of course i do. I.Who are you?

51
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,810
So it doesn't bother youbreaking up a family and.

52
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,890
Wait,wait,wait,do youthink i'm dating benny?

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,690
To be generous,yeah.

54
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm his daughter,katie.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,500
You three make quite a crew.

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,340
Yeah.

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,440
Which reminds me.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,490
A cabin on lake carroll,

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,660
two days pulling largemouthout of crystal clear water.

60
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,650
man,they're going to love that.

61
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,020
So will you.

62
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,870
Yes,i will.

63
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,190
Matt,i have some news.

64
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,800
Boys,i'm coming home.

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
- What,really?
- yeah

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Mom's coming home!

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,890
Because of overcrowding,they're letting me out early.

68
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,180
I told you she'd come back.

69
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,130
Mom's coming home!Mom's coming home!

70
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,090
Mom's coming home!

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,910
I told you she'd come back.

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,110
Mom's coming home!

73
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,640
Your wife beth came to see me.

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,070
Yeah,well,she's got a flairfor the dramatic,that woman.

75
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,170
Now you understand why it'sbest i give her some space.

76
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,620
Always the martyr.

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,300
Hold on,you don't know the whole story.

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,130
And i never do.

79
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,950
It's like i didn't know the story of my 21yearold sister.

80
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,120
Yeah,i talked to her.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,210
21 years old,

82
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,340
which is exactly how long ago you left meAnd mom to fend for ourselves.

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,740
Tell me this.Do youeven know who her mom is?

84
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,980
Of course i do.

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,620
And have you been takingcare of her all these years?

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,470
How could i?I just metkatie when i got to town.

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,350
You're unbelievable.

88
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,680
Yeah,well,alert the press.

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,590
I had some issues when i was younger.

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,050
But don't forget,i'm comingout of a happy retirement

91
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,080
To save your dysfunctional firehouse.

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
That's an excuse!

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,670
You're just running from another family,leaving the kids with the bill.

herrmann,lieutenanttests are coming up.

98
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,990
How many times you take that thing?

99
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,530
Capp,really?

100
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,310
You mean how many times did i fail it?

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,540
The answer is three,but not since the '90s.

102
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,380
Five kids is all theaggravation that i need.

103
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,540
I know my place.

104
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,820
Lady in the house.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,350
Mama!

106
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,050
Now here's a sight i love to see.

107
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,310
What,me or the groceries?

108
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,480
There's more in the car.

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,660
- You got it.
- Guys.

110
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,230
Baby,how are you?

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,140
Wallace,hi.

112
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,160
I will help with the rest of the groceries.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,810
chief,you have a call.

114
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm no foodie per se,

115
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,790
But having two millses in the kitchen bodes well for lunch?

116
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,070
I thought mcleod burnedall of our old logbooks in the town square.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,310
What year you got there?

118
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,430
'85.

119
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't suppose you'rejust cruising memory lane.

120
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,750
Factory fire on haskell,high heat,

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,270
asbestos falling like snow.

122
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,030
No masks back then.

123
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,710
Three of these men are dead.

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,430
Lung cancer.

125
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,770
severide,roll call's in five minutes.Where's shay?

126
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,990
I don't know,dawson.

127
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,610
I'm not her babysitter.

128
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,010
Yeah,well,someone needs to be.

129
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,960
Looks like the engine is losing water.

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,630
A couple of seals are cracked.

131
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,130
We put in a request,

132
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,720
and the wizard said it'sgoing to be a couple of weeks.

133
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,330
You sure we've got that long?

134
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,120
Excuse me.

135
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm looking for jeff clarke.

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,120
Yeah. Who should i say is,

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
his wife.

138
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,300
Yeah.

139
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,460
- Something wrong?
- Just slow down for a second.

140
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,340
I'm here in peace.

141
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,590
What do you want,lisa?

142
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,750
To talk to you.

143
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,250
I've been going to a group.

144
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,410
Good for you.

145
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,120
It's a place to hearother people's stories,

146
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,000
To connect and find outwhat's going on in your head.

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,570
Here's what's going on inside my head.

148
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,190
A month after i got back,you were sleeping at your sister's house.

149
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,840
When i needed you most,you left.

150
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,790
Jeff,you treated melike the day's garbage.Worse.

151
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,660
Is that what they tell you in that group?

152
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,710
You left me,lisa.

153
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,590
I did.

154
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,150
And i'm sorry,okay?

155
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm here to say i'm sorry.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,230
- Wish it was that easy.
- It could be if you'd let it.

157
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,230
Let's just spend some time together.

158
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,490
I got to get back.

159
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,660
Okay,see you later.

160
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,560
Look,before you start with the heavy breathing,i know.

161
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm more than happy to get a reliever.

162
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,350
I'm good. I'm good.

163
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,370
Ijust got a lot going on.

Everyone in this room hashandled the various intrusions

And that is why 51 is still going strong.

It's your commitment to the house

170
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,810
That allows me in good conscience to announce

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,070
We got to get water on that tanker now!

328
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,990
Herrmann,you got this?

329
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,260
Got it,lieutenant.

330
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,290
Let's go,move those lines!

331
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,050
Cool that propane!

332
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,320
Give me one line on the firewith two sheeting off the top.

333
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,850
We got to keep this rig cool!

334
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,290
Anna!

335
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,470
Anna?

336
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,990
Severide,how many still trapped?

337
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,620
There's less than tenstill in the warehouse

338
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,510
But a bunch more stillin the passenger car.

339
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,220
sir,you need to get backin your car and drive away.

340
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,970
It's tempting,but you lookto be about ten hands short of what you need.

341
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,090
David arata,chief of trauma lakeshore.

342
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,350
Okay,yeah,you'll do.

343
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,140
What's your head count?

344
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,390
we're at 30 so far,but we got more coming in.

345
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,280
Sir,move that man to the black tarp.

346
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,580
No,wait.We haven't assessed him yet.

347
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,750
Unless you have plasma,which you don't,he's dead.

348
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,860
I need any injured who canstill walk to keep walking.

349
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,330
We need space to work.

350
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,440
Let's go.

351
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,550
Sheet off the top.

352
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,630
Hit it from the other side!

353
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,430
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

354
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,020
What the hell is that?

355
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,760
The pressure relief valve's venting.

356
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,600
Without it,this thing's blowing sky high!

357
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
You better get these attack lines back.

358
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,830
We're going defensive!Go back.

359
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,510
Come on!

360
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,340
Back here.Something's wrong.

361
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,980
He was wrapping my legthen he just fell back.

362
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,050
Come on,westin.

363
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,340
What's wrong,marine?

364
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,510
You've never seen a little bruise before?

365
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,670
You,of all people,shouldknow how serious this is.

366
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,850
You,of all people,know that no army medic walks out on the wounded.

367
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,570
Severide,help me out.

368
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay,hold on.

369
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,540
You're gonna be okay.

370
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
Damn it.

371
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,010
Something wrong?

372
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,860
- No.
- Good.

373
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,660
Head down,task at hand.

374
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,390
Okay.

375
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,460
Anna!

376
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,260
This candle ever gonna go out?

377
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,360
That propane's got to go someplace.

378
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,660
If it goes out,then we got to worry.

379
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,070
Chief,pressure's falling on the pumper.

380
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,760
- Floor it.
- I think the seal's going bad.

381
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,070
We're losing pressure.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,210
Son of a bitch.

383
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,720
Seals just popped,so we've lost pressure.

384
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,580
Herrmann,set up an ariel pipe.

385
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,690
We got to squeeze every dropof water onto that tanker or it'll blow.

386
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,420
Got it,let's go!Get out of here!

387
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,660
25 to main,where's that backup?

388
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,810
Delay,25.Still 15 minutes out.

389
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,400
Let's go!

390
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,860
Internal bleeding.I'm not sure how bad.

391
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,370
- Let me help.
- I got it,shay.Right here.Red.

392
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,840
All right.

393
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,020
Black.We need the space.

394
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,140
No. Dawson.You take care of him.

395
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,210
It's okay.

396
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,730
Red.

397
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,240
Okay,fine.

398
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,270
You all right?

399
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,470
No.

400
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,700
You can do this.

401
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,460
Just get through the day,all right?

402
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,390
Breathe in for me.

403
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,810
Line's charged.

404
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,040
Here comes the water,chief!

405
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,290
Let's hope it lasts.

406
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Anna?

407
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,480
We finished the primary searchfor warehouse workers.

408
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,780
- How many?
- 22.

409
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,990
There were 24 cars in the lot by my count.

410
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,030
Today's payday.

411
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,450
Our two bookkeepers use the back office.

412
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,440
chief,there's possibly two workers still in the back office.

413
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,390
Mills,grab your irons.

414
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,660
Let's go,go!

415
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,340
Fire department!If you can hear me,call out!

416
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,520
Chief,warehouse guy said the bookkeepers work

417
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,310
In the third office towards the back.

418
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,340
Chicago fire department.

419
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,990
Call out if you can hear me.

420
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,750
Up ahead on the left.

421
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,650
Chief,wait!

422
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,730
Mills?

423
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,840
Yeah,here,here.

424
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,400
- You okay?
- Yeah,yeah,i think so.You?

425
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,030
I'm good,i'm just.I'm just trapped.

426
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,260
Me too.

427
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,690
Let me try and.

428
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,760
No,no!

429
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,650
There could be a few tons above us.

430
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,580
Let's just not push our luck,okay?

431
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,510
- Yeah.
- This is boden.I'm with mills.

432
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,770
We're in the north end of the warehouse.

433
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,520
There's been a collapse.

434
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,610
On our way,chief.

435
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,430
That's it on the water.

436
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,620
Engine's fried.Watch that tanker!

437
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,780
chief,the heat destroyedthe pressure release valve.

438
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,150
What do you want us to do?

439
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,060
The tanker's gonna blow and it's gonna take the block with it.

440
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,450
This is battalion 25 to allfire and police personnel.

441
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,910
Evacuate the area to a 1/4mile perimeter.

442
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,770
Repeat evacuate the area.

443
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,040
It's the right thing to do.

444
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,660
I'm gonna need confirmation

445
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,920
That all first responders havepulled back to a safe distance.

446
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,990
I got a job to finish.

447
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,140
We're on the tanker.

448
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,870
Chief ain't going out like this.

449
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,850
Let's move.

450
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,800
All right everybody,let's go.

451
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,670
People,if you can move,let's do it.

452
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,380
We need to evacuate.

453
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,840
Sir,let's go.

454
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,100
Not a chance.

455
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,270
negative on that confirmation,chief.

456
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,160
Herrmann,you listen to me.

457
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,840
Chief,you know they aren't going anywhere.

458
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,570
- Where'd you come from?
- Back office.

459
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,990
- How'd you get out?
- Around back.

460
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,710
But everything came down right behind us.

461
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's go.

462
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,710
We got to release and divert the gas flow.

463
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,500
Will that coupling fit one of our hoses?

464
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah,let's try it.

465
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,660
Anna!

466
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,640
Anna,can you hear me?

467
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,140
guys,secure the end of this hose.

468
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,660
Got it.

469
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,760
Let's attach it to the track.

470
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,740
Move,guys.Let's move.I need a chain.

471
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,370
Coming in.

472
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,780
Westin?Westin,stay with me.

473
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,810
Stay with me,buddy.

474
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,810
We have more incoming.

475
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,840
You need to ration your supplies.

476
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,980
His vitals are 80 over50.He needs a second line.

477
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,940
keep moving.I'll handle this one.

478
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,950
Well,i guess this isn't a good time to ask if you're claustrophobic.

479
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,870
I spent the better part ofyesterday trapped in an m.r.i.

480
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,580
All i could think ofwhen i was in that machine is

481
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,670
What i was gonna do when i got out.

482
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,170
This wasn't on the list.

483
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,860
So you got your test results in?

484
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,940
No,not yet.

485
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,770
Maybe it's better i stayin here,not knowing.

486
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,420
But if the results are clear,and.

487
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,570
You don't have to retire.

488
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,780
Men who usually stay on thejob longer than

489
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,610
They should live to regret that choice.

490
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,610
You have any regrets?

491
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,540
I'm done talking about me.

492
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's talk about you and p.d.

493
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,390
Marcus!

494
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,420
No.

495
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm not giving up.

496
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,150
Is there someplace else she could be?

497
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,860
Our meal vouchers were in her backpack.

498
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,910
She wanted to see ifthey were good for lunch.

499
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,800
Where do they sell food on the train?

500
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,430
I know you think that iwalked into police academy

501
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,840
Because i got pushed over for squad.

502
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,090
It's not the reason why.

503
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,190
I wanted out because i foundout about you and my mom.

504
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Come on,quit lyingaround and get out of there

505
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,830
Before this whole thingblows to smithereens.

506
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,830
Hose secure.

507
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,660
Opening the valve.

508
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,640
Coming out with the chief and mills.

509
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,790
Severide,how's that valve?

510
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,850
Son of a bitch.

511
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,220
i need a vice grips up here.

512
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,050
Chief.

513
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,830
Go.

514
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,330
Damn it!Hurry.

515
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,120
Clear!

516
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,590
Mills,how's your arm?

517
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,600
Anna!

518
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,700
Anna?

519
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,750
I need a backboard over here.

520
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,320
Can you hear me?

521
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,160
My dad.

522
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,530
He's waiting for you.

523
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,700
- Why aren't you treating him?
- What?

524
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,890
He saved lives in there,and you're gonna let him die in the dirt?

525
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,170
Even if i had an ambulance,

526
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,410
he wouldn't make it to the hospital alive.

527
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,750
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,560
Jarhead.

529
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,210
You get the rest?

530
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,490
Yeah,man,i did.

531
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,730
Could have got you tooif you'd told me earlier.

532
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,720
And let you be the hero?

533
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,850
Go to hell.

534
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,210
All passengers alive anddead have been accounted for.

535
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,070
You disobeyed orders.

536
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,880
Yep.

537
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,400
I suppose you taught us that.

538
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,820
Chief,just know if it were up to me,

539
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,190
you wouldn't be going anywhere.

540
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,370
Thanks.

541
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,560
Dawson,shay,i remember you were doingroundsWith hallie thomas

542
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,830
over at lakeshore,right,designs on being a surgeon.

543
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,830
Yeah,that's right.

544
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,200
You were extraordinary today,both of you.

545
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,670
Call me anytime.

546
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,590
I'm always willing to help out good people.

547
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,510
I understand you had quite a day today.

548
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,500
It's calls like that thatreflect very well on this house.

549
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,880
I don't give a damn how it reflects.

550
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,670
We can't operate withoutthe support that we need.

551
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,350
But you did today,didn't you?

552
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,660
You worked with what youhad,and you saved lives.

553
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,660
So whether you like it ornot,chief,the system works.

554
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,900
But that's not your problem anymore.

555
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,180
This is for your exit interview tomorrow.

556
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,320
Please fill it out andremember to bring your badge.

557
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,160
I actually missed this place.

558
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Heather.

559
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,930
Why didn't you call?Iwould have picked you up.

560
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,830
I wasn't gonna stay there aminute longer than necessary.

561
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,510
I was hoping i could get the keys so i can be there when the boys wake up.

562
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,610
Sure,yeah.

563
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,780
They are going to lose theirminds when they see you.

564
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,630
Matt,this whole thing.

565
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:20,020
Has made me realize i need to make some changes in my life.

566
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,450
Whatever you need.

567
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,950
I know that.I do.

568
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,680
But i also know thatwhen i wake up tomorrow,

569
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,520
Everything i see,everywhere i go,

570
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,690
will remind me of losing andy and jen.

571
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,420
I've got this old friend in florida.

572
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,420
She owns an apartmentbuilding and needs a manager.

573
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,580
It's rent free,and it's a steady job.

574
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,670
Heather.

575
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,600
Take a little time.

576
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,110
I've cleared it withthe probation department.

577
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,330
shay.Can you give me a minute?

578
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,620
We really need to talk.

579
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,850
Not now,i.I'm fine.

580
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,620
Lover's quarrel?

581
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,450
Just go.

582
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,290
Mr.boden,this is dr. Kerry.

583
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,870
Your test results came back negative.

584
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,700
I'd still like to getyou tested every year,

585
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,640
But there's no reason youshouldn't get out and celebrate.

586
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,760
Congratulations.

587
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,590
You sure picked a hellof a call to go out on.

588
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,490
Sure did.

589
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,330
Peter.We should talk.

590
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,350
Before.

591
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,200
I was so mad at you,icould barely look at you.

592
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,940
And day after day i've watched you put yourself

593
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,020
On the line for this house,for me.

594
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,360
And now you're leaving,and.

595
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,540
I realize what a waste oftime it was to be so mad.

596
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,710
I regret that,and i wish i had that time back.

597
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,480
What's up?

598
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,090
You were right.

599
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,850
Let's face it,when it comes to women i'm a world class screwup.

600
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,850
Something goes wrong for me,

601
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,390
And i make sure i scorchthe earth as i leave town.

602
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,440
I did that to your mother.

603
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,850
I did it to katie's mom.

604
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,890
And now i'm doing it again to beth.

605
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,710
She's probably gonna divorce me,

606
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,970
But at least i can be around for the boys.

607
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,620
I'm sorry i wasn't around for you.

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,080
Anyway,they got soccer,so.

609
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,400
If i hit the road now,ishould be able to make the game.

610
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,160
That's good.Good.

611
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,950
Yeah.

612
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,650
Do me a favor,will you?

613
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,620
Would you tell wally,chief boden,that.

614
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,290
51 is his house.

615
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,940
one last thing.

616
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,080
Your sister katie.

617
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,770
I haven't spent much time with her,but.

618
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,440
She seems like a nice person.

619
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,900
No promises.

620
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,570
I'll see you,kelly.

621
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,130
It's difficult for me to accept

622
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,210
That the department i'vealways known is changing.

623
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,530
That makes me somewhat of a dinosaur.

624
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,370
But as difficult as those changes are.

625
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,370
Letting go of a lifetime'swork,that isn't easy.

626
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,960
Jeff.

627
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,330
I'm sorry.

628
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,730
I am so sorry.

629
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,160
There isn't a single man i've served with

630
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,820
Who hasn't been brought to his knees because of what he's seen on the job.

631
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,560
Different endeavors in life change people.

632
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,390
Only the strongest are up for that.

633
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,610
What makes them exceptional?

634
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,700
No matter how hard they fall,

635
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,750
they never give upWhen there'ssomething worth fighting for.

636
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,710
You'd make a great lieutenant.

637
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,020
Yeah,i don't know if i canhandle waiting

638
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,930
By the mailbox for another rejection letter.

639
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,050
I'm pretty sure it'dcome by email nowadays.

640
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,500
Yeah,thanks so much,sweetie.

641
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,430
When i was buried under two tons of rubble,

642
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,990
My men risked their lives to pull me out.

643
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,670
Even an extinct old dinosaur like me.

644
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,140
So to think about saddlingthem with a broken system

645
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,010
That strips away the essentials so they can barely do their job,

646
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,160
A broken system that mightkeep one of my men and women

647
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,080
From going home to their families,i will not. Allow that.

648
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,600
And i don't give a damn.

649
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,360
I will have no regrets.

650
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,110
You. Are not taking my house.

651
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,080
Not without a fight.

652
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,850
Do me a favor and take careof your mom and brother,okay?

653
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,920
You know.

654
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,850
Your dad always used to tell me

655
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,340
That we didn't become menuntil we got our badges.

656
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,270
His original badge will alwayshang on the academy wall,but.

657
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,820
Made this one for you.

658
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,990
Is this his number?

659
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,020
I was in line right after him,

660
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,270
so our badges are onlyone number apart,see?

661
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,990
Can i keep yours too?

662
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,720
Absolutely.

663
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,300
This is for you so you don't forget us.

664
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,640
Not a chance.
