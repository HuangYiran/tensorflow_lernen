1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:04,686
维吉妮亚  维吉妮亚  维吉妮亚
Virginia? Virginia? Virginia?

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:06,568
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

3
00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:08,720
我最爱玩这个了
Ooh, I love this game!

4
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,112
"猜我是怎么弄到这个的"游戏
"Guess how I got this" Was a game

5
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:12,005
我爹妈已经乐此不疲好多年了
my parents hadbeen playing for years.

6
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:17,781
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

7
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,629
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

8
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,473
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

9
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,132
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

10
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:36,321
我不想吹牛
I don't want to brag,

11
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,569
但我差不多算是这个游戏的灵感之源
but I was sort of the inspiration for this game.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,261
猜我是怎么弄到这个的
Guess how I got this.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,778
我猜莎拉・麦劳克兰 
I'm gonna guess that Sarah McLachlan

14
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,806
又把海鲜市场的所有龙虾都放生了
freed all the lobsters from the Seafood Shack again.

15
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:48,680
不对
Nope.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,977
你和缅因州的州长打赌赢了
You won a bet with the governor of Maine.

17
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,757
塞布丽娜  大街上才没有州长呢
Sabrina, Main Street doesn't have a governor.

18
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,757
吉米把缅因州误听成大街

19
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:53,874
说话前动动脑子好吗
You got to think before you guess.

20
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,844
你们把这游戏的乐趣都毁了
You know, you guys are ruining this game.

21
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,134
你从哪儿弄到这龙虾的  伯特
Where'd you get the lobster, Burt?

22
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,887
泰勒付不起我整理草坪的钱
Tyler couldn't pay me for mowing his lawn,

23
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:00,096
就把这小家伙抵给我了
so he gave me this little fella.

24
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:03,276
-伯特  我觉得你占到大便宜了呢  -是啊
- Burt, I think you got the better end of that deal. - Yeah.

25
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:05,144
超市的龙虾我们可买不起呢
We could never afford lobsters at the store.

26
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:07,961
是啊  泰勒说超市必须高价出售
I know! Tyler says supermarkets have to overcharge

27
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,009
因为有层层的中间人都要收取费用
because of all the middlemen they have to pay.

28
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,370
送货的  送冰的
The delivery guy, the ice guy,

29
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,157
那些没用的装袋工和收银员
those useless baggers and checkers.

30
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:14,336
我讨厌他们  
Oh, I hate those guys.

31
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:15,955
吉米  我们就是干那行的
Jimmy, we are those guys.

32
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:17,654
你应该跟泰勒说好以后都用龙虾结账  
You should make this a regular thing with Tyler.

33
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:18,474
正有此意
I'm gonna.

34
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:21,383
但我在想  怎能满足于区区一只龙虾呢
But I was thinking, why stop with lobster?

35
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:22,813
这玩意完全可以做大啊
This could be huge.

36
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:24,501
想想其他可以交换的东西
Think of the other things I could trade for.

37
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,889
螃蟹  虾  各种贝类
Crabs, shrimp, mollusks.

38
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,969
别停  再往大处想
No. Think bigger.

39
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,325
还有啊  牡蛎吗
I don't know. Oysters.

40
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,222
鹈鹕
Um, uh... pelicans!

41
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:33,947
再大点
Even bigger.

42
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,678
我们可以一起用自己的服务来换实物
We could both trade services for stuff.

43
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,756
我们的工作量一点没加
We'd be doing the same amount of work,

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,554
但回报更丰厚
but enjoying a much bigger return on the cool stuff.

45
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:42,934
听起来不错啊
That sounds great!

46
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:45,440
你们也可以找些可以交换的技能加入我们
You guys should find some tradable skills and join us.

47
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:46,844
你们总该有什么擅长的吧
Must be something you're good at.

48
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,812
我特别擅长避免把自己扯进荒诞的事里
I've gotten really good at avoiding ridiculous ideas,

49
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,069
所以别算上我们
which is why we're gonna bow out.

50
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,843
再说  明天巴尼要给我们上急救课
Plus, we have Barney's first aid class tomorrow.

51
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,774
急救课  你学那个干啥
First aid class? What do you need that for?

52
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:58,224
急救只是那些卖纱布的捏造的骗局
First aid is just a scam dreamed up by the gauze and bandage people.

53
00:01:58,224 --> 00:01:59,899
或者它就是个行之有效的救命措施
Or a proven life saver.

54
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,674
是啊  喜旺大部分时间都你们带
Yeah, and since Hope spends so much time here,

55
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:03,345
所以我们希望你们也能去听听课
we think you guys ought to check out the class, too,

56
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:04,666
就当是为了喜旺
for Hope's sake.

57
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,433
吉米  孩子难免受伤 
Jimmy, kids get hurt--

58
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,829
擦伤手肘  割到手指
they scrape their elbows, they cut their finger,

59
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,859
从车底的洞里掉下去
they fall through a hole in the bottom of your car.

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,120
这都是无法避免的
Nothing you can do to avoid it.

61
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,755
再说我们这里有个超级完美的急救箱
Besides, we got a perfectly good first aid kit right here.

62
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,805
瞧
See?

63
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,233
"发射求救信号  吃个三明治  等待救援"
"Shoot flare, eat sandwich, wait for help."

64
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,218
我也不知道  或许他们说的对
I don't know. Maybe they're right.

65
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,252
不如我们直接翘掉培训课吧
Maybe we should just skip the class and...

66
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,288
吉米
Jimmy.

67
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:30,828
天啊
Oh, my.

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,785
时间真是把杀猪刀
Oh, the years have not been kind

69
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,385
火鸡色拉三明治变毒药
to this turkey salad sandwich.

70
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:53,272
第二天  我父母把以物换物计划付诸实践
The next day, my parents put their bartering plan into action,

71
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,494
竟然还成功了
and it actually worked.

72
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,246
他们得到了需要的
They got things they needed.

73
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:58,602
和不需要的东西
They got things they didn't need.

74
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,590
也享受了早就该去做的事
And they got things that were long overdue.

75
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,341
冲洗
Rinse.

76
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:09,547
最重要的是  他们得到了一直以来长期梦寐以求的东西
Most importantly, they got things they had always dreamt about.

77
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,799
我们这儿有如此美味的枫糖浆
Oh, if we have maple syrup this incredible here,

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,472
何必还要舔着脸找加拿大进口
why do we even talk to Canada?

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,341
天啊
Oh, man.

80
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,761
巴布  你的高超手法让我
Barb, what you're doing right now is actually

81
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:24,457
十分乐意帮你清理下水槽口蓄积的毛发
making me look forward to cleaning your drain hair.

82
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,097
维吉妮亚  瞧瞧我的新帽子
Hey, Virginia, check out my new lid.

83
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:32,074
我替斯蒂芬老太太清洗泳池  她帮我做的
Old Lady Stevens made this for me for cleaning out her pool.

84
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:34,235
以物换物真是有史以来最棒的事
This bartering thing-- it's the greatest thing ever.

85
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,892
没错  按摩  龙虾  毛线帽
I know. Massages, lobsters, crocheted hats.

86
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,492
我们简直是以物换物的大师
It's like we're barter-aires!

87
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,628
我在想
I was thinking.

88
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,853
如果那些和我们交换的人
what if the people who are trading with us

89
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:44,367
相互间也进行同样的交易呢
started trading with each other?

90
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,112
是啊  对整个纳什维尔而言  
Yeah. Natesville would become a place

91
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:47,104
生命中那些美好的事  
where the good things in life

92
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,502
可以向那些一直辛苦劳作的人倾斜
actually trickle up to the people who do all the work.

93
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,648
倾斜式经济
A trickle-up economy.

94
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,035
我觉得真有那玩意儿呢
I think that's a thing.

95
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,563
不是
No.

96
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,303
我突然想起挠痒娃娃了[与倾斜式经济谐音]
I'm thinking Tickle Me Elmo.

97
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,815
你们或许都很好奇我为何有资格教这堂课
You all may wonder why I'm qualified to teach this class.

98
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:04,133
我童子军时期可学到过不少东西
Well, I learned a thing or two from the trusty scouts.

99
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,867
他们把我打个半死之后
They would often administer first aid

100
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:08,105
总是会对我采取急救措施
after they beat the tarnation out of me.

101
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,306
可能因为我是一个特别容易搞定的家伙
I suppose I was an easy target.

102
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,256
超重  气喘  贫血
Overweight, asthmatic, anemic

103
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,769
还是个重度色盲
and wildly color blind.

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,547
怎么迟到了  没事吧
You're late. Is everything all right?

105
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:19,358
我刚收到我妈寄来的明信片
I just got this postcard from my mother.

106
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,589
"真希望你也在这儿"
"Wish You Were Here."

107
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,059
-她这次挺和善的  -想太多  看背面
- Oh, she's being nice this time. - Yeah. Turn it over.

108
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:28,184
"因为在厄瓜尔多做前额缩小术超级便宜
"Because forehead reduction surgery is super cheap in Ecuador.

109
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:28,938
爱你  塔玛"
Love, Tams."

110
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,771
别难过  亲爱的
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

111
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,721
不  我该感到荣幸才对
Yeah. Really, I should be flattered.

112
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,192
她虽然身在热带天堂
I mean, even in tropical paradise,

113
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:35,720
心里却还在想着我的缺点
she's thinking about my flaws.

114
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:39,224
不幸的是  我被胖揍了六顿
Unfortunately, I took six brutal beatings

115
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,886
才知道根本没有什么残忍勋章
before I learned there was no merit badge for cruelty,

116
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,431
而那些童子军对我施暴时我竟然不做反抗
and I'd been letting the scouts pummel me for no real reason.

117
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:47,252
大家好
Hey, everybody.

118
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,451
瞧瞧我的大奶罐
Check out my big cans.

119
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,495
还记得乔希吗  他走了几年又回来了
You all remember Josh. He's back after a couple years away.

120
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,028
第六号海豹突击队
SEAL Team Six.

121
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,386
乔希很擅长拿杂货开玩笑
Josh is amazing with grocery humor.

122
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,886
他曾用水壶开过一个类似的玩笑
He does a similar joke with jugs.

123
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:05,113
当我爸妈把纳什维尔的所有技工都召集齐了后
Once my parents had gathered all of Natesville's skilled workers,

124
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,834
他们打算将计划付诸实施
they attempted to lay out the plan.

125
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,584
但有些人花了好些时间才明白
It took a while for some of them to understand.

126
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:12,387
大家好  我是酒鬼菲尔
Hi. My name's Phil, and I'm an alcoholic.

127
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:14,084
你好  菲尔
Hi, Phil.

128
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:15,657
菲尔  我再说一遍
Phil, for the second time,

129
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,134
这里不是互助会
that's not why we're here.

130
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:18,568
在过去的几天里
Oh. For the past few days,

131
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,508
维吉妮亚和我过上了一种
Virginia and I have enjoyed a lifestyle

132
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:25,463
曾经我们无法企及的生活方式
that previously was beyond our reach.

133
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,630
我们怎么办到的  伯特
How did we do it, Burt?

134
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,208
通过以物换物
Through barter. Oh.

135
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,004
事实是  我仅仅修了几个小时的草坪
In fact, after only a few hours of lawn work,

136
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:35,524
就可以交换到一个
I was able to trade for something that was heretofore

137
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,411
迄今为止只有富豪跟海象可以享用的东西
only available to tycoons and walruses.

138
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:40,864
是什么呢
What is it?

139
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:44,516
好吧  答案就在你们的椅子下
Well, look under your chairs and find out!

140
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,617
这不是龙虾吗
Is that a lobster?

141
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,351
正是
That's right.

142
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,901
龙虾归你了
You get a lobster!

143
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,465
快把龙虾带回家吧
You get a lobster!

144
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,175
你也得到了一只龙虾
You get a lobster!

145
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,834
痛
No!

146
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:03,109
帮我弄掉它
Make it stop!

147
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,117
抱歉我只能用纸巾
Sorry about the paper towel.

148
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,982
因为我不相信纱布
I don't believe in gauze.

149
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:09,150
我们想说的是
The thing we're trying to say is,

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,086
之所以我能交换到这么多龙虾
I was able to trade for all these lobsters

151
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:13,035
是因为我们跳过了中间商
because we cut out the middleman.

152
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,866
我不用付钱给送货的
I didn't have to pay the delivery guy,

153
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,483
也不用付钱给在龙虾鳌上套橡胶圈的
or the claw-rubberbanderer guy.

154
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,291
真心对不住 巴布
Sorry again, Barb.

155
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,138
我们正邀请你们做一样的事情
And we're inviting you to do the same thing,

156
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,908
不仅仅是跟我们  是跟大家所有人
and not just with us, but with each other.

157
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,604
因为越多的人参与其中
Because the more people that are involved,

158
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:28,785
越多人获利
the more people benefit.

159
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,930
再提醒一下  这不是在搞"金字塔骗局"
And again, this is not a pyramid scheme.

160
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,930
金字塔骗局也称层压式推销  即以根本不可能支付的高利息作诱饵进行金融诈骗

161
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,340
就算你是干这行的
Although if you make pyramids,

162
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,863
我们一样欢迎你入局
you're welcome to join our scheme.

163
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,082
我是说加入体系
Uh, I mean, system.

164
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,071
那你的意思是
So, are you saying

165
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,665
我可以用龙虾跟史蒂文斯老太太
I can trade Old Lady Stevens lobsters

166
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,175
换一套42码的修身针织套装
for a crocheted suit in a 42 slim?

167
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,333
噢  孩子  这肯定行不通
Oh, honey, that's not gonna work.

168
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,589
我对龙虾过敏的
I'm allergic to crustaceans.

169
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,702
这很简单
That's easy.

170
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,731
我替你修草坪
I mow your lawn,

171
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,676
你给泰勒针织套装
you give Tyler the suit,

172
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,041
泰勒给我龙虾
Tyler gives me the lobsters.

173
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:00,659
另外
Again,

174
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,228
我再强调一遍
I can't stress enough,

175
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,239
这不是"金字塔骗局"
this is not a pyramid scheme.

176
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,383
克拉拉・巴顿表示同意
And Clara Barton said, "You know what? I will."

177
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,383
克拉拉・巴顿  美国红十字会创始人

178
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:15,284
我想这基本上概述了急救的起源
And that, I think, covers the origins of first aid.

179
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,924
噢  我没想到居然花了1小时45分钟
Oh, I can't believe that took an hour and 45 minutes.

180
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:19,817
好吧  我们接着说窒息
Oh, well, let's move quickly to choking.

181
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,811
这些都是最常见的容易噎到的东西
Now, here are the most common choking hazards.

182
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,172
总算有吃的了  我饿了
Finally, some food. I'm starving.

183
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,305
吉米  吉米  吉米
Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy?

184
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:32,907
我想吉米真的噎到了
I think James is really choking!

185
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,422
大家不要慌
Okay, nobody panic.

186
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:39,106
有人真的用过海姆利克氏操作法吗
Has anyone here ever actually done the Heimlich?

187
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,245
我
Yes.

188
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,953
人家只在人形枕头上实施过呀
I've only ever done it with my special body pillow.

189
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:45,579
没用  我的手好滑
Oh, it's no use. My hands are slipping!

190
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,469
都怪我擦手霜的强迫症
Damn my vain compulsion to moisturize!

191
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,287
我的手很漂亮  但毫无用处
My hands are beautiful, but useless!

192
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:59,001
我的天  吉米的老婆
Oh, my God. Jimmy's wife

193
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,691
刚刚救了吉米
just saved his life.

194
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,258
太弱了吧
What a wuss!

195
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,929
吉米  接下来呢
Hey, Jimmy, what's next?

196
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,775
你要坐下来小便吗
Are you gonna start peeing sitting down?

197
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:10,061
你可以闭嘴了吗 乔希
Okay, you know what? Can you just cut it out, Josh?

198
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,416
好  好  冷静点
Okay, okay, calm down.

199
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,273
这又弄不死他 只是玩笑而已
They're not gonna kill him. They're jokes,

200
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:15,503
又不是葡萄
not grapes.

201
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:25,900
对不起  吉米
I apologize, Jimmy.

202
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,280
如果我不跟着笑
If I don't laugh along with his jokes,

203
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,176
他就改取笑我了
he'll start making fun of me again.

204
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,344
你懂的  我浑身上下确实充满了笑点
As you know, I'm a veritable minefield of mockable traits.

205
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,932
没事的  弗兰克
It's all right, Frank.

206
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,871
弗兰克  你来吗
Yo, Frank, you coming?

207
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,771
马上  我在给吉米指卫生巾的位置
Yeah. I was just pointing Jimmy towards the sanitary napkins.

208
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:45,633
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

209
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,118
你没事吧
Hey, are you okay?

210
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,352
我又不是个小孩  塞布丽娜
Hey, you know, I'm not a baby, Sabrina, all right?

211
00:08:53,353 --> 00:08:55,375
我能照顾好我自己
I-I can take care of myself.

212
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,150
这算什么啊
What was that all about?

213
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,352
你救了他的命
I'm afraid you saved his life,

214
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,338
同时也可能扼杀了他的男子气概
but in the process, you may have killed his manhood.

215
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,199
他被噎到了
Well, he was choking.

216
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,533
我还能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

217
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,594
你也可以等专业人士出现
Well, you could have waited for the professionals to show up.

218
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:10,928
又不是说牺牲一些脑细胞
It's not like a few less brain cells

219
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,258
会让他少得一个普利策奖
is gonna cost him a Pulitzer.

220
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,740
好吧  那我下次就看着他在大伙面前噎到
Oh, okay, so, I should just wait for him

221
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,752
不去救他咯
to choke in public again, and then not save him?

222
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:17,750
那可得过段时间了
Oh, that could take days,

223
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,501
但我觉得他撑不到那时候
and I don't think he's got that kind of time.

224
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,376
你得帮他把他的男子气概找回来
You've got to help him get his masculinity back.

225
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,744
我该怎么帮
How am I supposed to do that?

226
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,130
你问我干嘛
Why are you asking me?

227
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,792
我有两个妈妈  没有老婆
I have two mothers, no wife,

228
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:29,386
而且曾经狂殴我的童子军还都是妹子
and those scouts who used to beat me up... were girls.

229
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:36,189
我们有麻烦了  伯特
We've got a problem, Burt.

230
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,011
我给了巴布一只龙虾  但她只帮我
I gave Barb a lobster, but she only massaged

231
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,294
按摩左半边的身体
the left side of my body.

232
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:42,009
我尝一口就知道自己根本不爱吃龙虾
It only took me one to realize I don't really like lobster.

233
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,150
我只喜欢溶化的黄油
Turns out, I just really like melted butter.

234
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,752
但现在我的左半边很爽
But now my left side is relaxed,

235
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,500
而右半边的肌肉却紧得难受
and my right side is tense as hell.

236
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,457
好吧  我们想想怎么办
Okay, we can figure this out.

237
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,500
伯特  看看这个
Burt, look at this.

238
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,022
我明白
I totally get it.

239
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,564
你是一个套着备用轮胎的技工
You're a mechanic with a spare tire.

240
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:57,880
很明显  现在一瓶油
Apparently, an oil change

241
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,618
只够换半件毛衣
is only worth half a sweater now.

242
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,268
织毛衣很花时间的
Knitting a sweater takes a long time.

243
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,143
你最好庆幸它可以盖得到你的胸部
Just be happy it covers your man boobs.

244
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,865
至少它们没有下垂到我的膝盖
At least they're not bouncing off my knees,

245
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,369
你这个没用的老太婆
you useless bag of wrinkles.

246
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,394
我们能解决这些问题的
We can work this out.

247
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:14,066
首先  菲尔  跟你妈道歉
First, Phil, apologize to your mother.

248
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,149
不幸的是  越来越多人
Unfortunately, there were more than a few people

249
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,095
在爸爸妈妈的计划上出了状况
that had a problem with Mom and Dad's plan.

250
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,579
所以他们聚集所有人
So they brought everyone together

251
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,713
来解决他们的问题
and tried to figure things out.

252
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:26,379
如果泰勒给了巴布两只龙虾
Okay, so if Tyler gives two lobsters to Barb,

253
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,927
巴布给康威医生做三分之一疗程的按摩
and Barb gives a third of a massage to Dr. Conway,

254
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,281
然后康威医生再为预言家帕姆
and Dr. Conway cleans four of Pam,

255
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,499
洗四颗牙
the fortune teller's teeth...

256
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,519
没错  然后帕姆
Right, and she gives half

257
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,537
再告诉菲尔下周彩票号码的一半
of next week's lottery numbers to Phil,

258
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,012
菲尔去为糖浆山姆修车
Phil fixes Syrup Sam's truck

259
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,538
以交换六块煎饼
in exchange for six pancakes

260
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,139
等值于山姆给史蒂文斯老太太的枫糖浆
worth of syrup to Old Lady Stevens.

261
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,252
而老太太要织帽子给...
Who makes a crocheted hat for...

262
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,871
等等  谁要针织帽子来着
Wait. Who needs a crocheted hat?

263
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,148
我们的微经济组织可能遭遇了"帽子泡沫"
Our micro economic group may be experiencing a Hat Bubble.

264
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:00,258
也许我们不需要等价交换
Maybe we don't have to trade

265
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,399
某种特定的服务
one particular service for another?

266
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:04,681
或许我们可以创造某种东西
Maybe there's something we can create

267
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:07,071
来代表服务的价值
that represents the value of services rendered.

268
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,079
比如彩色珠子  或者纸
Like colored beads or a piece of paper.

269
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,479
纸这个想法很高端
Paper's a good idea.

270
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,527
很新颖
That's pretty cool.

271
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:13,534
但如果要显得官方正式
But to make it even more official...

272
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,112
我们就该在上面加个头像
we should put someone's face on it!

273
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:21,093
加谁的头像呢
Now, who could that be?

274
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:28,556
为了让这个以物换物系统更高级
To bring their barter system to the next level,

275
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,394
爹妈去了李的复印店
my parents went down to Lee's Copy Shop

276
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,654
让李印刷了几百张伯特币
and had him print up hundreds of Burt Bucks.

277
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,698
这些足够流通了
There's plenty to go around.

278
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,902
相信我  有了这个  一切就简单多了
Trust me, this'll make everything easier.

279
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,612
币值有三元  七元和十一元
They come in threes, sevens and 11's.

280
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,307
这都是伯特的幸运数字
Those are Burt's lucky numbers.

281
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:49,595
回击乔希的羞辱
去死吧
你饭做得有吉米好吗
你骂我的话都会应在你自己身上

282
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:50,816
不
No...

283
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,748
你才是呢
you are.

284
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,997
太棒了
Oh, that's good.

285
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,236
吉米  吉米  救命啊
Jimmy! Jimmy, help!

286
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,357
我来救你了
Oh! I'll get you!

287
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:06,449
天啊
Oh, my god!

288
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,125
弗兰克  停下
Hey, Frank! Stop!

289
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,960
弗兰克  停下
Frank! Stop!

290
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:26,484
天啊
Oh, my god.

291
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,453
经典啊
Ha! Classic!

292
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,123
恭喜啊  吉米
Congratulations, Jimmy.

293
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:32,502
你马上就要从
You're about to go from being

294
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,393
本超市最大傻瓜
the biggest idiot in the store

295
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,329
荣升至全网最大傻瓜了
to the biggest on the Internet.

296
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,385
不  你才是呢
No, you are!

297
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,348
干得好  詹姆斯  你是个英雄
Well done, James. You're a hero.

298
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:43,082
如果你没有抓住吊在空中的塞布丽娜
If you hadn't caught the dangling Sabrina,

299
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,120
她可能会摔断"嘴"
she may have... broken a log.

300
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,229
不对头啊
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

301
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:49,931
是腿
Oh. A leg.

302
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:51,238
甚至...
Or...

303
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,552
可能断头
cut off her head?

304
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:53,828
等等
Wait a minute.

305
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:55,975
这都是你们演的吗
You guys faked this?

306
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,997
想必她要伪造的还不止这些吧
Bet that's not the only thing she has to fake.

307
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,613
抱歉  我以为乔希还在呢
Sorry, I thought Josh was still here.

308
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,069
我要去做手指甲和脚趾甲啦
Well, I'm off to my mani-pedi.

309
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:10,066
能借我一点伯特币吗
Can you spot me a few Burt bucks?

310
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,768
不行啊  我最后一点也全花在
No. I spent my last ones on a crochet lesson

311
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:13,844
斯蒂芬老太太的针织课上了
from Old Lady Stevens,

312
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,510
这样我就能给马桶织个舒服的垫子了
so I can make this toilet seat cozy.

313
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:17,242
冬天的时候肯定很爽
that's gonna be great in winter,

314
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,682
如果你没有伯特币了
but if you're out of Burt Bucks

315
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:20,753
我也没有伯特币了  那就麻烦了
and I'm out of Burt Bucks, then we got a problem.

316
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,313
那你就得修剪更多的草坪
I guess you're just gonna have to mow more lawns

317
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:24,020
我也不得不去给更多人家干活
and I'm gonna have to clean more houses.

318
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,757
可我今天想去修手修脚啊
But my mani-pedi's today.

319
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:29,242
我的手裁伯特币裁得好辛苦
I've got so many paper cuts from handling all those Burt Bucks,

320
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,390
我要给手打蜡呢
I'm getting a hot paraffin wax dip.

321
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,368
绝不能错过了  维吉妮亚  不能
I can't miss that, Virginia, I just can't.

322
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:36,041
太不公平了  如果说这世上有谁
Doesn't seem fair. If there's anyone

323
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,584
可以拥有源源不断的伯特币  那就该是你伯特
who should never run out of Burt Bucks, it's Burt.

324
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,191
肯定有办法
There's got to be a way

325
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:42,046
让我们摆脱困境
we can bail ourselves out of this.

326
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:45,087
我们可不可以直接多印一些伯特币呢
What if we just print ourselves some extra Burt Bucks?

327
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,092
这对大家都好啊
I mean, that's good for everyone,

328
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,559
因为我们花得越多
because the more we spend,

329
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,599
别的人也能花得更多
the more everyone else will have to spend.

330
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,250
我不是股神巴菲特
I'm no Warren Buffet,

331
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:53,949
但我敢说
but I bet that's just the

332
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,120
这能刺激我们以物换物经济
thing to stimulate our bartering economy.

333
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,932
在别人家豪宅的厕所里干活儿时
Reading those money magazines while you're on the can

334
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:00,939
读的那些金融杂志总算有用武之地了
in the fancy houses you clean is really paying off.

335
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,979

344

只怕如今事与愿违*
*I'm afraid it doesn't work

345
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,213
我苦苦寻觅伴侣*

355

机油已经换好了
Oil change is done.

356
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,597
再换一次吧
Change it again!

357
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,683
太爽了
That was amazing.

358
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,071
是啊  我们在纸钱堆里大干了一场
Yeah. Now that we've made sweet love on paper money,

359
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,092
要用回硬币就有难度了
it's gonna be really hard to go back to coins.

360
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,727
简直难以置信
I can't believe this.

361
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:21,401
我在网上火了  都有58个人看过了
I'm all over the Internet. I've got 58 views,

362
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,197
我每看一次  点击率就增加一次
and every time I check it, it gets higher.

363
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,858
看啊  59个人看过了
Look at this! 59!

364
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,569
你看了多少遍了
How many times have you checked it?

365
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,046
不知道  五十次吧  还是五十五
I don't know, 50, 55.

366
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:34,397
我不想小题大做  但...
I don't want to be dramatic, about this, but...

367
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:37,534
你还不如让我死在急救课上算了
sometimes I wish you had just let me die in that first aid class.

368
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,553
吉米  听着
Jimmy, look...

369
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:40,967
怎么回事
What was that?

370
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,257
我觉得是有人进了储藏室
I think there's somebody in the garage.

371
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,705
是吗  在超市里的那场戏还不够吗
Really? Your little stunt in the grocery store wasn't enough?

372
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,313
-得了  -不是的
- Oh, come on. - No.

373
00:15:54,314 --> 00:15:56,768
蒙面的歹徒  搞什么啊
A masked burglar? I mean, what... what is this,

374
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,342
-史酷比[卡通狗]吗  -吉米  我...
- Scooby-Doo? - Jimmy, I...

375
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,422
乔希
Josh?

376
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:03,299
你怎么能雇一个最爱取笑我的人
How could you hire the guy who makes the most fun of me

377
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,916
来让我更加无地自容
to make me feel even worse about myself?

378
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,914
我没雇他  他应该是真的来抢劫的
I did not hire him. I think he's actually trying to rob us.

379
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:11,982
是嘛  我真得信了
Oh, yeah, like I'm supposed to believe that this is real.

380
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,386
吉米
Jimmy!

381
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,994
怎么老发生这种事
Why does this keep happening?

382
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,754
你应该感到羞愧
You... should be ashamed.

383
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,615
你海豹突击六队的兄弟
What would your brothers at SEAL Team Six

384
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,131
会怎么说
have to say about this?

385
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,873
可能会说"乔希是谁"
Probably, "Who's Josh?"

386
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:47,150
因为我之前明显是在撒谎
Because I was obviously lying about that.

387
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:49,057
我刚从监狱出来  笨蛋
I was in prison, you idiots.

388
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,807
你刚从监狱出来
So you just got out of prison

389
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,723
就打算抢劫我们
and you're already trying to rob us?

390
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,076
大房子  弱娇妻  蠢老公
Big house, tiny wife, wimpy husband--

391
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:56,899
入室窃贼的理想对象啊
it's what every home invader dreams of.

392
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,915
太好了  现在警察和全镇人
Oh, great. Now the police and everyone in town

393
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,391
都要知道你又救了我一次
are gonna know that you saved me one more time.

394
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,247
这镇子我住不下去了
I'm never gonna be able to live this down.

395
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:05,823
吉米  就告诉大家
Jimmy, we could just tell everybody

396
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,935
是你救了我  行吧  谁知道啊
that you saved me, okay? Who's gonna know?

397
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:09,798
-我知道  -我也知道
- I'll know. - I'll know, too.

398
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,125
知道吗  给你来点胶带
You know what? Maybe a little duct tape

399
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,504
你就能消停
is gonna shut you up...

400
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:15,658
马上...
in about...

401
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:32,275
吉米  这是什么
Jimmy, wha... what is this?

402
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,342
那个啊  那个
Oh, those? Uh... that's...

403
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,238
什么都不是  给我
that's nothing. I'll-I'll get those.

404
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,673
等等  都是寄给我的  我怎么从来没见过
Wait, but these are all addressed to me-- why haven't I seen them?

405
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,762
可能是喜旺放在这的  你知道的
Maybe Hope put them in here-- you know that she likes

406
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,924
她喜欢扮邮递员  喜欢囤东西
to play mailman and hoarder.

407
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,116
大多是我妈寄来的明信片
It's more of those postcards from my mom.

408
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:47,225
怎么会在这
What are they doing out here?

409
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:50,782
我都会在你看到之前  就把明信片藏在这
I always, um, hide them in here before you see them,

410
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,258
因为我知道你看了会难过
because I know how much they upset you.

411
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,633
我错了
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,355
这是什么意思
What was that for?

413
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:03,506
奖励你为了让我不难过
Because you committed

414
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:06,290
而犯下的联邦罪行
a federal crime to protect my feelings.

415
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,682
吉米  你还不明白吗
Oh, Jimmy, don't you see?

416
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,181
可能我是救过你几次  但
I may have saved you a couple times, but...

417
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,584
你每天都在救我
you save me every day.

418
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:21,670
我想念狱中的老公了
I miss my prison husband.

419
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,786
-啥  -没啥
- What?  - Nothin'.

420
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,203
伯特  搞定
Burt, we've done it!

421
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,162
咱的生活水平倍儿高啊
We are livin' the good life.

422
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:32,927
虽然这三天除了龙虾  黄油和枫糖浆
And even though I haven't eaten anything but lobster,

423
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,588
我啥也没吃过
butter and maple syrup for the last three days,

424
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:35,821
但感觉前所未有的爽
I have never felt better.

425
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:36,877
我在想
You know, I was thinking,

426
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,138
龙虾确实不错
while lobster is pretty damn good,

427
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,718
但还有啥是追踪镇有  而纳什维尔镇没有的
what does Tracetown have that Natesville doesn't?

428
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,728
第三世界国家的阅读能力
Reading level of a third grade country.

429
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,196
不  我是说我们没有的东西  比如排骨
No, something we don't have: delicious ribs.

430
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,242
咱们应该扩大系统
Mmm. It's time to expand our system,

431
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:51,452
把其他镇也拉进来
bring other towns in.

432
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,466
这样就有更多的商品和服务
Which would mean more goods and services.

433
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,929
不仅有排骨
And not just ribs.

434
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,727
还有馅饼
We could get pies.

435
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,363
或者皮肤科医生
Or a dermatologist.

436
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,527
做钥匙的工匠
A guy who makes keys.

437
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:04,420
吉斯先生和吉斯夫人好
Hey, Chances.

438
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:06,649
泰勒  很潮嘛
Hey, Tyler. Lookin' sharp!

439
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:08,718
来杯枫糖浆吧
Pour yourself a glass of maple syrup.

440
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,993
不用了  问一下
Oh, I'm good. Uh, let me ask you,

441
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,453
你们是不是印了额外的伯特币
you didn't print up any extra Burt Bucks, did you?

442
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,854
我们才不会承认
We're not saying we did,

443
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:20,101
但如果我们承认  有问题吗
but if we did... why would that be a problem?

444
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,258
我就知道
I had a feeling.

445
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:22,659
市场货币贬值了
You flooded the market.

446
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,102
不用谢
You're welcome.

447
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:27,944
这不是好事  我上一个龙虾卖了4000伯特币
It's not good. I sold my last lobster for 4,000 Burt Bucks.

448
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:28,854
你们没有从
Didn't you learn anything

449
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,302
津巴布韦的超级通货膨胀中得到教训吗
from the hyper-inflation fiasco in Zimbabwe?

450
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,474
我们有自己的路子  跟津什么韦的路子不一样
We didn't do it the Zim-bob-way, we did it our way.

451
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,432
抱歉  两位
I'm sorry, guys,

452
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,590
伯特币贬值  我不收伯特币了
Burt Bucks are worthless; I can't accept them anymore.

453
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,127
再见
See you around.

454
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,016
就他一个人  不影响
Well, that's just one guy. It shouldn't matter.

455
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:47,924
系统太大了  不可能崩溃
System's too big-- it can't fail.

456
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,381
但不只是一个人
But it wasn't just one guy,

457
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:54,739
几个小时内整个系统就崩塌了
and it only took a couple hours for the entire system to fail.

458
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,011
龙虾一没了  糖浆也不行了
Once lobster was out, big syrup fell,

459
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,794
接着整个编织业都垮了
and then the entire crochet industry unraveled.

460
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:02,625
很快  我爹妈只能收拾这堆烂摊子
Pretty soon, my parents were left holding the bag...

461
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:06,676
这次  还有几辆堆满废纸的独轮车
or, in this case, several wheelbarrows filled with worthless paper.

462
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:16,211
如果单考虑独轮车方面
I guess if you think about this purely in terms of wheelbarrows,

463
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,365
我们还走在了前列
we came out way ahead.

464
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,156
也没人真的遭受损失
And... nobody really got hurt.

465
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,007
对
True.

466
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,613
有人吗
Hello?

467
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,182
有人啊
Oh, hello!

468
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,118
李先生  你怎么来了
Mr. Lee? What are you doing here?

469
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,987
管你们要印刷的钱
Well, I need to get paid for the printing.

470
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:29,318
没问题  能用伯特币吗
No problem. Can I pay you in Burt Bucks?

471
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:31,788
很幽默嘛
That's very funny!

472
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:33,609
我拿这堆假钱能干嘛使
What can I do with all the play money?

473
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,943
不能付房租  也不能买油墨
I can't pay rent, I can't buy ink,

474
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,078
当厕纸又太硬
and it's far too rough for toilet paper.

475
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,582
这账单你得付了
You need to take care of this.

476
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:41,720
行
Okay.

477
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,159
有点意思
Interesting. Mm-hmm.

478
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,244
劳驾问下
Let me ask you this.

479
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,024
独轮车能抵债吗
Do you take wheelbarrows?

480
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:58,280
爹妈的换物系统确实成真了
Mom and Dad's bartering system finally worked...

481
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,151
只跟他们预想的不一样
just not how they planned.

482
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,617
他们享受了一个星期的奢华生活
They lived the high life for one week,

483
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:05,519
但为此要做5万小时的修剪和清洗工
but it cost them 50,000 hours of landscaping and cleaning.

484
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,495
伯特  这边修好到楼后去
Burt, when you're done,

485
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,234
那边还好多树篱要修呢
there are more hedges behind the building.

486
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:09,605
真棒啊
Nice!

487
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,753
往好的想  这麻烦不会永远是咱的
Well, on the bright side, this won't be our problem forever.

488
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,318
等咱死了  咱们的孩子还有孩子的孩子
After we're gone, our children and our children's children

489
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,574
还要为我们给这个中国印刷工还债
will be paying off our debts to the Chinese printer.

490
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,770
政府由比我们聪明的人掌权
Well, it's a good thing people

491
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:24,143
真是一大幸事
smarter than us are running the real government.
