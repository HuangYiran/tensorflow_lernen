1
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,241
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree

2
00:01:56,492 --> 00:02:00,537
煙囪清掃工就是幸運星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

3
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,248
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

4
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,670
當他和你握手的時候，幸運就會傳染給你
Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you

5
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:12,760
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

6
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,136
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

7
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:17,846
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

8
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:26,088
女士們，先生們
All right, ladies and gents...

9
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,717
這樣的場合，幽默詩正好派上用場
comical poems suitable for the occasion...

10
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:32,512
即興創作，當場發表
extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.

11
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:34,724
好的，我們開始
All right, here we go.

12
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,727
這是我們共同的天地
Room here for everyone Gather around

13
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,189
警察先生剋盡職守
The constable's "responstable".

14
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,361
聽起來還不錯吧？
Now, how does that sound?

15
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,117
你好，拉克小姐 讓我為你獻上一首
Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you

16
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:58,707
拉克小姐喜歡和安德魯在公園散步
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

17
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:03,047
你好啊，安德魯
Hello, Andrew.

18
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:07,926
啊，考利夫人 一個關於你的故事
Ah, Mrs Cory a story for you

19
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,889
你的女兒過去比你矮……
Your daughters were shorter than you...

20
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,017
但現在，她們長高了
but they grew.

21
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:24,277
親愛的帕西蒙小姐
Dear Miss Persimmon...

22
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,281
嗯？
Yes?

23
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,785
風，從東方刮來
Wind's in the east

24
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,829
霧，在四處瀰漫
Mist comin' in.

25
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,919
一件醞釀已久的事情看似就要發生
Like something is brewin' about to begin

26
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:45,009
沒人能夠預測未來
Can't put me finger on what lies in store

27
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,762
但我知道將要發生的一切……
But I feel what's to happen...

28
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:52,600
都曾經發生過
all happened before.

29
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,148
對不起，剛才說到哪裏了？
I'm sorry. Where was I?

30
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,387
謝謝，謝謝你的支持
Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.

31
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:32,645
啊，拉克小姐，謝謝。
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

32
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,107
天主保佑你
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

33
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,860
您就是慷慨的化身
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

34
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:42,740
您就免了。
No charge.

35
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:47,786
哦，是你啊！你好。
Oh, it's you! Hello.

36
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:51,707
你是說，櫻桃樹大街17號麼？
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

37
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,544
好吧，跟我來。
All right. Come along with me.

38
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,716
這就是櫻桃樹大街
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

39
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,344
一個很可愛的地方
Nice little spot, you might say.

40
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,724
17號就在前面
Number 17's just down a bit.

41
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,730
這個能給人留下深刻印象的大房子第一眼看上去並不舒服
Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye...

42
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,398
它是退役海軍上將
is the home of Admiral Boom...

43
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,568
鮑默將軍的家
late of His Majesty's Navy.

44
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,571
他的房子就像一艘船
Likes his house shipshape, he does...

45
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:23,784
他做事更是井井有條，一絲不茍
shipshape and bristol fashion at all times.

46
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:31,542
報時槍準備 準備完畢，將軍
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

47
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,545
還有3分零6秒 是，將軍
Three minutes and six seconds.
Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:38,717
將軍一向以準時而聞名
What he's famous for is punctuality.

49
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,136
全世界都以格林尼治時間為準
The whole world takes its time from Greenwich.

50
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:45,183
但人們說格林尼治以將軍的時間為準
But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom.

51
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:46,935
情況還好麼，將軍？
What cheer, Admiral?

52
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:50,354
下午好，年輕人。你要到哪兒去？
Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

53
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:53,858
17號那兒有個聚會，我想去看看
Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

54
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,821
把這事記入航海日誌 是，將軍
Enter that in the log.
Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,989
應該提醒你，年輕人
A word of advice, young man:

56
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,076
17號地區的暴風雨跡像已經很明顯
Storm signals are up at Number 17.

57
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,494
天氣馬上就要變壞
Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

58
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:08,708
謝謝，我會留神的
Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.

59
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,754
這就是櫻桃樹大街17號
Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

60
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:17,259
喬治?班克斯先生的住所
Residence of George Banks, Esquire.

61
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,221
噢，將軍的話一點都沒錯
Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.

62
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:24,601
17號地區的天氣很惡劣
Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake.

63
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,394
別理她！ 住嘴！
Leave her alone!
Shut up!

64
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,148
我告訴你，不要試圖阻止這個惡人！
I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!

65
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,526
讓她走，我說，她走了真好！
Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance!

66
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:33,694
從她踏進門的那刻起，我就沒喜歡過她
I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

67
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:38,575
但沒有了保姆，誰來對付那兩個孩子？我麼？天！
But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

68
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,911
瞧她那高傲的樣子！
Her and her high and mighty ways!

69
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,955
還有她那張臉，我已經受夠了
And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

70
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,373
事實上，布裏夫人！你就是把全世界的財寶
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute...

71
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,127
都堆在我面前，我也不會再多呆一分鐘
not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

72
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,797
不，不，卡蒂保姆，別走！
No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

73
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,215
別擋著門
Stand away from that door, my girl!

74
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,885
你讓我們怎麼和主人說孩子的事呢？
But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

75
00:07:56,136 --> 00:08:00,933
這與我無關。這是那兩個小野獸最後一次從我這溜走。
It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

76
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:04,145
他們一定在什麼地方。你去動物園找過了麼？
They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park?

77
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,064
你瞭解簡和邁克爾
You know how Jane and Michael is.

78
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,149
你難道不擔心獅子會抓住他們嗎？
Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya?

79
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,737
你知道他們是多喜歡在那籠子周圍玩
You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

80
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:13,947
我不想再廢話了
I said my say, and that's all I'll say.

81
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,741
這所房子已經和我永遠一刀兩斷
I've done with this house forever.

82
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,494
好啊，好極了
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

83
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,538
出門當心別摔了，寶貝
And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

84
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,918
噢，別這樣，卡蒂保姆！
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

85
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:29,464
班克斯夫人！她回來了！
Mrs Banks! She's home!

86
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,926
我們女兒的女兒會敬仰我們 我們將一起歡唱
Our daughter's daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus

87
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:35,012
「幹得好，主張參政的姐妹們」
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

88
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,262
卡蒂保姆，艾倫，晚上好
Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.

89
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,517
我們舉行了一場盛大的聚會！
We had the most glorious meeting!

90
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,937
威伯尼夫人把自己綁在首相的馬車車輪上
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the Prime Minister's carriage.

91
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,399
你們真應該去看看 班克斯夫人，我有句話要對你說
You should've been there.
Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.

92
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,027
還有阿什列夫人被抓走了
And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison...

93
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,196
她一路上邊唱歌邊散發傳單
singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

94
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:54,282
我很高興你回來了，夫人，我已經盡力了
I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me...

95
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,702
謝謝你，卡蒂保姆
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

96
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,330
我就知道我不會看錯的
I always knew you were one of us.

97
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,334
我們是身著裙裝的戰士
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

98
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,337
為婦女的投票權而英勇地戰鬥
And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

99
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,467
儘管我們尊敬每一個男人
Though we adore men individually

100
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:16,224
但作為一個群體，他們是愚蠢的
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

101
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:20,812
班克斯夫人 甩掉昨日的枷鎖
Mrs Banks.
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

102
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,440
肩並肩，我們走向自由
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

103
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:28,152
我們女兒的女兒將會敬仰我們
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

104
00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:32,449
她們將一齊歡唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

105
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,577
「幹得好 主張參政的姐妹們」
"Well done Sister Suffragette"

106
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:38,831
可能的話，我不想冒犯你，但是……
Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I...

107
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,711
從肯辛頓到比林斯門呼聲此起彼伏
From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries

108
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,673
從這片土地的每一個角落 婦女們站起來了
From every corner of the land womankind arise

109
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,636
政治平等 權利平等
Political equality and equal rights with men

110
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:55,182
潘克赫斯特夫人又被銬上
Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

111
00:09:55,434 --> 00:10:01,231
我們不再做溫順的附屬品
No more the meek and mild subservients we

112
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:05,944
為了我們的權力英勇奮鬥
We're fighting for our rights militantly

113
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:07,571
Never you fear

114
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:11,408
班克斯夫人，我能插句話麼？
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

115
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,663
甩掉昨日的枷鎖 班克斯夫人！
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Mrs Banks!

116
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:19,292
肩並肩我們走向自由
And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

117
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:23,798
我們女兒的女兒將會敬仰我們
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

118
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,470
她們將一齊歡唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

119
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,638
「幹得好」 班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

120
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,515
「幹得好」 班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

121
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,976
班克斯夫人！
"Well done, Sister Suf..."
Mrs Banks!

122
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:40,357
什麼事？ 班克斯夫人，我有件事要告訴你
What is it, Katie Nanna?
Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you.

123
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,861
孩子們在哪裏？ 夫人，孩子們……
Where are the children?
The children, madam...

124
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,905
確切地講，不在這裏
to be precise, are not here.

125
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,907
他們又消失了
They've disappeared again.

126
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,243
卡蒂保姆，你確實太粗心了
Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you.

127
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,287
這已經是這周的第三次了
Doesn't it make the third time this week?

128
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:56,250
第四次，夫人。如果不是氣憤之極的話
The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it.

129
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,751
我並不想說他們的壞話
I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but...

130
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:00,212
你估計他們什麼時候能回來？
Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

131
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:04,216
這可不好說。現在請你算一算我的薪水
I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll...

132
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:08,597
噢，天，卡蒂保姆！你不是要走吧？ 班克斯先生會怎麼說？
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

133
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:12,142
他回家後，發現孩子們不見了會很生氣的
He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing.

134
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,688
艾倫，把這些拿開，你知道這東西會讓他多惱火
Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

135
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,606
是的，婦人
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:20,776
卡蒂保姆，我請求你，再想一想
Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider.

137
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,446
想想孩子們，想想班克斯先生
Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks.

138
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:27,867
他剛開始適應你
He was just beginning to get used to you.

139
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,581
各就各位！
Posts, everyone!

140
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:44,511
4，3，2，1，點火！
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

141
00:11:56,024 --> 00:12:01,529
卡蒂保姆，我請求你…… 我的薪水，請！
Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
My wages, if you please.

142
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,617
今晚早了點，是嗎？將軍
Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?

143
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,953
胡說，正點報時，跟往常一樣
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

144
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:11,374
銀行裏的事情還好吧？
How are things in the world of finance?

145
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,878
從沒有比現在更好的時候了，貨幣堅挺，貸款利率不斷上升
Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

146
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,840
英鎊成了全世界的寵物
And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

147
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,259
很好 先生，你那兒的情況怎麼樣？
Good man.
How do things look from where you stand?

148
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,887
很難講
Bit chancy, I'd say.

149
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:26,557
起風了，氣壓也下降了
The wind's coming up and the glass is falling.

150
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,434
我不喜歡這種情況 好，好，好
Don't like the look of it.
Good, good, good.

151
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:34,315
班克斯，毫無疑問你將趕上壞天氣的
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather.

152
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:38,862
班克斯！你聽見了麼？
Banks! Do you hear me?

153
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,032
你好，卡蒂保姆。那一定很重吧。
Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy.

154
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,912
讓我來吧
Allow me.

155
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,830
哼！
Hmph!

156
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:51,542
多可愛的帽子啊！
What a very pretty hat.

157
00:12:57,258 --> 00:13:01,010
就像一位國王
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

158
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,974
騎著他的駿馬，謝謝
Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you.

159
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:09,395
當我擺脫白天的喧囂，回到家，回到妻子身邊
When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife

160
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,358
我是多麼心滿意足，我的生活多麼愉快！
How pleasant is the life I lead

161
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,693
親愛的，有件事和孩子們有關 是的，是的，是的
Dear, it's about the children.
Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:18,572
我按照日程表精確地管理著我的家！
I run my home precisely on schedule

163
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:22,535
6點01分 我走進家門
At 6:01 I march through my door

164
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:26,539
6點02分 放下我的手套和手杖
My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

165
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,459
我的生活始終如一！
Consistent is the life I lead

166
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,587
喬治，孩子們不見了。 太美妙了。
George, they're missing.
Splendid. Splendid.

167
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,467
1910年在愛德華國王的統治下
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

168
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:39,971
做一位英國男人是多麼光榮 這是一個男人唯上的時代
King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men

169
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:43,974
我是城堡的主人 統治者
I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege

170
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:47,563
我管理著我的僕人，孩子們和妻子
I treat my subjects, servants children, wife

171
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:50,066
嚴格且溫和，貴族的行為理應高尚
With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige

172
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,902
現在6點03分，我領地的繼承人們
It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

173
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:57,739
已經洗過了，吃飽了
Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

174
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,828
我會拍拍他們的頭，打發他們去睡覺
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

175
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,709
啊，我的生活多麼氣派！
Ah, lordly is the life I lead

176
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:12,758
威妮弗蕾德，孩子們在哪兒？ 他們不在這裏，親愛的
Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.

177
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,344
什麼？他們當然應該在這兒！他們會在別的地方嗎？
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

178
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:19,764
我不知道，喬治 你不知道？
I don't know, George.
You don't know?

179
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:23,644
他們不見了。卡蒂保姆到處都找遍了
Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

180
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:27,689
我要立即處理這件事
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

181
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,445
請給我接警察局，快！
Give me the police station, quickly, please.

182
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:36,199
我想這件事不必麻煩警察，事實上……
I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter...

183
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,201
請別試圖用什麼事實把事情弄得模糊不清
Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.

184
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:42,414
唯一的事實，很明顯，卡蒂保姆不能勝任她的工作
One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.

185
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:46,710
她使得這個家陷入混亂，我要教訓教訓她……
She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to bo...

186
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:50,340
哦，她已經走了，是嗎？
Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

187
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,759
是的，親愛的，剛剛走
Yes, dear, only just.

188
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,053
喂，呃……我是喬治?班克斯
What, uh... Yes. George Banks here.

189
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:59,474
櫻桃樹大街17號。出了件急事
Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.

190
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,978
請立即派一名警察
I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

191
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,648
喬治，警察來了！
The policeman's here, George!

192
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:08,818
什麼？噢，真及時！服務真好！
What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service.

193
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:11,738
謝謝！晚安
Thank you so much. Good night.

194
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,824
請進，警察先生，請進！ 謝謝！
Come in, Constable. Come in.
Thank you, sir.

195
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:16,619
我在公園那邊巡邏時
While going about my duties on the other side of the park...

196
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,663
發現了兩件遺失的貴重物品
I noted some valuables that had gone astray.

197
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,165
我相信是你的，先生 貴重物品？
I believe they're yours, sir.
Valuables?

198
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:25,211
來，過來
Come along, now. Come along.

199
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,090
簡！邁克爾！
Jane! Michael!

200
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:30,842
威妮弗蕾德，請別激動
Winifred, please don't be emotional.

201
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:35,262
哦，他們今天走了很多路，精疲力盡了
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

202
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:39,436
孩子們，過來
Children, come here at once.

203
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,026
怎麼回事？ 對不起，我們和保姆卡蒂走散了
Well?
I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

204
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:50,196
你知道的，今天風很大，而這個風箏對我們來說大了點
You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

205
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:54,200
在某種意義上說，先生，是風箏跑走了而不是孩子們
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

206
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,704
謝謝，警察先生。我想我能夠控制這件事
Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

207
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,542
說實話，這風箏並不好。我們自己做的
Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves.

208
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,503
也許你可以幫我們做一個……
Perhaps if you helped us to make one...

209
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,507
哦，那很重要，先生。風箏很難控制
Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things.

210
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,301
就在上周，我和我的孩子們……
Why, only last week with me own youngsters...

211
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,970
我非常感謝你送他們回來
I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children.

212
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,350
如果你到廚房看看，廚師會給你弄些吃的
And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

213
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,729
謝謝你，先生。我該回去工作了
Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

214
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,065
謝謝你，警察先生
Thank you, Constable.

215
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:26,278
晚安，小姐。晚安，夫人，晚安，先生
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

216
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,366
廚師會給我弄些吃的。我從沒……
Cook'll find me something. I never...

217
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:34,912
喬治，我非常非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

218
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,249
我猜你大概要談談這件事
I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

219
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
的確！
I would indeed!

220
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,920
艾倫，帶簡和邁克爾到樓上去
Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

221
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:45,258
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:50,346
我就知道。誰首當其衝的負擔這一切？
I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?

223
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:51,973
我！就是這樣！
Me, that's who!

224
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,728
他們不想要一個誠實勤勞的人
They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here.

225
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,273
他們需要的是動物園看守
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

226
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:02,526
我很抱歉，親愛的。我當初之所以選中了卡蒂保姆……
I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna...

227
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,612
是因為她看上去那麼嚴厲
I thought she would be firm with the children.

228
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:06,655
她看上去會嚴格地要求孩子們。
She looked so solemn and cross.

229
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:10,284
威妮弗蕾德，不要把效率和急躁混為一談
Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

230
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:12,287
下次我會試著幹得好一點
I'll try to do better next time.

231
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:15,374
下次？親愛的，過去的四個月裏你已經換了六個保姆
Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months!

232
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:19,169
個個都是不稱職的災星 我同意
And they've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.

233
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,297
給孩子們選保姆是一項重要而細緻的任務
Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task.

234
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:27,804
它要求深入的觀察，公正的判斷，還有識別人的能力
It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.

235
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:32,309
在這種情況下，只好由我親自來……
Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh...

236
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,435
呃，處理了
select the next person.

237
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,021
噢，喬治？！ 顯然想要選出一位合適的保姆
Oh, would you, George?
Obviously the way to find a proper nanny...

238
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,107
就應該採用恰當的方式
is to go about it in a proper fashion.

239
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,070
我要在《泰晤士報》上登一則廣告。請你記下來
I shall put an advertisement in the Times. Take this down please.

240
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,071
當然，是的，親愛的。 招聘
Yes, of course, dear.
Wanted.

241
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,323
呃，不，呃，要求一位……
Uh, no. Uh, required.

242
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:51,539
嚴厲、受人尊敬言談穩重的保姆
Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.

243
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,459
以為英國的保姆應該像一位將軍
A British nanny must be a general

244
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,089
帝國的未來就掌握在她的手中
The future empire lies within her hands

245
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,260
因此我們需要塑造孩童的人
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

246
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,179
應該是一位能夠發號施令的保姆
Is a nanny who can give commands

247
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,807
你記下來了麼，威妮弗蕾德？ 噢，是的，親愛的，一字不差
You getting this, Winifred?
Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

248
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,644
一家英國銀行的運作在準確無誤的基礎上
A British bank is run with precision

249
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:16,356
一個英國家庭也要求絲毫不差
A British home requires nothing less

250
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:21,321
傳統，紀律和規則是我們的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

251
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:25,866
失去了這些，將陷入混亂，災難，無政府狀態
Without them, disorder catastrophe, anarchy

252
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,747
總之，可怕的混亂
In short you have a ghastly mess

253
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,041
精闢，喬治！很有啟迪
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

254
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:34,085
《泰晤士報》會很滿意的
The Times will be so pleased.

255
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,712
父親？ 什麼？
Father?
Yes?

256
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,215
我們已經商量過了
We've discussed everything...

257
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,677
對今天的所做作為，我們感到非常抱歉
and we're very sorry about what we did today.

258
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,972
我想應該是的
I should certainly think so.

259
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,723
從卡蒂保姆那裏跑走是不應該的 是這樣
It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
It was indeed.

260
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,059
我們這麼幹的目的就是想要換一位新的保姆
And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

261
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,230
很明智。我很高興在這件事上能得到你們的幫助
Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

262
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,358
我們認為你會同意的。所以我們寫了一份廣告
We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

263
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,777
什麼廣告 招聘新保姆的
Advertisement for what?
For the new nanny.

264
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,655
你們寫了一份廣告…… 喬治，我想我們應該聽一聽
You wrote an advert...
George, I think we should listen.

265
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:04,910
你說過你需要我們的幫助 但我是……哦，好吧
You said you wanted our help.
But, I... Oh, very well.

266
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:08,413
為兩位極其可愛的孩子招聘一個保姆
"Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children."

267
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,126
及其可愛的？應該說是「極其難管」的
"Adorable." Well, that's debatable, I must say.

268
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:15,588
如果你想得到這個職位
If you want this choice position

269
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,927
你應該開朗活潑
Have a cheery disposition

270
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:24,515
簡，我不是…… 面龐紅潤，沒有疣子
Jane, I don't...
Rosy cheeks, no warts

271
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:29,396
那是我加進去的 精通各種遊戲
That's the part I put in.
Play games, all sorts

272
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:34,318
你必須善良和藹，聰明機智
You must be kind You must be witty

273
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,364
恬美可愛，且美麗漂亮
Very sweet and fairly pretty

274
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:39,657
好了，簡直荒唐透頂…… 喬治，別這樣！
Well, of all the ridic...
George, please!

275
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:43,995
帶我們出遊 款待我們
Take us on outings Give us treats

276
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:47,791
為我們唱歌 還要帶上甜點
Sing songs Bring sweets

277
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,835
從不發火
Never be cross or cruel

278
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:56,800
絕不拿蓖麻油和薄粥糊弄我們
Never give us castor oil or gruel

279
00:19:57,052 --> 00:20:00,680
愛我們如同自己的子女
Love us as a son and daughter

280
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:05,685
還有不能有大麥茶味兒
And never smell of barley water

281
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:09,148
這條也是我加進去的
I put that in too.

282
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:13,777
如果你不斥責我們，壓制我們
If you won't scold and dominate us

283
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,616
我們絕不會做讓你恨我們的事情
We will never you give you cause to hate us

284
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:24,664
我們不會藏起你的眼鏡，讓你找不到
We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

285
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:30,337
把青蛙放在你的床上，或把胡椒粉倒進你的茶裏
Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

286
00:20:30,588 --> 00:20:33,757
好保姆，快點來
Hurry, Nanny

287
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:38,680
此致……敬禮
Many thanks Sincerely

288
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:43,728
簡和邁克爾?班克斯敬上
Jane and Michael Banks

289
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:45,729
謝謝。非常有趣
Thank you. Most interesting.

290
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,523
現在我聽夠了你們的胡言亂語
And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense.

291
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:52,320
回房間去吧
Please return to the nursery.

292
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,958
他們畢竟是個小孩子，他們只是想幫幫忙
They were only trying to help. They're just children.

293
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,044
我知道他們還是小孩子
I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred.

294
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,880
我很慶幸我決定介入這件事情
I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand.

295
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,425
「遊戲，唱歌，甜點」
"Play games, sing songs, give treats."

296
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:17,055
荒唐！毫無疑問
Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever.

297
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:21,059
該開始行動了
Now is the time for action.

298
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:25,065
請告訴我《泰晤士報》的號碼 不，我當然不知道號碼
Give me the Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

299
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:27,775
哦，喬治，你總是這麼強勢
Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

300
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,986
泰晤士報？我是喬治?班克斯
The Times? George Banks here.

301
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:35,951
櫻桃樹大街17號。我要在你們的欄目上登一則廣告
17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

302
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,930
報時槍準備好了麼？ 準備完畢，將軍！
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

303
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,559
請報告，賓納克先生
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

304
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,604
是。風向已經轉變，好像來自一個新的區域
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

305
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,399
是的 先生？ 什麼事？
So it is.
Sir?
What is it?

306
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,237
左舷船首好像出事了
Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

307
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:15,243
我不得不說，一群可怕的人
Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

308
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:24,796
門外的保姆排起了長隊，先生。能讓她們進來了麼？
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

309
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:28,259
艾倫，我說過了8點鐘開始，就8點
Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be.

310
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,302
還有12秒
You see? Twelve seconds to go.

311
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,305
10，9，8…… 各就各位！
Ten, nine, eight... Posts!

312
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,934
7，6，5，4……
Seven, six, five, four...

313
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:40,354
3，2，1！
three, two, one!

314
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:44,526
艾倫，現在8點整了
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

315
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:47,113
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

316
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,991
艾倫，我已經告訴你多遍……
But I have told you time and time again, Ellen...

317
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:52,826
我不喜歡做事沒有條理
I dislike being hurried into things.

318
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:59,084
我不明白，他們一點也不符合咱們的廣告
I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

319
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,681
邁克爾，看！
Michael, look!

320
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,230
不會是一個巫婆吧。
Perhaps it's a witch.

321
00:23:57,482 --> 00:24:01,360
當然不是，巫婆都是騎著掃把
Of course not. Witches have brooms.

322
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:20,047
就是她，咱們想要的人。她看了我們的廣告
It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

323
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:25,137
她符合咱們的每一個條件
Rosy cheeks and everything.

324
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:30,600
艾倫，你可以把她們帶進來了，一次一個
Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

325
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:34,312
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:39,152
你請進，每次一位 謝謝
You may come in one at a time.
Thank you.

327
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:42,864
哦
Oh.

328
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:49,204
你就是簡和邁克爾的父親嗎？
You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?

329
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,500
我說，你是簡和邁克爾的父親嗎？
I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

330
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,127
噢，是的，當然
Well, well ye... Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

331
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,296
你帶了推薦信吧？我可以看看嗎？
You brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

332
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:59,465
哦，我的原則是不提供推薦信
Oh, I make it a point never to give references.

333
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,592
依我看，那已經過時了
A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

334
00:25:01,844 --> 00:25:04,555
是麼？我們還是有必要看一看
Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

335
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:08,098
現在，看看廣告上的要求吧
Now then, the qualifications.

336
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,854
第一條：開朗活潑
"Item one: A cheery disposition."

337
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,855
我從不生氣
I am never cross.

338
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:15,942
第二條：面龐紅潤
"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

339
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:17,527
顯而易見
Obviously.

340
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:21,448
第三條：會做各種遊戲
"Item three: Play games, all sorts."

341
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,159
我可以肯定孩子們會發現我的遊戲花樣繁多
Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

342
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:27,704
這張紙，你從哪裏弄到的？我記得我已經把它撕了
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

343
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:31,793
抱歉，第四條：必須善良和藹
Excuse me. "Item four: You must be kind."

344
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,046
我很善良，但非常嚴格
I am kind, but extremely firm.

345
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:37,340
你丟了什麼東西嗎？ 啊！是
Have you lost something?
Ah! Yeah.

346
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:40,344
那張紙，我想我……
That paper, you see. I thought that I...

347
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,972
你是喬治?班克斯先生嗎？ 什麼？
You are George Banks, are you not?
What?

348
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:46,098
你登了廣告招聘保姆，是嗎？
And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

349
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:50,022
喬治?班克斯 那就好
George Banks.
Very well then.

350
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:52,899
我撕了它，轉過來
I tore it up, turned it over.

351
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,193
又撕了一下，然後扔在哪兒
Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

352
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:58,321
請原諒，你生病了嗎？
I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

353
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:01,074
我希望沒有
I hope not.

354
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,411
現在談談我的薪水吧。關於這一點這上面很模糊
Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

355
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,124
是很模糊 我們有必要明確下來
Very obscure.
We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

356
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:09,876
的確有必要 每隔一個星期二我得休息一天
Yes, we must indeed.
I shall require every second Tuesday off.

357
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,839
每個星期二
Every Tuesday.

358
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:20,430
另外，規定一個試用期也許是明智的做法
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

359
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:31,191
我給你一個星期的時間
Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

360
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:36,404
我去看看孩子們，謝謝你
I'll see the children now. Thank you.

361
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:54,675
邁克爾，把你的嘴閉上，我們不是鱈魚
Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish.

362
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:58,555
別光站在那兒看，走吧
Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward.

363
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:02,308
動作快點
Spit spot!

364
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,769
喬治？ 哈？
George?
Aah!

365
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,813
喬治，你到底在做什麼？
George, what on earth are you doing?

366
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:10,109
我還以為你正在面試那些保姆呢 剛才還是！
I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was! I was!

367
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,943
你是說你已經選完了？
You mean you've selected one already?

368
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,780
是的，都結束了。 那麼，她在哪兒？
Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
Well, where is she?

369
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,450
什麼？她在孩子們的房間裏
What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

370
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,120
我的意思是讓她開始工作了。 你太英明了
I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
How clever of you!

371
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,165
要是我一定會把事情搞砸的
I would have muddled the whole thing.

372
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:27,545
告訴我，她是不是符合我們的所有要求？
Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

373
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:31,466
一切都發生得太快了，我的意思是……
Well, i-it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

374
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,927
她嚴厲嗎？她會發號施令嗎？
Will she be firm? Will she give commands?

375
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:37,473
她能塑造孩子們嗎？
Will she mould our young breed?

376
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:41,226
我想她能
You know, Winifred, I think she will.

377
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,479
那麼，也許最好讓艾倫
I think she will. In that case...

378
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,732
告訴其他的人可以走了
perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

379
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:51,403
其他人？哦，是的，艾倫？ 是的，先生？
The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
Y-Yes, sir?

380
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,617
告訴其他人可以走了，這位置已經有了合適的人選
Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

381
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:59,620
其他人？ 是的，其他人。
The others, sir?
Yes, the others.

382
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,584
她以為我們需要幾個保姆
How many nannies does she think we need in this house?

383
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:10,467
這個位置已經有了合適的人選
The position has been filled.

384
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:17,851
恐怕我們的房間不夠整潔
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

385
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,144
就像一個大熊的窩，對嗎？
It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

386
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:22,772
你的包真滑稽 是地毯
That's a funny sort of bag.
Carpet.

387
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:24,941
你是說包裏裝的是地毯嗎？ 不，是用地毯做的
You mean to carry carpets in?
No. Made of.

388
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:29,362
這是你的房間，從這裏可以欣賞到公園
This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

389
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:32,197
嗯
Hmm.

390
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,412
好吧，畢竟不是白金漢宮
Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.

391
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,666
還挺乾淨
Still, it's clean.

392
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,336
我覺得它很合適
Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.

393
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,007
只是到處需要整理一下
Just needs a touch here and there.

394
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,343
首先，就像我常說的那樣
Well, first things first.

395
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:54,932
掛帽子最合適的地方就是衣帽架
I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

396
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:12,534
哈！這怎麼能用呢？
Ah! This will never do!

397
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:21,169
我更喜歡大一點的
I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

398
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:23,923
但是裏面是空的呀！
There... But there was nothing in it.

399
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:27,093
不要根據表面現象作判斷
Never judge things by their appearance.

400
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:31,430
即使是一隻地毯包。我就從來沒有
Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.

401
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,691
美麗的東西永遠是快樂的
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

402
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:48,615
嗯，也許應該更亮一些
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

403
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,796
我們最好多留心這傢伙
We better keep an eye on this one.

404
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,590
她很狡猾。 她棒極了。
She's tricky.
She's wonderful.

405
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:07,010
這下好多了！
Much better!

406
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:11,057
我瞧瞧
Now, let me see.

407
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,399
奇怪，我總是隨身帶著的。一定放在什麼地方了
That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

408
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,361
什麼東西？ 類型測量尺
What?
My tape measure.

409
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:26,282
你找它來幹什麼？ 我想知道你們倆個屬於哪一類。
What do you want it for?
I want to see how you two measure up.

410
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,706
這是我見過的最好笑的事情。我知道它就在裏面的某個地方
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

411
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,669
啊，哈哈，找到了
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is.

412
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,089
好，過來，快一點！
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

413
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,677
抬起頭來，邁克爾。別無精打采的。
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

414
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,433
跟我想的一樣「非常倔強，多疑」
Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

415
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:54,104
我沒有！ 自己看
I am not!
See for yourself.

416
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:57,190
極其頑固，且多……
"Extremely stubborn and sus..."

417
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,777
多疑！
Suspicious.

418
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:03,657
輪到你了，簡
Now you, Jane.

419
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:08,954
嗯，「愛傻笑，不把東西放好」
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

420
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:11,623
那麼你呢？
How 'bout you?

421
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:16,003
我們來看看吧，拿著！
Very well. Hold this for me.

422
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,551
正如我所預料的，「瑪麗?潑平斯」
As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

423
00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:24,722
「一切都近乎完美」
"Practically perfect in every way."

424
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:28,725
瑪麗?潑平斯！這是你的名字嗎？真可愛
Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

425
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:31,228
謝謝。我也一直很喜歡它
Thank you. I've always liked it.

426
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,732
現在，我們可以開始了吧？ 開始什麼？
Now, shall we get on with it?
Get on with what?

427
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:37,068
在廣告裏，你不是特別提到了會做各種遊戲嗎？
In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

428
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,195
哦，是的！ 很好，那麼……
Oh, yes!
Very well, then.

429
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:42,533
我們的第一個遊戲就叫做「好的開始是成功的一半」
Our first game is called "Well Begun Is Half Done".

430
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,034
我不喜歡，聽上去不太好
I don't like the sound of that.

431
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:47,245
換個名字就叫「讓我們開始整理房間」
Otherwise entitled, "Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

432
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:51,292
我告訴過你她很狡猾
I told you she was tricky.

433
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,546
我們可以開始了麼？ 瑪麗?潑平斯，你認為這是個遊戲麼？
Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

434
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:58,342
這取決於你如何看待它
Well, it depends on your point of view.

435
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,095
你要知道，在每一件我們必須要完成的工作裏
You see, in every job that must be done...

436
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:03,345
都蘊含著快樂的成分
there is an element of fun.

437
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,767
你要發現快樂，抓住它！
You find the fun, and snap!

438
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,103
工作就變成了遊戲
The job's a game.

439
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:13,942
你承擔的每一項任務都變得輕鬆
And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake

440
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:16,278
愉快，充滿了樂趣
A lark, a spree

441
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,199
顯而易見
It's very clear to see

442
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:24,911
一湯匙糖可以
That a spoonful of sugar

443
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:27,582
幫助你把藥喝下去
Helps the medicine go down

444
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,710
甜藥好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

445
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:36,716
只要一湯匙糖就能幫助你把藥喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

446
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:42,723
讓人意猶未盡
In a most delightful way

447
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:49,732
正在築巢的知更鳥，沒有空閒去休息
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest

448
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:53,903
它要一點一點地收集築巢的材料
While gathering his bits of twine and twig

449
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:58,491
儘管它那樣執著於工作，但它仍然唱著快樂的歌
Though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot

450
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:05,664
因為他知道，歌聲會使工作變得輕鬆愉快
He knows a song will move the job along

451
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,721
因為一湯匙糖能幫助你把藥喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

452
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:23,142
甜藥好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

453
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:27,855
只要一湯匙糖能幫助你把藥喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

454
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:33,946
讓人意猶未盡
In a most delightful way

455
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,723
蜜蜂採集花蜜
The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

456
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,479
嗡嗡嗡，飛來飛去，從不厭倦
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

457
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,401
因為它們從采過的每一朵花裏只汲取了一點點
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

458
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,945
因此…… 因此……
And hence
And hence

459
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:51,406
它們發現…… 它們發現……
They find
They find

460
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:57,996
它們的任務不再沉重
Their task is not a grind

461
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:08,550
真無恥
Cheeky.

462
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,680
別沒完沒了得了
Don't be all day about it, please.

463
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:44,088
放我出去！
Let me out!
Let me out!

464
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,686
放我出去！
Let me out!

465
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,982
好了！非常……
Well, that was very...

466
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,568
非常感謝……
Thank you now...

467
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,822
現在，你應該結束了！
When you've quite finished!

468
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:10,409
謝謝！
Thank you.

469
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,082
到此為止吧。請拿上你們的外套和帽子
That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please.

470
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:16,915
接下來，我們去公園
It's time for our outing in the park.

471
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,545
我不想出去，我還想整理房間
I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

472
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:22,923
適可而止是最好不過的了，請跟上來
Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please.

473
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:26,261
讓我瞧瞧，你這樣子還不夠好
Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like.

474
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,846
幸好，還有時間
Still, there's time. There's time.

475
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:32,893
動作快點！出發
Spit spot! And off we go.

476
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:37,106
因為一湯匙糖能幫助你把藥喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

477
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:41,027
甜藥好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

478
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:44,697
只要一湯匙糖能幫助你把藥喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

479
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:49,994
讓人意猶未盡
In the most delightful way

480
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:23,156
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

481
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:27,911
我做我喜歡的事情，我喜歡……
I does what I likes And I likes

482
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,956
我做的事情
What I do

483
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,000
你好，熱愛藝術的人！
Hello, art lovers.

484
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,504
正如你所看到的，今天我是個馬路畫家
Today I'm a screever and as you can see

485
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:42,969
馬路畫家是最高水平的藝術家
A screever's an artist Of highest degree

486
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,934
這是我記憶中所有的作品
And it's all me own work from me own memory

487
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,311
雖然不是出於英國皇家藝術院
Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

488
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,980
但是看上去還是非常不錯的吧？
Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

489
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:57,110
黑煙囪……冒黑煙
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

490
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:02,908
我畫我喜歡的，我喜歡我畫的
I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

491
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,914
我不索取任何報酬
No remuneration do I ask of you

492
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:11,792
但我的帽子很歡迎
But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

493
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:17,673
一兩個銅板
Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

494
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:27,018
等等！別動
Wait! Don't move.

495
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,229
千萬別動
Don't move a muscle.

496
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,692
就呆在那兒！
Stay right where you are.

497
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:39,615
我就知道！瑪麗?潑平斯！
I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

498
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:43,827
很高興再見到你，伯特。這是簡和邁克爾
It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

499
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,582
我上次看見他們，正在追一隻風箏，對吧？
Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

500
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,877
瑪麗?潑平斯要帶我們去公園
Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

501
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,341
去公園？我知道瑪麗?潑平斯是不會的
To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.

502
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,467
別的保姆會帶孩子們去公園，但是……
Other nannies take children to the park.

503
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,931
你們現在是和瑪麗?潑平斯在一起，一下子你們就到了連做夢都想不到的地方
When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of.

504
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:04,017
迅速到你都還沒察覺
And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle"...

505
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,811
最不尋常的事情就開始了
the most unusual things begin to happen.

506
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,397
你再說什麼，我一點也不知道
I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

507
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:13,109
好吧，你知道我本來不應該說的，但是……
Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind...

508
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:16,113
她腦子裏有一個令人興奮的好地方
is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.

509
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:19,576
沿著這些線就能到哪兒，對此我是不應感到驚訝的
Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised.

510
00:39:19,827 --> 00:39:22,995
「在泰晤士河上泛舟」如果你們喜歡出遊，那絕對是個好去處
"Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing.

511
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:26,750
我們到了
Here we go.

512
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:39,305
馬戲團。去看看可愛的馬戲團如何？有獅子和老虎
The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers.

513
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:42,475
舉世聞名的雜技演員為你……
World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats...

514
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:45,854
表演精彩絕倫的節目
of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.

515
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:49,566
Ta-da!

516
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,298
Ta-da!

517
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:16,094
哦，那太可愛了。如果你願意的話，我更想去那兒！
Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

518
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,182
很美，是嗎？典型的英國鄉村景象……
Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside...

519
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,726
好像出自一位真正的鄉村愛好者之手
as done by a true and lovin' hand.

520
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:24,688
沿著這條路走下去，翻過這座山……
Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair...

521
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,067
有一個鄉村集市，不過你現在看不見
down that road and uh, over the hill.

522
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,529
這兒根本就沒有路
I don't see any road.

523
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,240
什麼？沒有路？
What? No road?

524
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:40,289
只要在這兒添點東西就行了……
Just wants a bit of somethin' here...

525
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:44,919
還有那兒
and a bit of somethin' there.

526
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:49,840
好了，一條鄉村小路很適合旅行和探險
There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

527
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,384
請讓我們去吧，瑪麗?潑平斯
Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please?

528
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:56,222
多可愛的地方啊！你不覺得它很可愛嗎？
Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

529
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,893
現在正是時候，瑪麗?潑平斯。沒人注意
Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

530
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:01,103
求求你了，瑪麗?潑平斯！
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

531
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:05,025
我可不願意出自己的醜，謝謝了
I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

532
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:09,070
好吧，我自己來
All right, I'll do it myself.

533
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,281
你要幹什麼？ 變個小魔法
Do what?
Bit of magic.

534
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,408
魔法？ 是的，很容易
A bit of magic?
It's easy.

535
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,163
讓我來看看。你頭腦裏想著
Let's see. You think.

536
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,540
眨一下眼睛
You wink.

537
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:23,336
眨兩下
You do a double blink.

538
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:27,673
閉上眼，跳！
You close your eyes and jump.

539
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:33,389
什麼都沒發生啊
Is something 'sposed to happen?

540
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,519
伯特，別胡鬧了！
Bert, what utter nonsense!

541
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,690
你為什麼總是把很簡單的事情弄複雜了
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

542
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:44,026
把手給我，邁克爾。抬起頭
Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch.

543
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:47,862
1，2
One, two.

544
00:42:02,379 --> 00:42:06,132
瑪麗?潑平斯，你看上去真漂亮
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

545
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:10,261
你真的這樣認為嗎？ 憑良心說，確實是。就像我初次見到你的時候一樣
Do you really think so?
Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

546
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:12,724
你也很棒，伯特
You look fine too, Bert.

547
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:15,018
我記得你說過那兒有一個集市
I thought you said there was a fair.

548
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:18,480
是的，沿著這條路往前，山後就是，記住了嗎？
So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

549
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,816
快來！我聽到了旋轉木馬的聲音
Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

550
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:26,615
告訴他們是伯特讓你們去的 別摔了，弄髒了畫！
Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

551
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,827
多麼美妙的一天
Ain't it a glorious day

552
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,997
就在這五月的早晨
Right as a mornin' in May

553
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:37,209
我想要飛翔
I feel like I could fly

554
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:40,628
別鬧了，伯特
Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

555
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:45,050
你見過這麼嫩綠的草地嗎
Have you ever seen the grass so green

556
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:50,682
或比這更湛藍的天空嗎？
Or a bluer sky

557
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:55,853
噢，跟瑪麗在一起就是一個快樂的假日
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

558
00:42:56,105 --> 00:43:00,317
瑪麗讓你的心變得輕鬆 你一點都沒有變，是吧？
Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

559
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,572
灰暗陰沉的日子裏
When the day is grey and ordinary

560
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:08,576
瑪麗讓它陽光明媚 噢，的確
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, honestly!

561
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:13,374
幸福在她的周圍蕩漾
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

562
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,586
洋水僊正對著小鴿子微笑
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

563
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:21,924
當瑪麗牽著你的手，你感到無比的驕傲
When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

564
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:28,055
你的心跳動比得上一個軍樂隊
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

565
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:34,938
你有點頭暈腦漲了 和瑪麗在一起是一個快樂的節日
You are lightheaded.

566
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,986

570

洋水僊正對著小鴿子微笑
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
Oink, oink.

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

579
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:33,551
像你這樣的紳士少而又少 正在消失
Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed, that's me.

580
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:37,971
你是裹在破舊衣裳裏的鑽石
Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

581
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:42,186
你的血統是高貴的 這誰都知道
Underneath your blood is blue
Common knowledge.

582
00:46:42,437 --> 00:46:46,482
你從不炫耀
You'd never think of pressing your advantage

583
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:50,903
克制是你的原則 是的
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
True.

Right you are. It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winnin'

I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

607
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,761
但，最優秀最出類拔萃的是……
But cream of the crop Tip of the top

608
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:33,433
是瑪麗?潑平斯 就到這裏
Is Mary Poppins

很好，事實上……
Very nice. Very nice, indeed...

620
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:57,407
如果你們不想去其他的地方
if you don't wanna go nowhere.

621
00:51:57,658 --> 00:52:01,118
誰說我們不打算去其他地方？
Who says we're not going anywhere?

622
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,370
管理員！

628
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:55,678
夥計，你聽到了麼？你甘心落後嗎？
Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that?

629
00:52:55,929 --> 00:53:00,016
來吧，咱們比賽一下。女士。這是你最快的速度嗎？
That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?

630
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:01,476
加油，加油！

634
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:17,202
慢點
Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

635
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:20,706
這可真是趟奇特的旅行
Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

636
00:53:20,957 --> 00:53:26,587
請你控制一下自己。咱們不是在賽馬場上
Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.

637
00:53:30,676 --> 00:53:34,638
請跟我來
Follow me, please.

638
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:52,742
早上好 好……呃？怎麼回事……
Good morning. Oh, yes, quite. Wha...

639
00:53:54,828 --> 00:53:57,079
我說！
I say!

640
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,251
你有沒有
Have you ever?

641
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,420
從沒有！
Never!

642
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:14,140
發現狐貍！
View Halloo!

643
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,726
哦，是的，絕對，發現狐貍了
Oh, yes, definitely. A view Halloo.

644
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:20,437
發現狐貍？
View Halloo?

645
00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:25,527
天！又是那些英國兵！
Faith and begorra! 'Tis them Redcoats again!

646
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:29,363
發現狐貍！
View Halloo!
View Halloo!

647
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,367
發現狐貍！
View Halloo!

648
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:33,369
Oh, musha, musha.

649
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,373
可憐的傢伙，讓我來幫你一把吧
Poor lit'I bloke. Let's give him a hand.

650
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:39,959
聖人啊，保佑我們！
Saints preserve us!

651
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,630
呀！
Yikes!

652
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:47,844
跑啊！
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

653
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:59,273
你上來吧，抓好了！
Up you go. Now hang on.

654
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:06,655
你看清楚了麼？這可是了不起的旋轉木馬
Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

655
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,450
過來比試比試呀，你們這幫壞蛋
Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns.

656
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:12,077
我能揍扁你們
I can lick the lot of ya's.

657
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:17,082
快點，美人，快點！
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

658
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,723
噢！騎手們，我可以先行一步嗎？
Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

659
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:11,643
當然可以，夫人
Certainly, ma'am.

660
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:15,815
謝謝 不客氣，夫人
Thank you.
Not at all, ma'am.

661
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:31,206
非常好的成績，先生們
Excellent time, gentlemen.

662
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:35,794
哦，是的，非常好 完美的成績，當然
Oh, yes, quite.
Perfect day for it, of course.

663
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:40,424
多漂亮啊
Oh. Oh, how nice.

664
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:44,221
萬歲！萬歲！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

665
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:47,849
萬歲！萬歲！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

666
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:52,146
現在別動，看鏡頭
Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

667
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,690
瑪麗?潑平斯，請你談談取得勝利後的感受
Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

668
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:57,025
好的，我…… 贏得了巨大的財富和榮譽吧？
Oh, well I...
Gaining fame and fortune.

669
00:56:57,278 --> 00:56:59,738
是的 可以將你的照片刊登在報紙上嗎？
Uh, Yes.
Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

670
00:56:59,988 --> 00:57:01,279
當然，我很願意
Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

671
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,867
除了你精彩的照片外，你能說幾句話描述一下你的心情嗎？
Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

672
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:07,286
好的，我…… 有沒有一個詞能形容你此刻的心情
Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

673
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,875
先生們，先生們，很抱歉
Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.

674
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,376
不過有一個非常好的詞
On the contrary, there's a very good word.

675
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:14,963
對吧，伯特？ 告訴他們是什麼吧
Am I right, Bert?
Tell 'em what it is.

676
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,965
好的
Right!

677
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:21,553
那就是「超級霹靂快樂的不得了」
It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

678
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,723
儘管聽起來很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

679
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,935
但是如果你大聲地說出來，聽起來就好像你很博學
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

680
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:31,063
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

681
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:34,317
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

682
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:37,112
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

683
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:40,575
當我還是一個小男孩的時候，我很害怕說話
Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

684
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:43,701
我父親擰著我的鼻子說我太差勁了
Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

685
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:46,914
但有一天我學會了一個詞，它救了我的鼻子
But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

686
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:49,626
你聽過的最長的一個詞
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

687
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,252
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

688
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,366
儘管聽起來很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

689
00:57:56,618 --> 00:57:59,412
但是如果你大聲地說出來，聽起來就好像你很博學
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

690
00:57:59,662 --> 00:58:02,414
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

691
00:58:02,665 --> 00:58:05,375
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

692
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:08,295
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

693
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:11,380
他周遊世界
He's travelled all around the world and everywhere he went

694
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:14,050
每到一處他就用這個詞，人們都說她很聰明
He'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent"

695
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:17,344
我和羅馬的公爵，印度的邦主一起消遣
When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

696
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,139
我說這個奇怪的詞，他們便請我喝茶
I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

697
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:23,435
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

698
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:26,395
儘管聽起來很糟糕
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

699
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:29,398
但是如果你大聲地說出來，聽起來就好像你很博學
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

700
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:32,443
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

701
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:35,154
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

702
00:58:35,404 --> 00:58:36,821
你知道，你也可以倒過來說……
You know, you can say it backwards, which is...

703
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:39,157
了得不的樂快靂霹級超
dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.

704
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,659
但你不認為這樣太長了點嗎？ 毫無疑問
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
Indubitably.

705
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,995
所以當你實在無話可說的時候，沒有必要沮喪
So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

706
00:58:44,246 --> 00:58:47,414
就想想這個詞吧，然後你會有很多話要說
Here, here! Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

707
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:50,292
不過，要小心用好它，因為它會改變你的生活
But better use it carefully or it could change your life

708
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,834
比如說？ 怎樣？
For example.
Yes?

709
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:55,422
一天晚上，我對一個女孩說起它，這個女孩就成了我的妻子
One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

710
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:59,967
她還是那麼可愛
Ow! And a lovely thing she is too.

711
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:04,095
那就是，超級霹靂快樂的不得了
She's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

712
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,516
超級霹靂快樂的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

713
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:09,019
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

714
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:15,107
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

715
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:25,784
簡！邁克爾！
Jane! Michael!

716
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:32,331
靠近些
Stay close now.

717
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,753
哦，伯特，可惜你那些美麗的畫
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

718
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:40,047
沒關係，它的出處還有好多
Well, there's more where they came from.

719
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:44,093
再說，我就要改行了，這鬼天氣，真能熱死人
Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

720
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,553
來吧，孩子們 再見，伯特
Come along, children.
Bye, Bert.

721
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:49,431
再見
Bye-bye.
Bye, Bert. Bye.

722
00:59:49,682 --> 00:59:51,557
再見，簡和邁克爾
Bye, Jane and Michael.
Bye, Bert.

723
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:55,353
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

724
00:59:55,605 --> 01:00:01,109
La dum da da dum
da da da da dum

725
01:00:15,456 --> 01:00:20,334
不，不，我不想吃你這討厭的藥。
No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

726
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,713
必須得吃麼，瑪麗?潑平斯？
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

727
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:28,842
弄濕腳的人就必須得吃藥
People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

728
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:36,100
我不想吃，我真不想……
I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
Oh!

729
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:47,402
酸橙汁！味道好極了！
Lime cordial! Delicious!

730
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:51,906
草莓汁！
Strawberry! Mmm!

731
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,286
朗姆酒
R-R-Rum punch.

732
01:00:57,537 --> 01:01:01,081
真可口
Quite satisfactory.

733
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:04,668
瑪麗?潑平斯，你永遠都不會離開我們的，是嗎？
Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

734
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,963
你的枕頭底下有沒有手帕？ 嗯
Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
Mm-hmm.

735
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:09,798
如果我們發誓做一個乖孩子，你會留下來嗎？
Will you stay if we promise to be good?

736
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,802
阿呃！那是一個脆弱的諾言。輕易地許下，輕易地違背
Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

737
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:16,512
沒有了你，我們該怎麼辦？
Whatever would we do without you?

738
01:01:16,764 --> 01:01:19,474
我將呆到風向改變了為止
I shall stay until the wind changes.

739
01:01:19,726 --> 01:01:21,810
但是，瑪麗?潑平斯，那會多長時間呢？
But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

740
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:24,061
請安靜些，你們該睡覺了
Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

741
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:28,358
哦，我們根本睡不著。今天遇到了那麼多有趣的事情
Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

742
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:31,319
有嗎？ 是啊！當我們跳進伯特的粉筆畫裏
Did they?
Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

743
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,154
我們騎著旋轉木馬，突然所有的木馬都一躍而起
And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and...

744
01:01:34,405 --> 01:01:36,405
我們飛馳在原野上
And we all went riding in the countryside!

745
01:01:36,657 --> 01:01:40,327
真的嗎？
Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
Really?

746
01:01:40,578 --> 01:01:43,705
瑪麗?潑平斯，你都不記得了嗎？你還得了賽馬冠軍
Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

747
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:47,875
一個像我這樣受尊重的人出現在賽馬會上？你們怎麼敢暗示這樣的事
A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

748
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:50,418
但是我看見了，是你！
But I saw you do it!

749
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:54,049
別說了，否則，我就要叫警察了！明白嗎？
Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

750
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:56,174
確實是這樣的！我看見了！
It did happen! I saw it!

751
01:01:56,426 --> 01:01:59,386
去睡覺吧 不，我不想睡
Go to sleep.
No, I don't want to go to sleep.

752
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:02,014
瑪麗?潑平斯，我們太興奮了！
Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

753
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:05,226
好吧，隨你們的便
Very well, suit yourselves.

754
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:08,437
保持清醒
Stay awake

755
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:13,359
別放鬆你的腦子
Don't rest your head

756
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:16,819
別躺在
Don't lie down

757
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:22,033
你的床上
Upon your bed

758
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:26,704
當月亮漫步在……
While the moon drifts

759
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:31,540
夜空的時候
In the skies

760
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:36,296
別睡著了
Stay awake

761
01:02:36,547 --> 01:02:45,179
不要合上你的眼睛
Don't close your eyes

762
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:52,936
雖然整個世界都已入睡
Though the world Is fast asleep

763
01:02:53,188 --> 01:03:01,570
雖然你的枕頭柔軟舒適
Though your pillow's soft and deep

764
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:09,912
你並沒有昏昏欲睡
You're not sleepy as you seem

765
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:15,124
別睡著
Stay awake

766
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:18,002
別打盹
Don't nod

767
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:23,632
別做夢
And dream

768
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:29,762
別睡著
Stay awake

769
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:35,351
別打盹
Don't nod

770
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:45,153
別做夢
And dream

771
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:59,291
今天天氣很好，賓納克先生。
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!

772
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:03,294
今早不會再有人睡懶覺了，裝雙倍的火藥
No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

773
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:05,713
雙倍的火藥？是，將軍！
A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

774
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:10,510
會震得更厲害，是嗎？
Shake things up a bit, what?

775
01:04:10,553 --> 01:04:13,555
多可愛的早晨啊，艾倫 的確是，夫人
Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
Indeed it is, ma'am.

776
01:04:13,805 --> 01:04:16,765
你把那些臭雞蛋放到我的包裏了嗎？ 放了，夫人
Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:19,935
在艾伯特禮堂的集會結束後，我們將去唐寧街……
After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street...

778
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:23,397
把這些東西扔在首相的身上
to throw things at the Prime Minister.

779
01:04:23,648 --> 01:04:26,692
你今天早上看上去非常好，喬治
Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

780
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:28,986
廚房裏那可怕的噪聲是怎麼回事？
What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

781
01:04:29,237 --> 01:04:32,781
那是廚師在唱歌 唱歌？她怎麼了？
It's Cook singing.
Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

782
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:36,199
她快樂得像一隻蟋蟀，老實講……
She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact...

783
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:39,245
從你僱用瑪麗?潑平斯那天起，這屋子裏似乎發生了……
since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing...

784
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:41,496
不同尋常的變化 有這回事？
seems to have come over the household.
Is that so?

785
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:44,750
就拿艾倫來說吧，她今早沒有打碎一隻盤子
Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

786
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,335
真的？那太不同尋常了 還有……
Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
And another thing.

787
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:51,423
他和廚師總是像貓見了狗一樣打個不停，但是今天
She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today...

788
01:04:51,674 --> 01:04:56,803
艾倫，親愛的，我來給你開門吧 謝謝
Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
Thanks ever so, ducks.

789
01:05:03,143 --> 01:05:07,312
艾倫，快停止你那恐怖的歌聲吧！
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!

790
01:05:07,522 --> 01:05:09,982
把窗戶關上，那鳥叫得我頭痛
And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

791
01:05:10,233 --> 01:05:14,278
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

792
01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:21,952
安靜點，你們鬧得主人頭痛
Quiet! You're giving the master an headache.

793
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,746
我很擔心你今天早上感覺不好
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

794
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:28,374
誰說我的感覺不好？我非常健康
Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle.

795
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,252
我只是搞不懂為什麼每個人都這麼興奮
I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

796
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:34,379
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

797
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,216
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

798
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:42,053
這花真可愛，謝謝，寶貝！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

799
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:45,682
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

800
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:47,933
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

801
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:50,562
停！停！停！ 早上好，父親
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Good morning, Father.

802
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,440
早上好 瑪麗?潑平斯教給我們最有趣的一個詞
Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

803
01:05:53,691 --> 01:05:56,693
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

804
01:05:56,944 --> 01:05:59,571
你們到底在說些什麼？超級……
What on earth are you talking about? Supercali...

805
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:01,488
究竟是什麼意思？
Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is.

806
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,740
當你不知道該說什麼的時候，你就可以這樣說
It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

807
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:06,535
但是我總是知道我該說些什麼，走開，請你們快點離開這裏
Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

808
01:06:06,786 --> 01:06:11,372
好的，父親 超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Yes, Father. Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:16,085
威妮弗蕾德，你能解釋一下這不體面的喧鬧究竟是為什麼嗎？
Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

810
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,880
我沒覺得有什麼需要解釋的
I don't think there's anything to explain. Do you?

811
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:21,423
很明顯你今天早晨有點不舒服
It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

812
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:23,427
孩子們近來只是想讓你感覺好一些
The children just came in to make you feel better.

813
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:26,096
我最後一次聲明
I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all.

814
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:29,432
我並沒有感到不舒服，我的狀態很好
I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood.

815
01:06:29,683 --> 01:06:32,267
我不需要別人的安慰
I do not require being made to feel better!

816
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:35,938
但是你常說希望我們的家充滿了歡樂和愉快
But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

817
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:38,772
威妮弗蕾德，在愉快和輕率不負責任之間……
Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation...

818
01:06:39,025 --> 01:06:41,443
我要做一點區分
between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

819
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:45,697
打斷一下，親愛的，大家各就各位！
Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

820
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:48,324
我並不反對任何人的歡樂和愉快
I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant.

821
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:50,326
但我堅持合乎傳統的禮儀
But I do expect a certain decorum.

822
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:53,288
我要告訴你的是，我不會袖手旁觀
I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by...

823
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:58,501
看著那個女人，瑪麗?潑平斯摧毀這個家庭的規矩
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and...

824
01:06:58,919 --> 01:07:01,296
自從她來了以後
There's something odd, I may say extremely odd...

825
01:07:01,546 --> 01:07:03,964
這房子裏出了很多非常奇怪的事情
about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived.

826
01:07:04,215 --> 01:07:09,219
我想讓你知道，我已經注意到了 是的，親愛的
And I want you to know that I've noticed it!
Yes, dear.

827
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:13,015
還有件事情 什麼，親愛的？
One thing more.
Yes, dear?

828
01:07:13,265 --> 01:07:15,057
找個人把鋼琴修理一下
I suggest you have this piano repaired.

829
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:18,227
當我坐在一件樂器前面的時候，我希望它別走調
When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

830
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:21,272
可是，喬治，你平常不彈呀！
But, George, you don't play.

831
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:26,736
夫人，這並不重要！
Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

832
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:42,500
讓我來看看，首先，我們得去找一位調音師
Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners.

833
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:45,253
然後去考利夫人的……
And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...

834
01:07:45,503 --> 01:07:48,922
商店，買些姜味麵包 哈，姜味麵包！
Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

835
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:51,509
然後還要到魚販那兒買一尾新鮮的鰨科魚
And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole...

836
01:07:51,761 --> 01:07:53,011
以及一品脫對蝦
and a pint of prawns.

837
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:56,013
呃，邁克爾，別在後頭慢慢吞吞的
Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

838
01:07:56,264 --> 01:08:00,433
哈嗨！
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

839
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,270
很高興見到你們 早上好，將軍
Good day to you!
Good morning, Admiral.

840
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:08,609
邁克爾，今天我們去哪兒探險？
Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today?

841
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:12,403
是去和霍屯督人戰鬥，還是去尋找寶藏？
Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

842
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:14,697
我們打算去買點魚
We're going to buy some fish.

843
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:18,116
非常好！全速前進
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

844
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:20,202
遵命，長官
Aye, aye, sir.

845
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:22,328
小伙子，讓我們繼續
Let's put our backs into it, lad.

846
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,792
注意外表整潔，這是這兒的規矩
More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

847
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:31,963
是安德魯
It's Andrew!

848
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:37,636
唔，不要太快，我一個字都沒聽清你說的
Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying.

849
01:08:38,846 --> 01:08:44,351
又發作了？可憐的人！
Again? Och! Oh, the poor man!

850
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,777
天主保佑你
Bless you.

851
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,239
當然，不能耽擱，我們立刻就去
Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.

852
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,117
非常感謝你
And thank you very much.

853
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,495
他說了什麼？ 他說，不客氣
What did he say?
He said, "You're welcome".

854
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:07,830
他還說了什麼？ 我認為他什麼都沒有說
What else did he say?
I don't think he said anything.

855
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:10,041
你總是什麼都知道
You know best, as usual.

856
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:16,672
我以為我們要去買點魚 計劃有些變動
I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
There's been a change of plans.

857
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:21,551
跟上，別走丟了
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

858
01:09:28,392 --> 01:09:30,727
安德魯，擔心起不了任何作用
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

859
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:34,481
你為何不回家休息休息一會兒呢？
Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

860
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:47,764
哦，伯特，很高興你也在這裏 我已聽說就立即趕過來了
Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
I came over the moment I heard.

861
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:49,849
他怎麼樣了？
Well, how is he?

862
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,768
說實話，我從來沒見他這麼糟糕過
I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!

863
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,020
他們怎麼跟來了？你知道，這病有傳染性
How about them? It's contagious, you know.

864
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:59,483
我們會長水痘嗎？ 絕對不會的
Shall we get spots?
Oh, highly unlikely.

865
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:03,862
哦，艾伯特叔叔 天主保佑，保佑我的靈魂
Oh, Uncle Albert!
Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

866
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:07,366
是瑪麗?潑平斯，我很高興
It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...

867
01:10:07,617 --> 01:10:10,827
我很高興見到你，瑪麗 艾伯特叔叔，你發過誓的
I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

868
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:13,705
我知道……
Oh, I kn... I know, I...

869
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:17,501
我努力了，真的……
But I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I...

870
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,379
但是我太喜歡笑了，你知道嗎？
But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well...

871
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,049
我一旦笑起來，就無法控制
And when I start, it's all up with the...

872
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,884
就像現在這樣
That's what happens to me.

873
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:31,055
我喜歡笑！我的天！
I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!

874
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:34,683
你看到了，我情不自禁
I can't help it. You can see that.

875
01:10:34,934 --> 01:10:38,478
我就是喜歡笑，沒別的
I just like laughing, that's all.

876
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:42,481
簡，你敢！你會讓他病情惡化的！
Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse.

877
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:47,153
情況確實挺嚴重的 是的，無論如何，你都必須保持嚴肅
It's really quite serious!
Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face.

878
01:10:47,403 --> 01:10:52,156
上次，我們花了三天時間才把他弄下來
Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

879
01:10:53,077 --> 01:10:56,621
我愛歡笑
I love to laugh

880
01:10:56,955 --> 01:11:00,457
爽朗的清晰的長久的笑
Loud and long and clear

881
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:04,292
我愛歡笑
I love to laugh

882
01:11:04,878 --> 01:11:08,089
一年比一年嚴重
It's getting worse every year

883
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,425
我越是笑
The more I laugh

884
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:14,512
就越是感到高興
The more I fill with glee

885
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:18,724
你在這裏起不到任何幫助 越是高興
You're no help at all.
The more the glee

886
01:11:19,184 --> 01:11:22,477
我就越是一個愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

887
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:24,563
這很令人為難
It's embarrassing.

888
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:29,566
我就越是一個愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

889
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:37,658
有些人從鼻子裏笑出來
Some people laugh through their noses

890
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,746
聽上去就像這樣
Sounding something like this

891
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,582
真煩人！
Dreadful!

892
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,836
有些人從牙縫裏笑出聲來
Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

893
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:52,672
嘶嘶嘶，就像一條蛇
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

894
01:11:52,924 --> 01:11:55,968
依我看，一點意思都沒有
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

895
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:59,471
有些人笑得很快
Some laugh too fast

896
01:12:00,431 --> 01:12:05,352
有些笑得很短暫
Some only blast

897
01:12:05,644 --> 01:12:09,855
其他人，就像鳥兒一樣咯咯地笑
Others, they twitter like birds

898
01:12:11,108 --> 01:12:13,025
你知道麼，你和他一樣嚴重
You know, you're as bad as he is.

899
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:18,823
有一種人從不掩飾他們的情緒
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

900
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:27,497
當有趣的事情向我襲來
When things strike me as funny

901
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:32,168
我無法將它隱藏
I can't hide it inside and squeak

902
01:12:32,169 --> 01:12:35,505
不得不哈哈大笑
As the squeakelers do

903
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:42,595
只要一開始笑，就得開懷大笑
I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

904
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:45,848
然後
And laugh

905
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:47,432
哈哈大笑
Too

906
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:49,434
太好了！
How nice!

907
01:12:49,686 --> 01:12:52,854
我一直期待你也來
I was hoping you'd turn up.

908
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:57,109
我們在一起過得很愉快
Turn up! We always have such a jolly time.

909
01:12:57,609 --> 01:13:02,113
我們愛笑
We love to laugh

910
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:05,950
爽朗的清晰的長久的笑
Loud and long and clear

911
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:09,829
我們愛笑
We love to laugh

912
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,289
這樣每個人都能聽到
So everybody can hear

913
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:16,042
你越是笑
The more you laugh

914
01:13:16,293 --> 01:13:18,670
哎喲，你們兩個別笑，回來
Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

915
01:13:18,922 --> 01:13:21,048
你越是充滿快樂
The more you fill with glee

916
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:24,883
你越是快樂
The more the glee

917
01:13:25,136 --> 01:13:30,348
我們就越是愉快的人
The more we're a merrier we

918
01:13:33,352 --> 01:13:37,439
歡迎你們，小朋友，請隨意
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

919
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,442
沒錯，把椅子拉上來
That's right. Pull up a chair.

920
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:42,275
是的，拉上來……
Oh, pull up...

921
01:13:42,527 --> 01:13:45,529
我不得不說你們是在出洋相
I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

922
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,408
說到出洋相，我倒是想起我的哥哥
Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.

923
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,827
他在鐘錶廠有一份輕鬆的工作
He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

924
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:54,036
在鐘錶廠？他做什麼？
In a watch factory? What does he do?

925
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:59,041
他一整天閒著做鬼臉（作鍾表面）
He stands about all day and makes faces!

926
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:04,755
他在一家鐘錶廠做鬼臉……
He makes faces in a watch fact...

927
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:09,218
你編的吧？
You made that up. I know.

928
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:13,471
太好了
That's so good!

929
01:14:13,723 --> 01:14:18,183
瞧瞧你們的樣子
Such behaviour!

930
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:25,066
這是我見過的最不光彩的一幕，我情願我不再叫瑪麗?潑平斯
Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

931
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:28,485
說到名字，我知道一個有一隻木頭假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解為：我知道有個人，他有一隻叫做史密斯的木頭假腿）
Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

932
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:31,989
那他的另一條腿叫什麼？
What's the name of his other leg?

933
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,325
很有意思吧？那他的另一條腿叫什……
Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other...

934
01:14:35,577 --> 01:14:37,828
孩子們，下午茶時間到了
Now, then, children, it's time for tea.

935
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,289
我可不願意我的日程被打亂
I will not have my schedule interrupted.

936
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,251
哦，請留步，看，我已經為你們準備了上好的茶
Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

937
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:46,501
這茶已經涼了
And it's getting cold!

938
01:14:46,753 --> 01:14:52,090
我本以為你會……
Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that...

939
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,012
好極了！非常感謝！
Splendid! Thank you very much!

940
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:59,515
請把腳收回去。啊，當心麵包和黃油
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

941
01:14:59,766 --> 01:15:03,603
我知道她會這樣做的。 這也是合乎傳統的茶。
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

942
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:07,063
我猜，你想要我做的下一件事情就是為你倒茶
Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out.

943
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:11,775
好吧，如果有必要，我一定去做
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

944
01:15:11,777 --> 01:15:15,697
如果你們不要像一群笑個不停的獵狗
If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas!

945
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:17,657
兩塊糖嗎？艾伯特叔叔？ 是的，謝謝
Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
Yes, please.

946
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:20,994
伯特，你呢？ 噢，不，不，不要糖
Uh, Bert?
Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

947
01:15:21,245 --> 01:15:24,705
我很高興你上來。如果你不來的話，就不好玩了
I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

948
01:15:24,957 --> 01:15:28,001
給你自己還有邁克爾加點牛奶
Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

949
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:30,169
你不覺得今年的這個時候天氣非常的好嗎？
Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

950
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,629
哦，是的。呃，談到天氣……
Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather...

951
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,839
有一天，天很冷
the other day when it was so cold...

952
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:38,551
我的一個朋友想去買件長一點的內衣
a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know.

953
01:15:38,802 --> 01:15:41,846
售貨員問，你打算要多長的（也可理解為：你打算要穿多久的）
The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"

954
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:47,142
我的朋友回答說，大概從9月到3月
And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

955
01:15:50,147 --> 01:15:54,316
簡！別太放肆了！
Jane! Control yourself!

956
01:15:54,568 --> 01:15:58,905
孩子們，麻煩你們坐到桌子旁邊來
Children, will you please sit up properly at the table?

957
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:02,073
你的茶，艾伯特叔叔 噢，謝謝，親愛的
Your tea, Uncle Albert.
Oh, thank you, my dear.

958
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:07,579
我很開心，多麼希望你們能一直留在這裏啊
I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

959
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,497
我們很高興不得不留下，因為沒有路下去
We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

960
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,126
哦不，路是有的
Oh, no, there is a way.

961
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:15,754
坦誠地講，我不願提起它……
Frankly I, I don't like to mention it...

962
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,004
因為你得不得不想一些悲傷的事情
because you have to think of something sad.

963
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:20,257
那麼請開始吧
Then do get on with it, please!

964
01:16:20,508 --> 01:16:23,260
讓我想想看
Let me see.

965
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,763
我知道一件非常合適的事情
I've got the very thing.

966
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:30,516
昨天隔壁的女士應聲去開門，一個人站在門外
Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there.

967
01:16:30,768 --> 01:16:35,772
他對女士說，我非常抱歉，我剛剛軋了你的貓
And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

968
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:39,484
哦，真悲慘 可憐的貓咪
Oh, that's sad.
The poor cat.

969
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:42,779
接著，那個人說，我很願意替代那隻貓
And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat."

970
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,867
女士說，可以，但有一點，你捉老鼠的技術好不好？
And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

971
01:16:50,953 --> 01:16:54,289
我真的很努力讓自己傷心點，但是……
Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do.

972
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:58,919
一切都那麼好笑，我不能……
But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't...

973
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,463
我禁不住……
I can't help...

974
01:17:03,466 --> 01:17:07,010
這已經夠了
That will be quite enough of that!

975
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,470
我們該回家了
It's time to go home.

976
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,304
唉，那太讓人難過了 哦，不！
Oh, that is sad.
Oh, no!

977
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:16,268
那是我聽過的最難過的事情了
Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

978
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,312
來吧，孩子們
Come along, children. Spit spot!

979
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:21,065
你們必須得走嗎？
Must you really go?

980
01:17:21,315 --> 01:17:23,941
你知道，大家來看望我
You know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

981
01:17:24,193 --> 01:17:28,196
我們一起過得很愉快，然而他們不得不回家
And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home.

982
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:32,409
對此我會感到非常非常的傷心
And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

983
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:35,119
別難過，我們會很快再來的
Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

984
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,163
我們過得非常開心
We had a lovely time.

985
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:39,791
伯特，照顧好艾伯特叔叔，好嗎？
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

986
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:44,879
我會再陪他呆一會兒的 謝謝，來吧
I'll sit with him a while.
Thank you. Come on.

987
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:49,758
艾伯特叔叔，我有一個笑話專門留給這樣的場合的
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.

988
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:53,177
你想聽聽看嗎？ 好啊，我非常感激
Would you like to hear it?
I'd be so grateful.

989
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:56,806
不必客氣，這是關於我爺爺的
Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see?

990
01:17:57,058 --> 01:17:59,309
有一天晚上，我爺爺做了一個惡夢
And one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

991
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,311
他害怕極了，以至於把枕頭咬成了碎片
So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits.
Yes.

992
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:04,480
成了碎片……第二天早晨，我說……
To bits.
Yes.
Next morning I says...

993
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:06,022
你感覺還好嗎？爺爺？
"How do you feel, Granddad?"
Yes.

994
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:11,820
他回答，呃，不壞，只是有點口乾
He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

995
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,618
我常說，沒有什麼東西比得上一個好笑話
Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

996
01:18:17,869 --> 01:18:23,540
確實是，啥也比不上好笑話
No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That...

997
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:41,723
班克斯，你今晚晚了些，是嗎？
Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?

998
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,894
我說，班克斯！出了什麼問題了，班克斯？
I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks?

999
01:18:46,145 --> 01:18:50,106
班克斯！
Banks!

1000
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:57,279
噢，父親，真高興你回來了 想聽個笑話嗎？
Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
Want to hear a joke?

1001
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,991
我們今天下午和瑪麗?潑平斯在一起過得非常愉快
We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

1002
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,577
說到下午的事情，那個笑話是這樣的
Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this.

1003
01:19:02,828 --> 01:19:04,871
我知道有個人名字叫史密斯，他有條假腿
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

1004
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:07,915
史密斯？我們不認識叫史密斯的人
Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

1005
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:12,710
笑話還沒有講完，另一個傢伙問，他的另一條腿叫什麼名字
And there was a second chap, and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1006
01:19:12,963 --> 01:19:15,756
我們還在天花板上開了一個非常棒的茶會
And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

1007
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,633
哦，孩子們，請安靜
Oh, children, please be quiet.

1008
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,552
瑪麗?潑平斯說，如果我們乖，她還會帶我們去那兒的
Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

1009
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:25,097
哦，瑪麗?潑平斯這樣說的嗎？
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?

1010
01:19:25,348 --> 01:19:27,932
請回到你們自己的房間去，好嗎？
Will you please return to your room.

1011
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:31,645
瑪麗?潑平斯，請隨我來好嗎？
Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

1012
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:35,357
好的
As you wish.

1013
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:41,655
瑪麗?潑平斯，我很遺憾，有些話我不得不說
Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

1014
01:19:44,325 --> 01:19:47,702
晚上好，喬治，有什麼問題嗎？ 我恐怕是的
Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid there is.

1015
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:51,247
我很想留下來，但是我不得不換衣服了，因為今晚還有個集會
I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

1016
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:53,416
威妮弗蕾德，我希望你能留下來
Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

1017
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:55,418
好的，喬治，當然
Oh, yes, George, of course.

1018
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:59,588
瑪麗?潑平斯，我不得不說，我對你感到非常失望
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

1019
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,300
終於輪到她了，我以前就聽過主人這樣講話
She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

1020
01:20:03,552 --> 01:20:06,427
我不否認對於孩子們將全部的時間……
I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children...

1021
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,432
都浪費在毫無意義的遊戲上，我應該承擔一定的責任
to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

1022
01:20:10,683 --> 01:20:13,351
但是，現在已經到了讓他們認識到生活的嚴肅性的時候
But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

1023
01:20:13,603 --> 01:20:15,521
但是，喬治，他們還是孩子
But, George, they're only children.

1024
01:20:15,771 --> 01:20:17,646
精確地講，鑒於已經發生的……
Precisely. And in the light of what has happened...

1025
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:20,108
喬治，你肯定你在說些什麼嗎？
George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

1026
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,233
我相信我知道，威妮弗蕾德
I believe I do, Winifred.

1027
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:26,071
一家英國銀行運作於準確無誤的基礎之上
A British bank is run with precision

1028
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:29,951
一個英國家庭也要運作與絲毫不差的基礎上
A British home requires nothing less

1029
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:34,247
傳統，紀律和規則是我們必須的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

1030
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:37,541
沒有了它們，混亂，無序……
Without them disorder, chaos

1031
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,667
道德崩潰
Moral disintegration

1032
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:43,422
總之，帶來的是可怕的，混亂不堪的局面 我非常贊同
In short you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.

1033
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:47,300
孩子們必須被引導，塑造和教導
The children must be moulded shaped and taught

1034
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:50,804
生活是一場終究要面對和參與的戰鬥
That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

1035
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:53,638
總之，我很驚訝地聽到我的孩子們討論……
In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about...

1036
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,516
跑到馬路上的粉筆畫裏……
popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures...

1037
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,935
與馴馬師聯歡，獵狐
consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting.

1038
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:01,229
當然，這件事本身我並不反對
Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much.

1039
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,897
畢竟，它是傳統的活動
At any rate, it's traditional.

1040
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,484
但是，在天花板上的茶會，請問是怎麼回事？
But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.

1041
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:10,447
在天花板上開茶會，以及其它各種令人疑惑的出遊！
Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

1042
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:14,826
如果他們必須出遊的話，那麼，出遊應該有
If they must go on outings These outings ought to be

1043
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,828
明確的目標和……是的，實際意義
Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality

1044
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:19,662
還有那些愚蠢的話
These silly words like

1045
01:21:19,915 --> 01:21:23,167
比如超……超級……
Superca... Super...

1046
01:21:23,418 --> 01:21:26,545
超級霹…… 超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Superca...
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1047
01:21:26,797 --> 01:21:28,297
是的，很好，就是你說的
Yes, well done. You said it.

1048
01:21:28,548 --> 01:21:30,716
到畫裏面
And popping through pictures

1049
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:34,635
毫無疑義，沒有任何必要
Have little use fulfil no basic need

1050
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:37,097
他們需要開始認識真正的現實
They've got to learn the honest truth

1051
01:21:37,348 --> 01:21:39,474
儘管年紀還小，他們必須學會……
Despite their youth They must learn

1052
01:21:39,725 --> 01:21:43,436
向您那樣的生活 正是如此
About the life you lead
Exactly.

1053
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:48,692
他們需要體會統計分類帳差額簿的興奮
They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

1054
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:52,903
成千個數字整齊地排成一行 很對
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.

1055
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:56,782
當瞥一眼顯示利潤上升的圖標
When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

1056
01:21:57,032 --> 01:22:01,161
興奮就溢滿他們那小小的心靈 的確如此
Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely!

1057
01:22:01,412 --> 01:22:05,706
他們應該學著沿著你的腳印走路 是的
It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.

1058
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:09,627
滿懷驕傲地沿著你的筆直且狹窄的道路前進 帶著驕傲
To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.

1059
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:13,673
明天，正如你所建議的那樣
Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

1060
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:17,302
簡和邁克爾將會穿著整齊地和你一起
Jane and Michael will be at your side

1061
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:20,136
好極了，你說的準確無誤……
Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...

1062
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:22,723
和我一起？去哪兒？
At my side? Where are we going?

1063
01:22:22,974 --> 01:22:24,725
當然是去銀行，完全按照您的建議
To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

1064
01:22:24,976 --> 01:22:26,893
我的建議？ 當然
I proposed?
Of course.

1065
01:22:27,145 --> 01:22:29,563
現在，如果你不介意，明天對於孩子們來講是個重要的日子
Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children.

1066
01:22:29,814 --> 01:22:34,984
我要讓他們睡個好覺，晚安
I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

1067
01:22:43,994 --> 01:22:47,579
威妮弗蕾德，我說過要帶孩子們去銀行嗎？
Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

1068
01:22:47,831 --> 01:22:50,583
聽上去確實是的，親愛的 哦
It certainly sounded that way, dear.
Oh.

1069
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,918
為什麼不呢？一個極好的主意！
And why not? A capital idea!

1070
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:56,172
這正是對付眼下混亂局面的一劑良藥
Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary...

1071
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:58,590
他們在這裏接觸的都是女人的不切實際的想法
female thinking they get around here all day long.

1072
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:00,424
好主意，非常好
Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

1073
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:04,512
好主意，非常好
Good idea. Quite right.

1074
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:07,514
瑪麗?潑平斯，我們不讓你走
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

1075
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:09,601
走？你們到底在說什麼？
Go? What on earth are you talking about?

1076
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:14,104
你不是被解雇了嗎？ 解雇？當然沒有！我從來沒有被解雇過！
Didn't you get sacked?
Sacked? Certainly not!I am never sacked!

1077
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,983
哦，瑪麗?潑平斯！ 好噢，好噢
Oh, Mary Poppins!
Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

1078
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:19,610
我也不是五朔節花柱，請別圍著我轉。
hurray, hurray, hurray...
Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

1079
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:22,779
但 但什麼但……
But?
Goats butt, birds fly...

1080
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,949
孩子們，你們必須早點睡覺，明天要跟你們的父親一起出去
and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

1081
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,118
別這樣，求求你 跟父親出去？
Come along, please.
An outing with Father?

1082
01:23:28,369 --> 01:23:30,162
是的 我不信
Yes.
I don't believe it.

1083
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:35,375
他以前從來沒有帶我們出去過 他從來沒有帶我們去任何地方
He's never taken us on an outing before.
He's never taken us anywhere.

1084
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,208
你怎麼做到的？ 做到什麼？
However did you manage it?
Manage what?

1085
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:39,962
你一定用了什麼方式把這主意塞到他的腦瓜裏了
You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

1086
01:23:40,213 --> 01:23:42,381
胡說！
What an impertinent thing to say!

1087
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:45,133
我怎麼可能把主意塞進人們的腦袋裏？真是的！
Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

1088
01:23:45,384 --> 01:23:47,676
他要帶我們去哪裏？ 去銀行
Where's he taking us?
To the bank.

1089
01:23:47,928 --> 01:23:52,514
哇~邁克爾，去城裏！我們能看到好多風景，爸爸會指給我們看
Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us.

1090
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:55,853
是的，多數風景他能發現
Well, most things he can.

1091
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:59,396
但有時候，我們所愛的人卻不能看到……
But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own...

1092
01:23:59,647 --> 01:24:03,650
他眼皮底下的事情 眼皮底下的？
can't see past the end of his nose.
Past the end of his nose?

1093
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:07,779
是的，有時候一些小事情其實非常重要
Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

1094
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:09,865
哦，看啊！這是主教座堂
Oh, look! The cathedral.

1095
01:24:10,116 --> 01:24:13,202
爸爸每天都從旁邊經過，他常看到
Father passes that every day. He sees that.

1096
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:19,332
每天清晨，在聖保羅大教堂的台階上
Early each day to the steps of St Paul's

1097
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:25,880
有一位孤獨的老婦人
The little old bird woman comes

1098
01:24:26,132 --> 01:24:29,217
用她自己獨特的方式
In her own special way

1099
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:33,637
向人們叫賣著
To the people she calls

1100
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:36,681
來買吧
Come buy my bags

1101
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:40,769
鳥食
Full of crumbs

1102
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:44,023
喂餵這些小鳥
Come feed the little birds

1103
01:24:44,273 --> 01:24:47,400
照顧它們
Show them you care

1104
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:54,073
你會感到快樂
And you'll be glad if you do

1105
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:57,493
它們的幼鳥非常飢餓
Their young ones are hungry

1106
01:24:57,745 --> 01:25:00,747
它們的鳥巢非常簡陋
Their nests are so bare

1107
01:25:00,997 --> 01:25:11,298
只要花您兩便士
All it takes is tuppence from you

1108
01:25:11,548 --> 01:25:14,967
來餵這些小鳥
Feed the birds

1109
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,347
一袋兩便士
Tuppence a bag

1110
01:25:18,597 --> 01:25:21,682
只要兩便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1111
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:25,394
兩便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1112
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:28,731
來餵這些小鳥
Feed the birds

1113
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:32,318
她正是這樣叫賣
That's what she cries

1114
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:35,153
在頭頂上
While overhead

1115
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:39,156
鳥兒在空中盤旋
Her birds fill the skies

1116
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:44,745
主教座堂頂上的所有聖人和使徒雕像
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles

1117
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:51,002
都注視著她
Look down as she sells her wares

1118
01:25:51,252 --> 01:25:54,338
雖然你看不見
Although you can't see it

1119
01:25:54,589 --> 01:25:57,925
但每次有人顯示出
You know they are smiling

1120
01:25:58,176 --> 01:26:01,428
他的愛心，購買鳥食的時候
Each time someone shows

1121
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:07,642
你知道雕像們正在微笑
That he cares

1122
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:11,061
雖然老婦人的叫賣聲
Though her words

1123
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:15,149
微弱而簡單
Are simple and few

1124
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,444
聽，你聽
Listen, listen

1125
01:26:18,695 --> 01:26:23,616
她在向你呼喚
She's calling to you

1126
01:26:23,867 --> 01:26:26,786
喂餵這些小鳥
Feed the birds

1127
01:26:27,036 --> 01:26:30,621
一袋兩便士
Tuppence a bag

1128
01:26:30,874 --> 01:26:34,751
只要兩便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1129
01:26:35,002 --> 01:26:40,423
兩便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1130
01:27:09,076 --> 01:27:11,702
雖然老婦人的叫賣聲
Though her words

1131
01:27:11,954 --> 01:27:15,623
微弱而簡單
Are simple and few

1132
01:27:15,874 --> 01:27:19,085
聽，你聽
Listen, listen

1133
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:24,256
她在向你呼喚
She's calling to you

1134
01:27:24,507 --> 01:27:27,800
喂餵這些小鳥
Feed the birds

1135
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:32,473
一袋兩便士
Tuppence a bag

1136
01:27:32,723 --> 01:27:38,436
只要兩便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1137
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:40,521
兩便士
Tuppence

1138
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:49,072
一袋
A bag

1139
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:11,884
現在給我記住，銀行是一個安靜且莊重的地方。所以要表現出我們最好的舉止
Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

1140
01:28:12,135 --> 01:28:15,011
我還以為那是你的銀行 好吧，我是銀行裏面一個年輕的職員……
But I thought it was your bank.
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers...

1141
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:17,515
所以在某種程度上是，有那麼幾分
so in a sense it is, sort of.

1142
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:21,642
邁克爾，看！
Michael, look!

1143
01:28:21,895 --> 01:28:23,729
是她 誰？
It's her!
Who?

1144
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,066
她是誰？ 賣鳥食的老婦人，就像瑪麗?潑平斯所描述的
It's who?
The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be.

1145
01:28:28,317 --> 01:28:30,901
你確實看到她了，對吧，父親？ 當然我能看到她
You do see her, don't you, Father?
Well, of course I can see her.

1146
01:28:31,153 --> 01:28:33,071
離我眼皮子這麼近的我能看不到？
Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

1147
01:28:33,322 --> 01:28:36,366
聽，父親，她在叫賣
Listen, Father, she's saying it.

1148
01:28:36,616 --> 01:28:39,909
喂喂小鳥，一袋兩便士
Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

1149
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:43,288
當然她在叫賣，她還能說別的什麼嗎？
Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

1150
01:28:43,539 --> 01:28:45,623
我們能喂餵這些小鳥嗎？ 為什麼？
Please may we feed the birds?
Whatever for?

1151
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:48,836
我從我的儲蓄罐裏面拿了兩便士 就這一次，求求你了
I have tuppence from my money box.
Just this once, please?

1152
01:28:49,087 --> 01:28:52,297
把你的錢浪費在一群骯髒的鳥身上？當然不行
Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1153
01:28:52,549 --> 01:28:56,260
但是瑪麗?潑平斯說…… 我對瑪麗?潑平斯說得話不感興趣
But Mary Poppins...
I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says.

1154
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,262
今天也不想再聽到她的名字。現在快跟上來！
Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

1155
01:28:59,513 --> 01:29:01,347
但這是我的兩便士！
But it's my tuppence!

1156
01:29:01,598 --> 01:29:04,934
邁克爾，我決不允許你把錢這樣扔掉！
Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away!

1157
01:29:05,184 --> 01:29:09,020
等我們到了銀行，我會教你該怎麼處置你的兩便士
When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence.

1158
01:29:09,273 --> 01:29:13,859
我想你也會發現這會非常有意思
And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

1159
01:29:46,975 --> 01:29:49,685
你好，班克斯。這些都是誰？
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1160
01:29:49,935 --> 01:29:52,270
道斯先生，它們都是我的孩子 我想也是
These are my children, Mr Dawes.
Well, so I assumed.

1161
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,648
但他們在這裏幹什麼？ 他們想開一個戶頭
But why are they here?
They wish to open an account, sir.

1162
01:29:55,899 --> 01:29:57,190
真的？ 是的
Oh, indeed?
Yes.

1163
01:29:57,443 --> 01:29:59,861
那麼年輕人，你有多少錢呢？
And just how much money do you have, young man?

1164
01:30:00,112 --> 01:30:03,156
兩便士。但是我想用來買鳥食 噓！
Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1165
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:05,867
兩便士
Tuppence?

1166
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:11,246
兩便士？恰好就是我起家的資金
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1167
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:18,002
那是銀行的主席，老道斯先生
That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes.

1168
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:19,836
金融界的一位偉人（也可翻譯為巨人，大力士）
A giant in the world of finance.

1169
01:30:20,088 --> 01:30:21,422
一個大力士？ 噓！
A giant?
Shh, shh, shh.

1170
01:30:21,673 --> 01:30:24,841
唔，父親，這些是班克斯的孩子
Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.

1171
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:28,679
他們想來開個戶頭 噢，是麼，孩子？
They want to open an account.
Oh, they do, do they, boy?

1172
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:31,473
好極了，好極了
Excellent. Excellent.

1173
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:34,059
我們總，總能讓……
We can al-always use...

1174
01:30:34,311 --> 01:30:40,733
讓錢發揮更大的作用，對吧？孩子
al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1175
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:43,569
這麼說，你有兩便士？
So, you have tuppence?

1176
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:45,694
我能看看嗎？
May I be permitted to see it?

1177
01:30:45,946 --> 01:30:48,114
不，我想用它來買鳥食，喂鳥
No. I want it to feed the birds!

1178
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:54,162
胡說！喂鳥，你能得到什麼？更胖的鳥？
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

1179
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:59,375
但是，如果你把你的兩便士
But if you invest your tuppence

1180
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,835
明智地存入銀行
Wisely in the bank

1181
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:06,756
兩便士將完好無損
Safe and sound

1182
01:31:06,757 --> 01:31:12,219
很快，那安全地投資在銀行裏的兩便士
Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

1183
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:16,850
會滋生利息
Will compound

1184
01:31:17,309 --> 01:31:23,397
當財富不斷地膨脹
And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

1185
01:31:23,648 --> 01:31:30,029
你將獲得成就感
As your affluence expands

01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:46,919
銀行經理手中
As propriety demands

1190
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:51,591
我來解釋吧，先生？ 來吧，班克斯
May I, sir?
Carry on, Banks.

1191
01:31:51,842 --> 01:31:53,926
你瞧，邁克爾，你將會成為如下項目的投資人……
You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

Very well, my boy, give me the money.
No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

班克斯！ 是的，先生，馬上給他，邁克爾
Banks!
Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

發展成為一筆巨大的財富
Semiannually

1210
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:21,341
當財富不斷地膨脹
And you'll achieve that sense of stature

你將獲得成就感

英格蘭沒落
England falls!

1227
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:21,897
你看到麼嗎，邁克爾？所有這一切都因
You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

正是在下，聽從你的吩咐
In the flesh, and at your service.

1254
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:10,723
你可真髒！ 哦，也許是有一兩處污漬
You're filthy!
Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1255
01:37:10,975 --> 01:37:13,143
碰巧今天我是個掃煙囪的人
It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

1256
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,603
哦，伯特，我們嚇得要命
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

好了，好了，現在不用害怕
Now, now, don't take on so.

Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father.

Now, who's after you?
Father is.

1260
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,488
什麼？ 他帶我們去他的銀行參觀

He brought us to see his bank.

1261
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:29,825
我不知道我們做了什麼，但一定是非常糟糕的事情
I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

1262
01:37:30,076 --> 01:37:33,203
他讓警察追我們，還有軍隊，所有人都在追我們
He sent the police after us, and the Army and everything.

1263
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:35,247
邁克爾，別這麼誇張
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1264
01:37:35,498 --> 01:37:38,250
好吧，一定有什麼誤會
Well, now, there must be some mistake.

1265
01:37:38,501 --> 01:37:40,586
你們的爸爸是個好人，他愛你們
Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

1266
01:37:40,836 --> 01:37:44,630
不可不這樣認為。你最好能看見他當時的那張臉
I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

1267
01:37:44,881 --> 01:37:46,591
他壓根就不喜歡我們
He doesn't like us at all.

1268
01:37:46,842 --> 01:37:49,760
好了，別好像好像的，好嗎？
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1269
01:37:50,011 --> 01:37:53,054
這是事實
It's true.

1270
01:37:53,306 --> 01:37:55,098
讓我們坐一坐
Let's sit down.

1271
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:57,851
你知道，……
You know, begging your pardon...

1272
01:37:58,102 --> 01:38:01,146
我很同情你們的父親
but the one my heart goes out to is your father.

1273
01:38:01,397 --> 01:38:05,233
他在那個冷酷的，無情的銀行中日復一日地……
There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day...

1274
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:09,068
被一大堆冰冷的，無感情的金錢所包圍
hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1275
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:10,989
我不喜歡看到任何生命被關在籠中
I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

1276
01:38:11,239 --> 01:38:13,741
父親被關在籠子裏了？
Father in a cage?

1277
01:38:13,992 --> 01:38:16,868
籠子的尺寸和形狀不同而已，你知道
They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1278
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,954
一些是銀行形狀的，用地毯什麼的來製作
Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

1279
01:38:19,205 --> 01:38:22,166
父親沒有麻煩，我們有！
Father's not in trouble. We are.

1280
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:25,419
哦，你們確信？
Oh, sure about that, are you?

1281
01:38:25,669 --> 01:38:29,088
換個角度想想，你們有你們的母親照顧你們
Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you.

1282
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:33,051
還有瑪麗?潑平斯，瓊斯警察，還有我
And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me.

1283
01:38:33,302 --> 01:38:36,012
誰來照顧你們的父親呢？你們說說看
Who looks after your father? Tell me that.

1284
01:38:36,264 --> 01:38:38,974
當一些可怕的事情發生時，他該怎麼辦？
When something terrible happens, what does he do?

1285
01:38:39,224 --> 01:38:41,224
他只能自己照顧自己
Fends for himself, he does.

1286
01:38:41,476 --> 01:38:44,352
他向誰傾訴？沒人！
Who does he tell about it? No one!

1287
01:38:44,604 --> 01:38:46,563
不能在家裏傾訴他的煩心事
Don't blab his troubles at home.

1288
01:38:46,815 --> 01:38:51,235
他只是毫無怨言，獨自一人，安靜地努力承受著
He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1289
01:38:51,485 --> 01:38:55,447
他並不是很安靜！ 邁克爾，安靜點
He's not very silent!
Michael, be quiet.

1290
01:38:55,698 --> 01:38:59,492
伯特，你確定父親真的需要我們的幫助嗎？
Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

1291
01:38:59,744 --> 01:39:02,495
呃，這個我不該說的
Well, not my place to say.

1292
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:06,331
我只注意到，一個父親常常需要那麼一點幫助
I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help.

1293
01:39:06,584 --> 01:39:10,461
來吧，我帶你們回家
Come on, I'll take you home.

1294
01:39:16,718 --> 01:39:19,803
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1295
01:39:20,054 --> 01:39:23,347
一個掃煙囪人就是幸運星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1296
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:26,559
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1297
01:39:26,811 --> 01:39:29,979
當我和你握手，好運就會傳染給你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1298
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:33,482
或者和我接吻
Or blow me a kiss

1299
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:37,820
好運也會傳染給你
And that's lucky too

1300
01:39:38,196 --> 01:39:41,156
當生活就想一串梯子
Now as the ladder of life has been strung

1301
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:44,576
你可以想想在梯子最底端的掃煙囪人
You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

1302
01:39:44,827 --> 01:39:47,954
雖然我成天跟爐灰打交道
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

1303
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:51,625
但在這整個廣袤的世界裏，沒有其它傢伙能比我更快樂
In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

1304
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:54,752
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1305
01:39:55,004 --> 01:39:58,340
一個掃煙囪人就是幸運星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1306
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:01,551
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1307
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:05,220
當我和你握手，好運就會傳染給你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1308
01:40:05,472 --> 01:40:08,474
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1309
01:40:08,725 --> 01:40:11,977
一個掃煙囪人就是幸運星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1310
01:40:12,228 --> 01:40:15,230
黑煙囪……冒黑煙……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1311
01:40:15,482 --> 01:40:20,651
當我和你握手，好運就會傳染給你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1312
01:40:23,447 --> 01:40:26,073
噢，艾倫，去看看是誰，把他們打發走
Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away.

1313
01:40:26,325 --> 01:40:28,951
我已經遲到了！ 是的，夫人
I'm dreadfully late!
Yes, ma'am.

1314
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:32,246
好了，我現在可以離開了。 哦別，請陪我們到父親回家來為止吧。
Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1315
01:40:32,498 --> 01:40:36,918
如果你跟他握手，他會感覺好多的。
He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

1316
01:40:37,168 --> 01:40:40,545
是孩子們 我想他們應該跟他們的父親在一起
It's the children, ma'am.
Oh, I thought they were with their father.

1317
01:40:40,796 --> 01:40:43,757
你們不是又逃跑了吧？你們知道這會讓我多痛苦嗎？
You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1318
01:40:44,008 --> 01:40:45,926
哦夫人，準確地講他們並不是逃跑
Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am.

1319
01:40:46,177 --> 01:40:48,469
然而，他們受了點驚嚇，需要有人照顧
They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

1320
01:40:48,721 --> 01:40:52,515
哦，當然！瑪麗?潑平斯會照顧他們的
Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.

1321
01:40:52,767 --> 01:40:55,059
噢，不，今天她休假
Oh, no, it's her day off!

1322
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:59,522
艾倫，我想請你…… 不行，夫人，我自己的活還沒有幹完呢
Ellen, I wonder if you would...
No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

1323
01:40:59,773 --> 01:41:02,608
好吧，你能問一下布裏夫人嗎？ 就算給我一百英鎊，我也不幹，夫人
Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1324
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:08,154
今天是烘焙日，你知道要煮多少東西麼！
This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is!

1325
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:09,781
你怎麼樣，先生？
What about you, sir?

1326
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:12,451
你剛才已經非常熱心地照顧這些孩子了
You've been so kind in looking after the children.

1327
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:14,993
唔……我嗎？夫人，我……我不得不離開
Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well, l-l-I have to be moving along.

1328
01:41:15,246 --> 01:41:16,997
市長大人家的煙囪被堵住了
The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

1329
01:41:17,248 --> 01:41:19,792
煙囪，你可真聰明
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1330
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:25,337
我們客廳的煙囪糟糕透了。煙不斷地往客廳冒
Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1331
01:41:25,588 --> 01:41:27,130
唔…… 非常謝謝！
W-W...
Thank you so much!

1332
01:41:27,382 --> 01:41:31,843
但，但是…… 還有，順便帶好孩子
But...
Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1333
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:33,887
市長大人家的馬上就要劇烈地噴發了
The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

1334
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:36,849
哦，謝謝你，我會非常感激的
Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

1335
01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:42,978
我必須得走了。我們勇敢的姐妹在監獄中正等著我領她們唱歌呢！
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song!

1336
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,483
再見，親愛的，一會兒見
Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.

1337
01:41:52,782 --> 01:41:56,117
我驕傲地挑選豬鬃工具，是的，我驕傲
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

1338
01:41:56,367 --> 01:42:01,746
掃帚用來掃煙囪，用刷子來通煙道
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue

1339
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:04,999
這裏很黑很暗
Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1340
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:08,002
現在，你將知道你的看法是錯誤的
There now. You see how wrong people can be?

1341
01:42:08,253 --> 01:42:13,091
這兒是通向你所謂魔法世界的一條通道
That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1342
01:42:13,342 --> 01:42:18,012
在上面煙霧如巨浪般翻滾，捲曲
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

1343
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:20,932
在星星和地面之間
'Tween pavement and stars

1344
01:42:21,182 --> 01:42:25,102
是掃煙囪人的世界
Is the chimney sweep world

1345
01:42:25,103 --> 01:42:27,604
這裏幾乎沒有白天
When there's hardly no day

1346
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:30,691
也幾乎沒有黑夜
Nor hardly no night

1347
01:42:30,942 --> 01:42:34,945
所有的事物一半在陰影裏
There's things half in shadow

1348
01:42:35,195 --> 01:42:38,239
一半在光線下
And halfway in light

1349
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:43,869
站在倫敦的屋頂
On the rooftops of London

1350
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,206
視野真開闊
Coo, what a sight.

1351
01:42:47,457 --> 01:42:49,749
我真希望我們能到上面去
I do wish we could go up there.

1352
01:42:50,001 --> 01:42:52,044
我也是！我喜歡煙囪
So do I! I like chimneys.

1353
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:57,091
非常正確！煙囪是一件完美的東西
Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1354
01:42:57,342 --> 01:42:59,593
她高高地建在屋頂上
She's built tall right up there on the roof.

1355
01:42:59,843 --> 01:43:03,096
當風向正確的時候，風吹過她的頂端
When the wind is just right, it blows across her top...

1356
01:43:03,347 --> 01:43:05,848
驅動煙從煙道中穿過
then draws the smoke right up the flue.

1357
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,727
拿著，用刷子感受一下底部的吸力
Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1358
01:43:09,978 --> 01:43:12,438
這就好像站在鯨魚噴水口的底部
It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?

1359
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:17,984
邁克爾，小心，你永遠不知道站在壁爐旁邊會發生什麼事情
Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace.

1360
01:43:18,695 --> 01:43:22,155
天啦！
Oh, bother!

1361
01:43:23,324 --> 01:43:27,618
邁克爾，邁克爾，下來！
Michael! Michael, come back down here.

1362
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,080
邁克爾，你在哪裏？
Michael! Michael, where are you?

1363
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,580
好吧，我不得不說，這有點尷尬！
Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

1364
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:36,086
伯特，麻煩你不要出餿主意了！
Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads!

1365
01:43:36,587 --> 01:43:38,587
現在輪到下一個 我能跟在後面麼？
There goes the other one.
Shall I go after 'em?

1366
01:43:38,839 --> 01:43:42,715
我們不能讓他們像袋鼠一樣在上面閒逛，對吧？
Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

1367
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:47,179
邁克爾，別害怕。事情正在……
Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going...

1368
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:56,186
你能立刻把你的東西放下嗎？
Will you put your things on at once?

1369
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,108
請快一點
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

1370
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:03,611
你在這兒！我以為你丟下我們了。 我們沒有這個意思
Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
We didn't mean to.

1371
01:44:03,862 --> 01:44:06,406
真好，一切平安無事。事實上……
Well, no harm done. The truth is...

1372
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:10,117
這是你們所說的偶發事件
this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance.

1373
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,952
看那兒
Look there.

1374
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:17,373
一個茂密的雨林正等著我們去探索
A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.

1375
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:21,878
為什麼不行，瑪麗?潑平斯？ 求求你了，瑪麗?潑平斯
Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
Please!

1376
01:44:21,879 --> 01:44:26,967
好吧，如果這是必要的
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

1377
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,137
同意
Fall in.

1378
01:44:31,388 --> 01:44:34,598
精神點，精神點。跟上！跟上！
Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it!

1379
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:38,644
排成一列，立正！
Get in line. Attention!

1380
01:44:38,895 --> 01:44:41,771
扛槍！
A-show arms!

1381
01:44:42,023 --> 01:44:46,569
向右轉！
A-right turn!

1382
01:44:51,658 --> 01:44:56,453
齊步走！
Quick march!

1383

很好，擦乾淨，邁克爾
It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

1385
01:45:38,201 --> 01:45:42,662
我們只能走到這裏了，是嗎？ 當然不
As far as we go, right?
Not at all.

1386
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:35,920
我說什麼來著？整個世界都在你腳下
What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet.

1387
01:46:36,172 --> 01:46:42,093
只有鳥兒、星星和掃煙囪人見過
And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?

1388
01:46:51,562 --> 01:46:54,146
真棒，但我們必須走出這片夜色
Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air.

Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1391
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:14,624
當你和一個掃煙囪人在一起，就如同與歡樂在一起
When you're with a sweep you're in glad company

1392
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:18,502
哪兒都不如一群快樂的人群
Nowhere is there a more happier crew

1393
01:47:18,754 --> 01:47:22,715
他們都這樣唱著

Aye, aye, sir.

1439

1454
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:53,054
不，真的，這時候不行。
Oh, no, really, not at the moment.

1455
01:54:53,305 --> 01:54:57,850
爭取婦女投票權！
Votes for women!

1456

1457
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:13,907
這都是些什麼？
What's all this?
What's all this
What's all this?
What's all this

1458
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,368
這都是些什麼
What's all this
What's all this, What's all this

1459
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,910
排成一列踢腿。來跳舞
Link your elbows, step in time
What's all this?

1460
01:55:18,163 --> 01:55:19,913
提起你的膝蓋
Kick your knees up
What's all this? Step in time

1461
01:55:20,164 --> 01:55:22,206
伯特。
Kick your knees up, Kick your knees up
Bert.
Kick your knees up

1462
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:26,252
提起你的膝蓋
Kick your knees up in time

1463
01:55:27,338 --> 01:55:30,673

1466
01:56:20,387 --> 01:56:22,889
哦，父親，這些掃煙囪人都握過你的手
Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand.

1467
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:25,432

You're going to be the luckiest person in the world!

1468
01:56:25,683 --> 01:56:28,477
來吧，孩子們，快點 等一等，瑪麗?潑平斯
Come along, children. Spit spot.
Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1469
01:56:28,728 --> 01:56:31,604
這簡直是件駭人聽聞的事件
What is the meaning of this outrage?

1470
01:56:31,856 --> 01:56:36,025
你再說一遍？ 你最好給我一個合理的解釋
I beg your pardon?
Will you be good enough to explain all this?

1471
01:56:36,278 --> 01:56:38,529
首先，我願明確地解釋一件事情
First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

1472
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:41,239
什麼？
Yes?

1473
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:45,160
我從不解釋任何事
I never explain anything.

1474
01:56:50,416 --> 01:56:52,918
是，我是班克斯
Yes. Banks here.

1475
01:56:53,169 --> 01:56:56,921
道斯先生！我非常非常的抱歉。關於今天在銀行發生的事情
Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today.

1476
01:56:57,172 --> 01:57:01,341
我可以保證…… 今晚，先生？
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?

1477
01:57:01,593 --> 01:57:05,053
是的，班克斯。我們希望你9點準時到達
Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

1478
01:57:05,305 --> 01:57:09,266
不能遲到
Without fail.
Without fail.

1479
01:57:09,516 --> 01:57:11,559
為什麼，班克斯。
Why, yes, Banks.

1480
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,311
這是極其嚴重的事件
It's extremely serious.

1481
01:57:13,562 --> 01:57:15,521
我們對這一系列決定非常遺憾
We regret this course of action.

1482
01:57:15,773 --> 01:57:17,064
我們非常遺憾
We regret this course of action.

1483
01:57:17,316 --> 01:57:20,026
畢竟，你和我們共事多年
After all, you have been with us a good many years.

1484
01:57:20,276 --> 01:57:23,569
畢竟，共事多年 在此之前是你的父親
After all, you have been with us a good many years.
As was your father before you.

1485
01:57:23,822 --> 01:57:26,658
之前是你的父親
As was your father before you.

1486
01:57:26,908 --> 01:57:32,120
是的，道斯先生。我會9點到
Yes, Mr Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

1487
01:57:52,557 --> 01:57:58,478
一個男人夢想著與巨人同行
A man has dreams of walking with giants.

1488
01:57:58,772 --> 01:58:04,151
在漫漫人生旅途中雕琢環境
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

1489
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:09,239
在他的熱情
Before the mortar of his zeal

1490
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:13,117
凝固之前
Has a chance to congeal

1491
01:58:13,369 --> 01:58:15,661
獎盃是獎勵給衝過終點線的人！
The cup is dashed from his lips!

1492
01:58:15,913 --> 01:58:18,039
激情尚未迸發便被澆滅
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1493
01:58:18,289 --> 01:58:22,041
他在他全盛時期被毀滅
He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

1494
01:58:23,253 --> 01:58:26,506
生活就像一杯朗姆酒，老爸。這是事實。
Life is a rum go, guv'nor. And that's the truth.

1495
01:58:26,756 --> 01:58:29,549
你知道我想什麼嗎？是那個女人——瑪麗?潑平斯說的。
You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1496
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:33,094
從她踏進這所房子的那一刻開始，許多事情就發生了！
From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

1497
01:58:33,345 --> 01:58:36,430
瑪麗?潑平斯？ 是的，當然。
Mary Poppins?
Yes, yes, of course.

1498
01:58:36,683 --> 01:58:40,602
我的世界曾經平靜
My world was calm

1499
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:45,313
井然有序，值得效仿
Well-ordered Exemplary.

1500
01:58:45,565 --> 01:58:48,484
自打這個人帶著被她喚醒的
Then came this person

1501
01:58:48,735 --> 01:58:53,531
混亂，來了以後
With chaos in her wake

1502
01:58:53,865 --> 01:58:59,078
現在我生活的抱負一下子
And now my life's ambitions go

1503
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:03,998
被打倒了
With one fell blow

1504
01:59:04,249 --> 01:59:11,505
這是相當難以
It's quite a bitter pill

1505
01:59:11,881 --> 01:59:13,131
表述的
To take.

1506
01:59:13,384 --> 01:59:15,384
這就那個姓潑平斯的女人！就是她造成的！
It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

1507
01:59:15,635 --> 01:59:17,927
我知道你說的這個女人
I know the very person you mean.

1508
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:20,179
瑪麗?潑平斯，她就是那個唱著……
Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

1509
01:59:20,432 --> 01:59:23,268
一湯匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1510
01:59:23,518 --> 01:59:26,811
那就是全部
That is all it takes

1511
01:59:27,062 --> 01:59:29,397
它把麵包和水
It changes bread and water

1512
01:59:29,648 --> 01:59:32,358
變成了茶和蛋糕
Into tea and cakes

1513
01:59:32,609 --> 01:59:34,068
你明白了嗎？那正是我的意思！
You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1514
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,114
把麵包和水變成茶和蛋糕！確實是！
Changing bread and water into tea and cakes! Indeed!

1515
01:59:37,364 --> 01:59:40,199
難怪這裏每件事情都雜亂無章
No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

1516
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,910
一湯匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1517
01:59:43,161 --> 01:59:46,329
每天走很長很長的路
Goes a long, long way

1518
01:59:46,581 --> 01:59:49,375
有助於你的
Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1519
01:59:49,626 --> 01:59:52,210
健康
Every day

1520
01:59:52,461 --> 01:59:53,920
如果你問我，一個有益健康的問題
An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

1521
01:59:54,171 --> 01:59:56,171
你知道她怎麼做的嗎？我現在意識到了
Do you know what she did? I realize it now.

1522
01:59:56,423 --> 01:59:58,883
她慫恿我帶簡和邁克爾來銀行
She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank.

1523
01:59:59,135 --> 02:00:01,344
這正是所有麻煩的開始
That's how all the trouble started.

1524
02:00:01,595 --> 02:00:03,887
慫恿你帶孩子們出門遠足？ 是的
Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
Yes.

1525
02:00:04,138 --> 02:00:05,764
真無恥！
Outrageous!

1526
02:00:06,015 --> 02:00:11,602
一個男人有許多重要的事情要去做。真可恥！
A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful!

1527
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:15,274
你是一個有身份的男人
You're a man of high position.

1528
02:00:15,525 --> 02:00:18,360
受同齡人的尊敬
Esteemed by your peers.

1529
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,946
當你的孩子們哭泣的時候
And when your little tykes are cryin'

1530
02:00:22,197 --> 02:00:26,074
你沒有時間去擦乾他們的眼淚
You haven't time to dry their tears

1531
02:00:26,326 --> 02:00:30,078
瞧瞧他們感激地小臉蛋
And see them grateful little faces

1532
02:00:30,331 --> 02:00:33,709
衝著你微笑
Smilin' up at you

1533
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:36,002
因為他們的爸爸
Because their dad

1534
02:00:36,253 --> 02:00:40,714
總是知道什麼是應該做的
He always knows just what to do

1535
02:00:40,965 --> 02:00:44,968
呃，我的意思是，瞧，我不認為我…… 就像你說的，老爸
Well, I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca...
Like you say, guv'nor.

1536
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:49,557
你不得不在石磨上
You've got to grind, grind, grind

1537
02:00:49,808 --> 02:00:53,060
不停地磨呀磨呀磨
At that grindstone

1538
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:55,770
雖然童年時光
Though childhood slips

1539
02:00:56,021 --> 02:01:01,109
就像沙子穿過沙漏
Like sand through a sieve

1540
02:01:01,484 --> 02:01:06,155
很快他們就長大
And all too soon they've up and grown

1541
02:01:06,406 --> 02:01:10,867
接著他們就離你而去
And then they've flown

1542
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:13,579
那時你再後悔
And it's too late

1543
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:19,709
就太遲了
For you to give

1544
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:26,300
就好像一湯匙糖
Just that spoonful of sugar

1545
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:30,594
能夠幫助把藥服下
To help the medicine go down

1546
02:01:30,846 --> 02:01:34,932
甜藥
The medicine go down

1547
02:01:35,183 --> 02:01:38,102
好入口
Medicine go down

1548
02:01:38,353 --> 02:01:43,106
好了，再見，老爸，很抱歉給你惹了這麼多麻煩
Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

1549
02:01:54,868 --> 02:01:57,119
父親？
Father?

1550
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:59,954
我們對兩便士的事情非常抱歉
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1551
02:02:00,206 --> 02:02:05,043
我們不知道那會引起這麼大的麻煩
We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

1552
02:02:10,174 --> 02:02:14,844
父親，給你兩便士
Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.

1553
02:02:26,898 --> 02:02:31,319
這樣能平息所有的風波嗎？
Will that make everything all right?

1554
02:02:31,569 --> 02:02:35,572
謝謝
Thank you.

1555
02:05:25,483 --> 02:05:29,235
進來!
Come in!

1556
02:05:36,618 --> 02:05:39,745
把帽子脫掉，班克斯
Take your hat off, Banks.

1557
02:05:52,759 --> 02:05:56,595
晚上好，先生們
Good evening, gentlemen.

1558
02:05:58,097 --> 02:05:59,889
很好，繼續
Well, get on with it. Go on.

1559
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:03,892
是，父親
Uh, yes, Father.

1560
02:06:05,812 --> 02:06:09,688
在1773年，這家銀行的一位職員……
In 1773, an official of this bank...

1561
02:06:09,942 --> 02:06:12,234
愚蠢地將一大筆錢借給
unwisely loaned a large sum of money...

1562
02:06:12,485 --> 02:06:16,571
往北美殖民地海運茶葉的貿易
to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.

1563
02:06:16,821 --> 02:06:20,533
知道後來發生了什麼事？ 是的，先生，我想我知道
Do you know what happened?
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1564
02:06:20,785 --> 02:06:22,660
當船停泊在波士頓港的時候
Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston Harbor...

1565
02:06:22,912 --> 02:06:25,413
一群殖民地居民打扮成印第安人
uh, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians...

1566
02:06:25,665 --> 02:06:30,542
登上了船，舉止非常粗魯，還將所有的茶葉傾倒到海裏
uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard.

1567
02:06:30,794 --> 02:06:33,545
導致茶葉味道變質
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking...

1568
02:06:33,797 --> 02:06:38,008
即使是美國人也不願意喝
even for Americans.

1569
02:06:41,345 --> 02:06:45,056
很對。這筆借款成了呆賬
Precisely. The loan was defaulted.

1570
02:06:45,308 --> 02:06:47,851
在這堵牆內的恐慌接踵而至
Panic ensued within these walls.

1571
02:06:48,102 --> 02:06:51,062
銀行發生了擠兌事件！
There was a run on the bank!

1572
02:06:51,313 --> 02:06:53,231
從那時起到現在，先生……
From that time to this, sir...

1573
02:06:53,482 --> 02:06:58,486
這家銀行還沒有發生過一起擠兌事件
there has not been a run on this bank...

1574
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:01,446
直到今天！
until today!

1575
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:06,575
一場擠兌事件，先生，起因是你兒子的可恥的行為
A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.

1576
02:07:06,828 --> 02:07:10,247
對此你否認嗎？ 我不否認，先生
Do you deny it?
I do not deny it, sir.

1577
02:07:10,498 --> 02:07:16,169
我只能情願為我兒子的行為承擔責任
And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

1578
02:07:18,381 --> 02:07:24,010
你還在等什麼？繼續！ 是，是的，父親
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Uh, y-yes, Father.

1579
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,697
不，別這樣！ 鎮定！
No, not that!
Steady on.

1580
02:08:04,715 --> 02:08:07,299
好了，班克斯，你還有什麼話要說的嗎？
Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

1581
02:08:07,551 --> 02:08:11,387
先生，他們說……
Well, sir, they do say that...

1582
02:08:11,639 --> 02:08:17,644
當你無話可說的時候，你就可以說……
when there's nothing to say, all you can say i...

1583
02:08:19,688 --> 02:08:24,233
班克斯，請搞清楚！我問，你還有什麼說的嗎？
Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

1584
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:28,570
只有一個詞，先生 什麼詞？
Just one word, sir.
Yes?

1585
02:08:28,822 --> 02:08:32,741
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1586
02:08:33,285 --> 02:08:34,243
什麼？
What?

1587
02:08:34,493 --> 02:08:37,328
超級霹靂快樂得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1588
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:42,375
瑪麗?潑平斯是對的。這個詞很特別，確實能讓你感覺好多了！
Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

1589
02:08:42,418 --> 02:08:44,418
你在說什麼？沒有這個詞
What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

1590
02:08:44,669 --> 02:08:47,921
不，有這個詞。實際上，它是一個完美的詞
Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually.

1591
02:08:48,173 --> 02:08:49,590
你知道有這樣的事情嗎？
Do you know what there's no such thing as?

1592
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:53,009
當所有的事情都說過並做過後，發生……
It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done...

1593
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:56,096
像你這樣的事情……
that there's no such thing as you!

1594
02:08:56,347 --> 02:08:58,014
主題，先生！注意談話的主題
Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence...

1595
02:08:58,266 --> 02:09:00,600
你想聽一個絕妙的笑話嗎？
would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?

1596
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:03,352
一個真正的笑話！ 笑話？真正的？
A real snapper!
Joke? Snapper?

1597
02:09:03,604 --> 02:09:06,690
是的，有兩個優秀的年輕人，簡和邁克爾
Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael.

1598
02:09:06,941 --> 02:09:10,234
有一天他們在街上相遇，簡跟邁克爾說
And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael...

1599
02:09:10,485 --> 02:09:13,069
我知道一個有一隻木頭假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解為：我知道有個人，他有一隻叫做史密斯的木頭假腿）
"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."

1600
02:09:13,321 --> 02:09:19,075
邁克爾問，真的？那他的另一隻腿叫什麼？
And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

1601
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:22,370
這個人瘋了，叫警衛
The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

1602
02:09:22,621 --> 02:09:25,999
超級霹靂快樂得不得了，我感覺好極了！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

1603
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,209
班克斯，不准你打擊我的父親！
Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

1604
02:09:28,461 --> 02:09:30,753
這是那兩便士 這是命中注定的，絕妙的
There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful...

1605
02:09:31,005 --> 02:09:33,880
超級霹靂快樂得不得了 的兩便士
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious tuppence.

1606
02:09:34,133 --> 02:09:37,051
好好保護它，再見！ 班克斯，你要去哪兒？
Guard it well. Goodbye!
Banks, where are you going?

1607
02:09:37,303 --> 02:09:40,054
我不知道 也許跳進馬路上的粉筆畫裏
I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture,

1608
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:41,723
去鄉下遠足
and go for an outing in the country.

1609
02:09:41,973 --> 02:09:45,225
或者騎著一匹旋轉木馬，贏得賽馬比賽
Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

1610
02:09:45,477 --> 02:09:49,439
或者僅僅去放風箏！這只有潑平斯知道！
Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

1611
02:09:49,689 --> 02:09:53,608
潑平斯？ 我的保姆。那首荒謬的歌就是她唱的。
Poppins?
My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

1612
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:58,113
一湯匙糖讓苦藥服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1613
02:09:58,364 --> 02:10:00,115
甜藥好入口
The medicine go down

1614
02:10:00,366 --> 02:10:04,369
甜藥好入口……
The medicine go down The medicine...

1615
02:10:05,537 --> 02:10:08,247
像三月裏的野兔般瘋狂
Mad as a March hare.

1616
02:10:08,498 --> 02:10:13,043
一隻叫史密斯的木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1617
02:10:13,712 --> 02:10:19,007
史密斯有條木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1618
02:10:19,508 --> 02:10:23,385
木假腿……
A wooden le...

1619
02:10:35,357 --> 02:10:38,525
父親？父親！
Father? Father!

1620
02:10:38,777 --> 02:10:40,612
父親，下來！
Father, come down!

1621
02:10:40,862 --> 02:10:46,449
爸爸，爸爸！回來！
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1622
02:10:53,916 --> 02:10:59,545
風向轉變了，非常精確地從西邊刮來！
Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

1623
02:11:00,423 --> 02:11:02,466
她不關心我們身上發生的事情
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1624
02:11:02,716 --> 02:11:07,803
她只答應呆到風向轉變為止。是吧，瑪麗?潑平斯？
She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1625
02:11:08,053 --> 02:11:12,557
請把衣帽架遞過來好嗎？
Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

1626
02:11:13,225 --> 02:11:18,646
瑪麗?潑平斯，你不愛我們了嗎？
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1627
02:11:19,315 --> 02:11:21,941
不關心我們的遭遇了嗎？
And what would happen to me
may I ask...

1628
02:11:22,193 --> 02:11:27,237
請問如果我愛所有的小孩，我該給誰告別呢？
if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?

1629
02:11:28,656 --> 02:11:31,491
是的，先生，沒錯。喬治 W 班克斯
Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks.

1630
02:11:31,744 --> 02:11:33,995
櫻桃樹大街17號
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1631
02:11:34,245 --> 02:11:36,455
大約6英尺高，是的。
About six foot one, I'd say, sir.

1632
02:11:36,706 --> 02:11:39,999
是的，今天早上第一件事情就是給他工作的銀行打了電話
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning.

1633
02:11:40,251 --> 02:11:44,003
目前我們所知道的唯一事情就是，他昨晚就已經離開了
The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night.

1634
02:11:44,255 --> 02:11:47,257
他很沮喪，沒說要幹什麼
No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

1635
02:11:47,508 --> 02:11:49,343
不會去投河吧？
Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.

1636
02:11:49,593 --> 02:11:53,470
在薩克福橋附近有一個非常合適的地點，因投河自盡而聞名
There's a nice spot there by Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

1637
02:11:53,723 --> 02:11:56,266
真的，艾倫！
Really, Ellen!

1638
02:11:56,516 --> 02:11:59,518
他看上去還不錯，很鎮定，先生
He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1639
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:02,688
沒有陰謀，如果你知道我的意思。
No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.

1640
02:12:02,939 --> 02:12:06,192
呃，日常習慣嘛。幾乎沒有人知道 甜藥好入口
Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down

1641
02:12:06,443 --> 02:12:08,443
甜藥好入口
The medicine go down

1642
02:12:08,694 --> 02:12:11,112
只要一湯匙糖 是他！
Just a spoonful of sugar
It's him!

1643
02:12:11,363 --> 02:12:13,406
幫你把苦藥…… 或者聲音聽起來像是他
Helps the medicine
Or something that sounds like him.

1644
02:12:13,657 --> 02:12:15,532
服下 班克斯夫人，能不能讓房子裏的人小聲一點
Go down
Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise...

1645
02:12:15,786 --> 02:12:20,623
我聽不到警長的聲音了 他現在很興奮
on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.
In the most delightful way

1646
02:12:20,873 --> 02:12:23,208
只要一湯匙糖
Just a spoonful of sugar

1647
02:12:23,459 --> 02:12:26,794
讓苦藥服下 喬治！
Makes the medicine go down
George!

1648
02:12:27,046 --> 02:12:29,338
哦，喬治，你沒有去投河
Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.

1649
02:12:29,589 --> 02:12:31,589
你真明智啊
How sensible of you.

1650
02:12:31,841 --> 02:12:35,052
好了，先生，找到他了！
It's all right, sir. He's been found!

1651
02:12:35,303 --> 02:12:37,221
不，還活著！
No, alive!

1652
02:12:37,472 --> 02:12:41,349
或者我以為。他正在親吻班克斯夫人
Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

1653
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,726
我真的很擔心，在銀行發生了什麼事情？
I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

1654
02:12:43,978 --> 02:12:46,730
我被解雇了，趕了出來，扔到了大街上
I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

1655
02:12:46,981 --> 02:12:51,234
一湯匙糖能讓苦藥服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1656
02:12:51,485 --> 02:12:54,904
他剛才的行為有點不正常
Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

1657
02:12:55,155 --> 02:12:58,157
甜藥好入口 瘋瘋癲癲的
The medicine go down
Dotty as you please.

1658
02:12:58,408 --> 02:13:01,576
喬治，你在地下室到底在做什麼？
George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

1659
02:13:01,827 --> 02:13:05,538
一會兒你就知道了。孩子們在哪裏？簡？邁克爾？
You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1660
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:08,957
你們的父親在叫。 聽起來不像是父親的聲音
Your father's calling you.
It doesn't sound like Father.

1661
02:13:09,211 --> 02:13:14,465
簡？邁克爾？ 快跑去吧
Jane? Michael?
Run along. Spit spot!

1662
02:13:18,092 --> 02:13:21,053
你不會走吧，瑪麗?潑平斯？
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1663
02:13:21,304 --> 02:13:25,516
快！快！
Spit spot.

1664
02:13:33,691 --> 02:13:37,486
他修好了！
He mended it!

1665
02:13:40,823 --> 02:13:44,283
太好了！ 你怎麼修的？
It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?

1666
02:13:44,534 --> 02:13:47,495
花兩便士買了紙和繩子
With tuppence for paper and strings

1667
02:13:47,745 --> 02:13:50,789
雙腳站在地上
You can have your own set of wings

1668
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:56,252
你可以讓風箏擁有自己的翅膀 緊緊抓住繩子
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight

1669
02:13:56,504 --> 02:13:59,964
你就能像鳥兒一樣飛翔
With your fist holding tight

1670
02:14:00,216 --> 02:14:02,258
來放飛你的風箏吧
To the string of your kite

1671
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:04,969
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1672
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:08,513
讓我們去放風箏
Let's go fly a kite

1673
02:14:08,766 --> 02:14:12,102
讓它飛向空中的最高處
Up to the highest height

1674
02:14:12,353 --> 02:14:15,480
讓我們去放風箏
Let's go fly a kite

1675
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:19,274
讓它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1676
02:14:19,527 --> 02:14:22,654
穿越雲層
Up through the atmosphere

1677
02:14:22,904 --> 02:14:26,281
直達晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1678
02:14:26,533 --> 02:14:32,119
哦，讓我們去放風箏
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1679
02:14:32,413 --> 02:14:34,665
你不認為，一個好風箏需要一條合適的尾巴嗎？
A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

1680
02:14:34,915 --> 02:14:39,793
那是我說的，先生。去放飛風箏！
That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite!

1681
02:14:40,045 --> 02:14:43,922
哦，不，先生。我不是說你
Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

1682
02:14:44,174 --> 02:14:47,510
讓我們去放風箏
Let's go fly a kite

1683
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,845
讓它飛向空中的最高處
Up to the highest height

1684
02:14:51,097 --> 02:14:54,264
讓我們去放風箏
Let's go fly a kite

1685
02:14:54,517 --> 02:14:58,061
讓它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1686
02:14:58,312 --> 02:15:01,439
穿越雲層
Up through the atmosphere

1687
02:15:01,691 --> 02:15:05,110
直達晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1688
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:10,990
哦，讓我們去放風箏
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1689
02:15:11,534 --> 02:15:15,036
當你高高地放飛風箏
When you send it flying up there

1690
02:15:15,286 --> 02:15:18,372
立刻你會感覺自己比空氣還輕
All at once you're lighter than air

1691
02:15:18,623 --> 02:15:23,501
你能在吹過房子和樹林的風裏起舞
You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees

1692
02:15:23,752 --> 02:15:27,045
用你的手緊緊握住繩子
With your fist holding tight

1693
02:15:27,297 --> 02:15:29,423
繫上你的風箏
To the string of your kite

1694
02:15:29,675 --> 02:15:31,634
放！

1699
02:15:46,524 --> 02:15:48,733
班克斯，你在這裏啊
Oh, there you are, Banks.

1700
02:15:48,985 --> 02:15:50,902
我要祝賀你
I want to congratulate you.

1701
02:15:51,153 --> 02:15:54,948
絕妙的笑話。叫史密斯的木腿
Capital bit of humour. Wooden leg named Smith.

1702
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,367
或者瓊斯或者其他
Or Jones or whatever it was.

1703
02:15:57,618 --> 02:16:00,537
父親在笑中死去
Father died laughing.

1704
02:16:00,788 --> 02:16:05,417
噢，我很抱歉，先生 不，沒什麼可抱歉的。
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1705
02:16:05,668 --> 02:16:07,877
在他的一生中從沒有見他這麼快活過
Never seen him happier in his life.

1706
02:16:08,128 --> 02:16:10,254
他留下了一個新合夥人職位的空檔
He left an opening for a new partner.

1707
02:16:10,505 --> 02:16:12,631
恭喜了

1708
02:16:12,882 --> 02:16:16,260

穿越雲層
Up through the atmosphere

1710
02:16:19,763 --> 02:16:22,974
直達晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1711
02:16:23,225 --> 02:16:27,728
哦，讓我們一起
Oh, let's go

1712
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,523
去放風箏
Fly a kite

1713
02:16:32,734 --> 02:16:34,609
這需要感謝你
That's gratitude for you.

1714
02:16:34,862 --> 02:16:38,239
甚至沒有說聲再見嗎？ 是，他們沒說
Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.

1715
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:44,160
看看他們，你知道，你跟他們的父親相比，他們更想念父親
Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

1716
02:16:44,412 --> 02:16:48,790
那是自然 好吧，你不在乎？
That's as it should be.
Well, don't you care?

1717
02:16:49,041 --> 02:16:52,793
近乎完美的人從不允許在他們的思想中摻雜個人感情
Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1718
02:16:53,045 --> 02:16:58,466
真的是這樣？我告訴你，瑪麗?潑平斯，你別騙我了。
Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

1719
02:16:58,717 --> 02:17:03,011
真的？ 真的！我完全知道你對這些孩子們的感情
Oh, really?
Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children.

1720
02:17:03,264 --> 02:17:07,642
如果你會認為我繼續保持沉默，我……
And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I...

1721
02:17:07,892 --> 02:17:12,229
那就乖乖地閉上嘴，謝謝
That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

1722
02:17:33,584 --> 02:17:38,336
再見，瑪麗?潑平斯。別離開太久
Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.

1723
02:18:23,756 --> 02:18:26,047
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1724
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:29,427
讓我們去放風箏
Let's go fly a kite

1725

讓我們去放風箏

1727
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:40,228
讓它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1728
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:43,690
穿越雲層
Up through the atmosphere

1729
02:18:43,941 --> 02:18:47,193
直達晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1730
02:18:47,444 --> 02:18:52,156
哦，讓我們一起去
Oh, let's go

1731
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:57,411
放風箏
Fly a kite
