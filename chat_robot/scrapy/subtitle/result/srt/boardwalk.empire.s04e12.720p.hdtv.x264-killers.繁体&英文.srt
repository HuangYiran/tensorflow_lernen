我不想聽你
What I don't want to hear from you--

92

瞎說

昨晚  在我家外面

110
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,040

你好像很驚訝  埃德加

有組織犯罪

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,040
我這只是正常的懷疑

114

是嗎
Is that what it is?

115
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,320

自從法學院的第一周

你就期望著我會失敗

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,710
我覺得
I think it's time,

127
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,670
鑒于我的職位所應得的尊重
considering the respect the position deserves,

128
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,150
你應該開始叫我胡佛局長了
you begin referring to me as Director Hoover.

129
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,240
當你聽到求救聲時
And when you heard these cries for help,

130
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,450
你做了什么

131
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,650

抱歉  先生  您得大聲點
I'm sorry, sir, I do need you to speak up.

133
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,220
我從大廳下去
I went down the hall

134
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,940
去了浴室
into the bathroom.

135
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,590
你是何時認為
And at what time did you form the opinion

136
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,500
那具尸體不是詹姆斯·達莫迪的
that the body was not that of James Darmody?

137
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,090
不是認為
Not an opinion.

138
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,010
你說什么
I beg your pardon?

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,300
不是認為
It was not an opinion.

140
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,860
我曾跟他并肩作戰
I fought beside him.

141

永遠忘不掉

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,100
謝謝  哈羅先生  沒有其他問題了
Thank you, Mr. Harrow. No further questions.

144
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,240
我
I, uh...

145
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,190
請求法庭原諒
begging the pardon of the court,

146
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,690
我昨晚才收到案件細節
I only received the particulars of this case last--

147
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,950
我注意到你戴了眼鏡
I notice you're wearing glasses,

148
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,560
哈羅德...哈羅先生
Mr. Harold-- Harrow.

149
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,800
是裝飾用的嗎
Are they for cosmetic purposes?

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,780
什么
What?

151
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,750
你戴眼鏡是為了好看  還是真的需要
Are they for reasons of vanity or do you need them to see?

152
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,480
眼鏡能...
They keep...

153
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,630
法官大人  如果證人含糊不清  聽證會還...
Your Honor, what's the point of a hearing if the witness--

154
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,280
先生  請你盡可能地大聲講話
Sir, I remind you to speak as loudly as you're able.

155
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
眼鏡能抵住面具
They keep my face on.

156
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,970
好的
Yes, all right.

157
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,510
那么我們能相信
So are we to believe

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,090
你的那只好眼的眼力
that the vision of your remaining eye...

159
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,260
法官大人  騷擾證人
Badgering, Your Honor.

160
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,220
比達莫迪先生親生母親的眼睛更好使嗎
...is more reliable than that of Mr. Darmody's own mother?

161
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,590
我知道是怎么回事
I know what happened.

162
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,390
我知道我看到了什么
I know what I saw.

163
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,620
我知道
I know.

164
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,700
法官大人  已經頒發了一張有效的死亡證明
Your Honor, a duly certified death record has already--

165
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,840
是動過手腳的死亡證明  法官大人
A jerry-rigged death record, Your Honor.

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,140
而且我的委托人
And surely my client's veracity

167
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
-在辨認自己孩子這事上...  -根本沒有尸體
- as to the identity of her own child... - There's no body.

168
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,310
我們說的正是這件事
The exact point that we're debating.

169
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,340
...應該更重視
...should carry more weight...

170
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,570
-沒有別人  -喪子之痛...
- There's no body.  -the grief of this aggrieved-- bereaved--

171
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,320
-我方有供詞  -沒有尸體
- We have a confession. - There's no body.

172
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,410
為了您自己的辯護  我必須堅持
I have to insist for your own defense,

173
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,760
-拜托...  -沒有尸體
- please-- - There's no body.

174
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,240
德里克先生  請你的代理人冷靜  不然我會將她逐出法庭
Mr. Drake, keep your client in check or I'll have her removed.

175
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,590
那是我兒子  我之前說過什么都不重要
It was my son. It doesn't matter what I said.

176
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,010
沒有別人
There's no one there.

177
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,880
我在戀愛  我受了欺騙
I was in love. I was tricked.

178
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,040
這哪有天理
How can that be right?

179
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,380
你好  打擾一下
Hello. Excuse me!

180
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,740
不許我說話  不許我活
I'm not allowed to speak. I'm not allowed to live.

181
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,130
快接線
Get on the wire.

182
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,770
憑什么男人想干什么就能干什么
Why does a man get to do anything he wants?

183
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,880
巾幗英雄
That a girl!

184
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,160
她瘋了  尸體在哪里
She's off! Where's the body? -

185
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,250
重點是讓他們開口
The idea is to get them talking--

186
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,920
販酒  海洛因  隨便你知道的
alcohol importation, heroin, what have you.

187
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,080
或許他們有所謀劃  或許是搶劫
Maybe they're planning something, a heist perhaps.

188
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,630
互相勾結
Conspiring with one another.

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
我們在這邊  伊萊
We're over here, Eli.

190
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,750
塞爾比探員和我們其他同事
Agent Selby and our other operatives

191
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,990
會在隔壁聽著
will be stationed in the next room listening in.

192
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,680
你聽到留聲機響起來  就是信號
When you hear the radio go on, that's your signal.

193
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,060
什么信號
My signal for what?

194
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,880
你離開去洗手間
To excuse yourself, go to the washroom.

195
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,300
事情會很棘手
Things could get a little messy.

196
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,180
你要做的就是保持冷靜
All you have to do is remain calm.

197
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,240
努基和其他人都不會知道你有參與
Neither Nucky nor the others will ever know you were involved.

198
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,110
你有兄弟嗎  諾克斯
You have a brother, Knox?

199
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,580
或者你  管你他媽的叫什么
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

200
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,580
-有親人嗎  -不關你事
- A family? - That's none of your business.

201
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,570
操你
Fuck you.

202
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,970
還有你  你這自以為是的兔崽子
And you, too, you smug son of a bitch.

203
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,930
我有個兄弟  名叫克勞德

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,170
-你害過克勞德嗎  -他不是罪犯  伊萊
- You ever fuck Claude over? - He's not a criminal, Eli.

206
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,920
而且你這樣做是為了你兒子
And you're doing this for your son.

207
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,320
我需要一份保證
I need a guarantee.

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,600
-沒有什么保證  -我沒跟你說話
- There are no guaran-- - I'm not talking to you.

209
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,000
這事辦成  我兒子不牽扯進去
We pull this off, my son stays out of it.

210
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,910
所有那些破事  關于他的謠言
All that other shit, this malarkey with him

211
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,750
還有那個室友  一筆勾銷
and the roommate, that all goes away.

212
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,020
我們都有各自的風險
We both have a lot riding on--

213
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,740
我才不信這句鬼話
I don't even think it's true, by the way.

214
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,060
把他們弄到這里
Get them in this room,

215
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,320
你哥哥  馬赫里亞  還有其他人
your brother, Masseria and the others,

216
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
威爾就沒什么可擔心的了
and Will has nothing to worry about.

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,530
威爾
Will?

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
幫我個忙
Do me a favor.

219
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,930
別說的好像你跟他很熟一樣
Stop talking like you know him.

220

224
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,980

The phone call.

226
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,910

那現在開始喝
Then start.

237
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,780
那槍擊是不是魏斯搞的
So was it Weiss that done the shooting or not?

I already gave you a job, Mr. Harrow.

279
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,500
讓我們單獨談談
Give us a minute.

280
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,110
吉米·達莫迪
Jimmy Darmody.

281
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,450
他怎么了
What about him?

282
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,910
我需要知道他在哪里
I need to know where he is.

283
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
他已經火化了
He was cremated

284
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,600
注射毒品過量死在他母親的浴缸里
after overdosing in his mother's tub.

285
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,520
你我都知道那不是真的
You and I both know that isn't true.

286
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,410
我也是讀了報紙才知道
I only know what I read in the papers.

287
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,970
那么你讀到吉莉安·達莫迪
Then you've read Gillian Darmody

288
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,630
因謀殺被逮捕的消息了
has been arrested for murder.

289
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,740
可那是荒唐之言
But that's ludicrous.

290
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,170
死在浴缸里的是詹姆斯
It was James who died in that tub.

291
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,680
如果法庭相信了
If they believe that,

292
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,210
她就自由了
she'll go free.

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,840
她肯定要來和我爭孩子
And she'll come back for the boy to spite me.

294
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,260
經歷了那么多磨難
After all of this,

295
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,400
我和我妻子
my wife and I...

296
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,940
是承受不起的
could not bear that.

297
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,250
假如有個匿名線人
If somehow an anonymous source

298
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,390
向官方透露吉米尸體的位置
were to disclose to the authorities

299
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,450
你愿意為這個線人
the whereabouts of Jimmy's body...

300
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,550
做些什么嗎
what would you do for that anonymous source?

301
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,240
你要我做什么都行
I would do whatever you asked.

302
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,470
-別擠  各位  -好了好了
- Nice and orderly, guys. - All right, all right.

303
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,830
給醫生讓路
Let the doctor through.

304
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,920
各位后退一下  講究點風度
Stand back, boys. A little dignity.

305
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,370
-拍張照片  -回來
- Get a picture. - Come on, get back.

306
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,420
-別推人  -是達莫迪嗎
- Hey, don't push. - Is it Darmody?

307
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,520
右腿六根鋼釘
Six screws in the right femur.

308
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,940
-是達莫迪  -各位  請后退
- It's him. It's Darmody. - Fellas, please, stand back.

309
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
這是達莫迪  那么那個是誰
If that's Darmody, then who's the other one?

310
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,980
拿回來
Hey, get it back!

311
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,010
放松點
Take it easy!

312
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
下午版有內容了
Call it in for the afternoon edition.

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,870
那我先來
Well, guess I'll kick things off and--

314
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,640
-艾德  -怎么了
- Ed. - Yeah, Nuck?

315
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,670
滾出去
Get the fuck out of here.

316
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,780
這是我辦公室啊
It's my office.

317
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,820
別逼我把你拉下來
I'll change that if it's the last thing I do.

318
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,980
我只是做了該做的
I just did what I had to.

319
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,840
你肯定
You of all people--

320
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,120
您最好讓我們獨處一會
It would be best to leave us be.

321
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,350
-你見過他  -我可沒說
- You've seen him. - I didn't say that.

322
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,500
你有他的消息
You've heard from him.

323
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,510
反正不是有就是沒有
Either you have or you have not.

324
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,800
要是沒有  那就是浪費
If you have not, then my time--

325
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,360
他要了結這一切
He wants this to end.

326
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,830
他不早就找我了結嗎
Endings have been attempted, have they not?

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
-各方面都是  -這關系到他家人
- On all sides. - This is a question of family.

328
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,900
女兒要結婚了  他得出席
His daughter's getting married. He wants to be there.

329
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,730
他想全身而退
He's looking for safe passage in and out.

330
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,010
拿什么交換
In exchange for what?

331
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,470
我就是個牽線的
I'm just the middleman here.

332
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,070
你們不是朋友嗎
I thought you were friends.

333
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,120
我沒有朋友  只有合作伙伴
I don't have friends. I have partners.

334
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,340
你救過他一命
You tried to save his life.

335
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,810
有回報我才伸手  他現在什么都沒有
I bet on a horse to win. He didn't even place.

336
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,350
世道已經變了
Today is a different day.

337
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,780
那你以后要向誰伸手呢
On whom will you wager tomorrow?

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,060
我就明說了吧
Let's get something straight, all right?

339
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,790
你的信仰  你過去的悲劇
Your beliefs, your tragic history,

340
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,980
我他媽才懶得聽呢
I don't give a rat's ass about any of it.

341
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,380
我們兩個人種唯一的共同點
The only thing your people and mine have in common--

342
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,270
就是都認錢
we both know what a dollar's worth.

343
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,530
這里沒錢就去那里掙
And if we can't make it one way, we'll make it another.

344
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,480
這座城市是我的蛋糕
I have a lot at stake in this town.

345
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,280
你要是想分一塊吃  就等著瞧吧
Try to take it from me, we have a problem.

346
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,320
俱樂部  北城
The club, the Northside,

347
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
哪個黑人管都一樣
I don't care which of you coloreds runs them,

348
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,670
給我管好就行
as long as they're run.

349
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,300
至于分成  還有你的市長小伙伴
The percentage, your new pal the mayor,

350
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,880
我們回頭再說
we'll discuss those later.

351
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,160
這事必須了結掉
This just needs to be over.

352
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,290
怎么了結
Over how?

353
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,310
你們兩個談
That's for you to arrange.

354
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,780
請你解釋一下
I urge you to be explicit.

355
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,340
我不希望以后再有人
I don't ever want to worry about that spook

356
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,400
暗地里盯著我
coming at me in the dark again.

357
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,680
明白了嗎
Do we understand each other?

358
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,860
明白了
We do.

359
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,750
終于
At long last.

360
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,140
我去找朝琪安排你倆談談
Then I'll let Chalky know you're willing to talk.

361
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,910
他要我告訴你件事
Something he wanted me to tell you.

362
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,490
說你肯定感興趣
Said you'd be interested.

363
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,700
什么
Yes?

364
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,590
那個歌手
That singer.

365
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,950
他說知道她在哪
He says he knows where she is.

366
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,290
買點洋薊
And be sure to pick up the artichokes.

367
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,150
二十二美分一磅
They're 22 cents a pound.

368
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,990
-那又怎么樣  等等  -我可不買
- So? Aspetta. - I'm not paying that.

369
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,160
咱又不是要飯的  洋薊還買不起
What, are we paupers? I want artichokes, for God's sake.

370
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,250
他媽的
Maladetta funga.

371
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,550
我剛噴過水
I just sprayed all this.

372
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,990
再來  正常講話
Go ahead. Speak in a normal tone.

好像有點多吧
That seems excessive.

382
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
我管它好像什么呢
I didn't ask how it seems.

383
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,280
彈夾再檢查一遍
Check those magazines, gentlemen.

384
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,910
子彈有限
We can't afford any misfires.

385
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,940
怎么樣
Well?

386
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,040
-長官  -聽不聽得見

- I can make out most-- - Yes or no?

389

放松  吉姆  沒事的
Relax, Jim. It'll be all right.

這是我的事業  哈羅德
This is only my career, Harold.

391
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,520
事情辦好了我才能放松
I'll relax when it's over.

392
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,820
好吧
Right.

393
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,980
好的
Yes.

399
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,850

We'll drive over together.

402
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,880
直接在那見面多好
Easier just to meet there, no?

403
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,560
應該一起進去  兄弟齊心嘛
We should walk in together, present a united front.

Sure thing.

410
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,390
關你什么事
How's that your concern?

411
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,700
不是  我只是
It's not. I just--

412
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,580
我很好奇  僅此而已
I'm curious, that's all.

419
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,380
你的姐夫  這個休伯特
Your brother-in-law, this Hubert,

420
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,570
他知道你要去嗎
he got the message?

421
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,800
他會提前九十分鐘到
He'll be there 90 minutes early.

422
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,260
記得要數數你看見了幾頭牛
Hey, make sure you count how many cows you see.

423
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,860
-向我匯報  -好的

怎么回事  在告別嗎
What was that? Good-bye?

428
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,330
-不是  -跟我保證你會來
- No. - Promise me you're coming.

429
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,510
因為我從未沒見過你姐姐
Because I've never even spoken to your sister

430
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,390
如果你不來的話就太尷尬了
and it will be pretty goddamn awkward if you don't show--

431
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,310
我們三天以后見
I will see you in three days.

434
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,470
有人嗎

435
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,510

436
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,220
在傷到人之前把那東西收起來
Put that away before someone gets hurt.

437
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,700
怎么他媽回事  人都在哪

-關門了  -為什么

439
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,270
能不能把那東西收起來
Would you put that away, please?

440
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,830
我要走了
I'm leaving town.

441
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,130
跟薩利去古巴

我辦完事情就走
As soon as I finish what I need to do.

444

你打算什么時候告訴我
When were you gonna tell me?

445
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,140
我打算現在告訴你
I intended to tell you now.

446
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,020
我們還要開會
We have a meeting.

447
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,610
-馬赫里亞  -沒有會議

448
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,030
我知道是怎么回事了
I saw to that.

449
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,850
旅店登記了三個空房間
There are names on a hotel register with three empty rooms.

450
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,590

451
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,380
-努基  我  -努基  我什么

452
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,800
努基  我犯錯了
Nucky, I made a mistake?

453
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,970
努基  對不起
Nucky, I'm sorry?

454
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,240
我說什么有什么關系
What's it matter what I say?

455
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,320
你能失去的東西很多
You have a lot to lose.

456
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,770
我嗎  我一無所有
Me? I don't have anything.

457
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,990
早晚你都會奪走
Sooner or later you wind up taking it all.

458
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,680
我無能為力
Can't help it.

459
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,190
我準備好了
I'm ready.

460
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,610
你呢
Are you?

461
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,810
是你罪有應得
It's what you deserve.

462
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,990
-爸  -走開
- Pop! - Back off!

463
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,060
-那是我兒子  -你在干什么
- That's my son! - What are you doing?

464
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,780
-他要殺了你  -不  不會
- He's gonna kill you.  - No, he's not.

465
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,790
他不會  他不會
He's-- he's not.

466
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,420
你跟他說
You tell him.

467
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
告訴他怎么回事
Tell him what's going on.

468
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,430
諾克斯
Knox.

469
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,930
你是對的  他不是禁酒探員
You had it right. He's no Prohee.

470
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,830
你那個同學  那個謀殺指控
The kid at school, that murder charge

471
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,020
你把檢察官買通了  他知道了
you had the DA squash, he knows.

472
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,240
他知道
He knows.

473
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,930
他想要你  紐約和佛羅里達的人
He wants you and New York and Florida

474
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,700
坐在一起
all together all at once.

475
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,320
這是不讓他
That's the price

476
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,930
進監獄的代價
to keep him out of jail.

477
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,830
- 爸  我  -你向著他
- Pop, I-- - So you go to him?

478
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,990
胳膊肘向外拐
Over your father?

479
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,200
我能收拾殘局
I'm the one who can fix it.

480
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,440
他本來應該有所成就
He was supposed to amount to something.

481
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,680
他還是會的
He's still going to.

482
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,760
什么成就  成為一個在旅店里
What? A man in an empty hotel

483
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,200
拿槍指著他兄弟的男人
pointing a gun at his brother?

484
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,010
我是為了家人
I did it for the family.

485
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,520
你沒有家人
You don't have a family.

486
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,270
我有
I do.

487
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,920
現在你也想擁有
Now you want that, too.

488
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,070
什么都無法填補你內心的空洞
Nothing will fill that hole you got inside.

489
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,150
你還不知道嗎
Don't you know that yet?

490
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,970
這是你搞砸的  伊萊
This is your mess, Eli.

491
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,390
自己受著吧
Drown in it.

492
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,330
他們不會來了
They're not coming.

493
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,290
你說不準
You don't know that.

494
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,940
你被騙了  吉姆  直面現實吧
You've been duped, Jim. Let's face it.

495
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,510
你可高興了  是吧
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

496
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,580
-什么  -能讓你這一天很愉快吧
- What? - That would make your entire day.

497
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,590
讓我們單獨待一會兒  好嗎
Give us a minute, will you?

498
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,450
你很生氣  我理解
You're upset. I understand.

499
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,550
生氣
Upset?

500
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,030
-生氣  -冷靜點
- Upset?! - Just calm down.

501
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,730
你以為我不知道嗎  你  胡佛還有其他人
You think I don't know? You, Hoover and the others,

502
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,380
-這是個多大的笑話啊  -吉姆  我
- what a joke this has all been? - Jim, I--

503
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,550
你從未支持我  從來沒有
You were never on board, never for a second.

504
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,570
我賭上了所有
I have put everything on the line!

505
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,400
我覺得你應該把你的槍給我
I think you should give me your sidearm.

506
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,050
什么
What?

507
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,150
你現在情緒不穩定
You are not keeping on an even keel.

508
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,570
你想要我的槍  哈羅德
You want my gun, Harold?

509
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,600
來拿啊
Why don't you take it?

510
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,670
他要見你
He's asking for you.

511
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,070
你醒著嗎
You awake?

512
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,980
感覺怎么樣
How you feeling?

513
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,950
我很好
I'm okay.

514
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,310
以前從未聽你這樣說過
I've never heard you say that before.

515
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,120
是嗎啡的關系
Morphine.

516
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,470
放松好好享受吧
Well, relax and enjoy it.

517
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,790
我們有二十四小時的保鏢和護士
We got round-the-clock guards, nurses, too.

518
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,850
你很快就會出院了
You'll be out of here in no time.

519
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,650
然后我們就會弄死那幫狗娘養的
And then we'll get them sons of bitches.

520
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,060
這是年輕人的游戲
This is a young man's game.

521
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,890
我不參與
I'm not gonna fight.

522
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,400
你想放走他們
You're gonna let them get away with it?

523
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,740
是你的  阿爾

整個組織
The whole operation.

526
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,660
天吶  強尼  你確定嗎
Jesus, Johnny. Are you sure?

527
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,240
你贏了  孩子
You win, kid.

528
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,380
我不擋你路
I'm out of your way.

529
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,970
我該去歐洲養老了
It's Europe for me.

530
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,400
-怎么回事  -威爾呢

-伊萊  -他在這里
- Eli... - Is he here or not?

532
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,550
你得對我說實話
You need to be honest with me.

533
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,090
伊萊  你忘了我們有約嗎
Eli. Did you forget we had an appointment?

534
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,810
沒忘
No.

535
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,820

誰能告訴我出了什么事

542
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,880
該死的  上樓去

- I'm trying to explain to you. - Your son is going to jail.

547
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,700

There was this boy a while back.

548
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,390
叫埃利斯啥

和你兒子同齡
About your own son's age.

550
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,900
是真的童子軍
A real Boy Scout type.

他偷車的時候被我抓了

你是在威脅一名聯邦探員嗎

把手腕給我

我的搭檔  塞爾比探員  他覺得我瘋了
My partner, Agent Selby, he thinks I'm crazy.

559
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,240
你覺得我瘋了嗎  伊萊
Do you think I'm crazy, Eli?

560
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,360
沒事  你可以說

569
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,390

我的兒子
My fucking son!

573
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,720
我們做什么
What you want us to do?

574
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,460
好好待著  別大驚小怪

你啥都不缺

579
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,950

580
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,150
我想要  你也想要

581

埃及有法老
Egypt had its pharaohs

583
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
國王從羅馬

584
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,440
她在哪里
Where is she?

585

你不在的地方

女兒換女兒
A daughter for a daughter.

590
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,360
那女的不是你女兒
That woman ain't your blood.

591
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,950
你怎么可能理解
How could you possibly understand?

592
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,920
我知道我討她的歡心
I understand I rock her fine.

593
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,360
輕而易舉的事
That was some sweet jelly.

594
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,590
現在她老擺臉色
Now her face ain't right

595
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,600
我不再需要看她的臉色了
and I don't need to be looking at that no more.

596
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,880
看看高貴的野蠻人
Behold the noble savage.

597
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,330

其余的
And all the rest...

600
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,930
關我屁事
I never did give a fuck.

601
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,310
了解彼此了吧
We see each other now?

602
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,370
你知道湯普森先生讓我做什么吧
You know what your friend Mr.Thompson asked me to do?

做了我
Kick a bullet in my head.

604
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,790
不過不會在這里做
But that ain't gonna happen here.

605
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,660
我們是文明人
We civilized.

606
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
你們都走不出巷子
None of you will make it past the alley.

607
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,860
那你就別想見到她了
Then you ain't never gonna see her again.

608
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,230
你從想掐死她的母親手里救下來的孩子
Baby you save from that half and half choke her mama.

609
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,160
那個男人被抓到了嗎
They ever catch that man?

610
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,890
告訴我她在哪里

你聽她親口給你說吧
But hear it from her yourself.

616
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,010
我一聲令下  她就沒命了
A nod from me and she's gone.

617
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,850
我們算扯平了

不  是謀殺聯邦探員
No, with the murder of a federal agent.

660
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,120
你們在一八九八年的新奧爾良港口

662
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,250
你說什么
I beg your pardon?

663
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,600

664
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,370

問問題的人
The one asking questions.

666
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,470
一八九八  沒錯

在美國待了二十六年

00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,900
卻仍然不是公民
but you're not a citizen.

669
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,080
這是作為拘禁我的理由嗎

670
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,980
你為什么要待在一個
Why would you go on living in a country

671

675
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,250
這是對他的哲學的過度解讀
That would be an oversimplification of his philosophy.

676
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,870

我怕你理解不了

你看上去挺聰明

你覺得是誰來決定真理的內容
Who do you think gets to decide what the truth is?

相關情報
and his ties to foreign powers.

694
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,090
他為什么要這么做
Why would he do that?

695
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,350
來展示出他
To demonstrate his commitment

696
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,250
對這片接納他的土地的忠誠
to the values of his adopted land.

697
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,220
賈維兄弟是位
Brother Garvey is a hero

698
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,570
致力于自由的英雄

699
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,730
但你不是
But you are not.

700
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,870
你只是個無足輕重的小人物
You are just a peddler and a pimp

701
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,480
乖乖坐在監獄里
sitting in a jail cell.

702
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,060
我是個商人  也是個基督徒

703
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,550
你同意跟我們合作  你愿意當什么
You agree to cooperate, you can go on pretending

704
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,910
就繼續當什么
to be anything you want.

705
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,040
不合作  我可以向你保證
You don't, and I will make sure

706
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,210
你再也見不到美利堅的陽光了
you never see daylight in America again.

707
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,790
我聽不見
I cannot hear you.

708
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,770
我說  是
I said yes.

709
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,770
是  什么
Yes, what?

710
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,870
是
Yes...

711
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,680
先生
sir.

712
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,240
老媽要的一切都在這了
That's everything Ma asked for.

713
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,600
湯姆隨后會去船上
Tom can run it up to Brigantine later.

714
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,530
除非你想去
Unless you want to do it.

715
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,870
我要在城里呆一會
I'm gonna stay in town for a little.

716
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,500
-不是想給你說教  -努基伯父  能不能
- Not trying to tell you-- - Uncle Nucky, can we just--

717
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,170
但是他們都靠你了
But they're counting on you--

718
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,880
你的母親  兄弟  姊妹
your mother, brothers and sisters.

719
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,720
你現在說了算
You're in charge now.

720
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,330
明白嗎
You understand?

721
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,240
我今晚出發
I'll drive up tonight.

722
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,850
這是正確的決定
That's the right decision.

723
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,480
我要怎么告訴他
What am I supposed to tell them?

724
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,980
說你父親和朋友待在西部  很安全
That your father is safe with friends out west.

725
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,740
他們不知道具體地址最好
It's best they don't know where.

726
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,870
這對大家來說都很艱難  但也只能這樣
It's hard on everyone, but that's how it has to be.

727
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,010
真的嗎
Is he?

728
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,970
什么真的嗎
Is he what?

729
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,670
他很安全
Safe.

730
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,170
說出你的想法  威爾
Speak your mind, Will.

731
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,690
如果我沒出現  你會怎么做
If I hadn't shown up, what would you have done?

732
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,470
他是你的父親  我的弟弟
He's your father, my brother.

733
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,110
我沒有你想的心那么狠
And I'm not the person you think I am.

734
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,530
晚點來信天翁
Come by the Albatross later.

735
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,160
我們一起走
We'll both head up.

736
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,590
這樣我們就能待在一起了
That way, all of us can be together, all right?

737
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,600
會越來越容易接受的  等著看吧
It gets easier. You'll see.
