1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,472
前情提要
Previously on Stargate: Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:05,103
放下武器
Lower your weapons.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,672
我们带来了基因疗法
We've come up with a gene therapy.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,966
成功了之后你们就可以像转基因土豆一样
We think we can make it so that you

5
00:00:10,134 --> 00:00:12,304
不用再吸食人类
will never need
to feed on humans again.

6
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:16,922
你们怎么可以无耻到如此地步？
How did you do that?

7
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,100
你不会真的认为是我们干的吧？
Surely you don't think we did this?

8
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,604
那儿怎么回事啊？Caldwell跑哪儿去了？
What the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,733
我们大家一起动手，把船给抢回来
We need everyone we can.
We're taking the ship back.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,278
Todd让我们把她带回来，不用动手
Todd let us take her back
without a fight,

11
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:35,283
但他把我们锁在外面了，现在缩到一个302战机舱
but he's locked us out of the controls
and retreated to one of the 302 bays.

12
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,037
这就是他炸毁设施的方法，把我们当人肉炸弹砸过去
That's how he's going to destroy
the facility, by ramming us into it.

13
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:43,293
你准备干嘛？
What'd you do?

14
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,503
打开一个足够大的超空间窗口，要容得下我们两艘船
Opened up a hyperspace window
big enough for the both of us.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,100
我们刚刚“穿越”了这行星
We just traveled through the planet.

16
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,969
他们还要多久才到，几分钟的事情
- How long till they get here?
- Just a matter of minutes.

17
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:57,755
准备好隐形了吗？全搞妥了
- Are we prepared to cloak the City?
- Yes, it's all set,

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,683
根据以往经验，个人认为护盾比隐形好
but for the record,
I still say the shield is a better idea.

19
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:03,645
因为，隐形后就没有任何防护了
Look, that cloak offers us
no protection whatsoever.

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,206
如果母舰直接跑到我们头顶上…… 这怎么可能？
- If that hive opens up on us...
- How could they do that?

21
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,514
他们需要知道我们的确切位置。不是吧？你真的以为他们不知道？
- They'd have to know our position.
- What, you're assuming they don't?

22
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:13,195
我们跟踪了他们好几天，他们肯定把船上的资料给弄走了
We've been tracking them for days!
They've got some inside information!

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,491
还是不要泄露我们的位置，直到确认安全为止
It's better not to confirm our location
until we know for sure.

24
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,744
没理由给他们个活靶子
No sense in giving them
an easy target to shoot at.

25
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:22,074
Sheppard上校，你那边怎么样了？
Colonel Sheppard,
what's your status?

26
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:25,502
发呆中…… 等下我一通知你就发射章鱼导弹
- Standing by.
- Be prepared to fire drones on my mark.

27
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:28,419
收到，到时候说声就行了
Copy that.
Just say the word.

28
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:31,787
同志们
Well,

29
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:35,093
我想我们尽量做好准备吧，开始隐形
I suppose we're as prepared
as we can be. Engage the cloak.

30
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,110
好的
All right.

31
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,818
OK，躲猫猫躲猫猫……
Okay. Cloak's engaged.

32
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,102
他们应该马上就到了
They should be here momentarily.

33
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:09,728
怎么啦？什么事都没有发生
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

34
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:13,840
他们只是呆在那儿。他们知不知道我们在这里啊？
- They're just sitting there.
- Do they know we're here?

35
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,054
等等，我刚收到一个消息。
Hang on.
I'm receiving a transmission.

36
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,180
好像是个文件。用台隔离的计算机把它读出来。
- It's a file of some kind.
- Pull it up on a firewalled computer.

37
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,038
上面说什么？什么都没有……一堆乱码……
- What's it say?
- It's nothing... a random bunch of...

38
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:38,420
等等。这是什么东东？
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

39
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:39,591
加密了的
It's encrypted.

40
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:42,462
和Daedalus号用的加密算法一样
Using the same kind of algorithm
we use on the Daedalus.

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,684
别开火……基因疗法开发……
Hold your fire...
Gene therapy developed...

42
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:50,113
Keller医生的...

43
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,030
怎么回事呀？我也不知道
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

44
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,174
貌似文件有点损毁了
Looks like
the file's corrupted somehow.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,636
……最初的结果无法消除疾病……
... initial results unable
to counteract the disease...

46
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,000
救救我们
Help us.

47
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:09,896
这什么乱七八糟的？
What on Earth does that mean?

48
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,127
我也不知道
I have no idea.

49
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,866
第五季17集 感染
Season 5 Episode 17
Infection (v. 1.00)

50
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:23,883


51
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,581


52
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:21,378
你什么意思，你弄不明白？
What do you mean,
you didn't understand him?

53
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:25,129
文件损坏了，我们只能恢复一些零碎的片段。
The file was corrupted.
We were only able to catch a few words.

54
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:29,080
即便如此，我们也能猜出来貌似他在求我们去救他。
Though, from what we could tell,
it seemed like he was asking for help.

55
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,091
凭什么啊？
With what?

56
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,385
去搞Jennifer的基因疗法？
Something to do
with Jennifer's gene therapy?

57
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:35,346
我们曾经给了他个机会去测试疗法，他却把我们给卖了。
Well, we gave him a chance to test it.
He double-crossed us.

58
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,252
我的意见是把它给轰出来
I say we blow him out of the sky.

59
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,478
我不同意你的观点
I can't say I disagree with you.

60
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:44,064
虽然我也觉得怪异，他就这么摆在那里
Though I do find it odd
he would just show up here,

61
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,899
明知道我们会做出什么样的战术反应
knowing that would be our reaction.

62
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,902
还有就是为什么会玩发送文件？而不是直接用无线电喊话？
And why send a file?
Why not just radio us directly?

63
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,238
无论他到底想要什么，对他来说肯定很重要。
Whatever he wants,
it must be really important.

64
00:04:51,406 --> 00:04:53,316
也许我们应该回应
Perhaps we should answer back.

65
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,544
告诉他我们没收好他的文件？
Tell him that we did not
receive the file properly?

66
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,440
这样我们就隐形不了啦
We might as well
just drop the cloak.

67
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,450
他们能根据无线电信号，追踪到我们的确切位置
They'll be able
to trace our radio signal.

68
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,000
不，我们可以用一艘Jumper来发送
No. We might be able
to do it from a Jumper.

69
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,793
跑到母船附近再和他们通信
Approach the hive cloaked,
and communicate with them from there.

70
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,407
但到时他们可以定位Jumper的确切位置
But then they would be able
to pinpoint the Jumper's exact location.

71
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:11,501
没错，但Jumper的机动性比这城市强多了。
Yes, but the Jumper's a lot more
maneuverable than the City.

72
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:15,692
我们不是第一次飞到Todd的门口了
This isn't the first time
we've flown up to Todd's doorstep.

73
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,737
有没有可能把视频处理得清晰一点？
Any chance
you could clean up that video?

74
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,562
把他的说话拼凑起来？不行啊，丢失太多数据了。
- Piece together what he's saying?
- No, there's too much data missing.

75
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,149
好吧，上校？
All right.
Colonel?

76
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,643
就来
On my way.

77
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,629
现在试试看……
Coming up on it now.

78
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,469
我是John Sheppard上校。
This is Colonel John Sheppard.

79
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:49,380
听到请回话
Please come in.

80
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:55,441
我们没有正确接收到你的视频传输。
We didn't receive
your video transmission correctly.

81
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,866
请回答。
Please respond.

82
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,065
他们听到了吗？
Are they getting this?

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,351
当然，他们应该听到了的。我的意思是，没理由他们……
Yeah, they should be.
I mean, there's no reason why they...

84
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,854
怎么回事？我搜不到任何生命迹象。
- What is it?
- I'm not picking up any life-signs.

85
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,655
什么？我想Rodney是对的。
- What?
- I believe Rodney is correct.

86
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:12,502
我也探测不到有幽灵存在
I have also not been able to detect
the presence of any Wraith.

87
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:15,363
我还以为是我们距离太远了呢，但这样就说的过去了
I thought it was because we were
too far, but this makes more sense.

88
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:16,665
是不是啊？
It does?

89
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,057
这船最好不是另一个现实跑过来的（平行宇宙？）
This better not be a ship
from another reality.

90
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:22,026
几天前我们就已经在盯着他们的行踪了，不记得了？
We've been tracking their approach
for a few days now, remember?

91
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,940
它不像另外一艘Daedalus那样，突然凭空蹦出来的
It didn't just pop into our space
like that other Daedalus did.

92
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:28,067
你知道当他们冬眠时我们的探测器是探测不到他们的
Look, we know that they don't show up
on our scans when they're hibernating.

93
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,377
这也许是个更符合逻辑的解释
I'd say that's probably
a more logical explanation.

94
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:31,752
所有人集体冬眠？
Hibernating.
All of them?

95
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,769
他们可以预先制定轨道，让船自己跑到这儿来
They could've pre-programmed the ship
to fly here on its own, enter orbit,

96
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,723
甚至还预先录了一段留言
even send a pre-recorded signal.

97
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:39,765
为什么啊？只有一个方法可以知道答案
- Why?
- There's only one way to find out.

98
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:46,217
我们接到一个信号，是Sheppard上校在加密频道上
We're receiving a signal. It's Colonel
Sheppard on a secure channel.

99
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:47,504
接入通话
Patch me in.

100
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,605
上面发生了什么事？
What's happening up there?

101
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:52,650
呃，幽灵使了个空城计
Well, the Wraith have thrown us
a little curve ball here.

102
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,989
没发现生命痕迹，我想他们都在冬眠
Got no life signs on board.
We think they're hibernating.

103
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,195
为什么捏？
Why do that?

104
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:59,032
这就是我们想要查清楚的，但必须要登船
That's what we'd like to find out,
but it means boarding the ship.

105
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,367
你确定没问题吧？如果是个陷阱怎么办？
Are you sure that's wise?
What if it's a trap?

106
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:04,240
呃，如果是真的，那实在很恶心，如果他们玩埋伏的话
Well, if it is, it's a pretty lousy one.
If they ambush us,

107
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,497
你仍可以在下面把他们打下来
you can still take 'em out
from down there.

108
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,500
牺牲你的性命？
Sacrificing your lives.

109
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,836
真荣幸你会认为Todd费了那么大周章来杀我
I'm flattered you think Todd
would go to so much trouble to kill me.

110
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,797
我认为如果能干掉一艘母舰
Look, taking out a hive ship

111
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:17,167
总是件好事，我们也不容易有这样的机会
is always a good idea,
but we did come all this way,

112
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:20,022
况且……还能弄点装备
and... got all dressed up.

113
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:21,895
好吧
All right.

114
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:30,905
还是没有他们的信号
No sign of 'em yet.

115
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,862
为什么我会觉得一艘空母舰
Why is it that I find empty Hives

116
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,051
比满是幽灵的母舰更让人毛骨悚然
even creepier than the ones
that are full of Wraith?

117
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:38,373
相信我，我们最好还是快点离开这里
Trust me, we're better off this way.

118
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,300
舰桥应该在上面
Bridge should be up here.

119
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,885
给我点时间……
All right, just...
give me a few seconds.

120
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:57,457
好的
All right.

121
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:04,431
看，我说的没错吧，他们都呆在冬眠舱里
Well, I was right.
They're all in their hibernation pods.

122
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:07,423
哪儿？船尾的一些屋子
- Where?
- There's chambers in the aft section.

123
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,770
最怪异的事情，就是……如果我没理解错的话……
The weird thing is, though,
if I'm reading this right,

124
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,855
他们没给自己设定起床闹钟
they haven't given themselves
a wake-up call.

125
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,649
你在说什么呀？
What?

126
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:17,238
通常情况下，他们会留一部小部分人醒着
The normal procedure
would be to leave crew members awake

127
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,697
来盯着冬眠舱的状态，到时间再把其他人弄醒
so that they could monitor the pods
and bring the others out when it's time,

128
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,904
现在既然他们全部进去了，按理说应该有某种自动装置
but since they all went in,
there'd be some kind of an automatic

129
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,286
或者设置定时关闭功能，但我一样都没发现
or timed shut-down protocol,
but I can't find one.

130
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,580
那么，如果我们不弄醒他们……
So if we do not wake them...

131
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:32,458
他们就永远醒不来了。听起来很爽啊~
- Then they never will.
- Sounds good to me.

132
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,677
你难道不觉得奇怪吗？Todd会把自己
Do you do not find it odd
that Todd would leave himself

133
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:40,383
和他的全体船员都交由我们发落？尤其是经过上次的事件之后？
and his entire crew to our mercy?
Especially after our last encounter?

134
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,568
可能他的智商没有你想象的那么高呢
Maybe he's not as smart
as you think he is.

135
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:48,639
这是什么？某种能量波动
- What was that?
- Some kind of power fluctuation.

136
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:52,436
读数显示某些次级系统故障
I'm reading minor malfunctions
in several of the ship's systems.

137
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:55,442
等等……
Hang on...

138
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,053
我拿到Todd的视频文件了，貌似未受损
I got Todd's video file.
Looks like it's intact.

139
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,754
我想它已经坏了。可能在传输时候搞坏的
- I thought it was corrupted.
- It must've happened in transmission,

140
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,530
通信系统的小差错
some glitch in the comm system.

141
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,491
原件，在这了，搞掂。让我看看
- The original, it's there. All right.
- Let's see it.

142
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,870
别开火，我们没有恶意
Hold your fire.
We mean you no harm.

143
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:13,786
在你们采取行动之前，让我先解释一下我们为什么会来这里
Allow me to explain our presence here before you take any action.

144
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:15,792
如果你们看到这个信息
If you are seeing this message,

145
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,963
意味着我们的船已经安全抵达Atlantis
my ship has arrived safely
at Atlantis.

146
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,050
我来是因为我和我的船员们
I'm coming to you because my crew

147
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:25,785
都受到了某种疾病的折磨
and I have been stricken with a disease...

148
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,337
是由Keller医生开发的基因疗法所引起的综合症
A complication to the gene therapy developed by Dr. Keller...

149
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,650
不是吧？我们都没给他……
- Wait a second. We didn't give 'em...
- ... I acquired some of the formulation

150
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,768
当我们占领Daedalus时，我们获取了一些公式
while my crew and I were occupying the Daedalus.

151
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,863
我承认
I admit,

152
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:43,121
我也想看看它是否可行
I wanted to see if it would actually work.

153
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,158
它确实管用
And it did.

154
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:49,077
最初的试验结果很不错
The initial results were nothing short of astonishing.

155
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,575
你们可以自己看
See for yourself.

156
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:58,498
我感到非常满意，于是决定给全体船员施用
I was so impressed, I decided to treat my entire crew.

157
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,652
那时候我们才开始发现问题
It was only then that we began to notice problems.

158
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,928
第一批试验的船员生病并且死去
The first group grew sick and died.

159
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,301
没多久，其余的人也开始生病
Before long, others began to get sick as well.

160
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,977
我们自身的免疫系统无法抵抗这种疾病
Our natural healing ability was unable to counteract the disease.

161
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,167
于是我不得不来这里
I have come here

162
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,817
作为最后希望
as a matter of last resort.

163
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,320
我意识到
I realize

164
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:26,991
上次我们是有点分歧
we have had our differences of late,

165
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,118
也许你们会不情愿帮忙……
and you may be reluctant to help us...

166
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:36,325
但请记住……
But remember this...

167
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,778
如果我们死了，我希望你们
If we die, any hope you may have

168
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:44,464
将来不要再使用这种治疗方案
of distributing this treatment in the future dies with us.

169
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,814
决定权在你们
The choice is yours.

170
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,930
现在我们知道怎么回事了
Now that we know what happened,

171
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:04,364
我们可以朝他们发射章鱼导弹，删除文件然后走人
we can just fire drones at 'em, and close the file and move on.

172
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,363
你说他用来吸食的手已经正常了……
You said his feeding hand was clean...

173
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,198
意味着治疗生效了，至少，有效了一小会儿
Which means the treatment worked, at least for a while.

174
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,400
然后就把他们给害死了，我不知道……
Then it started killing them, so I don't know

175
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,369
如果他们都想变成这样
if they're gonna line up for this one.

176
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:17,206
我们必须找出来哪儿出了问题
Which is why we need to find out exactly what went wrong.

177
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,877
我们要一点一滴地仔细检查母舰上的医疗数据
We need to examine every scrap of medical data on that Hive.

178
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,840
我们甚至要唤醒一些幽灵
We may even need to revive a few of the Wraith

179
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,059
这样Keller医生就可以进行完整的医疗评估
so Dr. Keller can perform a complete physical evaluation.

180
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,804
很抱歉，但IOA强烈要求
I'm sorry, but the IOA is strongly committed

181
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,847
开发这种基因疗法
to the development of this gene therapy.

182
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,765
这是他们唯一的一次达成一致意见
It's a thing they all agree on.

183
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:39,436
如果这方案实在是不可行，那也没办法，但他们要看到证据
If it's simply not workable, so be it, but they're going to want to see proof.

184
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:43,365
我说这方案超好，把幽灵都杀光光了，你还要怎么样？
I say it works fine. It kills Wraith. What more do you want?

185
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,428
你是说我们把方程式保持原样
You're suggesting we keep the formula as is,

186
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:48,612
并且找个方法故意让它泄露出去？
and find a way of exposing them involuntarily.

187
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,803
为什么不？
Why not?

188
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,367
把幽灵一次性消灭光光，IOA肯定会高兴得不行
Get rid of the Wraith once and for all. The IOA would approved that.

189
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,285
问题在于传递渠道
The problem is in the delivery systems.

190
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:58,040
我们刚朝Beckett医生的逆转录酶病毒这方向努力
We just went down this road with Beckett's retrovirus.

191
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,303
就算我们成功把它改造为生化武器
And even if we do succeed in weaponizing the treatment,

192
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,084
也不见得我们能够成功全部灭绝幽灵
it is unlikely that we would wipe out the Wraith entirely.

193
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,359
最多我们可以削弱他们
At best, we would weaken them.

194
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:08,172
这我没有异议。另一方面，
- I don't have a problem with that.
- On the other hand,

195
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,865
如果我们可以成功地改造他们的进食习惯
if we do succeed in eliminating their need to feed,

196
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,513
也许就可以说服他们自愿接受治疗
we might be able convince them to take the treatment willingly.

197
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:18,726
这两个方面，无论是改进医疗方法或者把它变成生化武器
Either way, whether it's perfecting the formula as a treatment or a weapon,

198
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,728
我们都需要尽可能地收集各种资料
we need to gather as much information as we possibly can,

199
00:12:21,897 --> 00:12:23,772
这又回到原点了
which brings me back to the same conclusion...

200
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,398
我们需要回到母舰上
We need to go back up there.

201
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,442
这次，Keller医生会和你们一起去
This time, have Dr. Keller accompany you,

202
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:31,286
还有Lorne少校的队伍，以及另外一个海军陆战队小组
as well as Major Lorne's team and another unit of Marines.

203
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:34,240
你仍然不能确定这是不是一个圈套？
Are you still not sure if it's a trap?

204
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:36,419
这么说吧，跟Todd打交道过程中
Let's just say I've learned to exercise

205
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:39,330
我学会了小心谨慎
an abundance of caution when dealing with Todd.

206
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,455
好吧
All right.

207
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:57,386
我的手下已经建立了环防圈，他们每小时都会检查
My men have established a perimeter. They'll be checking in every hour.

208
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,449
我知道！我知道！能量波动
I know! I know! Power fluctuations.

209
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,115
看，就像我说的，船上的某些系统有点儿运作不正常
Look, it's like I said, some of the ship's systems are acting up a little.

210
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,444
你把它修好就是了。一会儿就好
- Well, get it fixed.
- Yeah, give me a few minutes.

211
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,638
Lorne少校，我是Williams上尉
Major Lorne, this is Lieutenant Williams.

212
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:39,608
请讲
Go ahead.

213
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,033
先生，你要我们汇报每件不寻常的事情？
Sir, you wanted us to report anything unusual?

214
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,425
是的，上尉，你有什么发现？
That's right, Lieutenant. What do you got?

215
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,152
是这样的，长官，我正站在这里观察，听到了一些噪声，然后……
Well, Sir, I was standing watch, and I heard a noise, and...

216
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,692
这墙开始融化了
The wall is melting.

217
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,793
什么？再说一遍？
Sorry? Come again?

218
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:55,947
等等……我想它停止了
Wait a minute... I think it stopped.

219
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,175
原地待命
Stand by.

220
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,775
Williams，回答
Williams, come in.

221
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,513
上尉，请回话
Lieutenant, please respond.

222
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:24,327
你好吗？
How you doing?

223
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:27,395
一切都好？
That good?

224
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,959
我不知道，我想，我……
I don't know, I mean, I...

225
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,086
我想我已经取得进展了
I guess I'm making progress.

226
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:35,342
我查出来是什么杀死了他们。你做到了？
- I found out what was killing them.
- You did?

227
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,662
治疗确实是按原计划进行了
The treatment worked exactly like it was supposed to...

228
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:41,162
消除了他们的手掌的吸食口，并且激活了他们的消化系统
It eliminated their feeding hands, it activated their digestive systems,

229
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,203
就像模拟时一样
just like it did in the simulation,

230
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,225
但是，很不幸，它还产生了一种
but, unfortunately, it also created

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,906
致命的类似癌症的疾病，同时在削弱他们的
a virulent cancer-like disease at the same time that it was weakening

232
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,420
免疫系统，就是这个要了他们的老命
their immune systems. That's what killed them.

233
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,836
那么，你还可以做点什么呢？
Well, is there anything you can do about it?

234
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,217
不知道，可能，应该可以……
I don't know. Maybe. It's possible.

235
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:58,845
什么？
What?

236
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:02,058
刚才突然感觉到对我来说太难了
I just feel like I'm in over my head.

237
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,901
你在说什么呢？
What are you talking about?

238
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,728
我看着你，Sheppard上校，还有小组的其他人……
I look at you, and Colonel Sheppard, the rest of the team...

239
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,925
你们经常做出抉择
You guys are so used to making decisions

240
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,273
这些抉择会影响成千上万人的生活
that affect the lives of thousands,

241
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:13,712
甚至几百万人
and even millions of people.

242
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:17,237
我并不习惯掌握着这个星系平衡的命运
I'm not so used to having the fate of the galaxy hang in the balance.

243
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:20,574
额，这个……你最好还是慢慢适应吧，有助于培养极大的自我满足感
Oh, that. You get used to it. Helps to have a massive ego.

244
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,785
听着，我不太懂得幽灵的生理学
Look, I don't know much about Wraith physiology,

245
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:24,898
但我了解你
but I know you.

246
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,529
如果有人可以处理好这个问题，那就是你
And if anyone can make this work, you can.

247
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:37,831
那么……这儿就是已知他最后所处的位置了
Well... This is his last known position.

248
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:41,010
上校！我们在这边发现了一些东西！
Colonel! We got something over here!

249
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,636
没有开火痕迹
Hasn't been fired.

250
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:59,148
要不要我叫更多人来帮忙找他？
Should I call up for some more personnel to help track him down?

251
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,740
我有个更好的主意，Rodney？
No, I got a better idea. Rodney?

252
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,851
这船上的地图是否可以加入生命探测信号？
Are the ship's schematics loaded into the life-signs detector?

253
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:08,087
我们第一次来就装上了，怎么啦？好的，等一下我们会用到
- I did it when we first got here. Why?
- Well, we're gonna need 'em.

254
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,902
有什么发现？没，只有我们俩
- Anything?
- No, it's just us.

255
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,923
Ronon，Teyla，你们那边有什么发现？
Ronon, Teyla, anything on your end?

256
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:21,405
没有，上校
I'm afraid not, Colonel.

257
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:23,520
好的，保持联系
All right. Stay in touch.

258
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,855
这是什么鬼东西？
What the hell is this?

259
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:33,827
应该是个开放的通道
It's supposed to be an open corridor.

260
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,651
我看看。这里
- Let me see.
- Here.

261
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:41,902
Rodney?

262
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,387
你给我们的地图很搞啊
This schematic you gave us is a piece of crap.

263
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:48,777
你说什么？这儿有个死胡同，地图上没有的
- What are you talking about?
- A dead end that's not on the map.

264
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:49,996
不可能！
That's impossible!

265
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,526
听着，我正盯着这里看呢。你也听着，我不知道该怎么说
- Look, I'm staring at it right now.
- Look, I don't know what to tell you.

266
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,960
我直接从船上的数据库把地图下载回来的
I pulled that schematic directly from the ship's database.

267
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,191
好极了，我还要兜一圈回去
Great. We have to double back.

268
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,312
Sheppard上校，我是Teyla，请回答
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla, please respond.

269
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,945
请讲。我们发现Williams上尉了
- Go ahead.
- We found Lieutenant Williams.

270
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:05,906
我想他已经挂了
I'm afraid he's dead.

271
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,276
发生了什么事？他受到攻击
- What happened?
- He was attacked.

272
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,478
谁？
By who?

273
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:15,901
不知道
I don't know,

274
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:18,892
但无论是什么东西，它想吃了他
but whatever it was, it tried to eat him.

275
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:21,194
你的意思是吸食？
You mean feed on him?

276
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:25,031
不，我的意思是吃了他，用牙齿咬的，像个动物一样
No. I mean eat him. With teeth, like an animal.

277
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,037
什么？
What?

278
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:31,750
好吧……向总部报告，让他们派些人去搬回尸体
All right... Radio back, try to get somebody to pick up the body.

279
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,331
与此同时，我们必须查出来到底怎么……
In the meantime, we're gonna have to figure out who the hell...

280
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,840
等等。我看到了一些东西
Hang on. We got something.

281
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:46,828
回到我们的位置
Move back to our position.

282
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:12,668
长官？
Sir?

283
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,345
在里面
In here.

284
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:36,897
另一个死胡同
Another dead end.

285
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:41,645
这完全说不过去，信号明明在我们头上
Well, this doesn't make any sense. The signal's right on top of us.

286
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,424
没事吧你们？
Is everybody okay?

287
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,965
我想是的。这是什么东西？
- Yeah. I think so.
- What the hell is that?

288
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,726
一个没有面具的幽灵战士
A Wraith soldier without the mask.

289
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,623
我从来没有想过他们会取下他们的面具
I didn't think they ever took those things off.

290
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:24,233
没有吸食手，记得吗？那他们吃什么？
No feeding hand, remember? How else is he gonna eat?

291
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,647
噢，爽了，这下我们要和饥饿的幽灵斗了
Oh, great. So now we have to contend with starving Wraith

292
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,646
那帮家伙刚学会用牙齿
who are just learning to use their teeth?

293
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,708
都是我的错，是我把他们所知道的
This is my fault. I'm the one that took away

294
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,664
唯一的进食机制剥夺了
the only practical feeding mechanism they ever knew.

295
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,959
好吧，我承认这有点麻烦
All right, look, I admit that it's a little disturbing,

296
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,831
但他们之前也并不像是人类的好朋友
but it's not like they were man's best friend before.

297
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,722
只是同一样东西的另一个版本
Just a different version of the same thing.

298
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,207
问题是，他们如何出来？能量波动
- The question is, how did it get out?
- The power fluctuations.

299
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,210
看来影响比我原来想象的更广泛
They must be more widespread than I thought.

300
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:53,050
那会怎么样？
So?

301
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:56,209
那么，这肯定有某种安全机制
So, there must be a safety protocol of some kind.

302
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,708
当能量中断时，冬眠舱会自行关闭
When there's an interruption of the power, the pods shut down

303
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,437
然后就把里面的人给放出来。但你已经稳定它了
- and release their occupant.
- But you stabilized it.

304
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:04,148
对不对？我是说……其余的冬眠舱都没问题吧？
Right? I mean... All the other pods are fine?

305
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,585
可能吧
They might be.

306
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,169
我……事实上我一直没确定在哪儿出了问题，所以……
I'm... I never actually figured out what was wrong, so...

307
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,030
有没有办法判断是否有其他冬眠舱也受到了影响？
Is there any way to determine if any of the other pods have been compromised?

308
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:14,408
这个我也不知道。也许，我们可以走下去看看
Well, I don't know. Maybe. I suppose we could go down and look.

309
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,702
我有个更好的主意，我们离开这鬼地方吧。
I got a better idea. Let's get the hell out of here.

310
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,330
除非我已经整理完相关的资料
Except I haven't finished sorting through the relevant data.

311
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,755
我意思是IOA…… IOA来咬我啊？我们撤
- The IOA...
- The IOA can sue me. Let's go.

312
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:34,457
什么？我知道这是条路
- What?
- I know this is the way,

313
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:37,334
因为早上我们还从这儿进来，但现在看起来变了
because we came by here this morning, but this looks different.

314
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,363
大概是你的幻觉吧？
You're probably imagining it.

315
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:41,923
也许不是……
Or not.

316
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:47,891
这墙从哪儿来的？本来这没有的
Where did that wall come from?
It wasn't there.

317
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,772
这怎么可能？我不知道！
- How's that possible?
- I don't know!

318
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:52,020
我们要找到另外一条路出去
We need to figure out another way out of here.

319
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:55,771
OK……看来如果我们走回头一点点
Okay... It looks like if we go back the way we came a bit,

320
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:59,336
我们可以走到另外一条走廊，可以绕到另外一边
we should hook up with another corridor that loops around the other side.

321
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,638
前面带路。好的……
- Lead the way.
- All right, well...

322
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:10,084
就是这儿了
All right, this is it.

323
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:13,237
穿过这里，大约100米，我们就到了
Through here, about a hundred meters, and we are there.

324
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:27,250
天哪！
Oh, my God.

325
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,585
这个…… 这可不妙。还用你说？
- Oh, this... This is not good.
- You're telling me?

326
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,237
dart船舱在另外一面，这是唯一出去的路
The dart bay's on the other side. This is the only way out of here.

327
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,700
你是不是准备告诉我为什么有那么大一个洞
You wanna tell me how a giant hole

328
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,651
魔术般出现在船中间？
magically appears in the middle of a ship?

329
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:49,211
事实上，关于这个，我有个看法。你知道？
- Actually, I have a theory about that.
- You do?

330
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:51,259
你瞧，那些小差错，之前解释过的
Look, these glitches we've been experiencing,

331
00:21:51,384 --> 00:21:54,461
他们并不受能源规则限制，他们发布在每个主系统
they ain't confined to power regulation. They're in every major system.

332
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,938
我会叫它们做“一堆小差错。”这可是一场大装修
I wouldn't call 'em "glitches." This is a major renovation.

333
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,688
我知道，但你想想看
I know, but think about it.

334
00:21:58,813 --> 00:22:00,686
幽灵船是基于有机组织的，对不对？
The Wraith ships are basically organic, right?

335
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:03,277
我的意思是，它们可以根据定制自己长出来
I mean, they're capable of self-regeneration when they're damaged,

336
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,061
但并非只有船体可以这样
but not just the hull.

337
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:07,782
还包括内部结构
The same systems regulate internal structure as well,

338
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:10,566
那么当这个系统发生故障，其余部分……
so if those systems are malfunctioning along with the others...

339
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,810
你认为这艘船正在自我修复？
You think the ship is repairing itself incorrectly?

340
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:17,209
不是修复，更像重新构造
Not repairing so much as reconfiguring.

341
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:21,561
你想想，当Williams死之前他说看到墙壁正在融化
Look, before he was killed, Williams said he saw the wall melt.

342
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:25,062
我们也经历过了，那些死胡同，本来应该是走廊的
We've experienced it, dead ends when there's supposed to be corridors.

343
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:28,917
这些“重新构造”是不是已经把我们去dart船舱的路给封死了？
And this reconfiguration has completely cut us off from the dart bay?

344
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,540
我只能说，是的。和Atlantis通话
- From what I can tell, yes.
- Get on the line to Atlantis.

345
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:35,281
让他们派些Jumper和工程兵过来，我们要想办法出去了
Have some Jumpers and combat engineers. We need to get outta here.

346
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:37,831
事实上，我也没办法，因为通信系统
Actually, I can't do that, because the communications systems

347
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,553
已经完全离线
are now completely offline.

348
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:41,530
你丫…… 说吧，你要我干嘛？
- Rodney...
- Look, what do you want me to do?

349
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,877
如果我知道这是什么原因引起的，我还能想想办法
If I knew what causing this, I could do something about it,

350
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,939
但是这些故障，到处都是
but these malfunctions are showing up everywhere.

351
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,019
我的意思是，它们看上去完全是随机的
I mean, they seem to be entirely random!

352
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,918
那我们只好困在这儿了？目前来说，是的
- So we're stuck here?
- For the time being, yes.

353
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:53,664
我一点办法都没有了
I do have an idea.

354
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,446
我们唤醒Todd。什么？
- We revive Todd.
- What?

355
00:22:57,685 --> 00:23:00,824
他了解这船，也许他能知道哪儿出了问题
He knows about this ship. Maybe he can help me figure out what's wrong.

356
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:03,869
你不会忘了上个幽灵跑出了吃了我们一个海军陆战队员吧？
You do remember the last Wraith that came out ate one of our marines?

357
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:05,796
他只是个幽灵战士
He was just a warrior drone.

358
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,162
我们长期以来都怀疑他们的大半生
We've long suspected they spend the majority of their life

359
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,932
都在其他幽灵的心灵控制之下
under the controlling mental influence of the other Wraith.

360
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,011
当你突然去掉心灵控制，发生这样子的事情一点不奇怪
It's not surprising if you remove that influence

361
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,653
他们回到野兽状态
they revert to an animal state.

362
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:18,124
但这种情况也可能发生在Todd身上。是的，但你忘了一件事情
- But that shouldn't happen with Todd.
- Yeah, but you're forgetting one thing.

363
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:20,561
我还没找到了一种可以治愈他们致命疾病的方法
I haven't found a cure for the disease that was killing them.

364
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:24,305
我的意思是，就算把他放出来，他也挺不了很久
I mean, we take him out, and he might not last long.

365
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:26,767
好吧，这是一项，但我更喜欢有个计划
Well, that's the one thing， I like about the plan.

366
00:23:27,502 --> 00:23:28,574
好极了！
Oh, great!

367
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,749
导航系统正在启动，无论你有什么计划，都要快一点了。
Navigation's acting up. Whatever we decide, we gotta do it quickly,

368
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:35,293
因为我们在这种故障状态下坚持不了多久
because I cannot stay ahead of these malfunctions for much longer.

369
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,556
你确定要这么干吗？
You sure about this?

370
00:24:10,628 --> 00:24:12,020
感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

371
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,562
没想到你会来
I did not think you would come.

372
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:16,066
朋友是用来干吗的？（相互利用呗）
What are friends for?

373
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:18,777
你的船要烂了
Your ship is malfunctioning.

374
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,529
我们需要你来修一下
We need you to fix it.

375
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,749
你唤醒我就是为了这个？没错
- You woke me for this?
- That's right.

376
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:25,561
我们有活要干了
We've got work to do.

377
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,282
你知道，我已经……试过这个了
You know, I did...
I tried that already.

378
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,921
好吧，好吧，你继续，我只是飘过……
Okay, all right. You know what? You just go ahead.

379
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,548
今天早上有些人在冬眠舱另外一面醒来
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the pod this morning.

380
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:42,124
这没道理
This makes no sense.

381
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:45,428
这系统不稳定。我已经告诉过你了！
- The systems are behaving erratically.
- I've been trying to tell you that!

382
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:47,435
你都干了些什么？什么都没干！
- What have you done to them?
- Nothing!

383
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,811
我们一上船就发现它已经这样抽风了
They've been acting screwy since the moment we came on board!

384
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,248
什么都失灵了
Nothing's responding the way it should.

385
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,801
就有点像……
It's almost as if...

386
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:56,940
像什么？
What?

387
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,818
不，这不可能
No, it's not possible.

388
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,570
什么不可能？
What's not possible?

389
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:04,575
我想我知道为什么这船会发生故障了
I believe I know why the ship is malfunctioning.

390
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,203
船感染了病毒？
The disease is in the ship?

391
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,938
这是唯一合理解释
It is the only explanation that makes sense.

392
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:14,688
既然你那么说
If you say so.

393
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,435
这怎么可能？
How is that even possible?

394
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,809
在冬眠的过程中
During the process of hibernation,

395
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,540
母舰和幽灵不断交换流质
there is a continuous exchange of fluid between Wraith and hive.

396
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,527
病毒肯定也是透过这种方式传播
The disease must have been transmitted in this manner.

397
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:29,060
晕倒，那我们现在在一个巨型肿瘤里面飞行了
Great. So we're flying around in a giant tumor.

398
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,223
而且还没有出口
With no way off.

399
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:34,609
时间拖得越久，病毒就发展得更凶猛
As time goes on and the disease progresses,

400
00:25:34,998 --> 00:25:37,623
越来越多的系统会受到影响……
more and more systems will become affected...

401
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:40,686
惯性阻尼、生命支持系统、船体完整性……
Inertial dampeners, life support, hull integrity...

402
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:41,860
我们能不能让它着陆？
Can we land it?

403
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:47,810
在最好的状态下，让一艘母舰着陆都异常复杂
Landing a hive is a tricky proposition in the best of circumstances.

404
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,784
在这种状况下，我可不建议这样
Under these conditions, I would not recommend it.

405
00:25:50,953 --> 00:25:52,037
那么我们还能怎么办？
So, what do we do?

406
00:25:52,776 --> 00:25:54,748
我们只有一件事情可以做了
There is only one thing we can do.

407
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,810
我们必须治愈这种疾病。等一等
- We must cure this disease.
- Wait a second.

408
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:00,499
目前我也是仅仅从皮毛上知道在治疗过程中出了什么问题
I've barely scratched the surface on what went wrong here.

409
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,813
我的意思是，可能要花数月时间来分析那些数据
I mean, it could take months to analyze the data.

410
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,280
按照飞船目前这种退化速度
At the current level of the ship's degradation,

411
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:08,011
估计在它变得不适合居住之前，我们还有四天时间
I estimate we have four days before it becomes uninhabitable.

412
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:10,305
所以，你最好马上开工
Well, you better get to work.

413
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,747
现在怎么样了？Rodney？
How's it going, Rodney?

414
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,810
很超现实的，每次我修好某样东西
Aside from the fact, every time I fix something,

415
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:22,650
另外一样又坏了，好的很哪
something else breaks, fine.

416
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,873
那么我们会遇到越来越频繁的能量波动？
So we can expect more of these power fluctuations?

417
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:28,405
看来情况会变得更糟糕。那我们就有问题了
- Likely. Probably gonna get worse.
- Then we've got a problem.

418
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,159
其他的幽灵。我们可不能让他们都跑出来
- The other Wraith.
- We can't afford to let them get out.

419
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:32,999
还好，我已经识别出
Well, I have been able to identify

420
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,248
我们刚谈到的安全协议
that safety protocol I was talking about.

421
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:38,773
我也许可以重载它，但要做一点点关键性修改
I won't be able to override it, but I'll make a few key alterations.

422
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,255
额，像怎么样的？我的意思是，最简单的方法
- Yeah? Like what?
- Well, I mean, the simplest thing to do

423
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,841
当冬眠舱关闭时
would be to make it so the pods don't release the Wraith

424
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:45,253
可以让冬眠舱不再放幽灵出来，但是……
when they shut down, but...

425
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,841
这会杀了他们。通常是窒息而死
That would kill them.
Basically suffocate them.

426
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:49,834
好极了，他们是幽灵
Great. They're Wraith.

427
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:52,471
是吗？他们接受了治疗，他们不再吸食人类
Are they? They've taken the treatment, they no longer feed.

428
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:55,248
你去告诉Williams上尉吧。那Todd怎么办？
- Tell that to Lieutenant Williams.
- What about Todd?

429
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:58,250
如果他的船员大量死亡，他肯定想知道怎么回事
If significant numbers of his crew are killed, he will demand to know why.

430
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:01,231
只是另外一种故障引起的，开始吧
Just another malfunction. Do it.

431
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:03,564
好的
All right.

432
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,733
你没事吧？
You all right?

433
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:13,546
等一下就会过去了
It will pass.

434
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,315
抱歉
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,706
我没想到会变成这样
I never meant for any of this to happen.

436
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:22,252
我的确认为这种治疗对每个人都有好处
I honestly thought the treatment would make things better for everyone.

437
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:27,998
你觉得很搞笑吗？
What's funny?

438
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,238
我觉得很有意思
I find it amusing,

439
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:34,375
人类向幽灵道歉
human apologizing to Wraith.

440
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,186
你无法理解怜悯
You don't understand compassion.

441
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:39,697
你只是把它视为软弱
You just view it as a sign of weakness.

442
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:41,104
难道不是吗？
Isn't it?

443
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,065
不，差远了
No, not by a long shot.

444
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,444
我不敢担保Sheppard上校会同意你的观点
I'm not sure Colonel Sheppard would agree with you.

445
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,948
Sheppard上校是个战士，而我是个医生
Colonel Sheppard's a soldier. I'm a Doctor.

446
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:53,316
啊，对
Ah, yes.

447
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:56,737
他的本职是杀戮，而你的工作是拯救生命
His job is to take lives, and yours is to save them.

448
00:27:56,872 --> 00:27:59,483
不，他的工作也包括拯救生命
No, his job is also to save lives.

449
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:03,292
他只是使用一套不同的工具
He just has a different set of tools.

450
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:12,312
好了……
All right...

451
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:16,123
我刚创建了一个子程序，来跳过安全协议
I've created a program
to override the safety protocol.

452
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:18,022
你确定我们要这么干吗？
You sure you want me to do this?

453
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,562
继续。好的
- Go ahead.
- All right.

454
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:30,236
这是什么？
What is that?

455
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:33,686
只是其中一间冬眠室，它不接受新的指令
It's one of the hibernation chambers. It's not accepting the new commands.

456
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,535
糟了，我在这里无法访问系统
No, it's no good. I can't access it from here.

457
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:39,344
有多少个幽灵在里面？
How many of them are in there?

458
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:43,082
这是其中比较小的一间，最多也就几十个吧
It's one of the smaller chambers, so a couple of dozen at the most.

459
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:48,171
我们要找其他的方法来对付这帮家伙了
We're gonna have to figure out another way to deal with these guys.

460
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:03,061
上校……
Colonel...

461
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,398
这可不是什么好兆头，赶紧行动
Well, that's not a good sign. Let's move.

462
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,229
能量波动
Power fluctuations.

463
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,627
更多幽灵会跑出来
More of them could be out.

464
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,030
这正是我担心的
This is what I was afraid of.

465
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,363
我刚知道你为什么不能访问最后一个冬眠室了
We just figured out why you weren't able to access the last chamber.

466
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:36,400
什么？什么原因？
What? What is it?

467
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:38,887
我们来晚了，冬眠舱已经打开了
We're too late. The pods are opened.

468
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:40,723
有多少跑了出来？
How many got out?

469
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,043
全部
All of them.

470
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:51,450
现在我们分成几个小组，把每层甲板分成四个区
Alright, we're gonna split into teams. Divide each deck into four sections,

471
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,201
我们要逐层清扫，从这个地方开始
we're gonna sweep through, starting from this position.

472
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,729
别犹豫
Don't take any chances.

473
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:58,550
看到移动物体就开火，都清楚了吗？
Shoot anything that moves. Everyone clear?

474
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,936
好的，开工吧
All right, let's move out.

475
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,753
在这里
It says here

476
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:41,318
在你的治疗方案里
you attempted to use Iratus DNA

477
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:42,840
你试图使用Iratus虫的DNA
in your treatment.

478
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:47,045
没错，我认为用Iratus虫纯净的基因
I thought using the pure DNA of an Iratus bug

479
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,829
也许有助于防止幽灵能力的衰退
would help prevent the deterioration of your Wraith abilities.

480
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,769
这是Michael的主意，不过可能说了你也不会相信
Got the idea from Michael, if you can believe that,

481
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,513
但是，很不幸，它没起作用，那么……
but, unfortunately, it didn't work, so...

482
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,452
怎么啦？
What is it?

483
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:01,730
我有个主意了
I have an idea.

484
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:06,391
Sheppard上校，请回答。我是Sheppard
- Colonel Sheppard, come in, please?
- This is Sheppard.

485
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:09,453
我要你下到实验室，Todd有话要跟你说
We need you to come down to the lab.
Todd needs to speak to you.

486
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:12,241
现在我有点忙，能不能等等？
I'm a little busy right now. Can it wait?

487
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:14,208
看来不行
Apparently not.

488
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,694
去跟Teyla和Ramirez汇合，直到我回来
Meet up with Teyla and Ramirez till I get back.

489
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:24,534
有什么事情急成这样啊？他说有个方法可以可以弥补
- What's so damn important?
- He says there's a way to fix this.

490
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:25,724
弥补什么？
Fix what?

491
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,818
治愈疾病？不是治愈
- Cure the disease?
- Not cure it,

492
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:29,567
而是恢复
but undo it.

493
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:31,708
到底什么意思啊？
What are you talking about?

494
00:31:31,877 --> 00:31:34,490
你知道，健康的幽灵本来就有些特殊的能力
As you know, healthy Wraith have an inherent ability

495
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:37,385
比如我们从来不得慢性病
to heal themselves of almost any ailment,

496
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:41,676
但并非一开始就是这样，几十万年前
but this has not always been the case. Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

497
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,430
曾经有过一种把死幽灵当作活幽灵来医的方法
there was a treatment of last resort.

498
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,547
好吧，给我讲讲幽灵史
All right, spare me the history lessons.

499
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,270
一些病入膏肓的重症幽灵
A terminally ill Wraith

500
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:51,619
有时候可以神奇地恢复到最佳健康状态
could occasionally restore himself to perfect health

501
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:55,706
如果他让一条那种你们叫做“Iratus虫”
if he allowed an Iratus "bug", as you call them,

502
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,735
特别是虫后，来吸食他的话
specifically a queen, to feed on him.

503
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,946
你不会刚刚才想起这回事吧？
And you're just bringing this up now?

504
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:04,453
这种治疗方法早就废弃了，因为太危险
The process was abandoned long ago because it is dangerous,

505
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:08,259
几乎总会让尝试的幽灵送命
almost always resulting in the death of the Wraith in question.

506
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:11,037
我只是……
I only...

507
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,772
现在才考虑这个，是因为……
consider it now because...

508
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,930
看来我们……
it would appear that we are...

509
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:18,046
没什么希望了
beyond hope.

510
00:32:20,837 --> 00:32:22,722
现在，这里有个行星
Now, there is a planet

511
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:26,179
不超过三天的路程，在那里我们能找到我们需要的东西
less than three days' journey where we will find what we need.

512
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:29,600
我们几乎不能让这一砣东西保持在轨道上，难道你想用它来超光速飞行？
We can barely keep this thing in orbit,
and you want to take it into hyperspace?

513
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,477
我应付得了
I can manage it.

514
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,604
还是算了吧，我看还是在这里找出一个解决方法比较靠谱
Well, forget about it. We're gonna
come up with a solution right here.

515
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:38,229
这是唯一能拯救我船员的方法。好吧，那我们不走
- This is the only way to save my crew.
- Well, we're not leaving.

516
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:41,611
至少出于礼貌，你也应该对我诚实点
At least do me the courtesy of being honest.

517
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:48,882
这跟你没关系，你也没什么理由
This is not about not you not wanting

518
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,106
冒险乘坐一艘受损的船进入超空间
to risk a jump to hyperspace on a damaged ship.

519
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,793
你不想我去，是因为我将要拯救上百个
You do not want me to go because I'll be restoring the lives

520
00:32:55,918 --> 00:32:58,612
病得半死的幽灵，包括我自己
of hundreds of unhealthy Wraith, including myself.

521
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:00,672
我必须承认，这念头我也有过
I got to admit, that did cross my mind.

522
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,456
但这疾病你们有不可推卸的责任
This disease is your responsibility.

523
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:07,989
如果当初我不同意和你讨论这个……
If I had not agreed to meet with you to discuss this...

524
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:09,953
你们的“发明”
innovation of yours,

525
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,894
我和我的船员也不会处于如此境地
my crew and I would not be in this predicament!

526
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,429
这么说来，我是不是应该仁慈一点
Well, I might be feeling a little more charitable

527
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:19,733
上次我们决定彼此信任的时候
if you hadn't tried to kill half my people

528
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:22,527
如果你没有试图杀死我们一半的人！
last time we decided to trust each other!

529
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:40,942
你欠我的，Sheppard
You owe me this, Sheppard.

530
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,387
我什么都没欠你
I don't owe you anything.

531
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,367
把他带出去
Get him out of here.

532
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:01,011
看来，我也没法指望得到他的帮助了
Well, I guess I can't count on his help anymore.

533
00:34:03,428 --> 00:34:06,612
这是什么？Sheppard，你要上来一下了
- What was that?
- Sheppard, you're gonna wanna get up.

534
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,039
继续努力
Keep working.

535
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:18,083
这是什么？
What the hell was that?

536
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:21,246
看来Todd对这艘船能挺多久的估算要有点折扣了
Looks like Todd's estimate of how long the ship's gonna last is a little off.

537
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:24,028
什么意思？还记得那个洞吗？它正在变大
- What are you talking about?
- Remember that hole? It's growing.

538
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:27,767
已经开始威胁船体的完整性了，但这还不是最严重的问题
It begins to threat the hull integrity, but that's not the biggest problem.

539
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:28,892
看到了没？
See that?

540
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,326
这是一条表示结构薄弱点的线，正好横跨整个船身宽度
That is a line of structural weakness right across the width of the hive.

541
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:35,887
如果这里稍微发生点爆炸，这船就会被撕成两半
If there's an explosive decompression, this thing could be ripped in half.

542
00:34:36,012 --> 00:34:38,936
我是Sheppard，全体队员返回，立即返回
This is Sheppard, all teams fall back. Fall back immediately.

543
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:42,022
我们还没搞妥这些幽灵
We're not finished with the Wraith.

544
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:44,693
别管他们了，这船身快裂开了，赶紧离开
Just leave 'em. The hull's failing. Get the hell out of there.

545
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,569
你们听到了，赶紧走！
You heard the man. Let's move!

546
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:47,988
我们走！
Let's go!

547
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:50,656
赶紧跟上
Come on! Hurry up!

548
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:07,190
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

549
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,689
我们离开这鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here.

550
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:24,704
怎么回事？
What is it?

551
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,403
门卡住了，怎么都开不了
The door's jammed. Won't open.

552
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:30,391
Rodney，我是Teyla，我们被困住了，这门怎么都打开不了
Rodney, this is Teyla. We are stuck behind a door that will not open.

553
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:32,640
你能不能帮忙？控制系统出故障了
- Can you help us?
- The controls are malfunctioning.

554
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:35,981
我看看能不能重载它，给我几分钟
I can't seem to override them. Just give me a minute.

555
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,372
我们可能没几分钟了，Rodney
We might not have a minute, Rodney.

556
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,553
你个香蕉苹果菠萝……
Crap.

557
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,620
啊？兄弟们，你们要马上离开那里
Uh, guys? You need to get out of there now.

558
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:08,587
听到了没有，马上离开！
You hear me? Get out of there now!

559
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:47,732
Sheppard！回答！快回答！
Sheppard! Come in! Please!

560
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,204
我们在这里。谢天谢地！
- Yeah, we're here.
- Oh, thank God.

561
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:53,591
那个隔离舱还能挺得住吗？是的，目前还行
- I take it the bulkhead held?
- Yeah, for now.

562
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,822
我把它密封了，这样就不会减压
I was able to seal off
so we won't depressurize,

563
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:58,011
但你们要下到这里来
but you need to get down here...

564
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:03,373
现在又怎么了？
What now?

565
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:06,173
这艘船把自己撕成开的时候，我们的轨道也发生了改变
The ship tearing itself apart, shifted our trajectory.

566
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:08,715
我们正一头朝行星栽下去！
We're headed straight for the planet!

567
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:21,128
我们的情况怎么样？
What's our status?

568
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,684
我认为用“失控”来形容比较恰切
I would say "screwed" is an apt description.

569
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:26,180
我们会不会烧起来？不，返回时没事
- Are we going to burn up?
- No, we're gonna survive re-entry.

570
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:29,083
事实上，它还会让我们变慢一点，但远远不够
In fact, it'll slow us down a little, but nowhere near enough.

571
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:31,625
你能不能把我们带到水上？无论陆地还是水面，在这个速度下
- Can you get us over the water?
- Land, water, at that speed

572
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,387
在撞击瞬间我们马上就被汽化了。我们要采取行动了
- we're going to be vaporized on impact.
- We've got to do something.

573
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:35,784
比如？想！
- Like what?
- Think!

574
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:37,868
我不知道……OK，就这么着吧
I don't know... Okay, right.

575
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,804
把机动推进器朝前，但它们都没有能量了
Forward maneuvering thrusters. But they're not getting any power

576
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,587
因为推进器的小导管已经给扯成了两半
because the propulsion conduits have been ripped in half.

577
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:46,925
我也许可以重新调整能量流向推进器，这样它就能减缓我们下坠的速度
I may be able to reroute power to them so they can slow our descent.

578
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:49,880
没问题，你说了算。但我根本不知道怎么搞！
- All right, now you're talking.
- I haven't a clue how to do it!

579
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,831
就算系统正常
Even if the systems were functioning,

580
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:54,173
也要花好几个小时来创建这样一个工作环境
it would take me hours to create that kind of work-around.

581
00:37:54,298 --> 00:37:55,982
好吧，你继续干吧
All right, just keep working on it.

582
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,871
你又去哪儿？我去找帮手
- Where the hell are you going?
- I'm gonna go get some help.

583
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,358
起来。你就不能不惹我吗？
- Get up.
- You can't quite leave me be.

584
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,970
没时间跟你玩了
I don't have time to play games.

585
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:10,198
你知道为什么会那么晃吗？哦，我猜猜……
- You know what that shaking is?
- Oh, I can guess.

586
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,376
我们离开轨道了，正在冲入大气层
We've lost orbit. We're entering the atmosphere,

587
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,908
这意味着几分钟后，我们就会撞向行星
which means in a few minutes, we're gonna slam into that planet.

588
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:18,471
倒是可以死个痛快
A quick death will be a welcome reprieve.

589
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,120
我没想到你就是这个么有始无终的人
I didn't think you were such a quitter.

590
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:25,157
听着，你让这艘船安全降落，我就带你去虫虫星球
Look, you get this ship on the ground, I'll take you to your bug planet.

591
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,529
你希望我会相信你？
And you expect me to believe that?

592
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,310
我说话算数
My word.

593
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:34,672
包括我所有船员？
And my crew?

594
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,854
他们已经死了
They're dead.

595
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:41,970
这艘船裂成两半，整个船尾都没了
The ship sheared in two. We lost the entire rear section.

596
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:45,604
如果我们去那个行星，这一切就不会发生！
If we'd gone to the planet, none of this would have happened!

597
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:47,786
你永远到不了那里，你心知肚明！
We would have never made it there, you know it.

598
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,144
船身损坏太严重了
The hull was too damaged.

599
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:52,606
现在，我能理解你因为船员而火大
Now, I understand you're pissed off about your crew,

600
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:56,979
但我们正准备去和他们汇合，除非有人可以让我们慢下来
but we're about to join 'em, unless somebody manages to slow us down,

601
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,230
你还准备来帮忙吗？
so are you gonna help us out?

602
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:04,028
我们进入大气层了
We're in the atmosphere.

603
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:05,802
高度100,000英尺
Altitude 100,000 feet.

604
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:08,496
没用的，我没法控制它
It is no use. I cannot control it.

605
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,666
滚一边去！
Move aside!

606
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:16,588
你放心他吗？他又能拿我们怎么样？现在我们已经是自由落体了
- You sure about this?
- What can he do? We're in a free fall.

607
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:20,210
我想我能新建一条旁路来输送能量
I believe I can successfully create a bypass that will deliver power

608
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,548
到前面的机动推进器，但这样要花一点点时间
to the forward thrusters, but it will take a few moments.

609
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:24,929
慢慢来。15秒后撞击
- You just take your time.
- Impact in 15 seconds.

610
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:27,599
如果成功了就不会，推进器点火！
Not if I can help it.
Firing thrusters!

611
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,737
40,000英尺。仍然下坠太快了
40,000 feet. Still descending too fast.

612
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,909
还不够！与其在那里批评我
- It's not enough!
- Instead of criticizing,

613
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,479
你还不如去帮我多弄点能量！
perhaps you could work at getting me some more power!

614
00:39:44,604 --> 00:39:45,604
就来！
I'm on it!

615
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:47,703
20,000英尺
20,000 feet.

616
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:49,788
调整推进器角度，让这船身水平
Angle the thrusters. Try to get the ship level.

617
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:51,539
这样能够让它漂过水面
We can fly her across the water.

618
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,374
相信我，我以前干过
Trust me. I've done this before.

619
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,837
10,000英尺。好了好了
- 10,000 feet.
- That's it.

620
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:59,106
我是我们能获取的所有能量了
That's all the power we've got.

621
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:13,349
2,000英尺！
2,000 feet!

622
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:17,390
我想说的就是这个！我们正在失去惯性阻尼！
This is it! We're about to lose inertial dampeners!

623
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,276
他们刚刚撞落水面，我取得坐标了
They just hit the water. I've got the coordinates.

624
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:52,253
马上把他们带回救生艇
Relay them to the rescue Jumpers immediately.

625
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:05,113
上校，很高兴看到你康复
Colonel. Good to see you back on your feet.

626
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:08,140
你的其余队员怎么样了？你知道的，正在康复中
- How's the rest of your team?
- You know, recovering.

627
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,471
当撞击水面的时候，我们受到了巨大冲击
We took quite a jolt when we hit the water.

628
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:11,830
可以想象得出
I can imagine.

629
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,454
你很幸运
You were lucky.

630
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:14,938
那时候Kersey少校
By the time Major Kersey

631
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:17,125
费了九牛二虎之力打通一条通道去到你的位置
was able to blast his way down to your position,

632
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,961
那个母舰，那些剩余部分，有一半已经灌满了水
the hive, what remained of it, was already half full of water.

633
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:22,171
把你捞起来后过不了几分钟它就沉了
It sank minutes after they extracted you.

634
00:41:23,134 --> 00:41:25,125
真希望能醒着看到这一幕
Wish I was awake to see that.

635
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:30,013
他怎么样了？不太好
- How is he?
- Not well.

636
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,473
他拒绝任何治疗
He hasn't responded to any treatment.

637
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,241
我接到你的申请
I received your request.

638
00:41:38,754 --> 00:41:39,767
怎么样？
And?

639
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,920
如果说错了请原谅
Forgive me if I'm wrong,

640
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,912
当初刚看到那艘船时，你不是想炸掉它吗？
but weren't you the one who wanted to destroy his ship?

641
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:48,197
好像是那样的
Sounds vaguely familiar.

642
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,451
现在你却想要我违反规定，把他放走？
And now you want me to go against protocol and let him go.

643
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:54,496
其实，不是他我们活不到现在。了解
- Well, he is the reason we're alive.
- I realize that, Colonel.

644
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:56,748
也是他把你置于危险之中的
He's also the reason you were in danger,

645
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:59,657
更不用说这会带来多严重的安全隐患
not to mention an incredible security risk.

646
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:02,628
好吧，你看，反正他都要死了
All right, look, he's probably gonna die anyway.

647
00:42:02,797 --> 00:42:06,132
要是他能活下来呢？他会记起来他都干了些什么
- And if he survives?
- He's gonna remember what we did.

648
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:09,844
无论你喜欢与否，他都是我们对抗幽灵的最佳同盟
Like it or not, he's our best ally in the fight against the Wraith.

649
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:13,264
如果我们想传播我们的基因疗法
If we ever get around to perfecting this gene therapy,

650
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,098
我们肯定需要他来帮忙分发
we're gonna need his help to deploy it.

651
00:42:17,313 --> 00:42:20,438
你知道做这种决定简直是拿我的事业来赌
You realize this is the kind of decision that could cost me my job.

652
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,566
难道一直以来不是吗？
Well, aren't they all?

653
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:40,322
很感谢你放我走
I appreciate your decision to let me go.

654
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:43,197
说话要算数的
A deal's a deal.

655
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,923
我会记住这一切，John Sheppard
I will remember this, John Sheppard.
