6
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,550
我知道
Yeah, no, I know,

7
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,990
只要你开口  我都会去办的
but when you tell me to do something, i'm gonna do it,

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,580
所以我正在给他写邮件
so I'm e-mailing him right now.

9
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,510
我不知道他要多久才回来
Well, I don't know how quick he's gonna get back

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,990
你也知道  他不经常查收邮件
'cause you know sometimes he doesn't check, so...

11
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,950
没错  诵诗会之后  我不会直接回家
Yeah, and after the poetry reading, I'm not going home.

12
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,680
那天是我生日  我想去夜店狂欢一下
I mean, it's my birthday, so I want to go to a club.

13
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,510
不  西蒙  我才不会骗她
No, Simon, I'm not gonna lie to her.

14
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,250
我只是不告诉她而已
I'm just not gonna tell her.

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,140
我先去把卡车停好
Let me go park the truck.

16

我是挺好的  谢谢关心
I'm good, thanks for asking.

So I'll just call, I guess, and get extra tickets.

20
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,080
对  当然
Yeah, sure.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,830
-我马上就办  -你在呢

-你好  西蒙  -没错
- Hi, Simon. - Yeah.

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,250
他说  "打给我"
He says, "Call me."

26
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
对  对  她刚到家
Yeah, yeah, she just got home.

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,470
她肯定能听到你  她就在我旁边
I'm sure she can hear you, she's standing right here.

28
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,500
-你好  卢克  -你好吗  克莱莉
- Hey, Luke. - How's it going, Clary?

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,030
不  我很快换好衣服
No, I'll get dressed quick.

30
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,190
要咖啡吗
Do you want some coffee?

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,060
再聊下去  我会迟到的
If we keep talking, I'm gonna be late.

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,190
好  那里见  拜拜

你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

35
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,470
挺好的  怎么了
Fine, why?

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,040
你保证今晚直接回家
You make sure you come straight home tonight.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,210
妈妈  拜托  只是个诵诗会而已
Mom, come on. Just a poetry reading.

38

我知道
I know.

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,320
再见
Bye.

40
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,650
你得和她谈谈  乔瑟琳
You need to talk to her, Jocelyn.

41
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,550
她还没准备好  至少现在没有
She's not ready, not yet.

42
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,220
不  她准备好了
Yes, she is.

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,780
是你没准备好
You're not.

44
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,430
对了  谢谢你能过来
By the way, thanks for doing this. 

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,090
他的诗歌对他意义重大
His poetry means a lot to him.

46
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,670
朋友就该相互支持嘛
That's what friends are for.

47
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,630
"来吧"
"Come

55
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,350
我听不下去了  你要不要再来杯咖啡
I can't listen to this. You want another coffee?

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,810
好啊
Yeah.

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,570
"如同片片娇弱的番红花瓣呓语着死亡"
"Like tiny crocus petals whisper death"

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,730
卡布奇诺和意式浓咖啡
Cappuccino and espresso.

59
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
"大地溺死在雨中"
"Rain drowns the earth

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,660
"颤栗的微风穿过病态的绣帷"
"Shivering breezes weave through a morbid tapestry

61
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,120
"弥漫着溃烂的气息"
"Of festering disease

62
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,910
"肿胀折磨着我"
"Turgid is my torment"

63
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,370
给你
There you go.

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,170
谢谢
Thank you.

65
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,710
"大地溺死在雨中..."
"Rain drowns the earth..."

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,840
那边的金发美女在对你抛媚眼
That blonde girl over there was totally flirting with you.

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,050
约她出去
Ask her out.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,760
-不  那可不行  -为什么
- Nah, it wouldn't be fair. - Why?

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,430
因为...
Well, because...

70
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,310
因为我心里有别人了
because I'm saving myself for someone else.

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,350
谁
Who?

72
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,850

谢谢
Thank you.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,760
感觉他的诗越来越糟了
Think he's getting worse.

76
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,660
作为他的朋友  你应该告诉他实情
As his friend, you should probably tell him.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,300
也许他的诗确实很棒
Maybe his poetry is great,

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,210
只是我们不懂得欣赏而已
we just don't know it yet.

79
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,210
咱们进这里玩吧
Let's go in here.

80
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,980
我想问问那个符号是什么意思
I want to ask what that symbol means.

81
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,840
克莱莉  我们进不去的
Clary, we'll never get in.

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,050
乐观点好不好
Such the eternal optimist.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,130
这太不像你了
This is so not like you.

84
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,300
就放纵一次嘛
Just go with it for once.

85
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,140
请问那个符号是什么意思
Hi. What does that symbol mean?

86
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,560
-什么符号  -对呀  哪有什么符号
- What symbol? - Yeah, what symbol?

87
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,360
-就在上面  你没看见吗  -没有
- It's right there. You don't... You don't see it? - No.

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,450
厉害啊
Hey, that was cool.

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,960
我们很融入嘛
Yeah, we're fitting in.

90
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,840
跳吧  跟着感觉走
Move it, go with it.

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,050
克莱莉  你想要点喝的吗
Clary, you want a drink?

92
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,220
好啊
Yeah.

93
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,520
克莱莉  克莱莉  你怎么了
Clary, Clary, what is it?

94
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,280
你没看见吗
You didn't see that?

95
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,840
我知道我看到了什么
I know what I saw. 

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
他们杀了那个让我们进去的男人
They killed the guy that let us in the club.

97
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,290
-你喝了什么吗  -对  不  西蒙
- Did you drink something? - Yeah... No, Simon.

98
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,500
我听说  有时候
You know, I've heard sometimes

99
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,340
他们会从通风口泵入迷幻剂之类的东西
they pump hallucinogenic stuff into the air vents

100
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,670
好让人们玩得更尽兴
to make sure people have a good time.

101
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,410
如果是那样的话  你怎么没事
Okay, then how come you're fine? 

102
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,670
难道我们吸的不是同一种空气
Did we breathe different air?

103
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,630
我不知道  还是快回家吧
I don't know. Let's just go home.

104
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,040
-你还好吗  -我很好
- You okay? - Yeah, fine.

105
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,600
你睡了一整天
You've been sleeping all day.

106
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,670
而且你昨晚很晚才回来
And you didn't come home till late last night.

107
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,880
是  但我回来了  好吗
Yeah, well, I'm home, okay?

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,790
你不能出去
Well, you can't go.

109
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,950
我又卖出了一幅画
Well, I sold another painting.

110
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,260
我想和你一起庆祝
I wanted to celebrate with you.

111
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,640
庆祝什么  你就那么一个买家
To what, your one buyer?

112
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,560
那个家伙到底是谁
Who is this guy anyway?

113
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,340
他买你的画  可能只是因为对你有意思
He probably just buys your stuff 'cause he's into you.

114
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,300
我敢肯定  你会像拴住卢克那样拴着他
I'm sure you'll just string him along like you do with Luke.

115
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,460
你真的想跟我谈这个
You really want to have that conversation?

116
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,290
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

117
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,680
-西蒙  -他对我来说  就像哥哥一样
- Simon. - He's like my brother.

118
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,480
我不觉得他是这么想的
I doubt he feels that way.

119
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,690
我要出去了
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

120
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,660
不  不  你不能出去
No, no, you can't.

121
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,940
你真是无理取闹
This is ridiculous.

122
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,000
你要去哪
Where are you going?

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,700
只是去爪哇琼斯咖啡店而已
I'm just going to Java Jones.

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,820
-我的上帝  -别慌  是我
- Jesus! - No, just me.

125
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,990
走吧  西蒙
Come on, Simon.

126
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,790
克莱莉  我有事要告诉你  好吗
Clary. There's something I want to tell you, okay?

127
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,940
我们可以晚点再谈
We can talk about this later.

128
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,470
再见  费瑞太太
Bye, Mrs. Fray.

129
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,880
看  我突然画了上百张这样的符号
Look, suddenly I'm drawing hundreds of these things,

130
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,760
而我根本不知道这是什么
and I have no idea what they are.

131
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,850
我不明白  我看我是要疯了
I don't know. I think I'm going out of my mind.

132
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,270
也许你就像《第三类接触》里的主角一样
You know, maybe you're like the guy in Close Encounters.

133
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,710
所有人都觉得他得了妄想症
Everybody thought he was paranoid,

134
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,450
但结果发现是UFO 
and then there turned out to be, well, UFO,

135
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,940
凡事都讲得通的  比如...
reasonable, like...

136
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,230
上帝啊  这不是真的
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

137
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,720
-怎么了  -这不是真的
- What? - This isn't happening.

138
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,860
现在你真吓到我了
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

139
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,450
克莱莉  你是不是...
Clary, are you...

140
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,670
你在看什么
what are you looking at?

141
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,800
在这等着
Wait here.

142
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,610
圣杯在哪里  乔瑟
Where's the Cup, Jocie?

143
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,580
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,000
那可多亏了你的女儿
You can thank your daughter for that.

145
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,750
为什么只有我能看见你
Why can I see you and no one else can?

146
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,300
我也想问你同样的问题
I was going to ask you the same question.

147
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,130
我都不知道我为什么在跟你讲话
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.

148
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,630
你是个杀人凶手  残酷无情的杀手
You're a killer, a cold-blooded killer.

149
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,640
所以还有和平有爱的杀手吗
As opposed to a peace-loving killer?

150
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,890
我知道我看到了什么
I know what I saw.

151
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,650
你觉得你知道
You think you know.

152
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,430
我为什么会画这个
Why am I drawing this?

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,560
看来我是对的  你不是凡人
So I was right, you're not a mundane.

154
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,820
什么  凡人是什么意思
Excuse me? What's a mundane?

155
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,460
凡世间的普通人类
Someone from the human world.

156
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,280
如果我不是普通的人类  那我是什么
If I'm not a human, then what am I?

157
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,620
去找圣杯
Go find the Cup.

158
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,620
你这是从什么时候开始的
When did this start?

159
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,660
不  我为什么会画这个
No, no. Why am I drawing this?

160
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,620
回答我
Answer me!

161
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,880
西蒙
Simon.

162
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,990
{\an8}克莱莉母亲来电
拒绝

163
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,190
也许你该接电话  可能是你男朋友
Maybe you should answer that. Could be your boyfriend.

164
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,820
-他不是我男朋友  -那他知道吗
- He's not my boyfriend. - Does he know that?

165
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,150
拜托快接  很吵
Please. It's annoying.

166
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,200
妈妈  我马上回来
Mom, I'm coming home.

167
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,470
不  不  不行  你不能回家
No, no, no. You can't come home.

168
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,910
明白吗  你不要回家
You understand me? You don't come home.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,700
打电话给卢克
You call Luke.

170
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,710
告诉他瓦伦莱还活着  他找到我了
Tell him Valentine's alive and that he found me.

171
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,840
我爱你
I love you.

172
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,300
-妈妈  -不  不要
- Mom! - No, no!

173
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,590
妈妈
Mom!

174
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,850
告诉瓦伦莱  他永远不可能得到圣杯
You tell Valentine he'll never have the Cup.

175
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,900
别喝  过来  别  什么
Don't you... Don't drink... Come here! Don't... What?

176
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,190
快接电话
Come on.

177
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,380
对不起  对不起  你还好吗
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

178
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,640
还好吗  听着  别动
All right, look, don't move, all right?

179
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,660
妈妈
Mom?

180
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,250
妈
Mom?

181
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,720
好了  起来吧
Come on. Come on.

182
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,790
够了  可以了  可以了
That's enough! That's enough. That's enough.

183
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,540
它已经死了
It's dead.

184
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,380
那玩意是什么
What the hell was that?

185
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,010
我说了  你也不会信的
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

186
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,350
说说看
Try me.

187
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
那是个恶魔
It was a demon.

188
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,420
你说得对
You're right.

189
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,790
我不相信
I don't believe you.

190
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,700
还有那个
And that thing,

191
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,320
你看见我在夜店里杀死的那个
that you saw me kill at the club, that...

192
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,190
也是恶魔
That was also a demon.

193
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,150
恶魔能寄主在任何生灵身上
Demons can take possession of any living creature.

194
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,120
任何人你都不能相信
You can't trust anyone.

195
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,650
甚至是你自以为了解的人
Even people you think you know.

196
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,870
那我为什么要相信你
So, why should I trust you?

197
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,650
我刚刚救了你的命啊
I did just save your life.

198
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,470
萝西娅  开门  拜托
Dorothea, open up, please.

199
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,550
你能不能...
Can you...

200
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,020
你知道我妈妈到底出什么事了吗
Do you know what happened to my mom?

201
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,020
你知道吗
Do you?

202
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,900
等等  你看得见这家伙吗
Wait, you can see this guy? 

203
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,740
她当然可以  她是女巫
Of course she can. She's a witch.

204
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,830
怎么从姜饼屋搬到这么简陋的一居室了
Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one-bedroom?

205
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,790
你知道我妈妈去哪了吗
Do you know where my mom is?

206
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,340
对不起  我不知道
Sorry. I have no idea.

207
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,210
她提到了一个人  叫瓦伦莱
Well, she mentioned a name... Valentine.

208
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,170
-你还是走吧  -不要  求你了
- You better leave. - No, please.

209
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,090
你必须告诉我  什么都行
Not until you tell me something, anything.

210
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,620
看看塔罗牌怎么说吧
Let's see what the cards have to say.

211
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,160
不好意思  但是我不相信这些
I'm sorry, but you know that I don't believe in any of...

212
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,370
坐下
Sit.

213
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,630
让手在所有牌上扫过
Run your hands over the cards.

214
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,220
这套牌是我妈妈画的
My mom painted these.

215
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,970
对  是送我的礼物
Yes. They were a gift.

216
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,510
看哪张牌会被选中
Let's see which card gets picked.

217
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,290
圣杯牌
The Ace of Cups.

218
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,050
-那是天使圣杯  -所以呢
- That's the Mortal Cup. - So?

219
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,210
别理他
Ignore him.

220
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,190
那是天使圣器
It's a Mortal Instrument,

221
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,720
我们族人的三大圣物之一
one of the three holy objects of my people.

222
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,890
这跟它有什么关系
What's it doing here?

223
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,220
这关我妈什么事
I don't understand what any of this has to do with my mom.

224
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,640
你妈妈曾是一名暗影猎人  和他一样
Your mother was a Shadowhunter, like him.

225
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,600
不对  我妈妈是个画家
No, my mom is a painter.

226
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,850
她从没跟你提过这些  是不是
She never told you any of this, did she?

227
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,380
我只知道她失踪了
All I know is that she's gone,

228
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,420
而我不知道要从何找起
and I have no idea where to start looking for her.

229
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,650
让我来为你读心
Let me read you.

230
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,260
有什么东西封住了你的记忆
There's something blocking your mind.

231
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,380
我猜是你妈妈为了保护你
My guess is your mother hired someone

232
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,930
找了法术高超的人帮忙
very skilled to protect you.

233
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,520
-保护我什么  -你自己的回忆
- From what? - Your own memories.

234
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,350
为什么
Why?

235
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
我有什么回忆她会希望我忘掉
I don't remember anything she'd want me to forget.

236
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,000
等等
Wait.

237
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,550
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

238
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,980
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

239
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,110
你吓到我了
You scared me.

240
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,320
这里发生了什么
What the hell happened here?

241
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,150
-我妈妈不见了  -什么
- My mom's missing. - What?

242
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,070
有人劫走了她  还把这里毁了
Someone took her and destroyed the place.

243
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,710
现在这个家伙在帮我找她
This guy is helping me find her,

244
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,250
但是你看不见他  而且他...
but you can't see him, and he...

245
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,590
克莱莉
Clary.

246
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,630
好极了
Great.

247
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,590
现在连我也看不见他了
Okay, now I can't see him, either.

248
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,340
我是杰斯·威兰德  恶魔猎人
Jace Wayland, demon hunter.

249
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,470
我是西蒙·路易斯  钥匙大师
Simon Lewis, Keymaster.

250
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,600
{\an8}电影《捉鬼敢死队》的角色  被恶魔附身

251
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,600
你是守卫者吗
Are you the Gatekeeper?

252
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,390
我听不懂你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

253
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,190
什么情况  你现在能看见他吗
Wait. What, so you can see him now?

254
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,150
-什么  我当然看得见  -我以为...
- What? Of course I can see him. - But I thought...

255
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,900
-不是  -你在说什么呢
- No... - What are you talking about?

256
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,530
太混乱了
This is so confusing.

257
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,440
这人是谁
Who's this?

258
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,990
是我爸爸  我两岁的时候他就去世了
That's my dad. He died when I was two.

259
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,160
克莱莉  过来一下
Clary, a moment.

260
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,730
你妈妈刚刚失踪
So, wait, your mom is gone,

261
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,130
你就跟这个染着黄发的哥特怪人混在了一起
and you're hanging around with some dyed-blond wannabe Goth weirdo?

262
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,420
你在哪里遇到的这个家伙
Where'd you come across this guy?

263
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,390
不是  是他来找的我
No, I didn't. He found me.

264
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,970
什么  他找的你
What? He found you?

265
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,110
-我知道这听上去...-你得看看这个
- No, I know it sounds... - You should check this.

266
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,600
顺便说明  我的金发是天生的
And for the record, my hair is naturally blond.

267
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,480
克莱莉  克莱莉  克莱莉  西蒙
Clary, Clary, Clary... Simon?

268
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,270
她给你打电话了吗
She called you?

269
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,110
你怎么没接
Why didn't you pick up?

270
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,820
如果知道事情这么严重  我肯定就接了
If I'd known it was serious, I would have picked up.

271
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,990
你不接  怎么知道严不严重
Well, how would you know if you didn't pick it up?

272
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,410
那是什么
What's that?

273
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,750
不是什么好东西
Nothing good.

274
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,250
你知道她从哪弄到的这东西吗
Do you have any idea where she got this?

275
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,130
我得去找卢克
I've got to find Luke.

276
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,260
好奇怪  他的车在这
It's so weird. His truck's here.

277
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,890
来  这边走
Come on. This way.

278
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,980
-你在这里等  -凭什么听你指挥
- No, you wait here. - Who made you the boss?

279
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,520
没关系  如果有人来了告诉我们一声
It's okay. Just let us know if anyone comes.

280
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,900
我认识卢克这么多年
I've known Luke all these years, 

281
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,320
但从没有来过这下面
but I've never been down here.

282
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,120
什么
What?

283
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,210
说啊  伙计
Come on, mate!

284
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,640
听好了
Now, listen...

285
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,980
我们只需要你实话实说  伙计
All you got to do, mate, is tell me the truth.

286
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,480
我告诉你了  我不知道圣杯在哪里
I'm telling you, I don't know where the Cup is.

287
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,690
我知道你和乔瑟关系亲密
I know you and Jocie are close.

288
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,570
我可不傻  对吧
I'm not stupid, am I?

289
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,690
不用你回答我
Don't answer that.

290
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,570
仔细听好了  只要说出天使圣杯在哪里
Listen to me, mate. Just tell me where the Mortal Cup is.

291
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,160
乔瑟就不会有事
And then Jocie will be fine.

292
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,830
-卢克  说吧  说实话  -我不知道
- Lukey, tell me. Tell me the truth. - I don't know.

293
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,000
别把我惹急了
You don't want to make me angry.

294
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,290
-我说过了  -是吗
- I'm telling you... - Do you?

295
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,210
我再问一遍  圣杯在哪里
I'm going to ask you again, mate, where's the Cup, huh?

296
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
我不知道
I don't know.

297
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,470
我们要找的不是同一个东西吗  小卢克
We all want the same thing, Lukey boy, don't we?

298
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,140
区别在于  我认为你知道东西在哪
Difference is, I think you know where it is.

299
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,510
对不对呀
Don't You?

300
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
快点  快点说呀
Come on. Come on. Talk!

301
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,400
我们得走了
We need to go.

302
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,440
不  拜托  你得帮帮他
No, please, you have to help him.

303
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,810
你不明白
You don't understand.

304
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,190
他们是瓦伦莱的手下
They work for Valentine.

305
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,420
他死定了  我帮不了他
He's a dead man. I can't help him.

306
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,900
他就像我的家人一样
He's like family.

307
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,690
真是不可思议
You know what's really amazing

308
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,700
你看起来还真的很像人类
is how much you actually look like a human.

309
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,820
很不错啊
Isn't it great?

310
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,460
求求你
Please.

311
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,330
你不生气吗  不变身吗
Are you gonna get mad? You're going to change?

312
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,790
我想看你变身的样子
I want to see you change.

313
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,300
快点让我看看你怎么变身
Show me how you can change. Huh?

314
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,630
快看啊  快看啊
Look at that. Look at that.

315
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,800
狗娃就要现形了
Dog boy's coming on.

316
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,050
你想抱我的腿吗
You want to hump my leg?

317
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,810
抱人的腿  你喜欢这个吧
You hump legs? You like that?

318
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,230
你想嗅我的屁股吗
You want to smell my derriere?

319
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,730
赶快给我变身
I want to see you change!

320
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,070
你只需要说出乔瑟琳藏匿圣杯的地方
You just got to tell me where Jocelyn hid the Cup.

321
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,070
我们就把她还给你
Then you can have her back.

322
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,820
保证她安然无恙地回来
She'll be safe and sound.

323
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,620
我不想让她回来
I don't want her back.

324
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,290
我一点都不在乎
I couldn't care less.

325
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,430
为了得到天使圣杯
I have spent years cozying up

326
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,710
我花了那么多年  亲近她跟她的孩子
to that woman and her brat for the Mortal Cup.

327
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,460
潘伯恩  说真心话
Pangborn, listen to me.

328
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,130
我真希望亲手把她交给瓦伦莱
I want to be the one to give her to Valentine.

329
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,670
是啊  没错
Yeah, right.

330
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,350
你犯了个大错
You are making a big mistake.

331
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,560
我不相信你说的话  你相信他吗
I don't believe you. Do you believe him?

332
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,770
-克莱莉  快逃  -克莱莉  听我说
- Clary, run! - Clary, listen!

333
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,660
对不起  警官
Excuse me. Officer?

334
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,330
我想举报一起入室抢劫事件
I'd like to report a break-in.

335
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,330
还有人口失踪
And a missing person.

336
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,750
我朋友的家被人非法闯入
My friend's house got broken into, and...

337
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,550
-她妈妈不见了  -不  不
- Her mom's missing. - Oh, no.

338
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,420
快跑
Run!

339
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,390
-你居然杀了两个警察  -他们不是警察
- You killed two cops! - They weren't cops.

340
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,690
快走
Let's go!

341
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,450
克莱莉
Clary.

342
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,450
你不能待在这里  他们会找到你的
You can't stay here. They'll find you.

343
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,420
卢克怎么能说他不在乎呢
How could Luke say that he didn't care?

344
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,170
我从记事起  就认识他了
I've known him for as long as I can remember.

345
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,910
过去他每天晚上都读书给我听
He used to read to me every night.

346
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,050
这么多年来  一直接我放学
He's been picking me up at school for years.

347
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,800
可能那些回忆都不是真的
Look, maybe those memories aren't real.

348
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,470
还记得我跟你说的吗
Do you remember what I told you?

349
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,470
任何人你都不能相信
You can't trust anyone.

350
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,350
不行  我要找到我妈妈  我得回家
No, I need to find my mom. I have to go home.

351
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,660
我肯定漏掉了什么
There must be something that I missed! 

352
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,340
听我一句话
Listen to me, okay?

353
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,130
我们会想办法解决的
We'll figure this out,

354
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,610
但不是在这里  也不是现在
but not here and not now.

355
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,570
我们得把你带到安全的地方
We need to get you to a safe place.

356
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,490
我是暗影猎人  克莱莉
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary, 

357
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,600
我会用我的生命保护你
and I will protect you with my life.

358
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,450
你们在这呢  我以为你们就在后面
There you guys are. I thought you were right behind me.

359
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,030
还以为把你们弄丢了
I thought I'd lost you.

360
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,580
好吧  我跟你走
Okay. I'll follow you.

361
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,870
你确定吗  他刚才杀了两个警察
Are you sure about that? 'Cause he just killed two cops.

362
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,160
他们可不是警察
Yeah, they weren't cops.

363
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,250
我看他们就是警察
They looked like real cops to me.

364
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,670
他们不是真正的警察
They weren't real cops.

365
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,590
那他们哪来的警车
So, where did they get the car?

366
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,720
他们不是警察
They weren't real cops.

367
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,750
{\an8}学院

368
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,650
到这里就安全了
We'll be safe in here.

369
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,520
这是什么破地方
What is this dump?

370
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,400
这可不是破地方
This isn't a dump.

371
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,570
只是你看不到而已
You just can't see it.

372
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,940
怎么回事  他们来这干什么
What the hell is going on? What are they doing in here?

373
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,370
-被恶魔咬伤了  -克莱莉
-It's a demon bite. - Clary.

374
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,900
杰斯  快想办法
Jace, do something!

375
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,470
现在你是不是应该
Is this the part when you start

376
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,910
撕下衣服  给我包扎伤口
tearing off pieces of your shirt to bind my wounds?

377
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,980
你要是想让我脱衣服
If you wanted me to take my clothes off,

378
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,580
直说就是了
you should've just asked.

379
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,550
发烧而已
It's just a fever.

380
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,770
她醒了
Hey. Hey, she's waking up.

381
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,220
我昏过去了  你们就给我弄了个纹身
I passed out, and you guys tattooed me?

382
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,040
我以为只有在拉斯维加斯才会发生这种事
Thought that only happened in Vegas.

383
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,790
-那不是纹身  -是咒符
- It's not a tattoo. -It's a rune.

384
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,330
他们什么样的咒符都有
They have them for everything,

385
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,420
隐形  强化  治愈
they make you invisible, strong, they heal.

386
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,850
当然也有显形的咒符
They also make you visible.

387
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,550
所以我才突然能看见他
That's why I could suddenly see him.

388
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,720
-就连饿的时候...  -不
- Even if you're hungry... - No.

389
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,400
咒符对你有效
The fact that the rune had an effect on you

390
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,010
正好解释了你为什么能看见我们
explains why you can see us.

391
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,220
我不明白
I don't get it.

392
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,630
凡人无法承受咒符的力量
Mundanes can't survive the process.

393
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,980
咒符对他们来说太过强大  所以...
The runes are too strong for them, so...

394
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,110
现在我们百分百确定你有暗影猎人血统了
Now we definitely know you have Shadowhunter blood.

395
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,900
等等  之前不确定吗
Wait, it wasn't definite before?

396
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,530
是的  她没死  所以现在确定了
Well, it became definite when she didn't die. Yes.

397
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,910
给  看看合不合身
Here, see if these fit.

398
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,080
这里可不经常有客人来
It's not every day we get guests in here.

399
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,070
尤其是女生
Especially not girls.

400
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,830
对了
Oh, Yeah.

401
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,380
我们不该报警吗
Shouldn't we call the cops?

402
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,340
我是说  那些真警察
I mean, the real ones.

403
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,920
真是个好主意
That's a great idea.

404
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,510
我们在过去的一千年里
I just don't know why we haven't thought of that

405
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,720
怎么就没想到要这么做呢
for the past thousand years.

406
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,970
霍奇准备好见她了
Hodge is ready for her.

407
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,390
他想在图书馆单独见她
He wants to see her alone in the library.

408
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,900
霍奇是谁
Who's Hodge?

409
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,020
整个学院由他负责
He's in charge of the Institute.

410
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,940
好吧  咱们走
Okay, let's go.

411
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,400
过去无数暗影猎人到这里寻求庇护
Hundreds of Shadowhunters used to seek asylum here.

412
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,240
但如你所见
But, as you can see,

413
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,780
现在只剩我们几个了
right now, we're the only ones.

414
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,790
没有了天使圣杯  我们正走向灭亡
Without the Mortal Cup, we're a dying breed.

415
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,500
如果你不是天生的暗影猎人
Either you're born of a Shadowhunter,

416
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,040
就得喝下圣杯里的血才能变为其中一员
or you have to drink from the Mortal Cup.

417
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,550
走不走
You coming?

418
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,310
感觉离布鲁克林很遥远吧
Pretty far from Brooklyn, isn't it?

419
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,100
离杰斯远点
Stay away from Jace.

420
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,650
霍奇可能有些古怪
You may find Hodge a little eccentric,

421
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,030
但他是史上最伟大的暗影猎人之一
but he's one of the greatest Shadowhunters that's ever lived.

422
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,820
把这个给我
Here, give me that.

423
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,480
把一个陌生人带到学院的中心之地
Don't you think it's a bit risky inviting

424
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,700
你不觉得有点冒险吗
a complete stranger into the heart of the Institute?

425
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,370
不  我觉得我们能信任她
No. I think we can trust her.

426
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,870
她那个凡人朋友呢
And what about her mundane friend?

427
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,540
那是一时冲动
Well, that was impulsive.

428
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,030
你一冲动就容易出事
When you're impulsive, things go badly.

429
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,400
小心点
Just be careful,

430
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,540
治疗心碎的咒符可是最痛苦的
the rune to fix a broken heart is the most painful one.

431
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,680
他们明天就会离开的  我保证
They'll be out of here in a day, I promise.

432
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,810
杰斯
Jace.

433
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,570
她曾是最杰出的暗影猎人之一
She was one of the best,

434
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,150
你母亲
your mum.

435
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,110
可我不明白...
But I don't understand why...

436
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,580
昨天你还只是个普通的女孩
Yesterday you were just a normal girl.

437
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,290
今天你觉得  你的世界
Today you feel as though your whole world

438
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,330
发生了翻天覆地的变化
has been turned upside down.

439
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,340
你只需要知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

440
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,720
你小时候听到的故事
The stories you were told as a little girl

441
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,360
怪兽  噩梦
about monsters, nightmares,

442
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,550
篝火边低语的传说
legends whispered around campfires...

443
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,980
都是真的
They're all true.

444
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,350
-这是恶魔吗  -没错
- Demon? - Yes.

445
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,940
这个也是恶魔吗
Demon?

446
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,610
不  狼人不是恶魔
No. Werewolves aren't demons.

447
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,110
我们跟地下生物达成了和平公约
We have a truce with Downworlders.

448
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,450
地下生物
Downwolriders?

449
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,330
住在14街以南的人吗
What is that, like people below 14th Street?

450
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,610
{\an8} 纽约市14街以南的区域称为downtown

451
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,740
地下生物指代所有其他族群
Well, "Downworlders" pretty much sums everything up,

452
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,460
吸血鬼  狼人  术士
vampires, werewolves, Warlocks.

453
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,290
术士  酷
Warlocks. Cool.

454
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,960
要怎么才能杀死僵尸呢
So, how do you kill a zombie?

455
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,130
我们不杀僵尸
We don't.

456
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,960
当然了  他们本来就是死人
Of course, they're already dead.

457
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,840
不  他们根本不存在
No. They don't exist.

458
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,640
那就是大名鼎鼎的圣杯啊
So, that's the famous Cup everyone's talking about.

459
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,850
没错  不过那是复制品
A replica. But yes.

460
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,310
杰斯总是一副愤世嫉俗的样子
You know, Jace has got a real chip on his shoulder.

461
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,880
如果你小时候  亲眼见到自己父亲被杀害
You would, too, if you saw your father murdered

462
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,310
你也会这样的
when you were a child.

463
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,150
如果不是他  我们早就死了
If it weren't for him, we'd be dead.

464
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,490
虽然不想承认  但他多次救过我们的命
He saved our lives more times than I care to admit.

465
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,650
好吧
Right.

466
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,080
传说
The legend goes,

467
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,750
十字军战士召唤了一位天使
the Crusaders summoned an angel,

468
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,250
天使拉杰尔
the Angel Raziel.

469
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,380
拉杰尔将其鲜血倾入杯中
Raziel poured his blood into a cup,

470
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,270
他们饮下杯中之血
and those who drank from it

471
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,090
成为一半人类一半天使
became half angel, half human.

472
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,930
就是暗影猎人
Shadowhunters.

473
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,560
他们的子孙后代沿承这个血脉
As did their children and their children's children.

474
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,760
我们拥有强大的力量
Beings of immense power,

475
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,230
足以维持世间平衡
strong enough to restore balance

476
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,690
保护世界  与邪恶为战
and protect the world in a war against evil.

477
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,020
这是一场没有胜利的战争
A war that can never be won,

478
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,440
但战斗不能停止
but must always be fought.

479
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,530
恶魔不会轻易灭亡
Demons don't die easily.

480
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,340
而我们
Whereas we,

481
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,910
我们终有一死
we remained all too mortal.

482
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,330
为什么不用圣杯创造更多的暗影猎人呢
Why didn't they just use the Cup to create more Shadowhunters?

483
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,430
瓦伦莱也是这么说的
Valentine's exact words.

484
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,880
圣钥会是圣杯的守护者
The Clave, the keepers of the Cup,

485
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,870
他们害怕使用圣杯的力量
they were afraid of using its power.

486
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,480
他们知道
They knew

487
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,920
喝了圣杯之血的人很少能够活下来
that hardly anyone who drank from it survived.

488
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,470
瓦伦莱·摩根斯顿集结了一伙朋友
Valentine Morgenstern drew a circle of friends together,

489
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,130
一群年轻的充满理想的暗影猎人
young, idealistic Shadowhunters,

490
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,810
帮助他从圣钥会那里窃取了天使圣杯
to help him steal the Mortal Cup from the Clave.

491
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,940
然而他并不想保护人类
But he didn't want to protect humanity.

492
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,430
他坚信  暗影猎人必须要进化
He believed there had to be an evolution of Shadowhunters,

493
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,330
成为更加强大的种族
something more powerful.

494
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,160
于是  他开始用天使圣杯做实验
He began experimenting, using the Mortal Cup.

495
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,580
他学会了召唤恶魔
He learned how to summon demons.

496
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,090
甚至给自己注射恶魔之血
He even injected himself with demon blood

497
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,860
来控制恶魔
so he could control them.

498
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,380
他想要统治一切
He wanted to rule.

499
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,390
你的母亲为了阻止他
Your mother, to prevent that,

500
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,360
偷走了圣杯
stole the Cup from him,

501
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,520
消失得无影无踪
and vanished into thin air.

502
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,560
可如果只有她知道圣杯在哪...
But if she's the only one that knows where the Cup is, then...

503
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,350
也许她不是唯一知情者
Maybe she isn't.

504
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,610
也许她告诉了别人
Maybe she told someone else.

505
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,360
只是当事人自己不知道而已
Someone who doesn't know she knows.

506
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,030
寂言兄弟准备好见她了
The Silent Brothers are ready for her.

507
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,290
霍奇怎么不一起来
Why didn't Hodge come with us?

508
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,210
他有很多年没离开过学院了
He hasn't left the Institute in years.

509
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,870
听说是因为一个咒语
Some say it's a spell.

510
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,130
他有旷野恐惧症吧
He's agoraphobic.

511
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,340
就是他吗
Is that him?

512
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,390
不  那是守墓人哈罗德
No, that's Harold, the groundskeeper.

513
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,760
那才是
That's him.

514
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,030
你确定要这么做吗
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

515
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,290
我们会帮助你恢复记忆
We will help you to remember.

516
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,000
你会惊醒死灵的
You'll wake the dead.

517
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,420
真不敢相信  这地方就在城市边上
I can't believe this place is just outside the city.

518
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,820
欢迎来到骸骨之城
Welcome to the City of Bones.

519
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,890
寂言兄弟就是在这里
This is where the Silent Brothers draw their power,

520
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,880
从暗影猎人的尸骨和骨灰中获取力量
from the bones and ashes of Shadowhunters.

521
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,870
他们都葬在这里吗
All of them are buried here?

522
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,890
是的
Yes.

523
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,390
未来某天  我会在这里
One day, that's gonna be me.

524
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,970
我只能送你到这了
This is as far as I go.

525
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,600
你会没事的
You'll be fine.

526
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,850
你之前也这么做过吗
So you've done this before?

527
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,820
没有
No.

528
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,040
你要听从自己的内心
You must listen with your mind.

529
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,340
妈妈
Mom?

530
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,260
妈妈
Mom?

531
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,810
出去  出去
Go. Go.

532
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,950
克莱莉  这是卢克
Clary, this is Luke,

533
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,820
我最好的朋友
my dearest friend.

534
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,780
你可以信任他
You can trust him.

535
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,410
你好  克莱莉
Hi, Clary.

536
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,620
不要跟别人说
Don't tell.

537
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,840
不要碰那件旧东西
Don't touch that old thing.

538
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,640
只是个旧杯子而已  克莱莉
It's just an old cup, Clary.

539
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,220
克莱莉  克莱莉  你没事吧
Clary! Clary, are you okay?

540
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,280
克莱莉
Glary?

541
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,740
你思想的封印比我预计的还要强大
Your block is stronger than I anticipated.

542
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,500
只有施术者本人才能帮你解开
It can only be undone by the one who put it there.

543
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,620
我不知道施术的人是谁
I have no idea who put it there.

544
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,420
你写下来了
You wrote it.

545
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,090
你的大脑记得倒像
Your mind remembers the inverted image.

546
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,470
只需要从另一个角度去看
Just have to look at it differently.

547
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,680
B A N E
"B-A-N-E."

548
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,060
-贝恩  -贝恩是谁
- Bane. - Who?

549
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,920
马格纳斯·贝恩  他是名术士
Magnus Bane. He's a warlock.

550
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,940
我早该猜到的
I should have known.

551
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,020
那我们去找他吧
Well, let's go talk to him then.

552
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,610
没那么简单
Not like that.

553
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,900
我们得需要伊莎贝尔的帮助
We're gonna need some help from Isabelle.

554
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,780
这就是件上衣
This is a top.

555
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,370
是裙子
It's a dress.

556
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,120
就是拉不下去
I can't pull this off.

557
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,950
你只要穿双合适的鞋子...
Well, actually, with the right shoes...

558
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,500
不是...
No, I mean...

559
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,290
是这件裙子太紧了  紧紧贴在身上
This dress is so tight, it's like a second skin.

560
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,730
没别的衣服可穿了吗
Don't you have anything else?

561
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,780
如果让人一眼就看出你是个凡人
If you go out looking like your mundane self,

562
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,020
我们是无法靠近马格纳斯·贝恩的
we won't get within a hundred feet of Magnus Bane.

563
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,820
他是布鲁克林最高术士
He's the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

564
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,920
不要抱怨了  过来
Now, stop complaining, come over here.

565
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,740
拿着
Hold this.

566
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,580
那个叫埃利克的家伙不喜欢我
That guy Alec doesn't like me very much.

567
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,390
那个家伙是我哥哥
That guy Alec is my brother.

568
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,330
杰斯知道埃利克对他的感觉吗
Does Jace know how Alec feels about him?

569
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,850
有那么明显吗
Is it that obvious?

570
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,140
其实没什么大不了的
It's really not that big of a deal.

571
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,100
我也是这么想的
It isn't to me either.

572
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,190
但圣钥会不这么想  规矩不是我定的
But it is to the Clave. I don't make the rules.

573
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,740
看到没  你这样挺漂亮的
See? You look pretty.

574
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,630
穿成跟妓女一样  真能找到我妈妈吗
How is being dressed like a hooker gonna help me find my mom?

575
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,090
说话注意点  那可是我的衣服
Easy now, those are my clothes.

576
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,310
她看上去很棒吧  埃利克
Doesn't she look great, Alec?

577
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,370
她看着就像那些
She looks like someone whose

578
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,200
把手机号码贴在厕所墙上的人
phone number should be on a bathroom wall.

579
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,070
我觉得你看起来很棒
I think you look great.

580
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,060
不对  我来过这里
Wait, I've been here.

581
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,820
-等等  -怎么了
- Wait. - What?

582
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,620
那样更好看吗
Is that better?

583
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,040
是的
It's better.

584
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,100
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

585
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,520
这是谁来了啊
Look-a here.

586
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,370
{\an8}纳非利  《圣经》中坠落天使与人类的后代

587
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,370
我怎么不记得邀请了纳非利之裔
I don't remember inviting any children of the Nephilim.

588
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,190
马格纳斯·贝恩  我们得谈谈
Magnus Bane. We need to talk.

589
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,070
你知道我不喜欢你们族群
You know I don't like you guys.

590
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,360
但我不赶你们走  因为这位迷人的人士
But I'll let you stay, but only because of the hot one.

591
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,030
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thanks. - Thank you.

592
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,200
什么
What?

593
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,830
我指的是他
I meant him.

594
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,740
蓝眼睛那个
The one with the blue eyes.

595
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,580
还因为克莱莉
And because of Clary.

596
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,790
你怎么会认识她
Wait. How do you know her name?

597
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,340
跟我来
Come with me.

598
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,090
-你母亲呢  -她失踪了
- Where's your mother? - She's missing.

599
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,090
原来如此
That explains it.

600
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,640
她每年都会带你过来
Every year, she brought you here.

601
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,320
从未失约过
She never missed an appointment.

602
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,950
我在你身上施的咒语是最完美的
Not every spell turns out as perfect as the one I did on you.

603
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,250
你只要一开始画天使咒符
As soon as you started drawing the angelic rune,

604
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,750
就预示着你的记忆开始恢复
it was a sign your memory was surfacing.

605
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,420
这是我植入你脑海的
I had built that into your mind

606
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,970
这样她才知道什么时候带你过来
so that she knew when to bring you back.

607
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,220
你看到的关于暗影世界的一切
What you saw from the shadow world,

608
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,470
即使是亲眼所见  你也会遗忘
you would forget, even as you saw it.

609
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,080
但随着你年龄的增长
But as you grew older,

610
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,310
我需要愈加频繁地为你施术
you needed my treatment more frequently.

611
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,770
她知道总有一天得告诉你真相
She knew she had to tell you one day,

612
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,020
但在你准备好之前
but until you were ready,

613
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,950
她想保持你记忆的封印
she wanted to keep the block on your mind.

614
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:04,020
这都是她要求的
It was exactly how she wanted it.

615
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,210
你觉得我们要在这里待多久
How long do you think we're gonna be here?

616
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,040
放松好吗  西蒙
Relax, Simon, okay?

617
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,540
不要喝
Don't drink that!

618
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,540
西蒙  西蒙
Simon! Simon!

619
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,120
封印会随时间逐渐消失
It'll wear off over time.

620
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,560
已经开始消失了  否则你也不会过来
It's already wearing off, or you wouldn't be here.

621
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,230
我需要记起来
I need to remember.

622
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,480
我妈妈情况危急
My mom doesn't have time.

623
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,540
求你了  你一定能帮我的
Please, there must be something you can do.

624
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,960
她的画都是你买走的
You're the one who's been buying all my mom's paintings.

625
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,990
你为什么都买下来
Why did you buy all of them?

626
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,150
我知道她需要钱
I knew she needed the money.

627
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,280
我爸爸的肖像你都买了
You even have a portrait of my dad.

628
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,090
那不是你爸爸
That's not your dad.

629
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,220
他是一名在伊拉克阵亡的士兵
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

630
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,020
乔瑟琳甚至都没见过这个人
Jocelyn never even met the guy.

631
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,040
是有人请她画这幅肖像的
She was asked to paint his portrait,

632
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,460
但是画完后  士兵的遗孀太痛苦无法接受
but it was too painful for the widow.

633
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,250
你妈就把画留下...
She kept the picture so... 

634
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,800
假装这是我爸爸
She could pretend he was my dad.

635
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,110
她做的一切都是为你好
Everything she did, she did for you.

636
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,870
你母亲全部的人生
Your mother's whole existence,

637
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,940
逃跑  躲藏  谎言
the running, the hiding, the lies,

638
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,460
都是为了保护你
were to keep you safe.

639
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,460
她对我说的有一句是真话吗
Was anything she ever told me true?

640
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,340
你的大脑中有一幅藏宝图  克莱莉
There's a treasure map inside your head, Clary.

641
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,290
找到圣杯  它会指引你找到你的母亲
Find the Cup, and it will lead you to your mother.

642
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,310
他们把西蒙带走了
They've taken Simon.

643
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,630
-谁  -吸血鬼
- Who? - Vampires.

644
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,650
记住
Just remember,

645
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,170
你母亲一直在躲避的是暗影猎人
it was Shadowhunters your mother was running from.

646
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,440
我们去找西蒙
Let's go find Simon.

647
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,260
我们不能私闯吸血鬼的巢穴
We can't break into a vampire's lair,

648
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,180
我们没学过对付吸血鬼
we never learned.

649
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,450
-不要再说了  -杰斯  你知道规矩
- Don't start again. - Jace, you know the rules.

650
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,070
我们来这里干什么
Guys, what are we doing here?

651
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,600
不是要去找西蒙吗
I thought we were trying to find Simon.

652
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,840
我们知道他在哪里
We know where he is.

653
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,100
但需要先拿点东西
We just need to pick up a few things.

654
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,690
这是什么  你们跟教堂之间的什么协议吗
What is this, some kind of deal you have with the church?

655
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,090
恶魔随时会以不同的形态
Demons exist all across the world

656
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,740
出现在世界各个角落
in their varying, different forms.

657
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,770
暗影猎人不信奉宗教
Shadowhunters cling to no particular religion,

658
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:14,280
但是所有宗教都会帮助我们
and in turn all religions assist us in our battle.

659
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,280
我们可以轻松进入犹太教会堂
We could have as easily gone to a Jewish synagogue

660
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,300
或是神社庙宇...
or a Shinto temple or...

661
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,480
找到了
Here it is.

662
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,230
每座教堂的圣坛下面
Beneath every altar in every church...

663
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,920
都会有这个
...you'll find this.

664
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,320
那你信仰什么
So, what do you believe in?

665
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,330
我信我自己
I believe in myself.

666
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,890
我知道我的职责是斩杀恶魔
I know my job is to kill demons.

667
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,290
所以我不用信仰别的
I don't have to believe in anything else.

668
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,480
那天使拉杰尔呢
What about the Angel Raziel? 

669
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,090
那个故事很动听
Yeah, makes for a nice story.

670
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,930
-但霍奇认为...-霍奇啊
- But Hodge thinks... - Yeah, Hodge.

671
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,070
他得多出来走走
He needs to get out more.

672
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,360
-我觉得...-听着
- I thought... - Listen,

673
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,520
我三分之一的人生都在猎杀恶魔
I've been hunting demons for over a third of my life,

674
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,510
但是我从未见过天使
and in all that time, I've never seen an angel.

675
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,890
给你
Here.

676
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,570
给你  你拿这个
Here, you take this one.

677
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:15,720
我不会...
I don't...

678
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,870
我教你
Here, let me show you.

679
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,440
这是专杀吸血鬼的枪  必须刺穿心脏
It's a vampire gun. Must pierce the heart.

680
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,290
抵在对方的胸口
Push it up against the chest.

681
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,510
开枪
Fire.

682
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,740
上膛  然后就可以再用了
Recharge. Then you're good to go again.

683
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,160
死亡旅馆
Hotel of Death?

684
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,210
他们还是很有幽默感的
You can't say they don't have a sense of humor.

685
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:42,560
走吧
Come on.

686
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,750
-你跟她是怎么回事  -她很勇敢
- What is it about her? - She's brave.

687
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,550
我们是暗影猎人  我们都很勇敢
We're Shadowhunters, we're all brave.

688
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,480
她以前不知道  她跟我们不同
She wasn't raised like us, she's different.

689
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,250
她会把我们都害死的
She's gonna get us all killed.

690
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,150
这是西蒙的衬衣
Simon's shirt.

691
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:31,780
他在这里
He's up here.

692
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,410
西蒙
Simon.

693
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,850
-天哪  天哪  西蒙  -克莱莉
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, Simon. - Clary.

694
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,370
别拉我  我快够到他了
No, I can feel him!

695
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,920
帮我一把  加油
Give me a hand. Come on, come on.

696
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,890
烂靴子
These damn boots!

697
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,440
来
Here.

698
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
接住
Here you go.

699
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,820
-好了  -慢慢来
- Come on. - Guys, steady.

700
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,850
慢慢来
Slowly.

701
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
他还活着
He's alive!

702
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,550
小心
Careful.

703
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,600
快走  他们要的不是我
Go on. Get out. They don't want me.

704
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,860
他们要的是你  他们想要圣杯
They want you, they want the Cup.

705
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,450
-快  走吧  -天哪
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh, God.

706
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,560
快走
Let's go!

707
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,390
这边
No, here.

708
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,880
-这边  -快走
- In here! - Go!

709
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:34,620
杰斯
Jace.

710
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,710
你后面
Behind you!

711
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,430
快走  快走
Come on! Come on!

712
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,700
克莱莉
Clary!

713
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,390
他们人数太多了
There's too many of them.

714
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,240
有点信心  行吗
Have a little faith.

715
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,870
快走
Run!

716
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,170
杰斯  给我匕首
Jace, I need a knife.

717
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,410
-太阳出来了  -快走吧
- The sun. - Let's go.

718
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,670
你去帮西蒙
You help Simon.

719
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,810
克莱莉
Clary!

720
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,860
坚持住
Hold on!

721
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,060
克莱莉
Clary!

722
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:23,710
谢谢
Thank you.

723
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,620
谢谢你救了西蒙
For saving Simon.

724
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,280
-你还好吗  -没事  我没事
- Are you okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay.

725
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,240
克莱莉
Clary.

726
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,630
我能跟你聊聊吗
Can I talk to you?

727
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,860
好  我正打算去看西蒙
Yeah, I was just gonna go see Simon.

728
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,380
-我希望你离开这里  -什么
- I want you to leave here. - What?

729
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,880
你差点害死我们
You almost got us killed.

730
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,550
很抱歉  但我们别无选择
I'm sorry, we didn't have a choice.

731
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,180
难道能对西蒙见死不救吗  而且杰斯...
I mean, we had to save Simon, and Jace...

732
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,350
杰斯是那种想要拯救世界的人
Jace thinks he needs to save the world.

733
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:27,890
不过不需要你来鼓励他
But you don't need to encourage him to do it.

734
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,130
-这不是你们的责任吗  -没错
- But that's what you guys do. - Yes, us.

735
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,810
这是我们的责任
What we do.

736
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,230
我们是个队伍  而你只是累赘
We're a team, you're deadweight.

737
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,440
-一个凡人  -我不是凡人
- A mundane. - I'm not a mundane.

738
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,510
如果你真如自己声称的那样勇敢
And if you were half as brave as you pretend to be,

739
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,450
你就该承认..
you'd admit that...

740
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:43,870
什么
What?

741
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,010
你就该承认你爱杰斯
You'd admit that you're in love with Jace,

742
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,490
所以你才这么希望我离开
and that's what this is really about.

743
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,210
你敢再说这样的话
If you ever say anything like that again...

744
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,170
我就杀了你
I'll kill you.

745
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,950
-我昏迷了多久  -一整天
- How long was I out? - All day.

746
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,530
我找到了你的眼镜
Found your glasses.

747
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,580
-一个镜片破了  -好吧
- One of the lenses cracked. - Yeah.

748
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,340
真奇怪
How weird.

749
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,050
我似乎不需要眼镜了
I don't seem to need them anymore.

750
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:48,680
你在画什么
So, what are you drawing?

751
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,350
没什么
Nothing.

752
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,530
-好多了吗  -对
- You okay? - Yeah.

753
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,950
真是太疯狂了
It was crazy.

754
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,950
很抱歉我一开始不相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you before.

755
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,540
现在我相信了
Now I get it.

756
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,790
而且
And...

757
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,540
我一定是昏迷了
And I must have passed out,

758
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,800
然后你出现了
and then you showed up.

759
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,260
听我说
Listen,

760
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,840
我知道一直以来  都是我比较需要你
I know I've always been the one who needed you

761
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,260
而你不需要我
more than you needed me.

762
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,890
-别瞎想  -是真的
- That's not true. - Yes, it is,

763
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,470
但我不在乎
but I never cared.

764
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,820
一直以来我只有妈妈  卢克  还有你
I've only ever had my mom, Luke and you.

765
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:46,570
所以别觉得你对我来说不重要
Don't ever imagine that you weren't important to me.

766
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,240
-好  -那就好
- Okay. - Okay.

767
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,120
知道了
Yeah.

768
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,740
那架钢琴怎么惹你了
What did that piano ever do to you?

769
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,200
你弹得就好像失去了至爱一样
You play it like you've lost your only love.

770
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,960
很不幸  我唯一的真爱只有我自己
Unfortunately, my one true love remains myself.

771
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,790
是吗  那你至少不用担心被拒绝
Well, at least you don't have to worry about rejection.

772
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,880
倒也不一定
Not necessarily.

773
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,760
有时候我会拒绝自己  这样才不会很闷
I turn myself down occasionally just to keep it interesting.

774
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,800
你的琴声的确饱含情感
You do play that with a lot of passion.

775
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,510
这正是问题所在  我弹得太有感情了
Well, that's the problem. I play it with too much emotion.

776
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,730
弹钢琴本应只是单纯音律的显现
It's supposed to be played with a simple representation

777
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,720
不该有情感的展现
of notes, no interpretation.

778
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,900
音乐就应该赋予情感
Music is supposed to have emotion.

779
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,980
恶魔对两个交错的音调很敏感
Demons react to certain frequencies when two tones cross.

780
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,280
这会令他们发狂
Drives them crazy.

781
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,450
巴赫发现了这一点  然后写下了乐谱
See, Bach discovered this and put it into a system using

782
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:18,330
结合音调连续的变换
a mathematical progression of tonal combinations

783
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,250
让恶魔现身
that allows us to expose demons.

784
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
所以巴赫也是暗影猎人吗
So Bach was a Shadowhunter?

785
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,130
-对  -所以
- Yes. - So...

786
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,870
所以巴赫的音乐对恶魔的影响
Bach is to demons what

787
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,350
就像大蒜对吸血鬼的效果
garlic is to vampires.

788
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,760
算是吧
Kind of.

789
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,850
不过  大蒜会用完
I mean, you can run out of garlic.

790
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:40,770
而音乐取之不尽
You can't really run out of music.

791
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,770
那是你放玩具的地方吗
Is that where you keep all your toys?

792
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:50,110
比玩具好玩多了
It's way more fun.

793
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,740
过来
Come on.

794
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,490
这是传送门
It's a portal.

795
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,830
就像百慕大三角一样  是自然形成的
Like the Bermuda Triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.

796
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:57,790
学院就围它而建
The Institute was built around it.

797
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,460
有些人说学院是纽约的第一栋建筑
Some say that the Institute was the first building in New York.

798
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,950
所以...
So it's...

799
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,400
构成空间的元素不仅仅是直线
Dimensions aren't all just straight lines.

800
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,090
还有曲线
There's bends,

801
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:10,220
折线和折角
folds and nooks.

802
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,880
解释起来有些复杂  不过
It's a little bit difficult to explain, but

803
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:14,320
传送门可以带你去
the Portal can take you

804
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,680
这个维度空间里的任何地方
wherever you want to go in this dimension.

805
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:21,300
当你穿过这层表面
So, as soon as you break that surface,

806
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,670
就会被送到你内心深处最渴望的地方
you're transported to wherever your deepest thoughts lie.

807
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,580
所以就是
So that means...

808
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,450
-我妈妈那里...-等等
- My mom... - Wait.

809
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,790
我们从出生起  一直在学习如何使用它
We spend our entire lives training how to use it,

810
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,510
练习在踏入之前  想象自己要去的地方
visualizing where it will take us before we step into it,

811
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,080
这需要很强的注意力
and that takes incredible focus.

812
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,520
如果你没接受训练  就直接进去
If you were to step into it without the proper training,

813
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,910
你可能会跌入边缘之境
you could end up in limbo,

814
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,160
永远迷失在自己的思想里
lost in your own mind forever.

815
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,120
过来
Here.

816
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,330
我给你展示一下
Let me show you.

817
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,130
来吧
Come on.

818
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,370
不许偷看
No peeking.

819
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:34,820
很帅吧
Pretty cool, isn't it?

820
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,090
好了
Now...

821
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,070
我们
You and I...

822
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,110
还要庆祝生日呢
Have a birthday to celebrate.

823
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,240
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

824
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,420
为找到你  我做了调查
Research. When I was trying to find you.

825
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:53,520
现在没人会来这里了
No one comes up here anymore.

826
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,560
这个地方完全属于我们
We have the place to ourselves.

827
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,310
这里好美
This is breathtaking.

828
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,860
抱歉我没有准备蛋糕
Sorry there's no cake.

829
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,820
我根本没想到会有庆祝
Well, I was expecting nothing,

830
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,390
所以已经很棒了
so this is great.

831
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,950
每个人的生日都应该收到礼物
Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.

832
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,130
你收到过什么礼物
What did you get?

833
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,500
大多数是武器
Weapons mostly.

834
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,740
你肯定不觉得惊讶
I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.

835
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,700
现在的我很难惊讶了
At this point, nothing really does.

836
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:47,880
我九岁的时候
When I was nine...

837
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,240
我爸爸送了我一只猎鹰
my father gave me a falcon.

838
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,330
他说让我驯服它
He told me to make it obedient.

839
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,760
要我把它弄瞎
I was supposed to keep the bird blind,

840
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,540
但是我下不了手
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

841
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:01,720
我轻抚它的翅膀  直至得到它的信任
Instead, I touched and stroked its wings until it trusted me.

842
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:03,800
我把它驯服得乖顺至极
I tamed it to perfection.

843
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,320
带去给我爸爸看
I took it to my father,

844
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,130
还以为他会为我自豪
expecting him to be proud of what I'd done.

845
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:10,930
他说
He said,

846
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,760
"我让你驯服它"
"I told you to make it obedient.

847
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,050
"而你却让它爱你"
"Instead, you taught it to love you.

848
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,240
"你没有驯服它  你毁了它"
"You didn't tame it, you broke it."

849
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,480
然后他抢走了猎鹰  折断了它的脖子
Then he took the bird and he broke its neck.

850
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,610
我哭了整晚  之后再也没有哭过
I cried all night and I never cried again.

851
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:28,980
你最终原谅他了吗
Did you ever forgive him?

852
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,600
他是为了让我更强大
He did it to make me stronger.

853
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,820
这是代表威兰德吗
Does that stand for Wayland?

854
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,450
到午夜了
Midnight.

855
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:49,470
看好
Watch this.

856
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:57,670
When your soul finds the soul it was waiting for

857
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,510
When someone walks into your heart

858
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:04,570
Through a open door

859
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:08,480
When your hand finds the hand

860
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,320
一般女孩说想要块大石头
When a girl says she wants a big rock,

861
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,910
{\an8}It was meant to hold

862
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,020
并不是真的指石头
she doesn't literally mean a big rock

863
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,450
每位暗影猎人都应该拥有自己的巫光石
Every Shadowhunter should have their own witchlight.

864
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,450
{\an8}Don't let go

865
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:24,730
When you're one with the one you were meant to find

866
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:25,910
我们有作伴的了
We have company. 

867
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,060
{\an8}Opened up to the light

868
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,140
那是霍奇的鸟
That's Hodge's bird.

869
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:33,670
{\an8}That was kept inside your soul

870
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,670
我们该走了
We should probably go.

871
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:37,750
Don't let go

872
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,050
Someone comes into your life

873
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:50,390
It's like they've been in your life forever

874
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:55,150
No there's no one else's eyes

875
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,850
That could see into me

876
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,040
No one else's arms can lift

877
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,730
Lift me up so high

878
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,950
Your love lifts me out of time

879
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,110
And you know my heart by heart

880
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:19,310
{\an8}And you know my heart by heart

881
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,310
我们真的该走了
We should definitely go.

882
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:26,940
And you know my heart by heart

883
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,750
And you know my heart by heart

884
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:41,600
{\an8}And you know my heart by heart

885
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,340
刚才那个喷水系统  抱歉
Sorry about the sprinkler system.

886
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,600
我忘了还有那回事了
I forgot about that.

887
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,110
你要睡觉了吗
You going to sleep?

888
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,630
你不累吗
Well, aren't you tired?

889
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,940
我从未这样清醒过
I've never been more awake.

890
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,000
-西蒙  我还以为你...-睡了吗
- Simon, I thought you were... - Asleep?

891
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,570
我刚才是在睡觉
Yeah, I was.

892
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,370
我们只是...
We were just...

893
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:02,700
下一次如果你先说清楚
Next time, it might be a nice idea

894
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,610
你床上还有别的男人的话
to mention that you already have a man in your bed,

895
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,580
我们也许就不会这么尴尬了
so we can avoid such uncomfortable situations.

896
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,830
你邀请他上床了吗
You invited him to bed?

897
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,980
很可笑  是吧
I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

898
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,060
这么多人怎么挤得下一张床
We would never have all fit.

899
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,050
我没邀请他上我的床
I didn't invite him into bed.

900
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,600
我们只是在接吻而已
We were just kissing.

901
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,330
你这么快就否决了我们的爱
How swiftly you dismiss our love.

902
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,590
杰斯
Jace?

903
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,730
西蒙  已经很晚了  抱歉打扰到你了
Simon, it's late, and I'm sorry we woke you.

904
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,600
我也是
So am I.

905
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,730
去啊  去追他  去给他道歉
Go ahead. Go after him, go apologize to him,

906
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,920
去告诉他  他在你心中有多特别
go tell him just how special he really is.

907
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,910
-别总是这样  -哪样
- Stop acting like that! - Like what?

908
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,350
好像没什么能伤害你一样
Like nothing ever hurts you.

909
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,490
也许你在吻我之前
Well, maybe you should have thought about that

910
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,310
就该想到这点
before you kissed me.

911
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:36,630
我吻你
I kissed you?

912
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,800
算了  这对我来说也不是那么特别
Don't worry, it wasn't that special for me either.

913
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,160
真的很抱歉  西蒙  但你刚才...
I'm really sorry, Simon, but weren't you just in the...

914
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,760
我只是在找你
I was just looking for you.

915
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,070
-你要去哪儿  -回家
- Where are you going? - Home.

916
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,500
很显然我在这里呆得太久了
It's clear I overstayed my welcome.

917
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,660
我道歉   一切发生的太突然了
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It wasn't like it was planned.

918
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,680
让我猜猜  你们是情之所至  拜托
Let me guess, it just happened. Please.

919
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,240
我知道你不喜欢他  但是...
Look, I know you don't like him, but...

920
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,570
事实上  我讨厌他
Actually, I hate the guy.

921
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
为什么
Why?

922
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,150
我觉得你该找个更好的人
I thought you were better than that.

923
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:07,660
你这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

924
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,300
我才是那个一直伴你左右的人  不是他
I'm the one who's always been there for you, not him.

925
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,540
我一直爱着你
I'm in love with you.

926
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:36,350
显然你对我没感觉
And it's clear that you don't feel the same way.

927
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,360
-这...-别说了
-It's... - Don't.

928
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,050
没什么好说的
There's nothing to say.

929
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,140
克莱莉
And, Clary,

930
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,700
他只是在利用你找圣杯
he's just using you to get the Cup.

931
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,550
西蒙
Simon...

932
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,910
{\an8}强化咒符

933
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:35,060
{\an8}静声咒符

934
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,230
除了你  只有你的母亲可以做到这个
Your mother was the only other person who could do that.

935
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,350
但我之前从未能这样做过
But I've never been able to do this before.

936
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:00,390
显然封印不止封尘了你的记忆
Apparently the block wasn't just repressing your memories,

937
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,810
也压制了你的能力
but your abilities as well.

938
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,040
-杰斯  我...-别说  让我猜猜
- Jace, I... - Don't tell me.

939
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,810
你突然想画画  所以要找个人体模特
You have a drawing emergency and you need a nude model.

940
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,070
-我没有兴致  -听我说
- I'm not in the mood. - Listen!

941
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,570
我知道我妈妈把圣杯藏在哪儿了
I know where my mom hid the Cup.

942
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,380
你好呀
Hey.

943
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,400
-你好  -克莱莉...
- Hi. - Clary...

944
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,210
你看起来很不一样
Wow, you look different.

945
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,640
这都是我借来的
Yeah, it's just something I borrowed.

946
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,040
这身装扮很棒  很漂亮
I mean, nice outfit. It's good.

947
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,070
我现在不方便说话  抱歉
Yeah, I can't talk now. Sorry.

948
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:09,760
{\an8}西蒙  我刚在克莱莉家附近碰到了她

949
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,980
-克莱莉  -我是为塔罗牌来的
- Clary. - I came for the tarot cards.

950
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,220
-为什么  -我需要它
- Why? - I need them.

951
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,190
就是我妈妈画的那一副
You know, the ones that Mom painted?

952
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:38,000
给我看一眼就行
I just need to look at them really quickly,

953
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,740
然后就还给你  我保证
and I'll give them back, I promise.

954
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,570
那些武器可不能带进来
Those can't come in here.

955
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,670
这里是和平之家
This is a peaceful house.

956
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:46,680
把它们放在那儿
Put them in there.

957
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,830
你今天过得如何
How are you feeling today?

958
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,350
不错  还可以
Fine. Just fine.

959
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:09,920
年轻人  那架钢琴音不准了
Young man, that piano is out of tune.

960
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,590
别弹了
Please don't.

961
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,430
年轻人
Young man.

962
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:31,310
别弹了
Stop!

963
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,740
这支曲子
That song.

964
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,500
我不喜欢
Not one of my favorites.

965
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,600
住手
Stop!

966
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,570
给我看看
Let's have a look.

967
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:04,630
快出去
Get out!

968
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,070
萝西娅夫人  你看到克莱莉了吗
Hey, Madame Dorothea. Have you seen Clary?

969
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,730
我刚收到短信说她在这里
I just got a text that said she was here.

970
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,600
没有
No.

971
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,880
好吧  我只是...
Okay. Well, I'll just...

972
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,060
西蒙
Simon!

973
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,470
西蒙
Simon!

974
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:50,570
西蒙
Simon!

975
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,180
西蒙  这不是她本人
Simon, it's not really her!

976
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:55,790
西蒙
Simon!

977
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,860
西蒙
Simon!

978
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,510
我来看着他
I'll take care of him.

979
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:06,870
西蒙
Simon!

980
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,730
圣杯在她手上
She's got the Cup!

981
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:23,710
西蒙
Simon!

982
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,490
抱歉
I'm sorry.

983
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:12,850
抱歉
I'm sorry.

984
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,630
杰斯
Jace!

985
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,750
咒符没有用
The runes aren't working.

986
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,360
西蒙  你过来
Simon, you follow me.

987
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,600
把这些剪开
You cut these up.

988
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,820
走开  你做的已经够多了
Don't. You've done enough.

989
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,580
别那样和她说话  那不是她的错
Don't talk to her like that. This isn't her fault.

990
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,700
你说得对  这都是你的错
No, you're right. This is your fault.

991
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,610
伊莎贝尔
Isabelle!

992
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:00,530
埃利克一直跟你说  你会受伤的
Alec kept telling you that you were going to get hurt.

993
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:01,920
你会让我们都受伤的
You were going to get us all hurt.

994
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,460
现在要死的却是他
Now he's the one dying.

995
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,020
我们必须找到天使圣杯
Well, we needed to get the Mortal Cup.

996
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,700
但不是通过害死你最好的朋友
But there were other ways to do it than

997
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,610
来找到它
getting your best friend killed.

998
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:11,810
你去把霍奇找来吧
Why don't you go get Hodge.

999
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,440
我从来没想过让埃利克出事
I never wanted anything to happen to Alec.

1000
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,300
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1001
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:24,360
我们发誓共进退  我们是一个团队
We agreed to do this together. We're a team.

1002
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,210
克莱莉来了后  我们就不是一个团队了
Since Clary got here, we haven't been a team.

1003
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,450
霍奇
Hodge!

1004
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,300
霍奇
Hodge!

1005
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,980
埃利克的伤势恶化了
Alec's getting worse.

1006
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:38,380
我知道
I know.

1007
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,200
我已经去请人帮忙了
I've already sent for someone.

1008
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,210
你拿到圣杯了吗
Did you get the Cup?

1009
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,200
接下来怎么办
What now?

1010
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:15,850
霍奇
Hodge?

1011
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,310
你根本不清楚
You have no idea what it's like

1012
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,350
背负着圣钥会的诅咒是怎样的
living with the Clave's curse,

1013
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:30,610
无法踏足外面的世界
unable to set so much as a foot outside,

1014
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:34,260
甚至连开扇窗户都不敢
afraid to even open a window.

1015
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:39,290
不要苛责我  克莱莉
Try not to judge me too harshly, Clary.

1016
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,300
霍奇  你做了什么
Hodge, what have you done?

1017
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,950
我就知道你能把圣杯带给我
I always knew you would bring me the Cup.

1018
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,770
只不过是早晚的问题
It was only a matter of time.

1019
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,320
她在哪儿
Where is she?

1020
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,810
她很好
She's fine.

1021
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,930
你得到你想要的了  放了她
You got what you want. Now let her go.

1022
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,130
我得确保你给我的是真的才行
I have to make sure you gave me the real one.

1023
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,400
所有人都出于错误的动机争夺升杯
Everybody wants the Cup for the wrong reason.

1024
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,670
你就没有错吗
And you don't?

1025
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,240
有了圣杯
With this Cup,

1026
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,440
我可以净化我们的血脉
I can cleanse our bloodlines,

1027
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,650
拯救我们的族群
save our race.

1028
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,920
你可能不太了解凡人的历史
You might not know much about mundane history,

1029
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,990
但我可以告诉你
but I can tell you

1030
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,150
当人们想要保护一个种族的时候
when people start talking about preserving a race,

1031
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:58,880
结果往往不尽人意
it never goes well.

1032
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:03,650
所以我妈妈倾尽人生将它藏起来
That's why my mom spent her whole life hiding it from you.

1033
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,930
不
No.

1034
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,160
她藏的不是圣杯
She wasn't hiding the Cup.

1035
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,380
而是你
She was hiding you.

1036
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,180
喝了它
Drink.

1037
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,370
我不会喝的
I'm not gonna drink that.

1038
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,340
你怕什么
Why are you so afraid?

1039
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,940
你还没出生的时候就喝过
You've been drinking this since before you were born.

1040
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:24,030
你还在你妈肚子里时  我就给她喝过
I fed it to your mother while you were in her womb.

1041
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,380
得了吧  克莱莉
Come on, Clary.

1042
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,300
你肯定已经猜出来了
You must have guessed by now.

1043
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,300
你母亲一直极力掩盖的
All these amazing talents

1044
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,650
你的这些惊人天赋
that your mother so desperately tried to suppress,

1045
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,810
你以为它们都是从哪儿来的
where do you think they came from?

1046
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,040
你是我女儿
You're my daughter.

1047
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:43,530
你血管里流的是我的血
My blood runs in your veins.

1048
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:44,990
现在...
Now...

1049
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:47,580
喝了它
Drink.

1050
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:51,870
喝了它
Drink!

1051
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:04,300
把它拿出来
Take that out!

1052
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,680
不
No!

1053
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:26,830
有人刚刚通过了传送门
Someone just went through the Portal.

1054
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,420
我去看看
I'll go check.

1055
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,040
抱歉
Sorry.

1056
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,520
有点太激动了
I got a bit carried away.

1057
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,690
卢克  你是一个...
Luke, you're a...

1058
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:10,020
克莱莉  听我说  听我说  别害怕
Clary, listen to me, listen. Don't be afraid.

1059
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,900
-听我说  -别碰我
- Listen, right? - Don't touch me!

1060
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,400
没必要这样
Hey, there's no need for that.

1061
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,990
那东西会回来的
That thing will be back.

1062
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,850
我们在外面不安全
We are not safe out here.

1063
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,920
为了躲避瓦伦莱  我跳进了传送门里
I jumped through the Portal to get away from Valentine.

1064
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,770
我以为会去到我妈妈那里
I thought I'd end up with my mom.

1065
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,560
结果我却来到了最不想去的地方
Instead, I ended up in the last place I wanted to be.

1066
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:37,300
听着  传送门把你送到这儿
Listen, the Portal brought you here

1067
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,260
是因为你当时肯定在想着我
because you must have been thinking of me.

1068
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,620
在你内心深处  你知道你可以信任我
Deep inside, you know you can trust me.

1069
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:44,000
你说你完全不在乎我俩会发生什么
You said you couldn't care less what happened to either of us.

1070
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,170
你只是想要圣杯  就跟所有人一样
You just want the Cup, like everyone else.

1071
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,420
我那么说是为了保护你  我还能怎么做
I said that to protect you. What else could I do?

1072
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,510
这段时间我一直在关注着你
Been keeping an eye on you this whole time.

1073
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,340
在旅馆那里的是你
That was you at the hotel.

1074
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,650
顺便说一句  扔得漂亮
Good throw, by the way.

1075
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:10,040
我怎么办
What about me?

1076
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:11,300
你怎么了
What about you?

1077
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,890
我们有约在先
We had a deal.

1078
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:15,090
我依旧没拿到圣杯  不是吗
Well, I still don't have my Cup, do I?

1079
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,350
我遵守了我的承诺
I held up my end of the bargain.

1080
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,920
不  你没有
No, you didn't.

1081
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,200
我把圣杯给了你
I gave you the Cup.

1082
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:31,440
是你把它给了克莱莉  那不是我的错
You handed it to Clary. That's not my fault.

1083
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,800
解除我的诅咒
Now lift it.

1084
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,790
听着  那都是你脑中的幻象
Listen, it's all in your head.

1085
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,400
不  不是
No. No!

1086
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,030
有一个咒语
There's a spell.

1087
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:45,780
是吗  咒语
Really? A spell?

1088
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:48,970
那只是你逃避真正问题的借口
That's just an excuse for a real problem

1089
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,660
这里的问题
in there.

1090
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,080
你真以为我能治好你
Do you really think I can fix that?

1091
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,030
我给你圣杯  你驱走我的恐惧
I give you the Cup, you take away the fear.

1092
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,910
没有圣杯  我跟你一样被困住了
Without the Cup, I'm as stuck as you are.

1093
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,720
只是我的恐惧是真实的
Except my fear is real.

1094
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,660
每个地下生物
Every Downworlder,

1095
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,660
圣钥会的每一位成员
every member of the Clave,

1096
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:13,340
传送门两边的每一个暗影猎人
every Shadowhunter on both sides of the Portal

1097
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,300
现在都在找我
is looking for me right now.

1098
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:17,390
我要尽可能取得所有的帮助
I'm going to need all the help I can get.

1099
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:21,050
你没必要这么做  瓦伦莱
You don't have to go through with this, Valentine.

1100
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:24,550
还从来没有恶魔涉足过学院
A demon has never set foot in the Institute.

1101
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:27,580
也许现在是时候涉足了
Well, maybe it's time they did.

1102
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:34,300
这一刻我等了这么多年
I've been waiting all these years to do this.

1103
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,420
克莱莉让我别无选择
Clary's given me no choice.

1104
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:42,830
她会回来的
She'll come back.

1105
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:45,930
是吗
Really?

1106
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:48,500
你怎么能这么确定
And what makes you so sure?

1107
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,900
这里有一个她在乎的人
There's someone here 

1108
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,490
她对他的感情跟对她母亲的一样深
she wants as much as her mother.

1109
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,430
如果你骗他们说  他俩都是你的孩子
If you lie and tell them they're both your children,

1110
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:58,240
就会伤透他们的心
you'll break their hearts.

1111
01:31:58,740 --> 01:31:59,890
我还能说什么呢
What can I say?

1112
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:02,630
心碎之人是最好的追随者
The broken make the best followers.

1113
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,360
看看你
Look at you.

1114
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:08,190
爱就是毁灭
To love is to destroy.

1115
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:05,790
霍奇到底在哪儿
Where the hell is Hodge?

1116
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,210
时间不多了
We don't have much time.

1117
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,650
-你看这样对吗  -不对
- Does this look right to you? - No.

1118
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:15,830
看
Hey, look.

1119
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,540
马格纳斯
Magnus?

1120
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,960
这些全部都需要  需要很多
I'm going to need all of this. Lots of it.

1121
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,390
拿着这个
Take this.

1122
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,890
封锁这个地方
Lock this place down.

1123
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,410
非盟友者  诛尽杀绝
Those who are not allies must be killed.

1124
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:25,210
别动
Don't do that!

1125
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,750
瓦伦莱
Valentine.

1126
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,940
乔纳森
Jonathan.

1127
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:33,070
你怎么知道我的真名
How do you know my real name?

1128
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:36,400
没有人那么叫我
Nobody calls me that.

1129
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:38,550
是真的吗
Is it true?

1130
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,970
瓦伦莱是我父亲
Is Valentine my father?

1131
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:50,210
他曾经是个很伟大的人
You know, he was a great man,

1132
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:52,460
但他和圣钥会发生了冲突
until his conflict with the Clave.

1133
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:54,530
你妈妈带着圣杯逃走之后
But when your mother ran away with the Cup,

1134
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,840
他非常害怕圣钥会报复他
he was just so afraid of retribution from the Clave,

1135
01:34:57,850 --> 01:35:00,450
所以他把自己的家烧为灰烬
he burned their house down to the ground.

1136
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:05,610
他想让别人都认为他已经死了
He wanted the world to believe he was dead.

1137
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:09,440
在灰烬里  我们找到了一个男人
In the ashes, we found the remains of a man

1138
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:10,890
和一个孩子的残骸
and a child.

1139
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,480
等等  还有个孩子
Wait a second, there was a child?

1140
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,880
瓦伦莱恼羞成怒  他想让她相信
Valentine was so enraged, he wanted her to believe

1141
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,650
他杀死了自己以及他们的儿子
he killed himself and their son,

1142
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,970
你的哥哥
your brother.

1143
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,330
我有一个哥哥
I have a brother?

1144
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,260
乔纳森·克里斯托弗·摩根斯顿
Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern.

1145
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,140
你撒谎
You're lying.

1146
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:35,200
我的名字是杰斯·威兰德 
My name is Jace Wayland.

1147
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:38,440
我是威兰德家的人 
And my family are the Waylands.

1148
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:42,580
你以为克莱莉是唯一被封印记忆的人吗
You think Clary is the only one with a block in her mind?

1149
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,080
让我把真相展示给你
Let me show you the truth.

1150
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:53,560
你没有驯化它  你毁了它
You didn't tame him. You broke him.

1151
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,830
不  你...
No! You...

1152
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,940
你不是我父亲
You are not my father.

1153
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:03,580
我回来帮你找回真正的自己
I came back to help you understand who you really are.

1154
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,790
我知道你在这里不开心
I know you're unhappy here.

1155
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:09,800
被规矩所束缚
Plagued by rules.

1156
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,140
你的位置
Your place

1157
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:15,320
在我旁边
is next to me.

1158
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,700
你是摩根斯顿家的人
You're a Morgenstern.

1159
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:20,380
你是我的儿子
And you're my son.

1160
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,690
我的名字是杰斯·威兰德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1161
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,330
我是威兰德家的人
I'm a Wayland.

1162
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:43,240
抱歉告诉你这个
Sorry to break this to you,

1163
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,290
但到你了解真相的时候了
but it's time you heard the truth.

1164
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,370
不要
Don't.

1165
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,170
只需要换一个角度看
It's all a matter of perception.

1166
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,440
你看  摩根斯顿
You see, Morgenstern.

1167
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,460
-拿着这个  -好的
- Take this. - Okay.

1168
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:21,890
好的
Okay.

1169
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,380
伊莎贝尔
Isabelle.

1170
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:54,010
克莱莉
Clary?

1171
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,290
我们找到你母亲了
Yeah, we found your mom.

1172
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,570
他们找到她了
They found her.

1173
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,280
她在学院里
She's at the Institute.

1174
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:02,970
阿拉里克
Alaric.

1175
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:05,000
我是卢克  你看到了吗
It's Luke. Can you see it?

1176
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:06,750
是的  我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1177
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,390
伙计们  我们得走了
Hey, guys, we have to go.

1178

卢克需要我们
Luke needs us.

1179
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:12,960
我们要去哪儿
Where are we headed?

1180
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,850
去学院
The Institute.

1181
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,330
我们会违反和平公约的
We'd be breaking the Accords.

1182
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,990
我们保持人形就不会了
Not if we stay human.

1183
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:20,460
走了  伙计们
Let's go, guys!

1184
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:21,840
走  走  走
Go, go, go, go!

1185
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,060
快点  出发

1186
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,410
准备好了
Ready to go!

1187
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,700
我都跟他们说了
They've all been briefed.

1188
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:36,640
这是阿拉里克  是我们中的一员
This is Alaric. He's one of us.

1189
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,660
请随意
Go ahead.

1190
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:45,110
如果需要的话  你可以把头伸出窗外
You can hang your head out the window if you need to.

1191
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,280
我是个狼人
I'm a werewolf

1192
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:49,630
不是金毛猎犬
not a golden retriever.

1193
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,840
西蒙
Simon!

1194
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,140
在这儿等着  我马上回来

No. Isabelle!

1197
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,960
快回来  伊莎贝尔  你在哪儿
Come on, Isabelle, where are you?

1198
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:15,960
好了  行动
All right, move it!

1199
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,870
快点  行动
Come on, move it!

1200
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,370
好吧
All right.

1201
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:28,720
狼人来救我们了
The werewolves are here to save us.

1202
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,390
从没想过我会这么说
Never thought I'd say that.

1203
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:38,640
终于来了  伊莎贝尔
Finally! Isabelle.

1204
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:42,730
打开门
Hey, open up the door.

1205
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,990
他有反应了
It looks like he's responding.

1206
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,160
他会活下来的
He'll survive.

1207
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,850
小心
And be careful.

1208
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,710
你们被入侵了
You're being invaded.

1209
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,410
召唤那些该死的恶魔...
Summoning all these bloody demons...

1210
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:05,960
跑
Run!

1211
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:15,380
快跑
Run!

1212
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:18,360
-我们去哪儿  -还有一个出口
- Where are we going? - There's another exit!

1213
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:20,450
等等
Wait.

1214
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,790
伊莎贝尔
Isabelle!

1215
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:39,180
-我差点杀了你  -是的
- I almost killed you. - Yeah.

1216
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,590
你还好吗
Hey. You okay?

1217
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:42,860
-是的  我没事  -走吧
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - Come on.

1218
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,850
这地方到处都是恶魔
This place is full of demons.

1219
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:46,080
这不可能
That's impossible.

1220
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:48,460
学院是圣地
The Institute is hallowed ground.

1221
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:50,210
好像没人告诉过他们
Yeah, no one seems to have told them that.

1222
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,030
肯定是里面的人放他们进来的
Someone on the inside must have let them in.

1223
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,300
这是营救行动
This is a rescue mission.

1224
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,250
我们对付不了恶魔
We are not equipped to fight demons.

1225
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:17,190
-快散开  -往那边走
- Spread out! - That way! That way!

1226
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,020
退回去  快点
Move back! Come on!

1227
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:38,350
我们这儿需要人手  阿拉里克
We could use some help here, Alaric!

1228
01:42:40,370 --> 01:42:41,420
阿拉里克
Alaric!

1229
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:46,760
这儿肯定有别的出口吧
Come on, there must be some other way out of here, right?

1230
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:48,000
没有  西蒙
No, there isn't, Simon!

1231
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,650
我们快顶不住了
We can't hold them much longer!

1232
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:39,660
让开
Step away.

1233
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:42,810
快让开
Step away!

1234
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,230
克莱莉  这是哪个咒符
Clary, which rune is that?

1235
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,090
我也不知道  这个是...
I don't know, it's just...

1236
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:19,860
-这咒符我从来没见过  -真的吗
- I've never seen it before. - Really?

1237
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,280
书里没有
It's not in the book.

1238
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:25,960
咒符要消失了
It's fading.

1239
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:50,700
拿着  他们肯定是从哪里进来的
Here, they're coming in through somewhere.

1240
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:51,810
我得去拦住他们
I'm going to stop them.

1241
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,250
走吧
Come on.

1242
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:58,910
你们先走
You guys go.

1243
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,070
我们断后
We'll catch up.

1244
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:28,710
不要
No!

1245
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:50,550
他们是从屋顶进来的  这边来
They're coming from the dome. Come on.

1246
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:04,090
乔瑟琳
Jocelyn,

1247
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:07,320
你一直在我的心中
you never left my heart.

1248
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:09,560
让我带你回家吧
I've come to take you home.

1249
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,230
她哪也不去
She's not going anywhere.

1250
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,880
你是怎么到这儿的
How did you get up here?

1251
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:26,590
你拥有的能力超乎我的期望
You're even more powerful than I anticipated.

1252
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:27,910
离她远点
Get away from her.

1253
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,040
搞什么鬼
What the hell?

1254
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,870
先听听他说的吧
Just listen to what he has to say.

1255
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,940
事情跟你想的不一样
It's not what you think.

1256
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,590
终于
Finally...

1257
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,400
我的两个孩子团聚了
Both my children together.

1258
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,020
我的女儿
My daughter

1259
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,300
和我的儿子
and my son.

1260
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:55,740
对不起  克莱莉
I'm so sorry, Clary.

1261
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:58,900
我之前不知道
I didn't know.

1262
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,140
瓦伦莱在说谎
Valentine's lying.

1263
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:04,620
你父亲是迈克尔·威兰德
You're Michael Wayland's son.

1264
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,880
卢克说我哥哥在火灾中被烧死了
Luke said my brother is dead. He died in a fire,

1265
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,840
他们在废墟中发现了他的遗骸
and they found his remains in the ashes.

1266
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:11,590
我逃走的时候  带走了乔纳森
I took Jonathan with me when I ran.

1267
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,910
那副骸骨是一个被狼人杀死的孩子
The bones were of a child killed by wolves.

1268
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,560
我也希望这不是真的
I wish it wasn't true.

1269
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,710
她不愿相信你
She doesn't want to believe you

1270
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:28,820
因为她爱着你  乔纳森
because she is in love with you, Jonathan.

1271
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,880
我还以为你叫杰斯
I thought your name was Jace.

1272
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,520
杰斯是个昵称
Jace is a nickname.

1273
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:41,800
乔纳森·克里斯托弗
Jonathan Christopher...

1274
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:45,160
J.C.
J.C.

1275
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:49,370
杰斯
Jace.

1276
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:28,690
那有个控制杆
There's the lever.

1277
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,080
你去把屋顶关上  我来驱赶它们
You go close the dome and I'll hold them off.

1278
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,220
把圣杯拿出来  克莱莉
Take out the Cup, Clary.

1279
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:47,860
把我的圣杯拿出来
Take out my Cup!

1280
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:49,360
我要那个圣杯
I want that Cup!

1281
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,150
你说过  你不会伤害她
You said you wouldn't hurt her!

1282
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:54,430
够了
Enough!

1283
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:01,870
适可而止
That's enough.

1284
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:04,880
来吧
Now!

1285
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:11,650
它卡住了
It's stuck!

1286
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:12,350
把它关上
Close it!

1287
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,030
关不上
I can't!

1288
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,790
好像少了个零件
I think there's a piece missing!

1289
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:24,770
克莱莉
Clary!

1290
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,300
我真的需要圣杯
I really need this.

1291
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:11,020
妈妈
Mom?

1292
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,740
-去找其他人  -好的
- Find the others. - All right.

1293
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:14,430
你想去上面还是下面
All right, you want to take the upstairs or the down?

1294
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:19,470
我不太喜欢地下室
I'm not too crazy about the basement.

1295
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:27,780
我快挡不住它们了
I can't hold them back any longer!

1296
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,730
西蒙  快点
Simon, hurry!

1297
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,040
克莱莉
Clary!

1298
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,420
你好呀  加洛维先生
Hello, Mr. Garroway.

1299
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:56,290
看来你今天过得不怎样啊
Looks like you're having a rough day, eh?

1300
01:51:56,810 --> 01:52:01,610
我想此时此刻最仁慈的
I guess the humane thing to do in this situation

1301
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:03,270
就是结束你的生命
would be to put you down.

1302
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,080
但是你不是想看我变身吗
But you wanted to see me change.

1303
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,630
是啊
I do.

1304
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,470
起来
Get up!

1305
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:23,330
儿子  你还想打多久
So, boy, how far do you want to take this?

1306
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,540
打到最后一口气
To the end.

1307
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,520
西蒙
Simon!

1308
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,390
伊莎贝尔
Isabelle!

1309
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,940
靠着我
Lean on me.

1310
01:53:58,070 --> 01:54:00,050
离开这儿  快走
Get out! Go on!

1311
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,500
快离开这儿
Get out of here.

1312
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:05,410
走吧
Come on!

1313
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:10,420
快走
Go!

1314
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,560
有人跟我说你喜欢弹琴
Somebody told me that you like to play music.

1315
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,870
約翰·巴赫肯定为你骄傲
Johann would be very proud.

1316
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:35,430
你将死在拉杰尔的剑下
Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.

1317
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:37,430
住手
Stop!

1318
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:39,930
不然我把圣杯扔了
Or I'll drop it!

1319
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:41,760
不要做傻事
You don't want to do that.

1320
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:44,000
克莱莉  不要把圣杯给他
Don't give it to him, Clary.

1321
01:54:51,270 --> 01:54:52,990
你听我说
I need you to listen to me.

1322
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,140
作为你的父亲
As your father,

1323
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,640
我请求你
I'm begging you.

1324
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:05,060
如果你真是个好父亲
If you'd been a real dad,

1325
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:07,990
你会懂我  你会知道圣杯在哪
you'd know me well enough to imagine where the Cup is,

1326
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,230
你会知道我的内心将它置于何处
where my deepest thoughts are taking it.

1327
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,660
你一点都不了解我
You don't know the first thing about me.

1328
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,950
你不是我爸爸
You're not my dad...

1329
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,450
永远都不是
And you never will be.

1330
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,240
我向你保证  你再也不会见到我
I promise, you'll never have to see me again.

1331
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:31,120
谢谢你  克莱莉
Thank you, Clary.

1332
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,500
没有圣杯  我们会迷失
Without this Cup, we are lost.

1333
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:40,240
不是我们
Not "We."

1334
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:43,830
是你
You.

1335
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:09,750
克莱莉
Clary!

1336
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:15,480
-不要  不要放手  -我绝不放手
- No! Don't let go! - Never!

1337
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:19,360
拿着这个
Here!

1338
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:19,690
你还好吧
Are you okay?

1339
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,830
我不知道
I don't know.

1340
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:04,250
我明白你所做的一切
I understand why you did what you did.

1341
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:08,090
我原谅你
And I forgive you.

1342
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:11,290
我想告诉你
I want you to know,

1343
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:15,620
我守住了你的秘密
your secret's safe with me.

1344
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,460
-嗨  -你来了
-Hey. -Hey.

1345
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:12,320
你妈妈怎么样了
So, how's she doing?

1346
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,740
还算稳定
Stable.

1347
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,470
医生也不知道她喝了什么
The doctors don't know what she took,

1348
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:18,420
我们只能耐心等待
so we just have to wait.

1349
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,740
对不起
I'm sorry.

1350
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,330
我可能对待感情有些老土
I guess I'm an old romantic.

1351
01:59:26,570 --> 01:59:30,600
我总希望当我最终向对方表白时
I always hoped that when I finally said "I love you" to someone,

1352
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,540
她能给我同样的回应
she'd say the same thing back.

1353
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,120
你会找到那个人的
And that someone will.

1354
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:35,720
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1355
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,830
你累了
Hey, you're tired.

1356
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:48,650
去休息一下  我们照顾她
Go sleep, we'll take care of her.

1357
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,810
-好的  -过来
- Yeah. - Come on.

1358
01:59:59,030 --> 02:00:03,560
{\an8}Underneath the echoes

1359
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:08,100
{\an8}Buried in the shadows

1360
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:12,170
{\an8}To see your ghost

1361
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:21,980
{\an8}But you must know I'll be here waiting

1362
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:28,460
{\an8}Hoping Praying

1363
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:33,310
{\an8}That this light will guide you home

1364
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:38,190
{\an8}When you're feeling

1365
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:44,740
{\an8}lost I'll leave my love

1366
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:44,910
房间收拾得不错
I like what you've done with the place.

1367
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:48,960
{\an8}Hidden in the sun

1368
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,200
我施了点小魔法
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

1369
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:51,930
克莱莉  我们都担心你不回来了
Clary, we're afraid you're not coming back.

1370
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:55,060
{\an8}For when the darkness comes

1371
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,060
我现在很难待在你身边
It's just really hard to be around you right now.

1372
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:57,150
对我来说也很难
It's hard for me as well.

1373
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,820
但这不只是关乎我俩
But this is about more than us.

1374
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:05,030
你有惊人的天赋  我们需要你
You have an incredible gift, and we need you.

1375
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,490
我需要你
I need you.

1376
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,330
我不知道该怎么办
I just don't know.

1377
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,170
你记得我说过从没见过天使吗
Remember when I said I'd never seen an angel?

1378
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:20,840
我说了谎
Well, I lied.

1379
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:32,390
你仍然是我见过的最勇敢的凡人
You're still the bravest mundane I've ever met.

1380
02:01:36,850 --> 02:01:38,520
我不是凡人
I'm not a mundane.

1381
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:42,320
等等  杰斯
Wait, Jace!

1382
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,620
{\an8}I'll be here waiting

1383
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:52,920
{\an8}Hoping Praying

1384
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:47,910
你不必着急
You took your time.

1385
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:57,710
{\an8}That this light will guide you home

1386
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:56,790
你刚刚说需要我
You said you needed me.

1387
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:02,850
{\an8}When you're feeling

1388
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:03,210
你要好好保管它
You should keep that safe.

1389
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:09,110
{\an8}lost I'll leave my love

1390
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:04,420
是的
Yeah.

1391
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:07,760
我能不能...
Is it okay if I...

1392
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,140
我可以...
Do I...

1393
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:13,950
{\an8}Hidden in the sun

1394
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,390
-我能不能...-可以
- Is it okay if I... - Yeah.

1395
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:20,100
{\an8}For when the darkness comes

1396
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,900
克莱莉  我不相信
Look, Clary, I don't believe it.

1397
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,690
在我心里  我觉得那不是真的
It doesn't feel like the truth, not in my heart.

1398
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:24,400
我只是不知道应该再如何看这个世界
I just don't know how to look at the world anymore.

1399
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:27,280
我看不到街道  交通灯  汽车
I don't see streets and traffic lights and cars.

1400
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,320
我看到恶魔和天使
I see demons and angels.

1401
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,280
一切都不同了
Everything's different.

1402
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:33,160
世界还是这个世界
The world's the same.

1403
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,370
只是你不再是你了
You're the one who's different.

1404
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:44,210
记不记得霍奇说的那句话
Don't you remember what Hodge said?

1405
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,510
什么话
