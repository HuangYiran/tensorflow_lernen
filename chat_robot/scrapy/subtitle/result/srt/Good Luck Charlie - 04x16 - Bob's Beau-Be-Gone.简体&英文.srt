00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,000
好啊  大家
Howdy, Duncans.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,170
-嗨  -嗨  博

12
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,320
今天会是很棒的一天  小博
We got a big day ahead of us, little B.

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,180
我很期待  老鲍
I'm looking forward to it, big B.

14
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,850
很好  他们都有爱称了
Oh. Good. They have nicknames.

15
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,200
好了  该出门了
Yeah, I guess we should get going.

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,170
今天我们要去捅一个蜂窝
Taking down a hornet's nest today.

17
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,520
怪不得我都感受到空气中的兴奋了
So that's the excitement I feel in the air.

18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,910
听着  有个惊喜给你
Oh, hey. Got a surprise for you.

19
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,420
我准备让你拿着喷雾器
I am gonna let you hold the fogger.

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,400
请允许我拥抱你吧  先生
Permission to hug you, Sir.

21
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,880
哦  来吧  小博
Oh, bring it in, little B.

22
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,090
-好了  再见  各位  -回见  女孩们  
- All right. We'll see you guys. - See you girls.

23
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,730
再见
See ya.

24
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,960
我觉得你爸爸真的很喜欢这小子
I think your father really likes this one.

25
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,160
我知道
I know.

26
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,200
这真让我烦恼
It concerns me.

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,270
哦  我得去学校了
Well, I should probably get to school.

28
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,780
好的  过的愉快  小泰  
All right. Have a good day, little T.

29
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,940
你也一样  老艾
You too, big A.

30
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
生活搞得一团糟
<i>Today's all burnt toast </i>

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,970
就要迟到  爸爸在叫
<i>Running late, and dad jokes</i>

32
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,120
我左脚的鞋子有没有人看到
<i>Has anybody seen my left shoe</i>

33
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,050
我闭上眼  咬口早餐
<i>I close my eyes, take a bite</i>

34
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,650
跳上车子  放声大笑
<i>Grab a ride, laugh out loud</i>

35
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,980
哎呀  老爸  鞋子就在房顶上
<i>There it is up on the roof</i>

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,170
我也曾这样生活  我已经顺利走过
<i>I've been there, I've survived</i>

37
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,090
所以听取我的建议
<i>So just take my advice</i>

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,070
宝贝  不要放弃
<i>Hang in there, baby</i>

39
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,860
世界有很多疯狂无奈
<i>Things are crazy</i>

40
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,780
可是我知道你会有美好将来
<i>But I know your future's bright</i>

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,370
宝贝  不要放弃
<i>Hang in there, baby</i>

42
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,410
不要怀疑
<i>There's no maybe</i>

43
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,940
一切终会如你所愿
<i>Everything turns out all right</i>

44
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,470
生活有悲有喜
<i>Sure life is up and down</i>

45
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,010
但是请相信我  坚持就有好结果
<i>But trust me it comes back around</i>

46
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,870
你会喜欢将来的你
<i>You're gonna love</i> <i>who you turn out to be</i>

47
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,590
宝贝  不要放弃
<i>Hang in there, baby.</i>

48
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,590
查莉成长日记  第四季第十六集
Good Luck Charlie  S04E16  Bob's Beau-Be-Gone

49
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,830
埃米特  我们要付房租了
Emmett, we gotta pay our rent.

50
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,810
又要付
Again?

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,920
这算啥  现在每个月都得交了
What is that, like every month now?

52
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,190
-是的  -但我现在没钱
- Yeah. - But I don't have the money right now.

53
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,930
哦  你真是太不可靠了
Well, that is very irresponsible.

54
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,540
特别是  我也没有钱
Especially since I don't either.

55
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,640
-好吧  那我们该咋办  -不知道
- Well, what are we gonna do? - I don't know.

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,370
但是如果我们付不了房租
But if we can't pay the rent on this place we're

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,030
我们就得搬回去和爸妈住
gonna have to move back home with our parents.

58
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,630
你还可以搬回去  我就没地儿待了
Well maybe you can, but that's not an option for me.

59
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,920
为什么
Why not?

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,620
我爸妈搬家了  还不肯告诉我搬哪儿去了
My parents moved and they won't tell me where.

61
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,490
那  如果你想看他们怎么办
Well, what if you want to see them?

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,300
另找一个中立的地方见喽
Oh, we meet at a neutral location.

63
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,850
但是我得先走  这样确保我不能跟踪他们
But I have to leave first so that way I can't follow them.

64
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,050
好吧  如果我们付不了房租
Well, if we're having trouble paying the rent,

65
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,480
或许可以考虑找一个室友
maybe we could get a roommate.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
你是说  找个其他人住这儿
You mean like somebody else that would live here?

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,560
那就是室友  是的
That's what a roommate is, yes.

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,160
赞啊  好主意
Well, that's a great idea.

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,510
这样我们就可以每人支付三分之一的房租了
That way we'd each only have to pay one third of the rent.

70
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,960
等会儿  我算的对么
Wait, did I do that math right?

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,620
就好像我知道似的
Like I'd know.

72
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,160
-小心那个机械人  -我看见了
- Oh, watch out for that cyborg. - I see him.

73
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,980
灭了他
Got him.

74
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,790
你真冷酷  我就喜欢这点
You are ruthless. I love it.

75
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,770
-从我外婆那继承来的  -还是很喜欢
- I get it from my Grandma. - I still love it.

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,300
喂  孩子们
Hey, kids.

77
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
有什么事吗  邓肯阿姨 
Something wrong, Mrs. Duncan?

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,000
噢  又来了
Oh, here we go.

79
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,670
既然你问了
Well... since you asked.

80
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,100
看  我是个地方电视名人
See, I'm a local television personality.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
我在"早安丹佛"中出场过
I appear on "Good Morning Denver".

82
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,330
然后话匣子就打开了
And the flood gates are open.

83
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,330
但是他们最近都没让我上场过
But they haven't had me on lately,

84
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,230
这真让我失望
and it is really getting me down.

85
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,190
难道我的名人生涯就这么结束了吗
Is it over for me?

86
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,690
但我还有好多才艺没有带给观众们啊
While I still have so much left to give?

87
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,240
你知道  这真是一个好问题
You know, that's a really good question.

88
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,110
也许爸爸知道答案
Maybe Dad knows the answer to that.

89
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,990
爸  妈妈要过去了
Dad! Here comes Mom.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,380
好吧好吧  现在全是在说绿色杂货店了
Yeah yeah yeah. It's all about the Green Grocer.

91
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,160
他是这个月的新星
He's the flavor of the month.

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,780
我觉得他仅仅是靠运气
I think he just got lucky

93
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,840
就因"吃着西葫芦  穿着比基尼"这一句话
with that "Eat a zucchini, wear a bikini" Line.

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,940
噢  我外婆也看了那个部分
Oh, my Grandma saw that segment.

95
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,640
她还专门为此去买了西葫芦呢
And then she bought some zucchini.

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,410
她该不会还想
She's not thinking of...

97
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,430
比基尼  噢  千万不要
A bikini? Oh, I don't think so.

98
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,850
坚持住
Stay on top of that.

99
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,220
我明天也会有一段出场
I actually have a segment coming on tomorrow.

100
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,290
这是我这几个星期的第一次出场
It's my first one in weeks.

101
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,600
可是会不会成为最后一次啊
But will it be my last?

102
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,750
爸  妈妈的问题都成堆了
Dad, these questions from Mom are piling up!

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
好吧
Oh well.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,860
如果这真是我的最后一次  我想
If it is my last, I guess the

105
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,140
好消息就是我有更多的时间陪孩子们了
good news is I get to spend more time with my kids.

106
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
你的那一场是表演什么
What's your segment about?

107
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,230
嗯
Okay.

108
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,880
是一个能哄小孩子开心
It's about entertaining the

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,880
又能完成家务的妙招
little ones and also getting your housework done.

110
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,530
我所做的就是把毛巾折成了有趣的动物形状
What I do is I fold towels into whimsical animal shapes.

111
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,580
有很强的视觉效果
A lot of it is visual.

112
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,460
-这样  想我给你看看么  -好啊
- Here, want me to show you? - Sure.

113
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,760
好的  太棒了  我刚做了一个  你会喜欢它的
Okay, great. I just made one. You'll love it.

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,380
你出啥毛病了  我本以为你很冷酷的
What is wrong with you? I thought you said you were ruthless.

115
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,930
那是对机械人
With cyborgs.

116
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,500
-可是那是你妈  -有什么区别
- This is your Mom. - What's the difference?

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,600
看招
Ba-bam!

118
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,160
这是一只天鹅
It's a swan!

119
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,440
想要看看我是怎么做的吗
Do you want me to show you how?

120
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,610
来吧  小鬼们  我有一篮子的
Come on, guys. I've got a

121
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,340
毛巾和大把的时间
basket full of towels and nothing but time.

122
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
-嗨  -嗨  伙计们
- Hey. - Hey, guys.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,620
泰迪  今天发生了一件特别神奇的事情
Teddy, the most amazing thing happened today.

124
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,750
我第一次看见了骆驼蟋蟀
I saw my first camel cricket.

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,260
你得知道  这孩子是一个天才
You know, this kid is a natural.

126
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,320
我本以为那是洞穴蟋蟀
I thought it was a cave cricket.

127
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,500
哇  你当时肯定回头
Wow. Well, I hope you turned

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,230
给我爸一个轻蔑的"你错了"
to my Dad and gave him a big old "In your face!"

129
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,830
呃  不会啊  我们可是一队的
Yeah, we don't do that. We're a team.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,540
对  除非我们被臭鼬攻击了
Well, unless we're getting attacked by a skunk.

131
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,910
那还是大难临头各自飞吧
Then you're on your own.

132
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,740
不仅是出色的灭虫专家  还有很棒的幽默感
A great exterminator and a great sense of humor.

133
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,970
噢  别说啦
Oh, stop.

134
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,520
博  甜心  你已经得到工作了
Beau, honey, you got the job.

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
你不用再迎合他了
You can stop kissing up and

136
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,570
你可以像我们一样寻他开心了
start making fun of him like the rest of us.

137
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,050
你什么意思
What do you mean?

138
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,380
就是说  你不用再假装
It's just, you don't have to pretend to be

139
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,430
喜爱那些灭虫什么的东西了
fascinated with all of this exterminator stuff.

140
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,570
但是  我是真的喜欢啊
But I really am fascinated.

141
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,000
我都能想象这是在做我毕生的事业
I could see myself doing this as a career.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,220
你认真的吗
Seriously?

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,410
是啊  对  今天我不是去地下室了吗
Yeah. Um... today I was in the crawlspace, right?

144
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,580
-然后我发现了一只很大的老蜘蛛  -博  博
- And I found this big old spider... - Beau Beau...

145
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,360
就像我妈经常说的那样
As my Mom always says,

146
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,480
不管房子下面发生什么  就让它深埋在地下吧
what happens under the house stays under the house.

147
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,340
-好吧  我想我该走了  -好的
- All right. Well, I'd better go. - Okay.

148
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,910
我得回家洗个澡
I need to get home and get showered.

149
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,130
我们今天用来杀虫的东西可是有剧毒的
That stuff we were using today is highly toxic.

150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,860
你就不能在抱我之前就说吗
Could you have maybe told me that before the hug?

151
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,170
嗯  你大概也得去洗个澡了
Yeah, you're probably gonna have to shower too.

152
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,750
抱歉  甜心
Sorry, Sweetie.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
-嘿  博去哪儿啦  -他刚走
- Hey. Where's Beau? - Oh, he just left.

154
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,240
都没和我说再见就走了吗
Without saying good-bye?

155
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,630
爸  你明天就能见到他了
Dad, you'll see him again tomorrow...

156
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,650
在那些讨厌的狭小的封闭空间
In some disgusting little enclosure.

157
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,250
我告诉你  博真的是一个很好的孩子
I'm telling you. That Beau is a great kid.

158
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,310
而且大家都知道
And who knows.

159
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,020
你们俩在一起了  我以后
You two stick together, I could

160
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,560
就可以把我的事业交给他了
see passing the business down to him some day.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,130
爸  我们还没有交往多久呢
Dad, we haven't been dating for that long.

162
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,400
我知道  只是
I know. It's just...

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,580
这一个感觉很特别
This one feels special.

164
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,540
我有一个工程学的学位
So I have an engineering degree.

165
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,120
现在我正在攻读天体物理的博士学位
Now I'm working on my masters in astrophysics.

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,990
嗯  这都很好  布莱恩
Well, that's all well and good, Brian,

167
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,060
但是我们有个很严格的筛选程序
but we have a pretty strict screening process here.

168
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,200
所以我要问你一个很重要的问题
So let me ask you the big question.

169
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,420
你有
Do you have...

170
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,340
167美元吗
$167?

171
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,240
有啊
Yes.

172
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,430
好的  下一个问题
Okay. Follow-up question.

173
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,870
你下个月的这时候也有167美元吗
Will you have $167 this time next month?

174
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,980
-是的  -我们已经知道所有的信息了
- Yes. - I think we have all we need.

175
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,480
我很整洁  我很安静
I'm neat, I'm quiet.

176
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,010
那你对不整洁不安静的
And how do you feel about

177
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,530
室友怎么看
roommates who are neither neat nor quiet?

178
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,380
没关系  我只是需要一个住的地方
That's fine. I just need a place to live.

179
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,460
我们已经问过你关于167美元的问题了吗
And did we ask you about the $167 already?

180
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,490
刚刚问过了
A few times, yes.

181
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,770
好的  安迪  谢谢你过来
Okay, Andy. Thanks for coming over.

182
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,290
-我们会很快给你回复的  -好的
- We'll get back to you real soon. - Great.

183
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
嗯  看来选择已经很明显了
Well, seems to me the choice is obvious.

184
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,600
用脚想都知道
I'd say it's a no-brainer.

185
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,050
-同意  好样的  室友  -多谢
- I agree. Good job, roomie. - All right.

186
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,730
有一个新室友的生活一定很棒
It's gonna be nice having a new roommate.

187
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,170
多了一个帮我们做家务的家伙
One more guy to help with chores.

188
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,180
-多了一个帮我们购物的家伙  -还有最好的是
- One more guy to help with shopping. - And the best part is...

189
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,410
我们终于可以实现我们的梦想了
We can finally realize our dream.

190
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,650
叠罗汉
The human pyramid.

191
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,130
好了  这样听起来怎样
Okay, how does this sound?

192
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,510
"亲爱的台长 在最近的鸟妈妈节目中
"Dear station manager Mama Bird's

193
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,030
把毛巾做成动物的那一段真是太“巾采”了
recent segment on towel animals was towel-rific".

194
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,630
你在做什么
What are you doing?

195
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,990
我们在给"早安丹佛"写信
We're writing letters to "Good

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
这样他们就会把老妈留在台里
Morning Denver" So they'll keep mommy on TV,

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,210
重点是她就不会再来烦我们了
and most importantly away from us.

198
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,300
信是什么
What's a letter?

199
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,400
就是用一种又贵又慢的方式去寄电子邮件
It's an expensive way to slowly send an e-mail.

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,180
好了  我们有十封信了
Okay. We have 10 letters.

201
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,990
好的  让我们把这些放到信里
Okay. Let's get these things in the mail

202
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,450
这样它们会在妈妈的节目播出第二天寄到台里
so they'll arrive the day after Mom's story airs.

203
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,270
查莉  我想玩换装游戏了
Charlie, I'm ready to play dress-up.

204
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,850
来了
Coming.

205
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
希望你的信有效果
This better work.

206
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,890
小博
Beau Jr.

207
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,610
你吃得像你鲍伯爷爷一样
You eat just like grandpa Bob.

208
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,410
你有这么多牙齿了
And you have just as many teeth.

209
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,330
好啦
Yeah.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,180
-嗨  亲爱的  -嗨  甜心
- Hey, darling. - Hi, honey.

211
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,700
还有你  小宝贝  
And baby boy.

212
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,120
你知道  在漫长一天的杀虫工作后
You know, there's nothing I'd rather see after a

213
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,650
除了你这美丽的新娘  我什么都不想看了
long day of killing bugs than my beautiful bride.

214
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,980
噢  你在做饭
Oh, you're cooking.

215
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,910
是啊  生活难道不是很有意思吗
Yeah. Isn't it funny how life turned out?

216
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,790
我像我妈一样做饭  你像我爸一样工作
I cook like my Mom, and you work like my Dad.

217
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,190
但是除了这点  我和他完全不同
But other than that, me and him are pretty different.

218
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,330
你今天掉了更多的头发
You lose more hair today?

219
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,750
是啊
Yeah.

220
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,010
但我背后会长回来更多的
But more came in on my back.

221
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,770
哦  这真好
Oh. That's nice.

222
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
你不会相信今天我工作时发生了什么
You won't believe what happened at work today.

223
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,690
又是一个除虫故事吗
Is this gonna be a bug story?

224
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,690
是啊  本来是讲除虫的  但是后面有一只野猫的戏份
Yeah, it starts out as one, but then a feral cat comes into it.

225
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,630
我好像剧透太早了
I'm getting ahead of myself.

226
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,870
哦  甜心  慢慢讲
Oh, honey, take your time.

227
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,630
我哪儿也不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

228
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,550
永远
Ever.

229
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,080
那是在约翰逊家的地下室
There I was in the Johnson's crawlspace.

230
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,470
很平常的一个星期二
Ordinary Tuesday...

231
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,230
或者说  我以为很平常
Or so I thought.

232
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,910
直到我看见了木屑
Yeah. Until I saw the sawdust.

233
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,490
这意味着有白蚁
That always means termites.

234
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,430
是啊  通常是这样
Well, almost always.

235
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,060
天呐  我敢说这地方从未这么干净过
Man, I don't think the place has ever been this clean before.

236
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,160
是啊  真是高效的十五分钟
Yeah, that was a rough 15 minutes.

237
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,130
肯定是咱们的新室友来了
Ah. That must be our new roommate.

238
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,780
-嗨伙计们  -嗨
- Hi, guys. - Hi.

239
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,680
呃  安迪怎么来了
Uh, what's Andy doing here?

240
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,000
他是咱们的新室友啊
He's our new roommate.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,260
他不是啊  布莱恩才是咱们的新室友
No, he's not. Brian's our new roommate.

242
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,800
-嘿  -我可不这么认为
- Hey. - I don't think so.

243
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,990
两位  进来吧
Guys, come on in.

244
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,370
我们要在走廊谈一小会儿
We're gonna have a quick discussion out in the hallway.

245
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,490
和你没关系的
Not about you.

246
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,430
和你有点儿关系
A little about you.

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,680
你不是说这事儿用脚想都行吗
I thought you said this was a no-brainer.

248
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,400
是啊  选那个矮个儿
Yeah, to pick the short guy.

249
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,670
他可是我们叠罗汉完美的顶端
He's the perfect top for the pyramid.

250
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,860
选那个高个儿咱们的叠罗汉会更高
The pyramid will be higher with the tall guy.

251
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,440
也许咱们不该任何事情都从叠罗汉的角度考虑
Maybe we shouldn't have based everything on the pyramid.

252
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,390
难以置信这几周我就上了这么一回电视
I can't believe this is the first time I've been on TV in weeks.

253
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,070
不对劲啊老妈  这事儿不科学
It's not right, Mom. It's just not right.

254
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,050
好  开始了
Okay. Here we go.

255
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,500
早安丹佛  早安菲尔
Good Morning, Denver. And good morning, Phil.

256
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,440
朗达  和你一起每早都安
It's always a good morning when I'm with you, Rhonda.

257
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,750
不得不说  我挺喜欢菲尔和朗达
I've got to say, I like Phil and Rhonda.

258
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,850
在幕后他们两个都受不了彼此
Behind the scenes, those two can't stand each other.

259
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,050
不是吧
No!

260
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,910
是的
Yes.

261
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,770
菲尔和朗达原来是一对情侣
Gabe, Phil and Rhonda used to be a couple.

262
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,470
直到朗达决定做绿色杂货店节目的情人
That is until Rhonda decided to give the Green Grocer a squeeze.

263
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,010
下面我们要报道几条重大新闻
We're getting word now of some breaking news.

264
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,030
请看I-70州际公路直播  在这里我们的直升机
Let's go live to I-70, where our news chopper

265
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,020
正在追踪拍摄一场高速的警方追捕
is following a high speed police pursuit.

266
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,060
什么  不要啊  人家要看妈咪
What? No, we want to see Mom!

267
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,570
盖比  亲爱的  别慌
Gabe. Honey, relax.

268
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,360
没关系的  我是压轴出场的
It's okay. I'm on towards the end.

269
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,210
只要这追捕不持续太久  就没问题
As long as this doesn't go on too long, we'll be fine.

270
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,640
这已经成为
This is now becoming one

271
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,260
丹佛史上历时最长的警方追捕
of the longest car chases in Denver history.

272
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
太糟糕了
Oh. This is bad.

273
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,410
这真是太糟糕了
This is really really bad.

274
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,790
怎么了
What's wrong?

275
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,300
是这样的  明天电视台会收到一沓儿信
Well, tomorrow the station's gonna get a bunch of letters

276
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,650
说他们如何喜欢老妈的故事  可是节目没有播出
saying how much they loved Mom's story which isn't on.

277
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,980
太糟糕了
This is bad.

278
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,920
这确实很糟糕
This is really bad.

279
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,050
这追捕还没结束吗
Is this chase still on?

280
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,990
是的  来人啊
Yes. Somebody!

281
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,890
让他靠边停车  爆他的轮胎
Pull him over, flatten his tires.

282
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,630
我们想看毛巾动物
We want to see towel animals!

283
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,060
盖比甜心  没事的
Gabe, honey, it's okay.

284
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,620
我们能挺过去的
We'll get through this.

285
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,250
如果他们今天不播我那段的话
If they don't put my segment on today,

286
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,540
总有一天会播的
they'll put it on another day.

287
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,850
不行  必须今天播
No, it has to be today.

288
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,160
看起来他靠边停车  举手投降了
Looks like he's pulling over, and he's putting his hands up.

289
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,530
看起来这场追逐已经和平结束了
Guess this chase has come to a peaceful ending.

290
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,480
好耶  终于结束了
Yes. Finally.

291
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,290
好了  我们还有段时间播另外一段
Well, we have time for one more segment.

292
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,780
我们把最好的留到了最后
And we saved the best for last.

293
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,170
所以接下来请收看大家的最爱  绿色杂货店
So let's hear from everybody's favorite, the Green Grocer.

294
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,050
你在逗我吗
Oh, come on!

295
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,680
-嘿亲爱的  -嘿
- Hey, darling. - Hey.

296
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,500
你怎么了
How are you?

297
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,440
我没事  就是做了个疯狂的梦
I'm okay, I guess. I had this crazy dream.

298
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,970
是关于未来  我们生活在了这里
It was the future, and we were living here.

299
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,380
你接管了我爸的事业
You inherited my Dad's business

300
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,870
还讲了些疯狂的除虫故事
and you were telling these crazy bug stories.

301
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,960
好有趣啊
That's funny.

302
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,840
而且你还秃顶
And you were bald.

303
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,030
这就不有趣了
That's not funny.

304
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,710
听着  我们坐下来好吗
Listen, can we sit?

305
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,550
有些事情我得跟你谈谈
I got something I need to talk to you about.

306
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,470
好吧
Yeah.

307
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,890
怎么了
What's going on?

308
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
拉尔夫・休斯死了
Ralph Hughes died.

309
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
噢不
Oh no.

310
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,500
谁是拉尔夫・休斯啊
Who's Ralph Hughes?

311
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,470
我不知道啊
I don't know.

312
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,740
好吧  很庆幸我们是为这事儿坐下来
Well, I'm really glad we sat down for this.

313
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,310
不  我只是没见过他而已
No, I mean I just never met him.

314
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,960
他本来是我家乡的除虫师
He was the exterminator back home in Hollow Rock.

315
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,350
也就是说这个职位有空档
Which means there's a job opening

316
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,750
而且如果我想要的话就是我的了
for an exterminator and it's mine if I want it.

317
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,800
我祖母打电话来
My Grandma called.

318
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,500
她说如果我接下这份工作回家去
She said if I take this job and come home,

319
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,870
她会支付我上夜校的费用
she'll pay for me to go to college at night.

320
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,510
那么你是在说  你要回田纳西去吗
So what are you saying? Are you going back to Tennessee?

321
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,950
我也不知道该如何回绝
I don't know how I can turn this down.

322
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,090
你看  我也不想说什么的
Look, I didn't want to say anything but...

323
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,400
可我真的有些想家了
I've been real homesick.

324
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,280
我喜欢给你爸爸工作可是
I like working for your Dad and all but...

325
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,780
泰迪
Teddy...

326
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,690
你是唯一能把我留在丹佛的人
The only thing that would keep me in Denver is you.

327
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,150
听着 博
Look, Beau...

328
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,490
我也不想让你走
I don't want you to go...

329
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,740
可我不愿成为你的阻碍
But I'm not gonna stand in your way.

330
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,950
那么
So...

331
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,630
是时候说再见了
This is good-bye?

332
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,450
我想是这样的
Yeah, I guess so.

333
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,370
你是个特别的女孩  泰迪
You're a special girl, Teddy.

334
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,320
我会一直想念你的
I'm gonna miss you a ton.

335
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,630
我也会想念你的
I'm gonna miss you too.

336
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,160
孩子们
Hey, guys.

337
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,170
怎么一脸悲伤的样子
Why the sad faces?

338
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,470
现在该是最艰难的时刻了
Now comes the hard part.

339
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,890
换人啦
Rotate.

340
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,730
布莱恩  你听见叮了没  叮一声我们就轮流换人啦
Brian, you heard the ding. After the ding, we rotate.

341
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,010
我还没吃完呢
I'm not done eating yet.

342
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,970
我不管 去厕所解决吧
I don't care. Take it to the bathroom.

343
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,830
这样多不卫生
That's not sanitary.

344
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,600
这样安排真不错
And the system works.

345
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,680
嘿PJ  你介不介意我
Hey PJ, you mind trading

346
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,570
用厕所时光换点儿你的座椅时光
me some bathroom time for some chair time?

347
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,400
规矩是这样的  叮 换 叮 换
The system is ding, move, ding, move.

348
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,420
除此之外没别的
There are no tack-ons.

349
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,160
-安迪  -别看我
- Andy? - Don't even look at me.

350
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,400
闪啦
Rotate.

351
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,060
埃米特  去厕所
Emmett, bathroom.

352
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,740
为啥  我很干净而且刷过牙  我根本不用去
Why? I'm clean, I'm brushed and I don't have to go.

353
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,460
不关我事  我们有规矩的
Not my problem. We have a system.

354
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,860
这规矩真愚蠢  我都看三个剧的开头了
The system's stupid. I've seen the beginnings of three shows.

355
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,870
却连一个剧的结局都不知道
I don't know how any of them end.

356
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,330
是谁从牙膏管的中间开始挤的
Who's squeezing the toothpaste tube from the middle?

357
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,550
我浪费了一半的厕所时光去弄好它
I wasted half my bathroom time trying to fix this.

358
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,880
PJ我能不能和你在走廊说句话
PJ, can I talk to you in the hallway please?

359
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,940
没问题
Sure.

360
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,550
你们俩继续听叮换人  我们去去就回
You guys keep moving on the dings, okay? We'll catch up.

361
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,790
换人啦
Rotate.

362
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,570
-这样下去不行  -是啊 你说的没错
- This isn't working. - Yeah, you're right.

363
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,830
咱们得弄走一个
We have to get rid of somebody.

364
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,950
-我选布莱恩  -我选安迪
- I pick Brian. - I pick Andy.

365
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,200
重新选
Re-vote.

366
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,690
-布莱恩  -安迪
- Brian. - Andy.

367
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,350
-重选  -不行啊伙计
- Re-vote. - No, man.

368
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,860
在我看来  只有一个方式解决这个问题了
As I see it, there's only one possible way to solve this.

369
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,510
我们离开这里
We're out of here.

370
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,380
没错  我们要找自己的地盘
Yeah. We're getting our own place.

371
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,020
好吧  两个方式
Well, two ways.

372
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,230
我知道现在你很难过
I know it's hard right now...

373
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,430
但是会有其他灭虫师的
But there will be other exterminators.

374
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,270
不
No.

375
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,850
都比不上博
Not like Beau.

376
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,590
他很特别的
He was special.

377
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,930
你会好起来的  我保证
You'll be okay, I promise.

378
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,990
你不明白啦
You don't understand.

379
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,170
没人会明白的
Nobody understands.

380
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,320
我以为他就是那个人呢
I thought he was the one.

381
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,190
可是  这不一定就是永别啊
Well, this doesn't have to be good-bye forever.

382
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,250
你可以视频聊天
You could video chat.

383
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,290
我不会视频聊天
I don't know how to do that.

384
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,280
我教你啊
I'll teach you.

385
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,500
真的吗
You will?

386
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,150
当然啦
Of course I will.

387
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,560
乖
Come here.

388
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,340
过来
Come here.

389
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,200
为什么
Why?

390
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,980
我要给你一个拥抱
I want to give you a hug.

391
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,520
我需要更多信息量
I'm gonna need more information.

392
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,520
盖比  我刚刚和电视台经纪人通过电话
Gabe, I just got off the phone with the station manager.

393
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,560
他们收到了一大沓信
Yeah, they received a whole

394
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,420
关于我没播放的节目
bunch of letters about my segment that never aired.

395
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,660
我知道是你写的
And I know you wrote them.

396
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,440
-你知道  -是这两件事告诉我的
- You do? - Two things tipped me off.

397
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
第一  昨天看节目时
One, you were acting

398
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,960
你的表现非常奇怪
really weird when you were watching the show.

399
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,100
第二  你居然看节目了
And two, you were watching the show.

400
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,160
-你不生气吗  -不 亲爱的
- And you're not mad? - No, honey.

401
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,180
恰恰相反
Just the opposite.

402
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,090
我真不敢相信
I can't believe you would go to

403
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,050
为了帮妈咪延续电视生涯  你竟然揽下这么多麻烦
all that trouble to help your mommy's TV career.

404
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,710
这就是我所做的
That's exactly why I did it.

405
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,740
事实上  电视台经理非常受感动
In fact, the station manager was so impressed

406
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,300
他想要我做一期关于咱俩亲情的节目
he wants me to do a segment on our relationship.

407
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,600
他  他想干嘛
He... he wants what now?

408
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,550
讲述我们有多么的亲密
It'll be all about how close we are.

409
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,630
我要叫它  “我的宝贝盖比”
I'm gonna call it "My baby Gabey".

410
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,000
我们要穿配套的衣服
We're gonna wear matching outfits.

411
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,040
你是说真的吗  老妈
Are you for real, Mom?

412
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,610
还是在整我什么的
Or are you just messing with me or something?

413
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,820
我为啥要整我的宝贝盖比呢
Why would I mess with my baby Gabey?

414
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,550
因为你写那些信的真正目的
Because the real reason you wrote the letters

415
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,990
是把我赶出咱们家咩
was to get me out of the housey wousey?

416
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,750
-查莉告诉你的吧  -她像小鸟一样唱出来嘀
- Charlie told you? - She sang like a birdy wordy.

417
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,960
是这样的查莉  博搬回田纳西了
Well, Charlie, Beau moved back to Tennessee.

418
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,860
而且  尽管他
And even though he's only

419
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,990
才离开几天  我已经在想念他了
been gone a few days, I already miss him.

420
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,530
当然了  没有老爸那么想念
Of course, not as much as Dad does.

421
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,070
哇哦
Wow!

422
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,360
一个满是黄蜂的窝
A nest full of yellow jackets?!

423
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,870
喔噢
Whoa!

424
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,870
干的漂亮啊  小博
Good kill, little B.

425
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,630
是啊  名师出高徒嘛
Yeah, well, I learned from the best.

426
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,170
泰迪在吗
Is Teddy around?

427
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,700
呃  不在
Uh, nope.

428
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,720
还没回家呢  听着
No, not home yet. Um, hey, listen.

429
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,420
让我给你讲讲今天看见的黑寡妇蜘蛛
Let me tell you about this black widow spider I saw today.

430
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,760
她身上那个卵袋简直有垒球那么大
She had an egg sack on her the size of a softball.

431
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,780
我想这次给你的建议是
I guess my advice to you would be...

432
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,330
还是和一个怕虫子的男生约会吧  如果不是的话
Date a guy who's afraid of bugs because if not...

433
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,960
那么
Well...

434
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,840
祝你好运咯  小查莉
Good luck, Charlie.

435
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,330
你是个什么玩意
What are you supposed to be?

436
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,070
多明显啊  一只毛巾龙虾
A towel lobster, obviously.

437
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,310
呃  我没看出来
Huh! I'm not getting that.

438
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,710
也许更像螃蟹
Crab, maybe.

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,130
那么  你应该是什么
Well, what are you supposed to be?

440
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,890
我显然是只毛巾大象
I'm obviously a towel elephant.

441
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,680
叠得多像啊
And a pretty good one.

442
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,050
真的吗
Really?

443
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,470
我怎么看着像食蚁兽
I'm getting more anteater.

444
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,780
你们消停会儿行不行
Could you guys keep it down?

445
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,600
你是什么啊
Who are you supposed to be?

446
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,760
毛巾啊
A towel.

447
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,760
而且以此为荣  我才不需要那些装饰
And proud of it. I don't need all the bells and whistles.

448
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,040
听见了吗孩子  做自己才是最棒的
Hear that kids? It's okay to just be who you are.

449
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,120
你现在还喜欢做自己吗
How do you like who you are now?
