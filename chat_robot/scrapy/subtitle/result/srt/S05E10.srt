1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,500
星际之门  前情回顾
Previously on Stargate Atlantis

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,070
我知道你们有个提议
Sir, I understand you had proposals.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,200
我们有个基因治疗方案
We've come up with a gene therapy

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,070
能使幽灵族的DNA发生改变
that alters wraith dna.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,410
我认为我们可以实现
we think we can make it

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,500
这样你们就不用再以人类为食了
so that you will never need to feed on humans again.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
接着
Here.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,300
尝尝这个
Try this.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,030
他是杰纳斯
his name was janus.

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,170
因果关系不能轻视
causality is not to be treated so lightly.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,370
没有人轻视它
no one's treating it lightly.

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,870
你就是
you are.

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,600
你坚持要进行你那实验
you are insistent on continuing the experiment.

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,100
我们曾下令要求你停止那项活动
we order you to cease these activities.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
这么小题大做有必要么
i don't know what all the fuss is about.

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,670
要是每次有人来
if we do this every time

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,730
都这么折腾
someone comes for a visit,

18
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,720
我们什么活儿都干不成
we'd never get any work done.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,180
我们只是到门口见见他
we're just meeting him at the gate.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,450
可不是去门口见他那么简单
we're not just meeting him at the gate.

21
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,780
帮他对那数据库进行研究
i've been pulled from my regular duties

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,420
已经够折腾我的了
to help him with his database "research".

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,920
我还有事儿要忙  你又不是不知道
i've got stuff on the go, you know--

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,780
重要的  对于人类的进化
important, vital projects

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,880
这可是至关重要的事儿
for the betterment of the human race.

26
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,220
事实上每个人都有
apparently there are other people

27
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,280
跟你一样重要的事情要忙
doing equally important work, rodney,

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,850
你难以相信那有多难
as hard as that is to believe.

29
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,120
令人振奋的一天
an exciting day.

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,220
的确
absolutely.

31
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,250
传送准备就绪
he's ready to beam.

32
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,780
很好
very well.

33
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,420
杰克森博士  欢迎回到亚特兰蒂斯
dr. jackson, welcome to atlantis.

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,420
谢谢  伍尔希先生  能回来真好
thank you, mr. woolsey. it's great to be back.

35
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,420
谢帕德中校  罗德尼
colonel sheppard, rodney...

36
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,750
没问题  当然没有  你有什么打算么
oh, sure, sure. what have you got planned?

37
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,850
对毫无意义的古人历史事件的
an exciting exploration

38
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,520
一次进动人心的探险?
of insignificant ancient historical events?

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,020
不  不是那么简单
no, not quite.

40
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,250
有个叫杰纳斯的古人  你们俩应该都很熟悉
i'm sure you're both familiar with the ancient named janus?

41
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,380
那个发明家?
the inventor?

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,350
对  他是带头的科学家
yes, he was the lead scientist

43
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,320
骨子里还有些叛逆
and apparently a bit of a renegade.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,780
我最近一直在研究他的日志
yeah, and i've been over all his logs.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,750
瞧瞧  这就是我们的工作成果
look, this is work we've done already.

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,980
我敢肯定我已经掌握了一些信息
i'm pretty sure i have information

47
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,880
能带我们找到他的秘密实验室
that could lead us to his secret lab.

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,380
秘密实验室?
secret lab?

49
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,080
是的  一个由他创立  后来被用于
yes, a place where he conducted and subsequently hid

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,320
藏匿他大部分非法研究的场所
a significant portion of his unauthorized research.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,980
如果没猜错的话  就在这里
and if i'm correct, it's right here...

52
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,880
在亚特兰蒂斯
on atlantis.

53
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,550
我对杰纳斯的数据库
i've been over janus' database entries

54
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,750
进行了地毯式检索
with a fine-tooth comb.

55
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,080
我从没见到有涉及秘密实验室的地方
i never saw any mention of a secret lab.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,650
杰纳斯做了很多工作
janus was doing a lot of work

57
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,820
但都没获得古人委员会的批准
that wasn't exactly approved by the ancient council,

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,120
不难想象
so it's not hard to imagine

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,850
他也不会把此全部记录在
he wouldn't include a full accounting

60
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,520
这种对外公开的数据库里
in this very public database.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,480
你在官方的报告中
do you include all of your research

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,620
提交了所有的研究细节?
in your official reports?

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,550
有话直说
just get to the point.

64
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,880
在他的记录里从未涉及过这个
he never talked about it in his entries,

65
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
但是杰纳斯的同代人中
but several of janus' peers

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,020
有人怀疑他有
suspected he had

67
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,880
"一整个碉堡的自由想法和实验"
a "bastion of unfettered thought and experimentation,"

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,520
同时他的一个情人也表示
or as one of his lovers put it--

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,620
他有情人?
he had lovers?

70
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,280
"城市墙壁中孤独的小岛"
"an isle of solitude within the city walls."

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
这可能是说他不善交际
could just mean he was hard to talk to.

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
过去还有人一直这么说我呢
people say things like that about me all the time.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,020
所有的作者对于
none of these writers had any idea

74
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,950
秘密实验室在哪里都毫无头绪
where the lab could be,

75
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,850
但他的一个年轻的助手
but one of his young assistants

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,080
回忆说有一天看他走进一条走廊
recalls a day where janus turned a corner down a hallway.

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,350
"今天我看到杰纳斯走进那条走廊"
"today i saw janus in the hallway..."

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,620
这真是重要的转折啊(讽刺)
there's a real page-turner.

79
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,750
出于好奇他就跟了上去
he chased after him with a question,

80
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,980
但当他转到走廊上  发现杰纳斯失踪了
but when he rounded the corner, janus was gone.

81
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,520
那条走廊是个死胡同
the hallway was a dead end.

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,650
他就那么消失了  我觉得他是进了秘密实验室
he had seemingly disappeared, i think, into his secret lab.

83
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,880
那  他的助手有没有提到
well, did this assistant happen to mention...

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,550
哪条走廊是吗  他说了
...which hallway? yes. he does.

85
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,950
代达罗斯号装载完了供给品之后
as soon as the daedalus unloads its supplies,

86
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,550
我们尽快出发
we'll be heading off

87
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,550
去跟托德他们会面
to meet up with todd and one of his hives.

88
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,320
你觉得他真的会露面么
you really think he's going to show up, huh?

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,350
还让你的人在他们身上
and let you guys try out dr. keller's gene therapy

90
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,320
试验凯勒博士的基因治疗
on a few of his guys?

91
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,220
放心  我们对这次谈判有把握
well, we held up our end of the deal.

92
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,650
我们可以让他凭借泰勒
we let him use teyla

93
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,420
去掌控幽灵母舰的联盟
to take control of an alliance of wraith hives.

94
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,120
这就是我想说的  他倒是如愿以偿了
that's what i'm saying, he's got what he wants.

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,150
我得跟你一块去
i should go with you,

96
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,980
因为我跟托德还有过牵扯
because i have a relationship with todd--

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,150
这正是我不让你去的原因
that is precisely why i don't want you there.

98
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,920
这次的任务说白了就是一场谈判
this mission is basically going to be a negotiation,

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,980
对于托德
and todd has, well...

100
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,120
对手是我的话  他的精神包袱会更轻些
less baggage with me than he does with you.

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,620
我不是说不让你领队
i'm not saying you shouldn't take the lead--

102
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,420
你是这里的副指挥官  上校
you're second in command here, colonel.

103
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,950
我知道我的前任对于
i know my predecessors played fast and loose

104
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,450
组织的一些规矩睁只眼闭只眼
with many of the rules set forth by the i.o.a.,

105
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,350
但是协议上很明确的表示
but protocol plainly states

106
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,850
在少数情况下
that in the rare instance

107
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,420
如果我必须要离开亚特兰蒂斯
where i am required to leave atlantis,

108
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,220
你得留下
you stay put.

109
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,750
在我回来之前这里你管
you're in command here until i get back.

110
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,320
明白吗
understood?

111
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,280
好吧
okay.

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,180
我不在的时候小心别出乱子
try not to blow her up while i'm gone.

113
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,750
我可不敢保证
no promises.

114
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,450
好了  这应该是最后一个了
yeah, i think this should be the last of it.

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,050
我正要走呢
i was just leaving.

116
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,380
我知道
yeah, i know.

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,250
来  我帮你拿
here, let me get that.

118
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,580
谢谢
thanks.

119
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,380
你要去代达罗斯号了?
so you're going on this daedalus thing?

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,780
谢谢
thank you.

121
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,280
这也是没办法的事儿
i kind of have to.

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,050
我是这里唯一懂得这种疗法的人
i'm the one that'll be administering the treatment...

123
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,080
这个我们之前也有谈到过
if, you know, we ever get to that point.

124
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,380
对
right.

125
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,550
我觉得我有必要跟你一块去
i think i should come with you on this.

126
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,480
真的  为什么
really? why?

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,620
我信不过那些家伙
i don't really trust these guys.

128
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,380
你信不过托德和幽灵族
you don't trust todd and his wraith

129
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,680
还是说代达罗斯号上的人员
or the entire crew of the daedalus

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,250
你担心我出事儿  想来保护我?
to protect me if something goes wrong?

131
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,680
不好说
i don't know.

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,180
可能两者都有吧
both, i guess.

133
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,350
什么
what?

134
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,180
没什么
nothing.

135
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,020
想说就说吧
what?

136
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
没什么  真没什么
nothing, nothing.

137
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,320
有你陪着感觉挺好的
it'd be great to have the company.

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,220
再见  罗德尼  祝我们好运
bye, rodney. wish us luck.

139
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,950
好运
good luck.

140
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,380
你说"我们"是什么意思
what do you mean, "us"?

141
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,580
罗德尼  你...
rodney... you, uh...?

142
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
那儿是不是有条水管?
is that a water line up there?

143
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,150
是的  在我们到这里的第一年
yeah, this section of the city flooded

144
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,420
这里就被淹了
the first year we were here.

145
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,480
有利用价值的东西
anything salvageable

146
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,950
都被转移到了主塔上
got moved to the main tower.

147
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,350
这里地处偏僻  看起来有希望
it's remote. that's promising.

148
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,580
在他到秘密实验室的时候
he wouldn't want anyone around

149
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,050
肯定不希望有人在附近的
when he came in and out of his lab.

150
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,080
真像个蝙蝠洞
like the bat cave.

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,350
是阿  就像个蝙蝠洞
yes... just like the bat cave.

152
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,150
到目前为止还没发现什么独特的东西
i'm not picking up anything unusual...

153
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,180
这儿曾经有东西
something used to be attached here.

154
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,950
嗯  这里也有
hmm. and here...

155
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,920
这儿还有
and another one.

156
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,420
知道是什么吗
any idea what they are?

157
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,150
好像是粗制的烛台插槽
looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.

158
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,820
嗯  问题是烛台在哪里
right. well, where are the sconces?

159
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,220
我怎么知道
i don't know.

160
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,320
可能负责装修的人突然改变了主意
maybe the decorator changed his mind.

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,080
你刚才说在洪水之后
you said after the flood,

162
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
所有有价值的东西
anything worth salvaging

163
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
都被转移到了主塔上
was moved to the main tower.

164
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,850
那但愿你能告诉我你有记录
now, please tell me you kept detailed records

165
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,420
关于那些东西都在哪儿发现的
of what was found and where.

166
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,980
我们有没有详细记录?  你当我是谁啊
did we keep detailed records? who are you talking to here?

167
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,120
这儿  这就是那个走廊
there. that's the hallway.

168
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,980
能放大点么
can you zoom in there?

169
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,420
这儿  这儿就是固定灯的地方
there. there are your light fixtures.

170
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,450
肯定是在被淹的时候
must have been knocked loose

171
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,320
被水泡松了
during the flood.

172
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,150
有可能
possibly.

173
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,580
你们抢救出了这些  对吧?
but you salvaged them, right?

174
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,480
这是在洪水期间掉落的灯具
they're lights that fell during a flood--

175
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,550
就顺顺我  好不好
just humor me, okay?

176
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,520
我觉得我们快有戏了
i think we're onto something.

177
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,920
好吧
all right.

178
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,150
在这儿呢
here they are.

179
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,950
找到了
i've got 'em.

180
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,820
奇怪
that's odd.

181
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,450
将三盏灯插亮时
each of these three lights made a different tone

182
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,620
它们发出三种不同的音调
when i plugged them in.

183
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,850
这儿有过类似的事吗
does that usually happen around here?

184
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,220
不常有  没有
not usually, no.

185
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,450
这些灯左碰右撞
they've been banged around a lot,

186
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,380
又被水淹了几天
underwater a few days.

187
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,380
估计是坏了
maybe they're just broken.

188
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,380
不  这是个谜题
no, it's a puzzle.

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,320
我想应该通过特定的顺序
i think we need to activate these

190
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,620
可将其激活
in a specific order.

191
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,880
三位数密码?
a 3-digit code?

192
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
你知道那破解起来有多容易?
you know how easy that would be to break?

193
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,820
也就6种可能
there's only 6 variations.

194
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,950
也许要几次组合
maybe activate them a number of times

195
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,520
才可以激活它们
in a specific order.

196
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,050
这三个音符有没有让你想到什么
i don't suppose you recognize any of these three notes?

197
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,320
这让我想到
like, does it remind me

198
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,580
杰纳斯最喜欢的布莱恩·伊诺音乐(音节超级少的)
of janus' favorite brian eno track?

199
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,420
不可能  绝没那么好运
no. no such luck.

200
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,920
杰纳斯的助理说他嗖的一下
janus' assistant said he disappeared pretty quickly

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,820
就从走廊消失了
down the hallway,

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,780
因此密码肯定不长
so it can't be a long code.

203
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,150
或许就是简单的3个连续音
maybe it's as simple as 3 tones in a row.

204
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,180
慢慢试吧
go for it.

205
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,620
等等
hold on for a second.

206
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,050
怎么了
what is it?

207
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,120
过来抵着墙
come here and push against this wall.

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,950
为什么
why?

209
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,050
拜托  照我说的做
please. just humor me.

210
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,780
我有主意了
i think i'm on to something.

211
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,950
好了  我数到三
okay, on the count of three,

212
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,920
你就用力推墙  行吗
push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?

213
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,480
行
okay.

214
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,420
好了  一  二  三
okay. one... two... three...

215
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,480
娘的
son of a bitch.

216
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,150
可控制磁性谐波共振
controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.

217
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,320
啥
what?

218
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,350
显然爱迪生在泰斯拉快要成功之前
apparently tesla was close to something like this

219
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,480
毁了他的实验室
before edison trashed his lab.

220
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,650
你在说什么呢
what are you talking about?

221
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,380
这堵墙是特别设计的
that wall was specially designed

222
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,220
当其不断收到
to de-stablize

223
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,450
特定的谐波共振时
when bombarded

224
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,750
就会变得不稳定
with a very specific harmonic resonance.

225
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,920
那些音就是这个作用
that's what the tones were.

226
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,880
周围强烈的磁性粒子
and the strong magnetic property of the particles

227
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
可以防止门瓦解
is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust.

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,380
用这种方法掩藏门真是绝了
it's a great way to hide a door,

229
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,920
当你想打开门时
because if you're looking for a door to open,

230
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,520
恐怕想找到都难
it's never going to be found.

231
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,820
类似全息照相  只是更加逼真
it's like a hologram, only better,

232
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,120
因为在音频响起之前  那儿就是一堵墙
because it's solid mass until the tones are playing.

233
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,420
你刚刚完全可以让我
so you could have just told me

234
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,120
走过这扇门
to walk through the door.

235
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,020
确实可以
i could have, yes.

236
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,080
是啊  是啊
yes, yes.

237
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,050
我们这到底是在哪儿
where the hell are we?

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,750
杰纳斯的秘密实验室
janus' secret lab.

239
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,720
通知其他人
alert the others.

240
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,220
仪器激活了
the device has been activated.

241
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,720
伍尔希先生
hey, mr. woolsey.

242
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,820
凯勒医生
dr. keller.

243
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,150
你那剽悍的保镖呢
where is your burly protector?

244
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,520
他不在你身边反倒挺不习惯的
it's odd to see you without him nowadays.

245
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,450
他在实验室里
he's in the lab.

246
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,490
你在忙什么呢
what are you working on?

247
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,320
演讲
a speech.

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,950
为了什么
what for?

249
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,650
这是个相当重要的场合
well, this is a fairly momentous occasion.

250
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,620
幽灵愿意走近一步
the wraith will take a step forward,

251
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,890
不仅仅为了他们自身利益
not only for their own benefit,

252
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,790
也是为了整个星系
but for that of the entire galaxy.

253
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,750
这是历史性的时刻
it's a historic day.

254
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,120
我觉得他们需要些认可
i just think it deserves some recognition.

255
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,620
那现在进展如何
what have you got so far?

256
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,450
"今天是个历史性的时刻"
"today is an historic day."

257
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,080
开头不错
it's a good place to start.

258
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,550
只是个半成品而已
well, it's a work in progress.

259
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,380
太酷了
whoa. that's pretty cool.

260
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,790
谐波共振
harmonic resonance.

261
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,820
是啊  听人说了
yeah, i was told.

262
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,890
如果音频没了
but what happens if the sound goes off

263
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,520
人还在墙中间怎么办
and you're in the middle of the wall?

264
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,120
那就等着门把你的身体分两半吧
the wall would break apart your body.

265
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
那我们应该
maybe we should--

266
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,380
我在门外建立了一个次声波音频发射器
i've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside.

267
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,750
门就一直开着了
the wall is now permanently open.

268
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,150
别担心
don't worry.

269
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,790
很好  目前进展如何
good. so, what have we got?

270
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,120
好消息是
the good news is

271
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,790
这里的确是杰纳斯的秘密实验室
it's definitely janus' secret lab.

272
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,890
坏消息是  进入这儿是最简单的
the bad news is getting in was the easy part.

273
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,980
这儿所有的数据
there are levels of encryption

274
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,490
都加了密
on all data here

275
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,950
即使是最变态的国家安全局探员
that even the most paranoid nsa agent

276
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,790
也没法搞定
wouldn't use.

277
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,020
我是说  很深奥
i mean, it is deep.

278
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,180
有些就是数字密码
some of them are straight-up math ciphers,

279
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,380
而有些是古人文明的谜题
while others are ancient knowledge puzzles.

280
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,750
除非我们开始解密
and until we start deciphering,

281
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,120
否则没法知道这些是什么意思
there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.

282
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,590
看来你们合作的不错
sounds like you guys make a good team, though.

283
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,590
是啊
yeah.

284
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,250
那么我回去继续当我的老大了
well, i guess i'll go back to being the boss.

285
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,320
感觉怎么样
how's that going?

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,520
无聊透顶
pretty boring, actually.

287
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,980
你若来帮我们
you're more than welcome

288
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,490
搞定这第一个流密码就更好了
to help us crack this first stream cipher.

289
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,490
他可进过门萨(一个高智商协会)
you know, he could have been in mensa.

290
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,750
等你们两个天才有突破时
why don't you contact me

291
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,080
记得通知我
when you two geniuses have a breakthrough.

292
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,450
会的
will do.

293
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
长官  有人呼我们
sir, we're being hailed.

294
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,980
打开通道
open a channel.

295
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,690
我是代达罗斯号上的卡德威尔上校
this is colonel caldwell of the earth ship daedalus.

296
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,180
正准备接待您的代表团
we're ready to receive your delegation.

297
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,920
代表团已经上路了
the delegation is on their way.

298
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,050
马克斯你开好舰桥
marks, you have the bridge.

299
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,180
我要去会客了
i'm going to meet our guests.

300
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,250
谢谢你们的光临
thank you for coming.

301
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,420
谢谢你们的邀请
thank you for having us.

302
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,150
今天是历史性的时刻
today is an historic day.

303
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,550
格罗斯泰斯特曾经说过
robert grosseteste once said--

304
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,490
我希望能尽快开始
i would like to get started as soon as possible.

305
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,520
好吧  当然啦
yes, of course.

306
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,080
但我仍想认可一下
but i wanted to recognize--

307
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,120
我很怀疑
i have my doubts

308
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,350
你们的计划是否有效
that your plan will be effective.

309
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,690
还是跳过
so shall we drop

310
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,690
多余的客套话
these unfounded pleasantries

311
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,850
直接切入主题吧
and get to work?

312
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,380
很好
very well.

313
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,350
凯勒医生
dr. keller,

314
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,690
请带路
lead the way.

315
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,850
请跟我来
please, come with me.

316
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,950
罗伯特什么?
robert who?

317
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,350
甭管了
never mind.

318
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,120
天都快亮了
you know, it's almost dawn.

319
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,790
如果这还能叫晚上的话
if you want to call it a night...

320
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,250
什么  不不不  我很好  没问题
what? no, no, no, i'm fine, fine.

321
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,490
你想休息的话
but if you need to rest,

322
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,920
我完全理解
i'll completely understand.

323
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,690
说真的  你是不是把每件事都看作竞争呢
seriously, is everything a competition with you?

324
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,420
我不知道你在说什么
i'm not sure what you're talking about.

325
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,620
帮你找到一个秘密实验室
i just found you a secret lab

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,950
里面满是很棒的古人物品
full of really cool ancient stuff.

327
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,320
你总该给我记一功吧
i kind of think that should score me some points.

328
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,650
好吧  我承认
okay, i will admit

329
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,020
我对你确实有一点无礼
that i may have been a little brusque with you.

330
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,980
一点?
just a little.

331
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,380
事实上
the truth is,

332
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,590
我并不认为你会有什么发现
i really didn't think you would find anything.

333
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,850
这我理解
well, that much i actually understand.

334
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,420
真的?
you do?

335
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,050
是的
yeah.

336
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,220
我的理论绝大多数时候
i've spent the majority of my professional life

337
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,150
都是被嘲笑的对象
being ridiculed for my theories,

338
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,950
但最终总是被证明是对的
most of which turned out to be correct,by the way.

339
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,950
我已经习惯了  罗德尼
i'm kind of used to it, rodney.

340
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,890
你不介意吗
doesn't that bother you?

341
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,950
没有辩解  没有认可  没有功勋
i mean, no vindication, no recognition, no credit...

342
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,690
你又何尝不是
i could say the same thing about you.

343
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,220
你的迄今为止的那些发现
the discoveries you've made,

344
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,890
恐怕能得5个诺贝尔奖
you probably could've won the nobel prize

345
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,450
也不止吧
five times over by now.

346
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,120
是呀
too true.

347
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,050
看来我们都不是为了名声的人
so, i guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?

348
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,620
是啊  也就混口饭吃
no, we did it for the money.

349
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,020
说得好
good one.

350
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,420
等等
wait a minute--

351
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,280
你不会比我拿的多吧  会吗
you don't get paid more than i do, do you?

352
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,820
会吗
do you?

353
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,350
超空间窗口刚打开
hyperspace window just opened.

354
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,850
代达罗斯号还没到时间回来啊
daedalus isn't due back yet.

355
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,980
去找谢帕德
get sheppard.

356
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,590
谢帕德中校
colonel sheppard, sir?

357
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,080
在  小睡了一下
yeah, uh, just resting my eyes.

358
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,490
谁在说话
who said that?

359
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,020
我破解了您房间的广播系统
i patched into the pa in your room, sir.

360
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,850
您最好赶紧过来
you're going to want to get up here.

361
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,450
出了什么事
what's going on?

362
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,180
我们正在跟踪一架小型飞船  在大气层中
we're tracking a small ship, in atmosphere.

363
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,150
它朝我们过来了
It's coming right for us.

364
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,020
把飞船放出去
Get the jumpers in the air.

365
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,520
它来得很快
It's closing fast, sir.

366
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
10秒之内就会到了
It'll be here in less than 10 seconds.

367
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,750
打开防护罩
Shields up.

368
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,180
飞船同时也准备好
I still want the jumpers ready.

369
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
来了
Here it comes...

370
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,050
不可能
That's impossible.

371
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,520
它刚做了什么
What did it just do?

372
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,750
它穿过了防护罩
It passed through the shield.

373
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,720
我知道  关键是它是怎么做到的
Yeah, but how did it do that?

374
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,220
我不太确定
I'm not sure, sir.

375
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,720
但好像古人飞船可以
Ancient ships can do it.

376
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,950
叫泰勒带一支分队
All right, tell Teyla and a team of marines

377
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,390
到那个码头来和我会合
to meet me at that pier.

378
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,520
他们应该就在你们前面
They should be right in front of you.

379
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,950
别动
Don't move!

380
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,280
这底下到底有什么
What's at the bottom of this tower?

381
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,750
罗德尼
Rodney.

382
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
罗德尼  这里是谢帕德  请回话
Rodney, this is Sheppard. come in.

383
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,920
罗德尼
Rodney!

384
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,050
什么事
What's up?

385
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,920
马上离开那儿
Get out of there right now.

386
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,850
为什么
Why?

387
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,380
控制室  那艘飞船现在是什么情况
Control room, what's the status of that ship?

388
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,490
对不起  中校
I'm sorry, Colonel.

389
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,990
他们走了
They're gone.

390
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,820
它还活着吗
Is it alive?

391
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,350
我问你呢
You tell me.

392
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,680
读数不连贯
I'm not getting any coherent readings.

393
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,750
也许我们要用医学扫描仪
Perhaps we should put it under a medical scanner.

394
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,720
好  那就这样做
Okay, do it.

395
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,550
拿个轮床来
Go get a gurney.

396
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,520
它真的劫持了罗德尼和杰克森博士?
So is it true they took Rodney and Dr. Jackson?

397
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,850
对
Yeah.

398
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,920
见鬼  怎么回事
What the hell happened?

399
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,700
我们被攻击了
We were attacked.

400
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,720
这我知道  谢谢
That much I got, thanks.

401
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,550
谁做的
By who?

402
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,550
我还想你来告诉我呢
I was kind of hoping you could tell me.

403
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,820
好了  这绝不是巧合
Okay, there is no way this is a coincidence.

404
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,250
我们发现了杰纳斯的秘密实验室
We discover Janus' super-secret lab,

405
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,620
而24小时之内
and less than 24 hours later,

406
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,490
一群外星人带着枪出现
a bunch of aliens show up, all guns blazing?

407
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,720
不觉得奇怪吗
Don't think that's a little odd?

408
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,680
你这么一说...
Now that you mention it...

409
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,350
他们十分确定自己要找什么
They knew exactly what they were looking for.

410
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,590
不浪费一点时间  直奔实验室
Didn't waste any time, went straight for the lab.

411
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,720
他们出来的时候  一个人拿着个仪器
When they came out, one of them was carrying a device.

412
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,920
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

413
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,980
我们根本没时间
we haven't had nearly enough time

414
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,520
检查完所有的东西
to go through everything we found in here,

415
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,720
所以也不可能知道
so there's no way of knowing

416
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,980
他们到底拿了什么
exactly what they took.

417
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,650
罗德尼和杰克森博士一进来
All this stuff came on

418
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,820
这些东西就自行运作起来了
when Rodney and Dr. Jackson came in here.

419
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,220
差不多
Pretty much.

420
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,850
它几乎就是因为
It activated

421
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,420
罗德尼的a.t.a.基因而激活  怎么了
probably in response to Rodney's a.t.a. gene. why?

422
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,590
如果这里有什么一直在发送信息呢
What if something in here has been broadcasting?

423
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,420
来自亚空间的信号  只有这种可能
A subspace signal-- it's the only possible answer.

424
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,180
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

425
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,320
我们之前遇到过
We've come across them before.

426
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,190
两个古人仪器中
They're a real-time, practically instantaneous link

427
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,520
存在着一种实时的联系
between two ancient devices.

428
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
就算相距半个银河  仍可以工作
They can be separated by, like, half a galaxy.

429
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,820
外边有一群外星人
There's a bunch of aliens out there.

430
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,390
他们偶然间发现一个古人实验室
They stumble upon an ancient lab,

431
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,490
估计就是杰纳斯自己造的
probably built by Janus himself.

432
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,220
处于休眠状态  不能运作
It's dormant. It's not working.

433
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,550
某一天  它突然激活了
Then one day, out of the blue, it activates.

434
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,150
他们围在一起  抓耳挠腮
So they're standing around, scratching they're heads.

435
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,550
不知道是怎么回事
They have no idea what's going on.

436
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,780
然后  他们发现了亚空间连接
Then they discover the subspace link.

437
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
他们打算跟踪它
They decide to follow it,

438
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,120
一路追踪找到了我们
they trace it back to us.

439
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,850
然后攻击了我们  还抓了两个当人质?
And then attack us and take two of our people hostage?

440
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,720
他们的目标不是罗德尼和杰克森博士
Rodney and Dr. Jackson were not the targets.

441
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,520
他们只是在错误的时间呆在了错误的地方
They were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

442
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,290
不管是什么仪器  那才是他们要的
Whatever that device was, that's what they were after.

443
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,950
好吧  推理得不错
All right, good theory.

444
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,490
那我们该怎么办
So what do we do?

445
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,250
我们...我们得先离开这儿
Well, we... we've got to get out of here.

446
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,590
我们很可能在一艘超空间旅行的飞船上
We're probably on a ship traveling through hyperspace.

447
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,720
我们会去哪儿
Where are we going to go?

448
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,150
我会想出点办法的
I'll think of something.

449
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,990
真的?
Really?

450
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,820
当然  一直都是
Yep. Always do.

451
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,820
哦对了  那我试过了
Oh yeah, I tried that.

452
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,920
你一碰到他们  他们就会电你
They zap you when you touch them.

453
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,780
你可以在我碰之前就告诉我
You could told me that before I touched it.

454
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,950
我是可以
I could have, yes.

455
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,950
他们什么都没给我们
Look, they stripped us

456
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,290
只有身后的一些衣服
of everything but the clothing on our backs

457
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,490
和周围的一圈激光墙
and surrounded us with laser walls...

458
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,190
我可想不出我们还能干点什么
I'm not sure how much play we have here.

459
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,390
至少还有一点是有利我们的
We've got one thing going for us, at least.

460
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,220
什么
What's that?

461
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,820
我们还没死
We're not dead yet.

462
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,350
说得好
Good point.

463
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,390
没用
It's no good.

464
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,950
还是没有读到有用的信息
I'm still not getting any useful readings.

465
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,250
这套装备发出了某种防护
The suit is emitting some sort of e.m. field

466
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,050
干扰了扫描仪
That's disrupting the scanner.

467
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,220
我完全不知道如何停掉它
I have no idea how to shut it off.

468
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,590
能不能穿透这层防护
There's no way to penetrate the shield

469
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,050
看清里面的情况?
and see what's under there?

470
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,290
我想不能
I'm afraid not.

471
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,620
盔甲下面会不会是个人
Do you think there's a human underneath all that armor?

472
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,490
不太可能  应该是个机器人
Impossible to say. Could be a robot.

473
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,680
有件事是肯定的
One thing's for sure--

474
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,550
这和我们见过的都不同
It's not like anything we've ever seen before.

475
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,850
韦尔博士的确说过
Dr. Weir did say that there were other

476
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,680
我们还会遇到其他
technologically advanced societies

477
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,150
科技高度发达的群体
that we have yet to encounter.

478
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,980
这是我们的"第一次亲密接触"
We've just made first contact.

479
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,190
你们要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

480
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,190
切开
Cut it open.

481
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,350
没用  锋口都钝了
It's no good. I just dulled the blade.

482
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,420
脖子
The neck.

483
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,320
什么
What?

484
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,820
看上去应该是最柔软的部分
Looks like the softest part.

485
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,190
试试从脖子入手
Try the neck.

486
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,150
它已经死了  拉迪克
It's already dead, Radek.

487
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,050
只是我们这么认为
We think.

488
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,050
你只管做
Just do it.

489
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,190
行得通
It's working!

490
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,720
出去  所有人出去
Get out. Everyone, get out!

491
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,020
大家都还好吗
Everyone okay?

492
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,120
是的
Yes.

493
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,780
不管装备下有什么
Somebody really wants to keep secret

494
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,390
他们不想让别人知道
whatever's inside that suit.

495
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,620
我们对在押的幽灵人
We've run close to a hundred simulations

496
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,590
进行了上百个
based on full medical scans

497
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,590
完整医学扫描模拟
of the wraith we've had in captivity.

498
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,250
都很成功
They've all been successful.

499
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,290
我们都知道
We both know very well

500
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,390
计算机模拟和实体试验
that computer simulations and live trials

501
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,750
有很大的不同
are very different.

502
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,490
我不认为我们是自夸的
I don't think we're doing this cavalierly.

503
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,780
我有数据为证
I stand by the data.

504
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,220
它能行
It will work.

505
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,050
也许能行
Perhaps it will.

506
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,590
问题是  你想它成功吗
The question is, do you want it to?

507
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,920
我的确看到了它的好处
I do see the benefits.

508
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,720
即使只是用在我的一些部队上
Even if we only used the therapy on some of my troops...

509
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,080
他们的生命  因为战争的关系
Say, those whose lives, thanks to this war,

510
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,680
都很短暂
are expected to be short.

511
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,290
为什么把那么好的资源浪费在他们身上
Why waste perfectly good resources on them, yes?

512
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,780
但要我为了人类的利益
But it will be very difficult for me

513
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,120
牺牲我周围的一些人
to ask those around me to give themselves over

514
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,620
我还办不到
for the good of the human race.

515
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,290
也是为了你们的利益
But it's for your benefit too.

516
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,750
如果你们不必再以人类为食
If you don't have to rely on human feeding,

517
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,450
战争就可以结束了
the war would be over.

518
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,450
也许...
Perhaps...

519
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,290
那然后我们做什么呢
But then what would we do?

520
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,520
我们又是谁呢
Who would we be?

521
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,450
我们能和负责人谈谈吗
Can we talk to somebody in charge?

522
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,080
我认为这里有些误会
I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.

523
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,150
没必要这样对待我们
There's no need to treat us this way...

524
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,520
运行仪器
Get the device operational.

525
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,050
我都不知道那是什么
I don't even know what it is!

526
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
太妙了
Oh, great.

527
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,350
关得密不透风
It's sealed shut,

528
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,420
而且还把控制器拿走了
and they've removed the door controls from this side.

529
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,720
我们到底在什么鬼地方
Where the hell are we?

530
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
从建筑风格上来看
I'd say judging by the lantian architecture,

531
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,680
我猜  是杰纳斯的秘密基地
I'd guess, you know, secret Janus facility.

532
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,980
这可对我们不利
Which is, you know, probably bad for us,

533
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,550
因为这意味着这里很难被找到
because it probably means it's hard to find.

534
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,490
也就是说近期内不会有人来营救了
So I guess that means no rescue any time soon.

535
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,520
你觉得看着眼熟吗
Does that look familiar to you?

536
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,650
是啊  亚特兰蒂斯实验室里的仪器
Yeah, it's the device from the Atlantis lab.

537
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,650
至少知道他们为什么要带我们过来了
At least we know why they brought us with them.

538
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,220
他们要我们帮助启动这个设备
they need us to get the device operational.

539
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,090
我知道他们的意图
i caught that.

540
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,650
我想我们不会从外面的健谈先生们那里
right, and i don't think we'll get any more info

541
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,150
得到什么信息了
from talky mcsays-a-lot out there,

542
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,700
那就启动控制台
so fire up these consoles,

543
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,650
看看我们要跟什么打交道
see what we're dealing with.

544
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,750
不是那个
not like that.

545
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,390
等下  可能是这个
um... let's see. yeah, like that.

546
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,250
还得按这个
and then i need to be right there, yep.

547
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,290
谢谢
thanks. there.

548
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,050
现在有五艘飞船在我们上空
we've got five jumpers in the air

549
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,880
摆成了防御阵形
flying a defensive formation around the city

550
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,750
飞船已经为你准备好了
and have the chair fired up and ready for you

551
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,750
可以立刻使用
at a moment's notice.

552
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,390
每五层都要有一个分队
i want marine details every five levels,

553
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,820
全副武装 时刻听我指令
locked and loaded, ready for my go-ahead,

554
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,680
以防万一
just in case.

555
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,780
没问题
absolutely.

556
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,920
中校  我想我找到了点东西
colonel, i think i may have something.

557
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,820
我按照你提出的假设
i've been working under the assumption

558
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
他们带走的设备
that, as you suggested,

559
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,780
在发出
the device they took

560
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,750
某种亚空间信息
must have been broadcasting

561
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,350
据此进行研究
some sort of subspace communication.

562
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,250
你能够追踪到吗
you can trace it?

563
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,980
如果是从亚特兰蒂斯发的话就能
if it was broadcasting from atlantis, yes.

564
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,750
不过明显已经不在了
but obviously it's not doing that anymore.

565
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,920
所以呢...
so...

566
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,150
所以...
so...

567
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,550
我用拉兹洛·巴拜的理论
well, i'm using the work of laszlo babai

568
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,450
做基础
as a stepping stone.

569
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,290
你知道那些组合数学  还有...
you know, combinatorics and, um...

570
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,620
别见怪
no offense,

571
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,190
但是那些数学太复杂了
but the math i'm using is so complicated

572
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,850
不知道我能不能
that i don't know if i can dumb it down enough

573
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,780
让你明白
for it to make sense.

574
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
不试怎么知道
try.

575
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,220
好吧
all right, well, okay,

576
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,020
我正在查看记录下来的亚空间日志
i've been going over our recorded subspace logs

577
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,980
尝试找到一条
and i'm trying to extrapolate the single thread

578
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,590
能把我们带到那个仪器附近
that will lead us to the area of space

579
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,550
的路线
associated with the device.

580
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,220
明白了
well, i understand that.

581
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,780
很难准确描述出我现在做的事  不过...
it doesn't accurately represent what i'm doing, but--

582
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,080
我知道了
i get it.

583
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
这事很难
what you're doing is difficult.

584
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,150
有进展的时候跟我说一声
just tell me when you get a hit.

585
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
这个机器
this facility is tapped into

586
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,220
接入了一个非常强大的发电系统
some pretty serious power generation.

587
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,050
以前从没见过这种玩意儿
i've never seen anything like it before.

588
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,050
得要很多能量...
you'd need a lot of power...

589
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,390
什么
what?

590
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,590
我知道这个东西干吗用的了
i think i know what this thing does.

591
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,550
什么
what?

592
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,820
这是终端机器
it's an endgame machine.

593
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
什么意思
how so?

594
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,850
如果和我想的一样的话
if it works the way i think it does,

595
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,450
那它能让幽灵族
it would mean the end of the wraith

596
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,450
永远消失
once and for all.

597
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,490
怎么能把幽灵
so how do you destroy the wraith

598
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,180
彻底毁灭
once and for all?

599
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,620
我可没说  毁灭
well, i never said "destroy."

600
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,590
我是说  可能会那样
i mean, it would lead to that, i suppose,

601
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,650
这个设备
but this device

602
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,220
将会把他们送上死亡之路
would stop them dead in their tracks.

603
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,590
怎么送
how?

604
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,390
它能制造一种特定的亚空间静电...
it creates a very specific subspace static...

605
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,550
用紊流来形容可能更好点
turbulence is a better way of looking at it.

606
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,520
然后
which...

607
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,650
听着
okay, look.

608
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,850
尽管他们都是依据
although they're all based

609
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,550
一个很类似的技术造成的
on a fairly similar technological premise,

610
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,920
但是每种都有不同的
each race has a slightly different type

611
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,880
超空间引擎系统
of hyperdrive.

612
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,320
我们用的是改造过的
ours are based on the asgard drives

613
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,650
仙宫驱动
with our own little twist.

614
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,820
古人有自己的系统
the ancients had their own system,

615
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,950
还有幽灵
and the wraith, again,

616
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,490
也有自己独立的超空间引擎技术
have their own separate hyperdrive technology.

617
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,320
好吧
all right.

618
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,620
最简单的
so at its base level,

619
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,950
超空间引擎能够通过进出亚空间
a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances

620
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,520
加大飞行距离
by entering and exiting subspace.

621
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,150
这个我知道
okay, this much i already know, yes.

622
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,950
所以  要是这个机器
okay, so, if this machine

623
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,550
能正常运转
is capable of actually functioning safely,

624
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,590
就会瓦解
it disrupts

625
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,450
幽灵使用的
the very specific subspace frequencies

626
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,690
特殊的亚空间频率
the wraith use.

627
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,220
然后他们就不能再用超空间引擎了
so they wouldn't be able to engage their hyperdrives.

628
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,950
真是天才  可惜不是
that's the genius-- they would be able to.

629
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,520
他们独有的亚空间轨道
it's just that their particular channel of subspace

630
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:01,980
不稳定
would be destabilized

631
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,360
飞船会被
and the ship would be ripped

632
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,150
撕的粉碎
into a million pieces.

633
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,520
机器运转起来之后
when this device is turned on,

634
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,700
一旦幽灵船进入超空间
every time a wraith ship enters hyperspace,

635
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
就会自爆吗
it self-destructs?

636
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,890
对
yeah.

637
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,320
这注意不错
that's a pretty effective idea.

638
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,050
等其他幽灵知道
because even if word got back to the other wraith

639
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,580
飞船不能使用超空间引擎的时候
that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives,

640
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,950
他们已经被困住了
they'd be stuck where they were.

641
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,480
他们只能用小型引擎
they could only travel using sublight engines.

642
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,720
因为古人飞船的超空间引擎
because ancient ships' hyperdrives operated

643
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,190
的频率和亚空间不同
on a different frequency of subspace,

644
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,320
古人就能把它们挨个收拾了
the ancients could fly around and pick them off one by one.

645
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,550
或者把他们仍在广袤的太空中死去
yeah, or just leave them to die in the vastness of space.

646
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,250
问题在哪儿
so, what's the catch?

647
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,620
问题是
ah, well, the catch is

648
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,320
由于
that janus ran a three-day test

649
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,220
未知因素的影响
about 10,000 years ago

650
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,850
那个研究
and then shut the whole project down

651
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,220
万年前的实验  杰纳斯做了三天就停止了
because of "unforeseen side effects".

652
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,680
什么未知影响
right, which were?

653
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,250
不太清楚
well, it's not clear.

654
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,250
不过那是问题的关键
but that's the key to the whole shebang.

655
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,750
杰纳斯把它带回了亚特兰蒂斯
janus brought that back to atlantis

656
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,620
但仍然与主机相连
but kept it connected to the main system here.

657
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,150
要运作  二者缺一不可
one won't work without the other.

658
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,920
似乎他们确信我们可以操作
they seem pretty convinced we can make it operational.

659
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,050
因为我们有可能
because we probably can.

660
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,220
这儿什么都有
we have everything we need here.

661
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
问题是该不该这么做
the question is whether we should.

662
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,450
上次我这么做的时候
the last time i went down this road,

663
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,250
差点毁了一个太阳系
i... i kind of destroyed a solar system.

664
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,650
我也不想
yeah, and i'm not too keen

665
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,020
亲身体验那些什么未知影响
about experiencing those "unforeseen side effects".

666
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,650
那我们要怎么做
so what do we do?

667
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,750
很简单
it's simple.

668
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,350
和他们理论
we, uh... we reason with them?

669
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,120
很明显  你们知道
Now, obviously you're as excited

670
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,650
能够在银河系
about the possibility of ending the wraith's reign

671
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,320
彻底消灭幽灵后很激动
over this galaxy once and for all.

672
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,250
不过现实是
but the reality is

673
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,790
出于某种原因
this device and this facility

674
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,820
制造者
were abandoned by their creator

675
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,020
抛弃了这个设施
for a very good reason.

676
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,120
所以  它不能工作...
see, uh, it doesn't work...

677
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,480
至少不能安全的工作
at least not safely.

678
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,750
就像我朋友说的那样
that's from what my friend can tell.

679
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,250
我们目的相同
look, we share the same goal.

680
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,150
也许还有很多其他共同之处
perhaps we have many things in common.

681
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,990
只要时间充足
look, given the right amount of time,

682
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,320
也许我们能让这个设备
it's possible we could get the device

683
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,380
安全运转
to function safely,

684
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,020
前提是得跟自己人联系
but we'd have to contact our people

685
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,380
找个强大点的科学队来
and bring in a much larger science team.

686
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,520
我不是那块料
see, i'm not that kind of scientist,

687
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,480
我朋友要是
and my friend here--

688
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,050
一小时内让机器运作起来
get the device operational within one hour

689
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,550
否则我就杀了他
or i will kill him.

690
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,950
明白了没
do you understand?

691
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,950
明白了
i understand. yes.

692
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,950
计划不错  丹尼
great plan, danny.

693
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,220
计划不错
great plan.

694
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,050
为什么穿着外套
why the suits?

695
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,750
他们现在不需要作战了
well, they're not in battle anymore.

696
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,450
开始我还以为
originally i thought

697
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,890
这是他们的作战服
it was just their version of swat gear,

698
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,890
可现在他们还穿着
but they still have it on.

699
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,090
也许不只是盔甲那么简单
maybe they're more than just armor.

700
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,320
可能是某种防护服
maybe they're some sort of protective suit.

701
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,280
也许他们不能在我们的大气中生活
maybe they can't function in our livable atmosphere.

702
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,450
也许我们应该把这先放一边
maybe we should just add it to the list of things

703
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,350
这和我们手头的工作没关系
that have nothing to do with the task at hand.

704
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,520
这些盔甲也许是
those suits might be the key

705
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,650
弄清楚这些人身份的关键
to figuring out who these guys really are.

706
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,020
你去了解他们
well, you work on understanding them.

707
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,490
我来保护我们的小命
i'll work on trying not to get us killed.

708
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,520
有进展了吗
well, you got something for me?

709
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,350
是的  那儿
yes. there.

710
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,650
m6h-987
m6h-987.

711
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,220
这是我觉得最可能的
that's my best guess.

712
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,390
确定吗
are you sure?

713
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,420
80%的可能性
well, about 80% sure.

714
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,950
这是唯一的线索  必须这么做
it's our only lead. i'll have to do.

715
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,180
上面没有星门  是吧
doesn't happen to have a gate on it, does it?

716
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
是的
no.

717
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,620
当然不会有
of course not.

718
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,050
代达罗斯号仍然联系不上吗
daedalus still out of communications range?

719
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,120
对
yeah, i'm afraid so.

720
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,820
和托德碰头的地点附近也没有星门
their rendezvous point with todd isn't even near a stargate.

721
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,020
我要你去飞船舱
I need you to get to the jumper bay,

722
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,720
尽力扩大亚空间
boost its subspace communications range

723
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,420
通讯范围
as much as you can.

724
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,220
你有什么计划
what are you planning?

725
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,550
我们得尽快赶到那星球去
we've got to get to that planet as soon as possible.

726
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,850
我们乘飞船靠近代达罗斯号
we'll gate as near as we can to the daedalus with a jumper,

727
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,850
让他们帮忙把飞船路线设定好
have them pick us up en route to the planet.

728
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,120
好的  半小时搞定
okay. give me half an hour.

729
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,850
我去让小组准备
i'm going to get the team ready.

730
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,920
主舱室已连接上亚空间
that main chamber houses the subspace antenna.

731
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,850
这会产生亚空间的静电干扰
it harnesses the static into subspace.

732
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,350
一旦开启就会这样
it will once i light it up.

733
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,550
什么  你早准备好了?
what? you're already ready?

734
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,880
它没坏掉  只不过是停下来了
well, it wasn't broken. he just shut it down.

735
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,180
你所需要的仅仅是
all you need is that,

736
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,150
对杰纳斯的编码模式有个基本了解
a basic understanding of janus' coding style,

737
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,390
然后我又要说了
and here's where i come in again,

738
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,620
古人基因
the ancient gene.

739
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,220
我们已经准备好了
we're ready to roll.

740
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,050
罗德尼  你没必要这样做
rodney, you don't have to do this.

741
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,590
什么
what?

742
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,750
要是把这东西开启了
if turning this thing on

743
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,650
意味着太阳能系统就会崩溃
means a solar system is going to explode,

744
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,220
那就不做
then let's not.

745
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,690
他们想要杀了你啊  我们没的选择
they're going to kill you. we don't have a choice.

746
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,620
不  我们有选择
yes, we do.

747
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,650
好吧  我啥也不干
okay, so i do nothing,

748
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,420
他们过来  然后干掉你
they come in here, they kill you.

749
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,920
接着会是谁  是我!
who gets killed next, huh? me.

750
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,880
跟你说实话  我还不想那么早死
to tell you the truth here, i'm quite fond of me,

751
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,750
所以最好趁你还活着的时候做
so might as well do it now while you're still alive

752
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,080
以防...你知道吧
as opposed to, you know, then.

753
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,920
好吧
all right.

754
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,750
好的
all right.

755
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,320
好的...
all right...

756
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,490
你还活着?
you still alive?

757
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,650
我看是
i think so.

758
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,450
我可不觉得天堂样该这样子
i'd hate to think heaven looks like this.

759
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,690
谁说我们去的是天堂?
who says we went to heaven?

760
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,650
正在运行
it's operational.

761
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,690
有什么异常?
anything out of the ordinary?

762
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,080
没啊  一切都正常的
no. everything is in the green.

763
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,420
我是说运行良好
i mean, it's working great.

764
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,850
那些"不可预测的副作用"呢?
what about those "unforeseen side effects"?

765
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,050
当然还不可预测啊
they're still unforeseen.

766
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,150
至少现在  运转正常  我们也还活着
for now, it's working, and we're still alive.

767
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,290
好吧  那现在怎么办
okay, so, what now?

768
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,450
也许...我们该庆祝一下
uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back

769
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,250
然后班师回亚特兰蒂斯?
and an all-expense-paid trip back to atlantis?

770
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,750
母舰传给你一条紧急信息
you have an urgent message from your hive.

771
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,850
我觉得你回想私下接听
i assumed you'd want to take it privately.

772
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,550
说吧
go ahead.

773
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
很好
very well.

774
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,080
批准!
permission granted.

775
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,390
我还得留在这里
i shall remain here.

776
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,020
没事吧?
is everything okay?

777
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,980
我们的一个设施
one of our facilities is under attack

778
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,290
遭到对手母舰的袭击
by a rival hive.

779
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,120
我们的两艘飞船必须去支援
our two support ships must depart for battle.

780
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,180
我的母舰还会呆在这里
my hive will remain here,

781
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,450
继续配合凯勒医生的工作
continue the work with dr. keller.

782
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,320
非常好
i'm glad to hear that.

783
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,180
哦  不是说被攻击好  那个太不幸了
oh, not the under attack part, that's unfortunate, of course.

784
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,290
我意思是...
i just meant--

785
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,720
算了
never mind.

786
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,590
马克斯  刚才怎么回事
marks, what the hell just happened?

787
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,980
你们怎么做到的
how did you do that?

788
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,450
我们怎么...
how did we--

789
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,390
你当然知道我们和这没关系
surely you don't think we had anything to do with that.

790
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,780
你们欺骗我
you've tricked me.

791
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,650
什么
what?

792
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,950
你们蓄谋已久了
this was your plan all along.

793
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,920
你们早就找到了设备
somehow, you've found the attero device.

794
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,120
什么  我们不知道你...
the what? we have no idea what you--

795
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,750
指挥官
commander,

796
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,950
我们尝试跟你联系
we've been trying to contact you.

797
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,820
另一艘攻击舰已被摧毁
the other cruisers were destroyed.

798
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,850
我知道了
i know.

799
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,250
我们上当了
we've been betrayed.

800
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,150
那我们该怎么办
what should we do?

801
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,520
我已经控制了他们的运输系统
i have control of the humans' transport system.

802
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,420
马上传送我们的部队过去
i'll begin beaming in our troops immediately.

803
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,420
船是我们的了
we're taking the ship

804
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,730
快
come on.

805
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,400
怎么了?
what's going on?

806
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,140
我们遭袭击了
we're under attack.

807
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,770
我们得去给你弄支枪  快点来
we got to get to the armory and get you a gun. come on.

808
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,340
锁住了
locked.

809
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,070
若楠!
ronon!

810
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,570
我们被困在里面了
we're locked in.

811
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,140
这样会拖延他们的行动
that should limit their movements.

812
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,770
继续传送部队
continue beaming in our troops.

813
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,270
十分钟了  还没问题
10 minutes and counting. still no problem.

814
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,170
哦  伙计...
oh, boy...

815
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,140
怎么了
what? what is it?

816
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,400
我想我刚发现了一个日志
i think i just found a log entry

817
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,100
说明了副作用是什么样的
that tells what the side effect is.

818
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,000
不是什么有害辐射吧
it's not harmful radiation, is it?

819
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,470
不不不  咱俩还安全
no. no, no, no. you and i are safe.

820
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,640
我是指银河系其他地方
it's just the rest of the galaxy

821
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,400
可能有问题了  包括亚特兰蒂斯
that's going to have problems, including atlantis.

822
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,370
我得把这个关掉
i've got to shut this thing down.

823
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,800
离开设备
step away from the device.

824
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,140
好 好 等等 等等
okay, wait.

825
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,470
设备现在有个非常严重的故障
there's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device,

826
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,840
我们得跟你们的....
and we need to talk to your boss--

827
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,770
好了  都设定好了
okay, all set.

828
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,940
我让恰克向m54-179星球拨号了
i'll have chuck dial m5r-179.

829
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,800
一旦你到了那里
you should be able to contact the  daedalus

830
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,740
就能通过亚空间
Via subspace

831
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,570
跟代达罗斯号联系上了
once you get there.

832
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,400
干得好
nice work.

833
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,740
谢了  祝好运
thanks. good luck.

834
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,240
多谢  这会派上用场的
thanks, we're going to need it.

835
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,540
好了  拨号吧
all right, dial up.

836
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,370
怎么了
what's that?

837
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,970
黑洞出现了个能量脉冲
we've got a power spike at the event horizon.

838
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,600
什么  能量堆积在星门?
what? power is building within the gate?

839
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,500
不不不  那不可能
no, no, no. that can't happen.

840
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,840
中校  别把飞船降到星门的位置
colonel, do not lower the jumper into the gate room.

841
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,670
怎么了
why not?

842
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,670
出于某种原因
for some reason,

843
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,600
有未知能源
there's an unprecedented power build-up

844
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,500
在星门周围堆积起来
within the gate.

845
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,370
从哪开始堆积?
power build-up from where?

846
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,270
从黑洞里
it's coming from within the event horizon.

847
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,200
哦  不
oh, no.

848
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,770
这对我们非常不利
this is very, very bad for us.

849
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,300
快把它关了
just shut it down.

850
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,600
可能是另一端某个瑕疵门吧
it's probably a faulty gate at the other end.

851
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,340
我  我正在试  可是不管用
i'm-- i'm trying. it won't let me.

852
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,870
好的  我马上下去
all right, i'm coming down.

853
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,540
我们怎么办  再等38分钟
what do we do, wait 38 minutes

854
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
然后通过"跳跃者"出去?
and ride the puddle out?

855
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,040
最好是
i wish.

856
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,970
如果能量再继续堆积
if the power continues to build like this,

857
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,970
星门将会超过负荷
the gate will reach critical overload

858
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,240
最后很有可能会爆炸
and most certainly explode.

859
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,170
爆炸?
explode?!

860
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,740
我说过了这对我们非常非常不利
yes, i told you it was very, very bad for us.

861
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,000
怎么会这样
how does something like this happen?

862
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,340
我不知道  以前没发生过
i don't know. it's never happened before.

863
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,970
我们还有多长时间?
how long do we have?

864
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,000
一点不长  大概90秒
not long at all. about 90 seconds.

865
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
90秒!
90 seconds?!

866
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,870
应该是快到60秒了
i would say closer to 60.

867
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,000
马上疏散楼里的人员
we've got to evacuate everyone in the tower.

868
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,200
星门爆炸等效于
the gate exploding is equivalent to

869
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
数个原子弹的威力
a dozen nuclear explosions.

870
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,740
我们没有地方
there's nowhere we could evacuate

871
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,540
可以撤退
quickly enough to a safe distance.

872
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,570
那个...  用那个保护罩
the-- the shield.

873
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,170
什么?
what?

874
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,740
在星门周围布上保护罩
collapse the city's shield around the gate,

875
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,770
来控制爆炸
contain the explosion.

876
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,140
对  对  这应该有用
yes, yes, that might just work.

877
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,700
舱门将要在5秒后达到爆炸极限
the gate will reach a critical limit in five...

878
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,870
4秒...
four...

879
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,940
3秒...
three...

880
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,570
2秒...
two...

881
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,670
1秒
one.

882
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,740
不要直视冲击波!
don't look at the blast!

883
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,900
以前强调过!
might have mentioned that before!

884
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,400
我看看能不能再转移一些能量到保护罩上
i'll see if i can divert more power to the shield,

885
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,340
看看能不能多屏蔽掉一点辐射
see if i can block more of the radiation

886
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,500
现在怎么样了
and now what?

887
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,270
保护罩仍然在减缓冲击波带来的能量
the shield continues to diffuse the energy of the blast.

888
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,100
保护罩多支撑一秒种
every second it's contained within the shield,

889
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,600
爆炸就会越减弱一些
the explosion gets weaker.

890
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,900
还需要多久
how long does it take?

891
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,140
哦  不
oh, no.

892
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,870
又怎么了
what?

893
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,940
保护罩至少还要1分钟
the shield needs at least another minute

894
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,300
来吸收所有的能量
to contain the full brunt of the blast,

895
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,700
但是温度已经过高了
but we're frying out the emitters.

896
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,270
我不知道我能坚持多久
i don't know how much longer i can hold this.

897
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,100
关闭整个城市  转移所有能源
shut down the city, transfer all the power.

898
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,370
我正在试
yes, i'm trying.

899
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,600
所有人撤离
everyone that doesn't need to be here,

900
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,140
到城市另一边
get to the edge of the city.

901
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
快!  所有人!
move! everybody!

902
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,770
你也撤
you're going to want to get out of here.

903
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,600
约翰  我...
john, i--

904
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,100
泰勒  拜托了
teyla, please.

905
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,600
加油  你能做到!  瑞迪克
come on, you can do it, radek.

906
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,900
减弱了
it's going down.

907
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,940
我们肯定行
we're going to make it.

908
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
不...
no...

909
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,440
还不够
it's not enough.
