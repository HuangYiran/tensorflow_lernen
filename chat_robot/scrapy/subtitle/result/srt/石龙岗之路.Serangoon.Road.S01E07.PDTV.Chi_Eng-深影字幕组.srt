00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,040
这城市正在自我毁灭 兄弟 所以我不愿参与
This city is eating itself, man. That's why I don't get involved.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,080
- 我们达成交易了吗? - 成交
- Do we have a deal? - Whatever you need.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,640
你的红毛搭档呢? 
And your ang mo partner?  

4
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,040
这是我们之间的交易
Let's just keep this between us.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,040
那是詹姆斯・林没错
Well, that's James Lim, right.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,720
他是个积极进取的生意人
He's a businessman on his way up,

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,560
他哥哥是林杰志 工会主要领袖
and his brother is Lim Chee Kit, the senior union leader.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,360
我想和你一起看电影 能更了解你
I'd love to see a film with you, get to know you better.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,640
为什么 你想给我立档案吗?
Why, so you can open a file on me?

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,560
听着 东南亚就像一个大型血腥跷跷板...
Listen, South-East Asia is like one big, bloody seesaw...

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,880
一边是美国中情局 另一边是英国军情六处
you have the CIA on one side, you've got MI6 on the other.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,640
之前中情局特工先生来找过你
Mr CIA Agent was looking for you earlier.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,040
- 忘记他吧 苏 - 你说话像我爸似的
- Forget him, Su. - You sound like my father.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
你觉得他与众不同吗? 他不是
Why do you think he's different? He's not.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,000
我想了想我说过的话 和相爱的人一起
I thought about what I said about being with people you love,

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,880
创造自己的生活
about making your own life.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,360
我要离开弗兰克
I'm leaving Frank.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,411
如果我没被录取怎么办? 
What if I don't get in? 

19
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:57,400
你没问题的
You will.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,880
但我没接到任何消息  
But I haven't heard anything.  

21
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,320
别担心 没问题的 相信我
Don't worry. You will, trust me.

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,640
你会去纽约或华盛顿上学
You're going to go to school in New York or DC.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,560
我会被调回兰利
I'm going to get posted back to Langley,

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,720
然后我可以带着你去看球赛
then I can take you to a ball game.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,560
- 球赛? - 对 棒球 世上最棒的运动
- A ball game? - Yeah. Baseball. It's the greatest game in the world.

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,950
我能带你去谢亚球场看纽约大都会的比赛 
I could take you to Shea Stadium to go and see the Mets. 

27
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:14,800
那是我最爱的球队
That's my team.

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
他们去年输了差不多109场比赛
You know that last year they lost, like, 109 games.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,600
- 太糟糕了吧 - 是啊 他们很差劲
- That's terrible. - It is. They were awful.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,560
我肯定这会违背城市的法令 但...
I'm sure it's against a dozen city ordinances, but...

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,080
- 康拉德 - 怎么了?
- Conrad. - What is it?

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,760
在这等我一下
Just wait here for a minute.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,200
你们在加班吗?
You guys working late?

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,280
老板想让我们把场地准备好 迎接早上的船员
Work site. Boss needs us to get it ready for the morning crew.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,480
趴下 趴下!
Down, down!

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,520
你没事吧?
You OK?

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,480
在这等着警察来
Stay here. Wait for the police.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
石龙岗之路 第一季第07集

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,480
窗帘
Mm, curtains.

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,480
窗帘怎么了?
Curtains?

41
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,840
我喜欢这里的窗帘 但要有点颜色才好
Yeah. I like it here, but it needs some colour.

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,425
来点自来水也许会好些 
Some running water would help too. 

43
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:14,640
很快就会有了
All in good time.

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,200
我们必须要这样吗?
Do we have to?

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,320
是的
Yes.

46
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,800
那弗兰克怎么办?
But what about Frank?

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
他这周末才回来
Well, he's not back till the weekend.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,760
只有四天了
That's only four days.

49
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,360
我得亲口告诉他 这是他应得的
He needs to hear it from me. He deserves that.

50
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

51
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
确定
Yes.

52
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,360
这就是我想要的 山姆
This is what I want, Sam.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,160
这一切都是我想要的
It's all I want.

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
这是你想要的吗?
Is it what you want?

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
是的
Yeah.

56
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,360
你明天晚上有空吗 卡拉汉先生?
Are you free tomorrow night, Mr Callaghan?

57
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,520
康拉德没事吧?
Is Conrad alright?

58
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,560
- 你确定吗? - 只是有些割伤和瘀伤
- Are you sure? - Apart from some cuts and bruises.

59
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
大伙 看到这个了吗?
Guys, seen this?

60
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,240
时事日报的头条
Front page of The Chronicle.

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,480
目击证人... 陈苏玲小姐
'Eyewitness... Miss Ch'en Su Ling.'

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,960
这下可瞒不了你父母了
Just what your parents don't need to know.

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,680
等等 他们为什么指责林杰志教授?
Hang on, why are they blaming Professor Lim Chee Kit?

64
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,200
似乎爆炸案的幕后操手是工会
Seems like the union is behind the bombing.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
但我认识林教授 这绝对不可能
But I know Professor Lim. That's impossible.

66
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,840
他只主张非暴力
He advocates nonviolence only.

67
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
是啊 非暴力炸弹
Yeah, nonviolent bombs.

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,160
他们炸毁了一个纹章 没人死亡
They blew up a coat of arms. Nobody died.

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,960
他们可能想说 看吧 独立就是个笑话
They might be trying to say, look, independence is a joke

70
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
我们还是在英国人的控制之下
and we're still under British control.

71
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
他们炸毁了一栋楼!
They blew up a building!

72
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,400
郑夫人
Mrs Cheng.

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,400
林先生 您怎么会下榻此地?
Mr Lim. To what do we owe the pleasure?

74
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,460
我哥哥和昨晚的爆炸案一点关系都没有
My brother had nothing to do with last night's bombing.

75
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,440
警察可不这么想
That's not what the cops think.

76
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,640
但是即使他们找到他 也不会逮捕他
But if they find him, they're not going to arrest him.

77
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,200
他们会杀了他 杀一儆百
They will make an example of Chee Kit, and they will kill him.

78
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
他们为何要怎么做?
Why would they do that?

79
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
你目击了昨晚的事
You saw what happened last night.

80
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,240
那个男人 没有武器 他们还是打死了他
The man, he was unarmed, and still they shot him.

81
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,240
特务处和政府觉得
Well, Special Branch and the government

82
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,760
齐基特是政治威胁
see Chee Kit as a political threat.

83
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,400
我们能为你做什么?
What can we do for you?

84
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
我想带齐基特去海外
I want to take Chee Kit offshore.

85
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,040
国内安全法规定
Internal Security Act.

86
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,400
要是警察抓到我们带危险分子离开岛内...
The cops catch us taking a subversive off the island...

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,360
..那就要去樟宜坐牢了
..it's a long holiday in Changi.

88
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,320
我不是让你带他走 只是找到他就好
I'm not asking you to take him, just find him.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,920
等风头过了 我会自己安排船
And when it's safe, I'll arrange a boat myself.

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,560
你有很多关系网 为什么你不自己找?
You're well connected. Why can't you find him?

91
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,880
我想他不会想见我 但...
I don't think he would want me to, but...

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,480
..毕竟他是我哥哥
..he's my brother.

93
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,600
为什么詹姆斯・林想让他哥哥离开岛内?
Why would James Lim want to get his brother off the island?

94
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,400
齐基特很有社会正义感...
Chee Kit is Mr Social Justice...

95
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,440
是为马来西亚着想的马来西亚人
Malaysians for Malaysia and all that.

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,360
詹姆士不介意红毛吗?
And James doesn't mind the ang mo?

97
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
只要他能从我们这获利
As long as he can make money off us.

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,120
詹姆士有野心 政治野心
The word is, James has ambitions, political ambitions.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,760
或许这就是他希望他哥哥离开的原因
Maybe that's why he wants his brother gone.

100
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,960
安格 我要一杯祭奠酒
Ange, I need a libation.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,640
我刚给过你一杯
I just poured you one.

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,920
我还能说什么呢? 我喜欢你的服务
Well, what can I say? I love the service.

103
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,160
天哪 迈卡
Jesus, Macca.

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,000
你认识山姆・卡拉汉吗?
Have you met Sam Callaghan?

105
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,960
没 但我听说过你 你是个调查员
No, but I've heard about you. You're the investigator.

106
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
安格・沃诺克 很高兴见到你

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,520

I hear you have contacts in Chinatown.

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
是吗? 谁告诉你的?

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,880
你随时可以来找我
You can always talk to me, you know.

111

想当记者
Wannabe journalist.

115
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
她很有才
She's good.

116
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,520
如果她老跟你聊 可成不了才
She won't be if she talks to you.

117
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,160
阿姆兰探长 对昨晚的枪击案有何看法?
Inspector Amran. Any comments on the shooting last night?

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
去和公共联络组谈吧
Go speak to the Public Liaison Unit.

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,960
你的朋友康在哪里?
Where's your friend Kang?

120
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
为什么问他? 他做了什么?
Why, what's he done?

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
他是我们昨晚击毙的恐怖分子的已知同谋
He's a known associate of the terrorist we shot last night.

122
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,200
已知同谋? 嘿 那是啥意思?
A 'known associate'. Hey, what's that mean?

123
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,040
告诉你朋友 只要他能来自首
Tell your friend it will be safer for everyone

124
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
这样对大家都好
if he comes in on his own accord.

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,560
别太生气
Don't get too pissed.

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,280
当然不会
Of course not.

127
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,280
你昨晚被兰利的人盯上了
You got noticed last night at Langley.

128
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
我被打晕了就引起他们关注了?
Getting knocked out got me noticed?

129
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,840
手无寸铁去抓恐怖分子 勇气可嘉 他们喜欢

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,120
炸弹袭击引起了他们的警戒
The bomb attack got their attention.

131

哈里森先生不是童子军
Mr Harrison is not a boy scout.

193
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
你没跟他说过 对吧?
You didn't tell him, did you?

194

我在帮你和费利克斯重归于好
I'm going to try and get you and Felix back together.

He's an accountant. Sounds like a solid chap.

196
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,920
山姆 你怎么了? 怎么这么开心?
Sam, what's wrong with you? Why are you happy?

197
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,406
有吗? 我怎么没注意到  
Am I? I hadn't noticed. 

198
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:46,120
你肯定是发烧了
It's got to be a fever.

199
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
我应该取消这次见面
I should call this meeting off.

200
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200

201
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,120
没什么 别停
Nothing. Keep walking.

202
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,634
我们被跟踪了吗? 
Are we being followed?  

203
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,440
我估计是 只是想确定一下
I think so. I just want to make sure.

204
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,661
谁会跟踪我们? 
Who would follow us?  

205

不知道 警察 政治保安部的人

这个叫山姆・卡拉汉的人
This Sam Callaghan,

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,280
他可能是英国或者美国的间谍
he could be spying for the British or the Americans.

214
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,640
不会的 山姆是澳洲人 他不是间谍 我保证
No, Sam's Australian, and he's not a spy, I promise.

215

帮帮我

216

你现在已经变成大美女了
You've become a very beautiful woman.

217

我早就知道你是个美女

218
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,280
费利克斯 你真知道林博士藏在哪里吗?
Felix, do you really know where Professor Lim is hiding?

没错
Yes.

220
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,240
我们跟你一样不想让警察参和进来
We don't want the police involved any more than you do,

221
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,960
但是詹姆斯・林说他很担心
but James Lim says he's worried,

222
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,100
所以我只是想代表他跟林博士说几句
so I just want to speak to Professor Lim for him.

223
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,040

245
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,760
陈苏玲
Ch'en Su Ling.

246
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,160
林教授 好久不见 见到你很高兴

他担心警察会抓到你

251
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,520
现在詹姆士唯一担心的 像他自己说的
The only thing that ever worried James, as he calls himself now,

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,240
就是银行余额
is his bank balance.

253
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
他想让我离开这里 不是吗?
He wants me to leave the country, doesn't he?

254
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
他说他不想让你死或者去樟宜坐牢
He said he didn't want you dead or in Changi.

255
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,680
如果我走了 就不能为我的人民做事了
If I leave, I can't do anything for my people.

256
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,160
所以请告诉他你找到我了
So please, tell him you have found me,

257
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,960
我会谢谢他的关心

258
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,200
但是我会继续呆在新加坡

259
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,800
但是 林教授 有人昨天被杀了
But, Professor Lim, a man was killed yesterday.

260

263
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
为什么我们在这里见面?
Why are we meeting here anyway?

264
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,760
康拉德 怎么了?

265
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,173
你说过我们认识以前 
You said that before we met 

266
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:13,520
你就是个梳马尾辫的姑娘
you were just a pigtailed girl.

267
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,400
你希望地方自治 民主 如此而已
You wanted home rule,democracy . That's all.

268
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,160
是这样的 怎么了?
Yeah, that's true. Why? 

269
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,560
我发现一篇有关你的情报
I found an intelligence report on you.

270
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,800
- 是六年前的 是罪证 - 这不可能
- It's from six years ago, but it's incriminating.- Oh, it can't be.

271
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,360
我看完了整个文件 确定只有一份
I went through the rest of the files, made sure there was only one.

272
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
上面说什么?
What does it say?

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,560
说你曾经组织学生抗议
It says that you used to organise student protests

274
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,560
而你就是...
and that you were a...

275
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
...共产党的支持者
..communist sympathiser.

276
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,200
你怎么能信这个呢?
How can you believe that?

277
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,920
这是真的吗?
Is that true?

278
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,680
我 陈苏玲 庄严地发誓我不是共产党的人
I, Ch'en Su Ling, solemnly swear that I am not,

279
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
现在不是 从前也不是 
nor have I ever been, a member of the Communist Party.

280
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,480
这不是玩笑
This is not a joke.

281
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,240
谁写的报告?
Who wrote the report?

282
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,591
不知道 从来没听说过他 
I don't know. Never heard of him. 

283
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,600
是个叫费利克斯・姚的人
It's a guy named Felix Yao.

284
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
- 姚? - 姚
- Yao? - Yao

285
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,080
对 你认识他吗?
Yeah. Do you know him?

286
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,520
- 是的 - 你上次见他是什么时候?
- Yes. - When was the last time you saw him?

287
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,400
- 今天 - 今天? 为什么?
- Today. - Today? Why?

288
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,320
为了郑夫人 这一定有什么误会
For Mrs Cheng. There's got to be a mistake.

289
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,800
我已经好几年没见过他了
I hadn't seen him in years,

290
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
但是他绝对不会这样诽谤我
but he would never say these things about me.

291
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,480
他六年前死了
Well, six years ago he did,

292
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,925
如果这些文件泄漏了
and if this file ever gets out, 

293
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:26,640
你将永远不会得到美国签证
you will never get a US visa.

294
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,680
但是康拉德 为什么他要给我造谣?
But Conrad, why would he lie about me?

295
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,760
我不知道
I don't know.

296
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,760
他为什么要这样?
Why would he?

297
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
不要跑 我们是警察 站住别跑!

298
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
我们是警察 站住别跑!

299
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,000
好吧! 好了
OK, OK, OK! Alright.

300
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,500
警官 不要再开了啦 警官

301
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,500
你们要的话我送你们一盒

302
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,500
这个是特别高级的

303
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,240
特别高级
Extra special.

304
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
这是什么?

305
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
警官我什么都不知道

306
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
这不是我的 OK?

307
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,940
这不是我的 不是我的

308
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,940
你要相信我 这不是我的

309
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
警官

310
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,480
山姆 我是被陷害的
Sam, I was set up.

311
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,920
爆炸后的一天 警察搜查了整个海港
The day after the bombing, cops crawling all over the harbour,

312
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,520
- 你却走私炸药? - 不 我没有
- and you smuggle in C-4? - No, I didn't.

313
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,520
- 我没警告过你吗? - 先听我说行吗?
- Didn't I warn you? - Would you just listen to me?

314
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,600
不管他们给我多少钱
No matter how much money they offer me,

315
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,800
你认为我会傻到携带炸药?
do you actually think I'm that stupid, to bring in C-4?

316
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
你真认为我这么傻吗?
Do you really think I'm that stupid?

317
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
阿姆兰认为你是
Amran thinks you are.  

318
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,080
那个人总是看我不顺眼
That guy always had something against me.

319
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
好吧 那你怎么处理这件事
Well, what are we going to do about it?

320
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,040
你知道被指控走私罪会怎么样
You know what the charge is for a smuggling offence.

321
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,520
他们会杀了你
They're going to hang you.

322
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
所以说你得相信我 山姆
That's why you have to believe me, Sam.

323
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,440
你得相信我 我是被陷害的
You have to believe me. I was set up.

324
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,280
好 我相信你
Yeah, I believe you.

325
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
我不就是把你弄出来吗
My opinion isn't going to get you out of here.

326
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,240
- 谁雇的你? - 就是有一批亚力酒的人
- Who hired you? - Just some guy with a shipment of arak.

327
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,200
- 你现在还想着保护他? - 我不是
- You're going to protect him now? - I'm not pro...

328
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,400
好吧 你肯定不想听到这些
Fine. You're not going to like this.

329
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,040
我不知道是谁 但我知道我为什么被陷害
I don't know who, but I think I know why I was set up.

330
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,120
我曾经给工会运过亚力酒
I have been transporting arak for the unions.

331
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,440
爆炸以后 即使知道阿姆兰在找你?
After the bombing, knowing Amran is looking for you?

332
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,800
这只是份工作 好吧?
It was just a job, OK?

333
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,760
我就是在赚钱 把亚力酒带到工会俱乐部
I was making money, bringing in arak for union clubs.

334
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,320
就这么多 就这样 好吧?
That's all. That was it, OK?

335
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,840
没有枪支 没有爆炸物 没那回事 山姆
No guns, no explosives, nothing like that, Sam.

336
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,120
我发誓 我发誓 我是被陷害的
I swear  I swear, man I was set up.

337
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,680
好吧
Alright.

338
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,480
你认为是我的人把炸药放到船上的?
You think my men planted C-4 on his boat?

339
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,360
- 我是说 他是被陷害的 - 被谁?
- That's not what I'm saying, but he was set up.- By who?

340
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,120
我不知道 他曾经为工会走私亚力酒 就这样
I don't know. He was smuggling arak for the unions. That's it.

341
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,640
别这样 你知道康
Oh, come on. You know Kang.

342
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,400
他就会投机取巧 不过不是激进分子
He's an opportunist, but he's not an activist.

343
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
他不会走私炸药的
He's not going to smuggle C-4.

344
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,320
- 你现在找到什么吗? - 还没有
- Have you found anything yet? - Not yet.

345
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,848
好吧 你们根本找不到 
Well, you're not going to.  

346
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:22,720
我们会继续搜查
We'll keep searching.

347
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,560
我们要扣押你的船 直到康被审判
And... we're impounding your boat until Kang's trial.

348
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
等一下 等一下
Oh, hang on, hang on.

349
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,120
你甚至没有考虑过康可能是被陷害的吗?
You're not even going to consider the possibility that Kang was set up?

350
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,200
如果你错了 他要被吊死
If you're wrong, he'll hang.

351
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,560
我来告诉你我考虑的是什么
I'll tell you what I'll consider.

352
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,040
带林杰志来见我
Bring me Lim Chee Kit,

353
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
我可能会把你朋友往积极的方面想
I may take a favourable view towards your friend.

354
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,240
你认为齐基特计划了爆炸事件?
You think Chee Kit planted the explosives?

355
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,480
我不知道 但你把他带来的时候我会考虑
I don't know, but I'll consider that when you bring him to me.

356
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,440
为什么 所以你要带他去见警察?
Why, so you can take him to the police?

357
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,920
不 我只是想和他说话  
No, I just want to talk to him.

358
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,240
你认为他是无辜的 是吗?
You think he's guilty, don't you?

359
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,840
我不知道 我想找到谁该对爆炸事件负责
I don't know. I want to find out who's responsible for the bombing.

360
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
- 我说了 不是林教授 - 你又不知道
- I told you. It's not Professor Lim. - But you don't know that.

361
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,720
但我知道如果找不到谁在他船上藏了爆炸物
But I know Kang will hang

362
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,920
康会被吊死
if we can't find out who planted explosive on his boat.

363
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,400
你想看他被吊死吗?
Do you want to see him hang?

364
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,800
对不起 我无能为力
Sorry. There's nothing I can do.

365
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
- 不许动 - 你想干什么?
- Don't move. - What do you want from me?

366
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,560
- 你是谁? - 你不会想知道的
- Who are you? - You don't want to know.

367
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,400
我没做错任何事情 
I've done nothing wrong. 

368
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,640
不许动 这不对 费利克斯
Don't move. That's not true, Felix.

369
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,760
别看我
Don't look at me.

370
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,400
这是你的签名吗?
Is that your signature?

371
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,520
- 你从哪得到的? - 这是你的签名吗?
- Where did you get it from? - Is that your signature?

372
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,440
是
Yes.

373
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,960
现在 你指控陈苏...
Now, you accused Ch'en Su...

374
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,600
别看我!
Don't look at me!

375
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,000
你指控 陈苏玲是共产党的支持者
You accused Ch'en Su Ling of being a communist sympathiser.

376
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,600
- 是真的吗? - 不!
- Is that true? - No!

377
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,320
那你为什么要撒谎 费利克斯?
Then why did you lie, Felix?

378
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
我很生气
I was angry.

379
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,240
我的父母...
My parents...

380
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,560
...他们以为我们会很合适
..they thought that we'd be a good match together,

381
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
但是她对我没有兴趣
but she just wasn't interested in me.

382
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,800
所以你做了一个假报告 是吗? 是不是?
So you made a false report, did you? Did you?

383
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,761
我会撤回那个 
I'll retract it. 

384
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,480
我会告诉他们我撒谎了闭嘴 闭嘴
I'll tell them I lied. Shut up, shut up.

385
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
接下来 你什么也不要说
This is what you're going to do. You're going to say nothing.

386
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,280
如果有任何人问起你那上面有什么
If anyone ever asks you what was in that,

387
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,680
你就否认你交过它 明白了吗?
you're going to deny you ever gave it, is that understood?

388
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,560
是的 我什么也不说
Yes. I will say anything.

389
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,480
如果我再听到你说陈苏玲任何消息
If I ever hear of you giving information on Ch'en Su Ling again

390
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,360
我会再来这 我知道你住在哪
I will come back here. I know where you live.

391
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
现在 站起来 面向墙 别看着我
Now, get up, face the wall. Don't look at me.

392
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,720
别看我 面向墙
Don't look at me. Face the wall.

393
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,720
数到五十
Count to 50.

394
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
好的
OK.

395
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,040
肯定是工会的人指使的阿拉克
It must have been one of the union guys that ordered the arak.

396
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,720
在找到你之前就已经装好了
It would have been loaded in before it got to you.

397
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,800
我猜是的
Yeah, I guess.

398
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,400
但是我说了 我认不出来他们
But I told you  I can't identify any of them.

399
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,560
我们要找出齐基特
We've got to find Chee Kit.

400
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,080
也许他知道些什么
Maybe he knows something.

401
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,640
如果是齐基特干的呢?
What if it WAS Chee Kit?

402
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,240
我会把他带来
I'll bring him in.

403
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,200
投弹手就交给你了 这是和阿姆兰的交易
The bomber for you. That was the deal with Amran.

404
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,560
你知道我上哪能找到他吗?
Do you know where I can find him?

405
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,400
康?
Kang?

406
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,000
我不知道他住在哪...
I don't know where he lives...

407
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,640
...但我知道他在哪祷告
...but I do know where he prays.

408
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,120
别再跟踪我了 任务结束了
Stop tailing me. The job's finished.

409
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,640
你的兄弟不相信你不是我们的错
It's not our fault your brother doesn't trust you.

410
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,240
他知道你和阿姆兰探员之间的交易吗?
Does he know about your deal with Inspector Amran?

411
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,640
我在警察局有很多人脉
I have many sources in the police department,

412
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,920
我会毫不犹豫的利用他们
and I wouldn't hesitate to use them

413
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,440
来保护我哥哥
to protect my brother.

414
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
不好意思

415
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,920
新加坡的大街上已经有
Already there's too much violence

416
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,560
太多暴力事件了
on the streets of Singapore.

417
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,680
我们的组织对这些事没有采取任何措施
Our union has never resorted to such things.

418
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,480
时代在改变

419
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,980
我们不应该继续被外国人欺压

420
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,480
这件事是应该被表扬的

421
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
- 是我吩咐的 - 你应该!

422
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
我们的人民已经厌倦了等待！

423
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
那是一次错误

424
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,080
唯一的错误是

425
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,980
炸药不够

426
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,880
我们的目标应该是内阁会议

427
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,920
不! 如果我们杀掉政府官员
No! If we kill government officials,

428
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,560
那么就不会再有人支持我们了
there will be no support among the people.

429
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,280
- 那就把他们都干掉 - 不!
- Then we'll take them all out. - No!

430
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
每个炸弹都会让英国人
Every bomb is another excuse

431
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,240
有理由把军队留下来
for the British to leave their troops here.

432
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,080
只要我还是工会的领头人
While I am the leader of this union,

433
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,800
我们就不能使用暴力
we will not use violence.

434
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
警察 举手站起来!

435
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,000
不! 不能用枪
No! No guns.

436
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,120
不能用枪!
No guns!

437
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,520
如果你不想死

438
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,720
跟我来

439
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,640
- 你是谁? - 苏玲的朋友
- Who are you? - A friend of Su Ling's.

440
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
你别无选择
You've got no choice.

441
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,360
这边
This way.

442
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,560
你为什么要帮我?
Why are you helping me?

443
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,360
我不想和我哥哥有任何关系
I don't want anything to do with my brother.

444
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,244
我不为你哥哥工作 
I don't work for your brother. 

445
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,440
我这么做是为了小康 - 康?
I'm doing this for Xiao Kang. - Kang?

446
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
他是我的朋友 他被陷害了 现在在监狱
He's a friend of mine. He's in prison for something he didn't do.

447
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,040
警察为什么抓他?
What do the police think he did?

448
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,760
他们认为他为你们工会走私炸药
They think he smuggled explosives for your union.

449
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,800
他们是对的
They're right.

450
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,720
等等 等等!
Wait. Wait!

451
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,400
我说了 等下! 你说什么 康做了什么?
I said, wait! What are you talking about, what did Kang do?

452
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
你想听实话?
You want the truth?

453
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,120
康为高和那些好战分子走私炸药
Kang smuggled weapons for Gao and the militant ones.

454
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,600
不 不 不 不 他没有
No. No, no. No, he didn't.

455
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,840
但他和邮局的事没有关系
But he had nothing to do with the post office.

456
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,400
那都是高义做的
That was all Gao Yi.

457
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,400
我劝过他 但是...
I tried to get him to stop but...

458
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
救我
Help me.

459
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,600
坚持下 叫救护车!
Hang in there. Get an ambulance!

460
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,440
快点 叫救护车!
Quickly, get an ambulance!

461
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,760
齐基特没有命令袭击邮局
Chee Kit didn't order the attack on the post office.

462
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,600
谁命令的?
Who did?

463
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,200
他说应该是高义
He said it could have been Gao Yi.

464
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,040
你看到是谁开枪打的他吗?
Did you see who shot him?

465
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
嘿 山姆... 我有个主意
Hey, Sam... I've got an idea.

466
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,240
叔叔? 如果我想找个医生来取出子弹
Uncle? If I was looking for a doctor to take out a bullet,

467
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,960
不能问问题 我该去哪?
no questions asked, where would I go?

468
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,060
不能找医生啊

469
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
为什么?

470
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
他们会报警

471
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,960
我带你去找后门的医生

472
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,760
见到这个很惊讶吗?
Surprised to see that?

473
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320
我不知道这是什么
I don't know what it is.

474
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,280
这需要点说服力 但是那个后门医生
It took some persuading, but that backstreet doctor

475
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,600
已经承认是他从彭立的肩膀取出这颗子弹的
admitted that he pulled it out of Peng Li's shoulder.

476
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
- 彭立 我的手下? - 是的
- Peng Li who works for me? - That's right.

477
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,680
他今晚没来上班
He didn't show up to work tonight.

478
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,120
我想知道发生了什么事
I wondered what had happened.

479
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,120
你哥哥可能要死了
Your brother is probably going to die.

480
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,240
他能告诉警察什么 让你这么害怕?
What is it you're so scared that he could possibly tell the police?

481
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,320
我听说你当时在那
I heard you were there.

482
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,720
在我哥哥中枪之前他说什么了吗?
Did my brother say anything before you let him get shot?

483
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,200
总有一天你会后悔这么说的
You're going to regret saying that one day.

484
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,240
你不会想成为我的敌人的 卡拉汉先生
You don't want me to be an enemy, Mr Callaghan.

485
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,120
现在说这个有点晚了
It's a bit late for that.

486
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,320
如果你的人跟踪警察...
If your man followed the cops...

487
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,880
...他们怎么知道我在哪的?
...how the hell did they know where I was?

488
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,000
交易就是交易 对吧?
A deal's a deal, huh?

489
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,720
他们抓到投弹手然后放我走了
They caught the bomber and they let me go.

490
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,880
我欠你个人情 伙计 谢谢
I owe you one, man. Thanks.

491
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,880
那么... 齐基特还能活命吗?
So is... Chee Kit going to live?

492
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,000
你还关心这个? 是你告诉警察他在哪的
What do you care? You told the police where he was.

493
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,080
你为什么不等等? 我会把他活着弄出来的
Why didn't you wait? I would have got him out alive.

494
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,720
我别无选择 伙计 他们已经知道...
I didn't have a choice, man. They already knew...

495
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,240
你一直都有选择
You've always got a choice.

496
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,960
警察欠你的 康 他们欠你的!
The police own you, Kang. They own you!

497
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,360
听着 我当初就告诉你了 不是我没说
Look, I told you about this first. It's not like I didn't tell you.

498
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,160
至少和你在这 我觉得 你知道
At least with you there, I thought, you know,

499
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,360
齐基特还有机会出来
Chee Kit could have a chance that he could get out.

500
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,560
我知道他和邮局的事无关
I knew he had nothing to do with the post office.

501
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,163
为什么我要相信你? 
Why should I believe you? 

502
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:37,040
你陷害我 你欺骗我工会的事
You set me up, you lied about the unions,

503
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,960
欺骗我走私的事 欺骗我关于齐基特的事
you lied about the smuggling, you lied about Chee Kit.

504
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,160
- 你陷害我 康! - 他们要杀了我!
- You set me up, Kang! - They were going to hang me!

505
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,320
我早就知道你是在装无辜
I always knew you'd play an angle.

506
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,080
这对我来说没什么
I didn't have a problem with that.

507
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,640
但我从来... 从来没想到你会这样欺骗我
But I never... I never thought you'd lie to me like that.

508
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,400
他可能就要死了
He's probably going to die.

509
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,040
我们结束了
We're done.

510
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,960
我们早就结束了 山姆
We've been done for a while, Sam.

511
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,840
你好啊 亲爱的
Hello, darling.

512
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,360
你看起来 跟平常一样漂亮
You look beautiful, as usual.

513
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
我们可以走了吗?
Shall we?

514
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,280
我... 我觉得我们该回去
I... I think we should go.

515
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,240
听着 对不起 克莱尔
Look, I'm so sorry, Claire.

516
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,240
我知道 过去这六个月 我几乎每周末都出差
I know, these last six months, I've been gone nearly every weekend.

517
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,200
- 弗兰克... - 不 请你让我说完
- Frank... - No, let me finish, please.

518
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,080
我跟麦斯威尔谈过了
I've spoken to Maxwell.

519
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,080
他也同意我一直在干着三个人的活儿
He agrees I've been doing the job of three men.

520
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,228
所以 他会给我请个助手 
So, he's getting me an assistant 

521
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:06,720
还给我一个周的假期
and giving me a two-week vacation

522
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,680
从今晚开始
starting tonight.

523
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,724
你想去哪里我们就去哪里... 
We can go anywhere you want...

524
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:13,840
意大利 澳大利亚 美国
Italy, Australia, the US.

525
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,920
随便说
You name it.

526
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,760
我哪里也不想去
I don't want to go anywhere.

527
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,360
那我们就待在这儿 放松一下 睡个懒觉
Then we can stay here. Relax, sleep late.

528
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,760
- 随便你想干什么 - 弗兰克...
- Whatever you want to do. - Frank...

529
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
...我真的觉得我们该回家
...I really think we should go home.

530
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,960
怎么了?
What's wrong?

531
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,920
听着 我不想在这里说 我觉得我们该回家
Look, I don't want to do this here. I think we should go home.

532
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,400
说什么? 怎么了?
Do what here? What is it?

533
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,840
克莱尔?
Claire?

534
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,040
弗兰克 我喜欢上了别人 我要搬走了
Frank, I've met someone. I'm moving out.

535
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,320
谁?
Who?

536
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,120
弗兰克...
Frank...

537
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,680
- 是谁? - 嘘!
- Who is it? - Shh!

538
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,000
我想喊就喊

山姆・卡拉汉

541
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,120

547

549
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,280

550
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,720
我回家收拾一下东西

551
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,960

552
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,480

我想见山姆 不过他还没回来
I was supposed to meet Sam, but he hasn't come back yet.

570

恐怕我帮不了你  
I'm afraid I can't help you. 

571
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:48,920
拜托 他说他会在这里的

572

稍等一下

578
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,580

你确定想看到这些吗?

几个小时之内他哪里都不能去

583
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,000
最好让他睡一会儿

584

不用担心 我早上会带他回家的

588
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,960
康拉德 怎么了?

589
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,680
我销毁了你的文档

590
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,360
我跟你的朋友费利克斯聊了聊
I had a chat to your buddy Felix.

591
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,560
我觉得他不会再找你麻烦了

592
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,200
- 你做了什么? - 没什么
- What did you do? - Nothing.

593
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,360
我们只是... 聊了聊
We just... had a little talk.

594
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,080
但是从现在开始你必须低调行事
But I need you to stay under the radar from now on.

595
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,800
- 康拉德 看 雷达呢 - 苏玲... 
- Conrad, look radar. - Su Ling...

596
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,040
好吧 我什么也不干
OK. Yes, I'm not doing anything.

597
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,480
不准聚会 不准跟你的朋友们谈论美国什么的
No rallies. No talking to your friends about the US or anything.

598
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,960
都不准
Nothing.

599
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,373
要多久?  
For how long? 

600
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:30,400
只要你还想要签证就得这样

601

我把文件销毁了
I got rid of the file,

602
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,080
但我不确定他们只有那一份材料
but I can't be certain that's the only one they have.

603
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,240
要是他们发现你有这么一段前科还在制造麻烦
If they find out you've got a history and see you making trouble

604
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,240
还跟人们谈论越南的事
and talking to people about Vietnam or anything,

605
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,400
他们就会撤回你的签证并且把你遣回家
they will revoke your visa and they will send you home.

606
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,480
- 不 他们不能这样 - 不 他们能
- No, they can't do that. - Yes, they can do that.

607
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,040
因为有前科的人是不能得到学习签证的
Because people with histories don't get study visas.

608
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,520
我要你向我保证

609
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,160
从现在开始你会保持低调

610
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,960
我保证 都听你的

哈里森先生

612
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,760
我能跟你说两句吗?
Can we have a word?

613
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,960
恐怕要单独谈谈
Alone, I'm afraid.

614
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,520
女孩子很漂亮呢
Pretty girl.

615
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,480
你想让我找到她的档案
You wanted me to find her file.

616
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,400
所以你才给我们情报
That's why you gave us the intelligence.

617
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,560
别担心 这些只有这么多了
Don't worry. These go no further than here.

618
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,960
我们有很多有意思的照片
We have many interesting photographs.

619
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,560
听说你搞丢了一些澳大利亚女孩
Heard you lost a couple of Australian girls.

620
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,360
她们没上船
The girls weren't on the ship when it docked

621
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,480
并且在新加坡乘客没有登陆记录
and Customs has no record of disembarkation in Singapore.

622
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,280
要不他们会杀了她们
拢10,000 or they'll kill 'em.

623
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,084
谁控制岸边这一带? 
Who controls the waterfront? 

624
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:16,400
凯・索和他的团伙
Kay Song and his thugs.

625
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,373
"格雷齐尔的女儿相当恐怖" 
'Grazier's Daughter Triad Horror.' 

626
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:19,280
这故事里面说的
The story writes itself.

627
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,680
你应该感激我没有即刻杀了你
You should be grateful I don't kill you where you stand.

628
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,040
你是我和兰利的新纽带
You're my new conduit into Langley.

629
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,600
你想让我为你监视中情局?
You want me to spy on the CIA for you?

630
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,160
- 我看见你丈夫了 - 你看见?
- I saw your husband... - Did you see...?

631
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,297
就在他死的那晚 
...on the night he died.

632
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:31,520
你知道是怎么回事吗?
Do you know what happened?

633
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,720
振作点 你现在是一名真正的间谍了
Chin up. You're a real spy now.
