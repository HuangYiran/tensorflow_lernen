22
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,860
自那以后我們一直在追捕他

23
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,310
我們稱之為"布萊克組織"

今天我們很高興地宣布

單獨談話
Individually.

You are entitled to bring along an attorney or a union rep,

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,550
由你們自己選擇
should you so choose.

66
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,360
我們為何需要律師
Why would we need an attorney?

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,280
我們考慮得長遠點  金寶
Well, let's look at this from our perspective, Kimball.

68
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,990
你們的上司伯特侖是個罪犯
Your boss Bertram is a criminal.

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,670
所以有可能你們也是
Makes sense that you might be one, too.

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,900
我們會非常仔細地審視你們每個人
We will be looking very closely at all of you.

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,230
如果你們有任何
If you have ever done anything

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,590
只要一點點可疑的舉動
even remotely questionable,

73
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,870
我們都會發現
We will find out,

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,960
然后起訴你們
and we will prosecute.

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,020
當然了  除非
Unless, of course,

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,550
你們能夠配合  那我們會非常非常滿意
We feel very, very comfortable with your cooperation.

77
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,570
那樣你們就有點回旋的余地
Then you got a little wiggle room.

killed a cop at a gas station in East Sac.

116
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,060
我聽說了
I heard.

117
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,150
那你聽說了伯特侖當時在加油站做什么嗎
Did you hear what Bertram was doing at the gas station?

118
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,100
沒
No.

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,140
他在打公用電話
Using a pay phone.

120
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,660
猜猜他打給了誰
Guess who he was calling.

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,470
我猜是簡
I'm gonna guess Jane.

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,810
沒錯  那他在哪
Ahh. Yeah. So where is he?

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,790
我不知道
I don't know.

124

我認為你清楚得很
I think you do.

125
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,290
我沒法左右你的想法
I can't help what you think.

126
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,400
我認為你的男朋友和一名危險的逃犯勾結
I think your boyfriend is colluding with a dangerous fugitive.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,620
我認為他已經深陷布萊克組織中無法自拔
I think he is up to his neck in this Blake Association craziness,

128
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,120
可能你也是
and probably you are, too.

129
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,630
我不是  他也不是
I'm not. He's not.

130
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,500
簡無法阻止打給他的人
Jane can't help who calls him,

131
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,520
而且他也不是我的男朋友
and he's not my boyfriend.

132
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,600
真是太遺憾了  特蕾莎
It's a damn shame, Teresa.

133
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,170
人人都說
By all accounts...

134
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,140
你是個好警察
You were a good cop.

135
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,550
我現在依舊是
I still am.

136

頭兒
Hey, boss!

瑞斯比
Rigsby?

138
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,130
周圍安全嗎
Is it safe?

139
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,820
嗯  你們在干嘛
Yeah. What are you doing?

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,130
我們聽說了伯特侖今早干的事
We heard about what Bertram did this morning.

141
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,750
聽說聯調局的人在找我們
We heard the F.B.I. were looking for us.

142
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,470
所以現在是怎樣  你們就躲在停車場嗎
So what now? You're hiding in the parking lot?

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,370
我們不是躲起來  只是潛伏
No. No, we're not hiding. We're just... laying low.

144
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,300
我們暫時還安全
Well, we're safe for now.

145
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,680
至少現在還沒有下達對我們的逮捕令
There's no arrest warrant that's put out for us just yet.

146
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,660
他們遲早會的
Give 'em time.

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,580
簡在哪
Where's Jane?

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,750
別問
Don't ask.

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,780
她剛已經問了
She just did.

150
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,500
聽我說
Listen to me.

151
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,710
如今加調局已經不復存在了
The C.B.I. is gone now.

152
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,810
我們只能靠自己了  你們得保護好自己
We're on our own. You need to protect yourselves.

153
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,520
你們不知道簡在哪里  他在干什么
You don't know where Jane is, you don't know what he's doing,

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,040
也不想知道  明白了嗎
and you don't want to know, you understand?

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,460
明白  頭兒
Yes, boss.

156
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,100
-明白  頭兒  -明白  頭兒
- Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.

157
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,510
那就好
All right then.

158
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,930
但我已經不是你們的頭兒了  關鍵就在這里
But I am not your boss anymore. That's the point.

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,230
我們只能靠自己
We're on our own.

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,430
我們明白的
Yeah, we get it.

161
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,800
那他在哪
So where is he?

162
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,530
{\pos(191.4,278.4)}加州  薩克拉門托  威廉蘭德公園

163
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,570
你被通緝了
You're a wanted man.

164
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,530
我想也是
Well, I like to think so.

165
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,940
我說真的  艾伯特給你下了逮捕令
Seriously. Abbott put an actual warrant out on you.

166
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,690
也不是第一次了
Eh. It's not the first time.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,550
所以你到底要不要告訴我
So you gonna tell me, or what?

168
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,930
哦對  伯特侖打給我了
Oh, yeah. Uh... Bertram called me.

169
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,120
我知道
I know.

170
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,130
他說了些什么
What did he say?

171
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,540
不管他想說什么  他那時沒時間
Well, whatever he wanted to say, he didn't have time.

172
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,790
為什么他還在城里
Why the hell is he still here?

173
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,090
他想做什么
What does he want?

174
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,580
我猜他會很快再打來告訴我
I'm guessing he'll call back soon and tell me.

175
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,240
你的手機不安全  聯調局...
Your phone's not safe. The F.B.I.--

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,140
對  他們裝了竊聽
Yeah, they have a tap on the line.

177
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,360
但他們還沒追蹤到
But they don't have a trace yet.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
如果他們追蹤到了  我現在就早該被捕了
If they had a trace, then I'd be arrested already.

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,310
也許如此  但他們早晚會追蹤到你的
Maybe so, but sooner or later, they'll get a trace on you.

180
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,150
我知道
I know.

181
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,860
但在伯特侖打來之前我不能扔掉手機
But I can't get rid of my phone until Bertram calls.

182
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,380
所以事情就懸在這了
It's all very suspenseful.

183
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,360
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,170
誰
Who?

185
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,030
伯特侖
Bertram.

186
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,020
到時候就知道了
We'll see.

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,990
你在閃爍其詞
Now you're being evasive.

188
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,500
小鳥的眼睛圓又亮
What beady little eyes birds have.

189
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,250
《小恐龍》[系列童書]  你知道吧
Tiny Dinosaurs, you know?

190
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,050
我知道
I know.

191
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,380
我知道你很清楚他的意圖
I know you know what he wants.

192
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,450
他到底想干什么
What does he want?

193
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,870
-喂  -很抱歉我那時不得不掛電話
- Hello? - Oh, sorry I had to hang up on you.

194
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,220
今天實在太忙了
It's been a busy day.

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,850
沒關系  這個電話不安全
Yeah, no problem. You know, this phone is not safe.

196
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,360
我馬上再打給你
Let me call you back in a moment.

197
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,540
好的
Yeah.

198
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,370
他說什么
What'd he say?

199
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,670
稍等一下
Just a second.

200
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,220
你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

201
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,890
我給你一百美元換你的手機  行嗎
I'll give you $100 for that phone.

202
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,480
什么
Huh?

203
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,750
兩百美元換你的手機
$200 for that phone.

204
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,150
這是什么騙局嗎
What's the catch?

205
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,170
不是騙局
No catch.

206
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,650
三百美元  外加
$300 plus...

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,690
一部替代機
a replacement phone.

208
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,770
那好吧
Uh, okay.

209
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,970
哥們  我一會兒再打給你
Yeah, dude, I'll call you right back.

210
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,280
交易愉快
Pleasure doing business with you.

211
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,130
謝了  伙計
Thanks, man.

212
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,050
他剛才到底說了什么
What did he say?

213
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,940
我覺得我們應該見面好好談談
Look, I think we should meet and talk.

214
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,850
-就我們倆  -就像約會一樣嗎
- Just the two of us. - What, like a date?

215
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,530
是啊
Yes...

216
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,080
不
No.

217
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,750
聽著  游戲結束了
Look, the game is over.

218
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,940
我得說你我確實不分伯仲
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

219
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,700
但現在一切都結束了
And now that it's over,

220
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,860
我真的覺得我們應該好好談談
I really think that we should talk.

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,770
停戰  不帶武器  不玩花招
You know, a truce. No weapons, no tricks.

222
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,110
就談談
Just talk.

223
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,960
然后各行其道
Then we both walk away.

224
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,280
談談  談什么
Talk. About what?

225
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,340
什么都談
Well... everything.

226
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,330
我想我們都需要結束此事了  對吧
I think we both could use a little closure, don't you?

227
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,800
就在今天  現在
It has to be today. You know, now.

228
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,750
我時間有點緊
I'm kind of pressed for time.

229
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,130
我怎么知道能否相信你呢
How do I know I can trust you?

230
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,490
都到現在了就別膽小了  派翠克
Ah, don't be timid now, Patrick.

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,630
我有那么多機會殺你  卻都沒下手  不是嗎
I could have killed you many times, and I haven't, have I?

232
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,260
好吧  時間  地點
Okay. When and where?

233
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,840
非常好
Excellent.

234
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,640
半小時后弗里蒙特公園的噴泉邊見
I'll be at the Fremont Park fountain in half an hour.

235
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,390
不行  我不知道那個地方  中央汽車站見
No. Don't know it. Central bus station.

236
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,730
-北入口  -不行  那里人太多
- North entrance. - Nah, There's too many people.

237
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,840
而且警察太多
There's too many cops.

238
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,890
你知道亞歷山大公墓嗎
You know Alexandria Cemetery?

239
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,970
我當然知道
Of course I do.

240
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,960
西門那邊有個小教堂
Yeah, there's a chapel by the western gate.

241
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,540
行啊  半小時之后見
That--that'll do. Half an hour.

242
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,210
別遲到  我不能待太久
Don't be late. I can't wait around.

243
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,350
半小時之后見
Half an hour.

244
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,010
他說什么
What'd he say?

245
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,950
他想見我
He wants to meet with me.

246
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,250
這是個陷阱
It's a trap.

247
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,020
可能吧
Probably.

248
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,310
你準備怎么辦
Well, what are you gonna do?

249
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,820
我去見他
I'm gonna meet him.

250
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,850
不行
You can't.

251
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,800
相信我  我知道自己在干什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

252
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,670
簡  別去  你想想
Jane, don't do this. Think about it.

253
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,110
聯調局馬上就要抓到伯特侖了
The F.B.I. is gonna get Bertram soon enough.

254
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,050
我不想他落在聯調局手上
I don't want the F.B.I. to get him.

255
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,710
你知道這一天早晚會來
You knew this day was coming.

256
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,030
就是今天了
It's here.

257

那我和你一起去
Let me come with you.

258
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,520
不行  我不想讓你牽扯進來
No, I don't want you involved.

259
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,060
牽扯  我早就深陷其中了
Involved? I am involved.

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,010
再也不會了
Not anymore.

261
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,020
我要借你的槍
I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

262
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,700
我的槍
My gun?

263
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,840
是  你的槍  我不會開槍的
Yes, your gun. I'm not gonna use it.

264
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,950
就是壯壯膽
Just a prop.

265
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,250
特蕾莎  相信我  拜托
Teresa, trust me, please.

266

謝謝
Thank you.

268
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,560
那邊吧
Like that way.

269
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,690
謝了
Thanks.

270
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,780
疑犯逃跑
The suspect got moved.

271
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,390
負責人呢  艾伯特在哪兒
Where's the man in charge here? Where is Abbott?

272
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,530
跪下
Get down on your knees.

273
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,180
把手舉到我能看見的地方
Keep your hands where I can see them.

274
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,900
艾伯特在哪兒  我必須得走了
Where is Abbott? I-I have to go.

275
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,840
好了  淡定點  伙計們
All right, take it down a notch, people.

276
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,900
他又不是阿爾·卡彭
He's not Al Capone.

277
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,900
{\an8}著名黑幫老大

278
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,190
艾伯特  請聽我說
Abbott, please listen to me.

279
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,490
我看得出來你是個正人君子
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

280
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,320
我以我的名義發誓  我一小時之內就回去自首
On my honor, I will give myself up in an hour.

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,140
但是現在  我...  我要
But right now I just-- I just need...

282
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,270
只要
Just...

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,250
算了
Forget it.

284
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,460
別別別  告訴我
No. No, no, no, no. No, tell me.

285
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,350
起來
Come on.

286
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,440
你要干什么  你需要什么
No, what do you need? What do you need, huh?

287
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,910
你需要一小時
You need an hour?

288
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,590
干什么
For what?

289
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,410
你要去哪兒
Where are you going?

290
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,660
去見誰
Who are you gonna go meet?

291
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,200
不說嗎
No?

292
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,720
那回局里說怎么樣
Well, let's take a trip downtown, shall we?

293
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,700
沒事  讓她過來吧
No. You can let her go.

294
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,760
你好  里斯本女士
Hi, Miss Lisbon.

295
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,890
就算是咱們兩個警察間幫個忙  艾伯特
Do me this one favor, Abbott, cop to cop.

296
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,400
放他走  我發誓到時候一定把他帶回來
Let him go, and I swear I will bring him back later.

297
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,850
不可能
Not happening.

298
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,070
你們到底有什么緊急的事
And what is all this urgency I'm hearing here?

299
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,510
你們是跟伯特侖有約吧
You made a plan with Bertram.

300
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,230
是嗎  是這樣嗎
Is that it? Is that what you did?

301
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,850
拜托了  艾伯特
Please, Abbott.

302
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,940
聯調局  退后
FBI! Back it off!

303
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,130
-加調局  你給我退后  -怎么回事
- CBI. Back it up yourself. - What's this?

304
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,830
放他走  艾伯特  他什么也沒做錯
Let him go, Abbott. He's done nothing wrong.

305
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,060
好啊  各位
Hey, guys.

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,870
很高興見到你們
You know, I-it's good to see you.

307
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,470
我本來不想提的  但加調局已經不存在了
I hate to bring you down, but there is no CBI.

308
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,050
你們的警徽就是個玩具
That badge is a toy,

309
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,480
而你們只是在假扮警察
and you're all impersonating officers of the law.

310
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,910
隨你怎么說  放他走
Whatever. Let him go.

311
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,360
你是纏上我了是嗎
Are you mad-dogging me right now?

312
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,910
纏上聯調局了
The F.B.I.?

313
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,050
你說你是真的聯調局探員  有什么證據
You say you're legit F.B.I., but how do we know?

314
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,640
對  你們也許是布萊克組織的成員
Yeah, you could be members of the Blake Association

315
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,100
也不是沒可能
for all we know.

316
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
我們不是
We're not.

317
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,470
拿出證明來
Prove it.

318
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,400
你的手下里德·史密斯就是其中之一
Your man Reede Smith was a member.

319
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,000
你為什么不可能是
Why not you?

320
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
而且我們怎么知道簡會不會有危險
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

321
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,960
太荒唐了
That's absurd.

322
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,210
抱歉 艾伯特探員
I'm sorry, Agent Abbott,

323
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,050
但是在確保他的安全之前
but it is our duty to protect this man

324
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,440
保護好他是我們的責任
until we're assured his safety.

325
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,430
放他走
Let him go.

326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,000
別這樣  別這樣
No, no, no, no, no.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,390
沒事的  放下槍
It's all right. Just stand down.

328
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,460
各位都放下槍  沒必要起沖突
Stand down, guys. No bloodshed required.

329
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,780
沒事的
It's cool.

330
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,690
讓他走
Let him go.

331
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,420
開我的車
Take my car.

332
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,200
長官
Sir?

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
就讓他走
It's okay.

334
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,500
謝謝各位了
Thank you, guys!

335
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,720
沒事了
We done?

336
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,550
他走了  就沒事了
He's gone. We're done.

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,310
逮捕他們
Arrest them.

338
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,890
把你們的槍都放到地上
Put your guns down on the ground...

339
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,160
慢慢地
slowly.

340
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,210
照他說的做
Do as he says.

341
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:42,140
去追蹤里斯本探員的車
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

342
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,280
是  長官
Yes, sir.

343
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,010
你在我車上裝了追蹤器
You put a bug on my car?

344
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,050
要不我們怎么能找到簡
How do you think we found Jane?

345
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,590
我說過認識你們這些人我很高興
I said I was glad to see you people

346
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,140
因為我知道你們早晚要出簍子
because I knew you would screw up

347
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,200
能省我不少事
and make my life easy.

348
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,350
這不應驗了嗎
And you did just that.

349
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,980
謝謝
Thank you.

350
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,180
逮捕她
Arrest her.

351
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,260
走吧
Come on.

352
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,810
他還沒準備好呢
He wasn't ready for it.

353
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,180
沒錯
No.

354
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
看啊
Check it out.

355
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,270
看看這個
Check this out.

356
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,500
你好嗎
What's up?

357
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,610
能幫我看會兒車嗎
Uh, could you guys keep an eye on my car for me, please?

358
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,320
當然了  會看好的
Sure, I'll watch it.

359
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,480
謝謝
Thank you.

360
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,650
動手
Let's go.

361
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,540
好了  伙計  別擔心
Yeah, man, no worries.

362
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,220
等等
Hey there.

363
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,040
不好意思麻煩你了  女士
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

364
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,450
我長話短說
Uh, long story.

365
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,270
你愿不愿意載我一程
Uh, I need--I need a ride, if you're willing.

366
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,030
這里是四隊  我們看見那輛車了
This is Unit 4. We have the vehicle in sight,

367
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,300
停在第五大道和謝爾曼街交會處
stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

368
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,970
退后  先退后  他們可能就在那兒接頭
Stay back, stay back. This could be the meet.

369
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,780
搞什么鬼
What the heck?

370
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,220
四隊  什么情況
Unit 4, what's the situation?

371
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,580
四隊  回答  該死的
Unit 4, respond, damn it.

372
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,510
頭兒  里斯本車里就幾個孩子
Boss, it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

373
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,890
簡不在里面
Jane wasn't there.

374
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,080
沒有發現簡  重復  我們沒發現簡
We don't have Jane. Repeat. We don't have Jane.

375
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,950
是否收...
Do you co--

376
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,220
別再越錯越多了
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

377
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,790
他去哪兒了
Where did he go?

378
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,280
不知道
I don't know.

379
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
你們是不見棺材不落淚是吧
You guys really have a death wish, don't you?

380
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,620
長官  我們真的不知道
Sir, we really don't know.

381
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,620
長官  你居然還叫他長官
"Sir"? Why the hell are you calling him "Sir"?

382
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,100
別激動  "頭號公敵"
Oh, calm down, Dillinger.

383
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,100
{\an8}約翰.格林杰是蕭條時期聯調局追捕的最著名的黑幫頭目  曾兩度越獄

384
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,980
我們現在是階下囚  還是識相點吧
We're under arrest here. We might as well be civil.

385
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,090
干嘛  你是想住好一點的牢房
Why? You think you'll get a nicer cell?

386
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,060
非常感謝[西語]  奧雷利奧
Muchas gracias, Aurelio.

387
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,250
別客氣  祝你好運[西語]
De nada. Buena suerte.

Hey, Patrick.

391
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,970
得先得搜搜你身上有沒有武器
I'm gonna need to search you for weapons.

392
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,050
然后你才能進去  把手舉起來
So you can go ahead, put your hands up.

393
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,870
試下也無妨
Worth a shot.

394
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,660
你可以進去了
You can go in now.

395
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,330
派翠克
Patrick.

396
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,050
謝謝你這么準時
Thank you for being so punctual.

397
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,340
你騙了我
You lied to me.

398
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,230
你不也是
Oh. Well... as did you.

399
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,880
我們還真是倆無賴  對吧
What a couple of scamps we are, huh?

400
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,720
我保證  這是最后一次騙你了
I promise that is the last lie that I will ever tell you.

401
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,040
先說正事
So... first things first.

402
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,060
你和聯調局犯了個嚴重的錯誤
You and the feds have made a big mistake.

403
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,690
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

404
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,800
你說什么
What?

405
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,010
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

406
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,550
很抱歉讓你失望了
I-I'm sorry to disappoint you,

407
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,200
但是我只是布萊克組織
but I'm just a humble foot soldier

408
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,430
一員卑微走卒罷了
in the Blake Association.

409
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,010
血腥約翰可是高層
Red John is one of the top brass.

410
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,850
我不是很相信你
I'm not sure I believe you.

411
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,840
信不信隨你  但
Well... that's your privilege, but--

412
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
但是我說的是真的
But I am telling you the truth.

413
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,150
你們草率得出的結論是錯的
You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.

414
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,850
那么誰是血腥約翰
Okay, so who is Red John?

415
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,440
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

416
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,780
真的
No, h-honestly.

417
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,380
不知道
No idea.

418
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,260
組織嚴格遵循的原則是只須知道必需的信息
The association works on a strictly need-to-know basis.

419
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,730
如果你說的是真的
Supposing what you say is true,

420
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,150
那么我們完全可以在電話里說
then we could have had this talk on the phone.

421
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,810
但是如果我們在電話里說
Yeah, but if we talked on the phone,

422
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,410
那你  你可能就不會來見我了
Then you... you probably wouldn't have come to meet me,

423
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,530
不是嗎
Would you?

424
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,470
我接到命令要打電話給你
And I was told to call you,

425
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,580
告訴你游戲結束  安排和你見面
tell you the game's over, and arrange a meeting.

426
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,670
為什么
Why?

427
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,000
為什么要我過來
Why am I here?

428
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,650
請你不要以為
Please... don't think for a moment

429
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,190
我樂意這么做
that I am happy about this.

430
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,420
組織不想有遺留問題
The association doesn't like loose ends.

431
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,580
不想留下把柄
Just hates them.

432
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,090
所以
So...

433
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,810
動手吧  奧斯卡
Go on, Oscar.

434
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,330
別  別  聽著  聽著
No, no. Listen. Listen. Let's--

435
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,790
我們談談  等等
Let's talk about this. Just... w-wait.

436
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,400
我很抱歉  這不是我能決定的
Now I am truly sorry, but it is totally out of my hands.

437
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,080
我一直都很喜歡你  派翠克
I always liked you, patrick.

438
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,890
別  別  不需要這么做
No. No. This is not necessary.

439
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,100
我們不
We don't--don't--

440
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,360
什...
H-hey...wh-

441
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,870
謝謝  奧斯卡
Thank you, Oscar.

442
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,180
你可以出去等著了  就...
You can wait outside. Just, uh...

443
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
確保沒人來打擾我們
Make sure we're left in peace.

444
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,150
你好  派翠克
Hello, Patrick.

445
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,900
你好
Hi.

446
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
現在什么情況
Hey, what's going on?

447
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,710
格蕾斯  你在干
Grace, what are you--

448
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,150
別這么做
What--please don't do that.

449
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,140
你還不如周呢
You're worse than Cho.

450
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,770
他們必須告訴我們到底怎么了
They need to tell us what's going on.

451
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,750
他們不需要做任何事
They don't need to do anything.

452
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,090
我們也什么都做不了  行行好就放松點吧
And we can't do anything, so please just relax.

453
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,130
放松  我怎么放松得下來
Relax? How can I relax?

454
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,880
你有時候表現的好像你很享受無助感
You know, sometimes I think you like being helpless.

455
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,770
好了  我收回  別放松
Okay, fine, I take it back. Don't relax.

456
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,970
用額頭把車窗撞破
Just break the window with your forehead

457
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,050
我們就可以跳車跑了
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it.

458
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,000
伙計們  團結一點好嗎
Guys, let's try to keep it together, okay?

459
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
好的  很抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

460
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,910
"抱歉"
"Sorry."

461
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,040
莫林斯  你是本地人  對嗎
Mullins, you're from here, yes?

462
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,310
是的  林肯高地的
Yes, sir. Over to Lincoln Heights.

463
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,070
-給我弄一張薩克拉門托的地圖  -是  長官
- Get me a map of Sacramento. - Yes, sir.

464
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,900
車里的電腦上就有
There's one on the computer in the car.

465
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,400
紙質地圖
Paper map.

466
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,560
紙質  地圖
Paper... map.

467
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,200
快點去找
Come on. Let's go.

468
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,160
你有紙質地圖嗎
Hey, do you have a paper map?

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,540
派翠克  終于又見面了
Well, Patrick, here we are.

470
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,190
可憐的家伙
Poor fella.

471
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,570
說他聰明又傻
Smart but dumb.

472
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,090
他從來沒想到
It never occurred to him

473
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,790
我也是布萊克組織的一員
that I am the Blake Association.

474
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,590
你為什么要殺他
Why'd you have to kill him?

475
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,350
每個人都認為他是血腥約翰  不是嗎
Everyone thinks he's Red John, don't they?

476
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,520
所以你們兩個同歸于盡
So... it would seem a fitting end to the story

477
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,850
會是這個故事完美的結局
if you two were found dead together.

478
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,400
沒人會再深究下去
No one will look any deeper.

479
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,330
所以我也必須死  是嗎
So I'm supposed to die, am I?

480
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,020
耗了這么多年
After all these years,

481
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,160
是不是不太公平
seems kind of unfair.

482
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,100
很公平
It's totally fair.

483
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,850
游戲結束  我贏了
The game's over, and I won.

484
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,690
這可不是游戲
It's not a game.

485
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,700
有人輸  有人贏  這就是游戲
There's a winner and a loser. That's a game.

486
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,750
我可沒要玩這個游戲
It's not a game I asked to play.

487
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,820
即使如此  你還是玩得很好
No, but you played it very well nonetheless.

488
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,880
你很有趣  很有挑戰性  謝謝
You were fun, challenging. Thank you.

489
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,320
你肯定有很多問題想問我  對嗎
You probably have a lot of questions for me, huh?

490
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,900
我們多得是問的時間
We have time, if you want.

491
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,610
我沒有問題
I have no questions.

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,310
你是個邪惡  性變態的反社會人渣
You're an evil, sexually perverted sociopath

493
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,490
還很可悲地妄自尊大
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

494
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,870
這就是你的本質
The rest is just details.

495
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,950
邪惡  性變態的反社會人渣
"Evil, sexually perverted sociopath"?

496
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,240
這一點我到是承認  但是
Well, I guess I have to own that, but, uh...

497
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,010
妄自尊大
"delusions of grandeur"?

498
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,070
我不承認
No.

499
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,550
我沒有妄想癥
I have no delusions.

500
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,870
我建立了這個地下帝國
I built a secret empire.

501
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,780
我控制著千萬人的生命
I control the lives of thousands of people.

502
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,470
我說的話可以決定生死
My word is life and death,

503
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,850
卻沒有人知道我是誰
and nobody knows who I am.

504
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,680
這就是偉大
Now if that's not grandeur,

505
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,050
不然還能是什么
I don't know what you call it.

506
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,960
我會說這是卑鄙的自大狂的胡言亂語
I'd call it the ravings of a squalid egomaniac.

507
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,470
瞧
You see?

508
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,170
你總是這樣沒來由地粗魯  目空一切
For no reason at all, you... you're rude and contemptuous.

509
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,040
這就是害死你老婆孩子的原因
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

510
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,360
你又有什么資格
Who are you to butt in here

511
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,370
在這對我評頭論足
and make obnoxious judgments about me?

512
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,390
你算什么
Who are you?

513
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,130
你算得上什么
Who are you?

514
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,190
誰也算不上
Nobody.

515
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,690
誰也算不上
Nobody.

516
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,620
你以前不了解我
You didn't know me.

517
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,360
現在也不了解我
You don't know me.

518
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,620
完全不了解
You have no idea.

519
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,440
派  你的問題在于
Here's your problem, Pat.

520
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,020
你很聰明  但是太傲慢
You're a smart man, but you are arrogant.

521
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,550
你不能接受別人比你聰明
You can't imagine someone smarter than you.

522
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,400
這就是為什么每一步
Which is why I've been ahead of you

523
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,890
我都能搶在你前面
at every step along the way.

524
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,000
你有槍  想自吹自擂
You're holding the gun. You want to brag?

525
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,930
盡管吹吧  我不會阻止你
Go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you.

526
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,680
你還是不知道我怎么騙過你的  是嗎
You still don't know how I fooled you, do you?

527
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,750
我怎么從爆炸中逃脫的
How did I survive that bomb?

528
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,420
我怎么猜出你的名單的
How did I know all the names on your list?

529
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,280
你一直缺少的就是這個對吧  你想要有人能欣賞你
Is this what you've been missing? Appreciation?

530
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,270
想讓我為你喝彩嗎
Do you want me to applaud?

531
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,160
你完全不知道  是嗎
You have no idea, do you?

532
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,030
我不知道你是怎么猜到嫌疑人名單的
I don't know how you got the list of suspects.

533
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,570
干得漂亮
That was a good trick.

534
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,940
但是炸彈那事很簡單
But the bomb gag is simple.

535
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,220
有兩次爆炸
There were two explosions.

536
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,620
第一次是個震央炸彈  為了把所有人炸暈
The first was a concussion bomb, knocked everyone out.

537
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
第二個
The second

538
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,400
才是那個炸死哈弗內和斯特爾斯的致命炸彈
lethal bomb that killed Haffner and Stiles

539
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,440
你把我  伯特侖和史密斯
only went off after you dragged Bertram,

540
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,900
拖出爆炸傷害范圍之后才引爆的
Smith and me out of harm's way.

541
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,240
沒錯
Correct.

542
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,810
偽造你的死亡就更簡單了
Faking your own death was easy.

543
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,690
布雷特·帕特里奇是布萊克組織的
Brett Partridge was Blake Association.

544
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,970
他可以接觸到原始DNA數據庫
His job gave him access to the primary D.N.A. database.

545
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,680
他把你的DNA記錄
He switched your D.N.A. Records

546
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,940
和你留著的一具尸體的記錄對調了
with a body that you had on ice.

547
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,200
一具替代品
A surrogate.

548
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,320
你用把尸體放在汽車后備箱
And you brought the body to my house

549
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,470
帶到了我家
in the trunk of your car

550
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,620
然后把尸體放在哈弗內和斯特爾斯旁邊
and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

551
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,800
很好
Very good.

552
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,750
雖然是后知后覺
Your hindsight is 20/20.

553
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,720
能給你看件東西嗎
Can I show you something?

554
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,460
當然
Sure.

555
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,870
面包屑
Bread crumbs?

556
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,190
鳥
Birds.

557
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,710
真聰明
Very clever.

558
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,260
炸彈是你犯的一個錯誤
The bomb was a mistake.

559
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,270
是你演的一出戲
It was theater.

560
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,580
我知道不管事實看起來如何
I knew that whatever the truth looked like,

561
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,350
與之相反的才是真相
The opposite must be true.

562
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,370
求你別
Please don't.

563
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,220
別殺我
Don't kill me.

564
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,330
現在你來祈求寬恕了
Oh, now you want mercy?

565
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,730
在你犯下那么多惡行之后
After all you've done?

566
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,490
你和我不一樣
You're not like me.

567
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,410
你是個好人
