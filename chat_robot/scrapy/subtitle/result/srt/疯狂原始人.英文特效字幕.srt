00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A hope that things will be better today\nthan they were yesterday.

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not for me.\nMy name is Eep.

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is my family, the Croods.

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins

00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,671
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and sloping foreheads,\nwe're cavemen.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most days we spend in our cave,\nin the dark.

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Night after night, day after day.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep, home sweet home.

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we did go out, we struggled to find food

12
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a harsh and hostile world.

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I struggled to survive my family.

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were the last ones around.\nThere used to be neighbors.

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Erfs, mosquito bite.

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throgs, common cold.

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Croods, that's us.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Croods made it, because of my dad.

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was strong,\nand he followed the rules.

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ones painted on the cave walls.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going out at night is bad.

25
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Basically, anything fun is bad.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to my world.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is a story about

28
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:22,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how all that changed in an instant.

29
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because what we didn't know\nwas that our world...

30
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was about to come to an end.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there were no rules on our\ncave walls to prepare us for that.

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are supposed to wait\nfor my signal. Eep?

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boo.

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow! No!

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been in that cave forever.

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three days is not forever.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is with this family.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep, would you come down here?\nYou're being so dramatic.

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Sandy, come back here.

40
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember the signal.\nGood girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,\nand you can give the signal.

42
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean, you're already out now.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you don't give the signal,\nhow do I know you're my dad?

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The signal isn't so you know it's me.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so you know I wasn't eaten\nby an animal.

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why is the signal an animal noise?

49
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't that just confuse things?

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.\nI'm still waiting for the signal.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, we're ready to leave.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still alive.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's still early.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,319
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're still fat.

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breakfast formation!

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to see some real caveman action\nout there. We do this fast.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do this loud.\nWe do this as a family.

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And never not be afraid!

60
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,841


61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yay, breakfast.

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's up?

63
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll flip for it.\nCall her in the air.

64
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heads!

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,557

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Thunk...

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait till we get home.

79
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep, put on the brakes.

80
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep!

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who is hungry?\n- All right! Good one, Dad.

82
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

83
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry, Dad.\n- Looks like fast food tonight.

84
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right. I ate last week.

85
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two knuckle warning!

86
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Croods. Go, go.

87
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,112

88
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The moon is full. Bath night.

89
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Run for your life!\n- You too, Mom.

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, you've got ants.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

93
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,354

94
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know she hates the cave, Grug.

95

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please come back tomorrow.

96
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could she not like the cave?\nIt's so cozy.

97
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a little dark, Grug.

98
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not that dark.

99

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, I have to close the cave.

102

106
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That was too close.\n- I was watching. I was fine.

107
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What were you doing up there, Eep?\n- I don't know.

108
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What were you looking for?\n- Nothing.

109
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Then why did you go up there?\n- I don't know.

110
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you know?

111
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop looking for things.

112
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fear keeps us alive, Eep.\nNever not be afraid.

113
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is the point of all this?

114
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

115
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we here?\nWhat are we doing this for?

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one said survival was fun.

117
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing is fun.

118
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you come down here?\n- Grug.

119
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Eep.\n- Grug.

120
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes.\n- Off!

121
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...\n- Off.

122
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't see why\nshe needs her own ledge, that's all.

123
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's what this is about.\n- She's working through some things...

124
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she needs her own space.

125
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What things?\nHow long is this going to take?

126
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?\nShe already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

127
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? She's listening.

128
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If she wants to survive,\nshe has to follow our rules.

129
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a story?\nEep loves those.

130
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good ide...\nHow about a story, huh?

131
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, tell us a story.

132
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

133
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep, your old favorite.

134
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't played with that thing in years.

135
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight we'll hear the story\nof Krispy Bear.

136
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A long time ago,\nthis little bear was alive.

137
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was alive\nbecause she listened to her father...

138
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and lived her life in routine\nand darkness and terror.

139
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she was happy.

140
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Krispy had one terrible problem.

141
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was filled with... curiosity.

142
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Grug.\n- Yes. yes.

143
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one day, while she was in a tree...

144
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the curious little bear\nwanted to climb to the top.

145
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no sooner than\nshe climbed to the top...

146
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she saw something new and died!

147
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just like that?\n- Yes!

148
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her last moments of terror\nstill frozen on her face.

149
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same ending as every day.

150
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it, Dad. I will never do\nanything new or different.

151
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good man, Thunk.

152
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everyone\nsharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

153
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Air.

154
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You talk.

155
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a person, like you.

156
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sort of like you.

157
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

158

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you mind not...

160
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That tickles.

161
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, hey!

162

163
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not supposed to be out here.

164
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep is gone.

165
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Grug!

166
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay in the cave.

167
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. You are really strong.

168
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! No! It's mine.

169

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please! Wait.\n- No!

170
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,238

171

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! Please.

172
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate the dark.

173
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on, come on.

174
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It does what you tell it?

175
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Sort of.

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sun?

177
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Fire.

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have your fire if you're dead?

191

207
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have seen it. It's coming this way.

208
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, the ground is going to shake.\nThen it breaks open. Everything falls in.

209
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire. Lava.

210
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

211
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me, everything we are\nstanding on will be gone.

212
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to get to high ground.\nI know a mountain, that way.

213
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's our only chance.

214
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come with me.

215
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

216
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

217
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

218
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you survive, call me.

219
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

220
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

221
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

222
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad!

223
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you hurt? What took you?

224
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. I left on my own.

225
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You what?

226
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, let me explain.

227
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never let me talk.

228
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're grounded.

229
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

230
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep!

231
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

232
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug! What happened?

233
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what, I am so mad right now\nthat I can't talk to her.

234
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep?

235
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will never believe it.\nI found something new.

236
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New!

237
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New is a big problem!

238
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait!

239
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

240
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It wasn't bad.\n- "New" is always bad.

241
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He was nice.

242
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Excuse me? He?

243
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he was a warthog,\nbut then he turned into a boy.

244
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange.

245
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually it's the reverse.

246
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...

247
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a boy.

248
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch. I'm going to call him.

249
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is wrong with you?

250
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was dangerous.

251
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was beautiful!

252
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to see dangerous? Here!

253
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My sniffer!

254
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, that's it!

255
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going back to the cave...

256
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're going to stay in there\nuntil you're older than...

257
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}her!

258
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What!

259
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't keep me inside forever!

260
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said this would happen.

261
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get to the cave!

262
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

263
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

264
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

265
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone okay?

266
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

267
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, the cave...

268
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's gone.

269
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

270
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really need to see this.

271
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should go there!

272
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:08,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No one is going anywhere.

273
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else did that boy say?

274
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug?

275
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go! Just go!

276
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

277
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three, four, five...

278
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six.

279
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we?

280
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I'm not sure.

281
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down.

282
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a lower place.

283
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But one thing is for sure,\nwe can't go back the way we came.

284
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy? What is it?

285
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

286
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't be out in the open like this.

287
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need a cave.

288
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, step where I step.

289
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Stay quiet.

290
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hopefully, nothing big\nknows we're here yet.

291
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

292
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

293
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

294
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

295
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait!

296
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

297
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

298
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

299
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

300
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Dad...

301
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just to be clear, are we looking for\nthe exact same cave?

302
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it was me...\nI'm just throwing this out there...

303
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it was me choosing the cave...

304
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would go with a smaller cave.

305
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

306
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

307
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take care of this.

308
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

309
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you got them right...

310
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, they're really...

311
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm loving this.

312
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,349

313
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stop running into their fists.

314
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, when you're done,\nwe should get going.

315
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. You can't get past this!

316
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Climb! Climb! Climb!

317
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cave!

318
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go! Go!

319

320
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

321
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

322
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

323
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And seven...

324
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

325
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's scared of the dark.

326
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, we're scared of the dark.

327
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill circle!

328
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep!

329
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep!

330
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Cavies!\n- "Cavies"?

331
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cavemen! Stand back!\nThey're practically animals.

332
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?\n- Yeah.

333
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The huge primitive teeth?

334
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

335
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The excessive body hair.

336
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one has got a tail.

337
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

338
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Close your eyes.\nI'm going to have to take their lives.

339
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! It won't help.\nThey're my family.

340
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

341
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sun is in his hands!

342
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. It's "fire."

343
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did it come from?

344
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made it.

345
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make some for me!

346
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't come out of him.

347
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make. Make it!

348
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a lot like your daughter.

349
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great, now he's broken.

350
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a baby sun.

351
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, stay back.\nWe don't know what it wants.

352
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we'll all sit here\nand wait for the sun to come back.

353
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

354
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and pretend today never happened.

355
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't this fun, Eep?

356
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep, don't touch him.

357
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodness knows where he's been.

358
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

359
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

360
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a cute little guy.

361
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Stay back.

362
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, wait!

363
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It likes me.

364
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! It's biting me!

365
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thunk! Try hiding from it\nin the tall, dry grass!

366
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

367
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're biting me!

368
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More fire babies.

369
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

370
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. But I won't let him.

371
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, son. Come back!

372
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, stop! Let me go!

373
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out! Out! Out!

374
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat up, babies!

375
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, stop touching me!

376
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Die!

377
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I win!

378
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not so scary\nonce you get to know them.

379
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you people?

380
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

381
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're the Croods!

382
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you are?

383
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy.

384
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Guy.

385
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

386
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like magic.

387
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And smells like food.

388
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't eat it, it's new.

389
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still alive!

390
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, keep eating.

391
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, where is Guy?

392
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

393
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going somewhere?

394
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mountain? High ground?\nEnd of the world, remember?

395
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That already happened.\nIt destroyed our cave.

396
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That was just the beginning of the end.

397
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The end of the end is still coming.

398
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep. Drop it.

399
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't let him go!

400
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if we don't find a\ncave before sunset?

401
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if it takes a few days?

402
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if the birds come back?

403
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need his fire, dummy!

404
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. You're staying with us\nuntil we find a cave.

405
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No, I'm not.\nDon't make me a part of this!

406
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay here if you want, but let me go.

407
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a dream...

408
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a mission, a reason to live!

409
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not anymore.

410
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got an idea.

411
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go to that mountain.

412
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too far.

413
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

414
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are caves on that mountain.

415
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you been there?

416
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a mountain.

417
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mountains are safe.\nMountains have caves.

418
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And water. And sticks.

419
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom? Did you hear that?\nI can get my own stick!

420
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Sticks and caves.\nCaves and sticks.

421
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy sticks. Let's go.

422
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet!

423
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That thing is weird.

424
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

425
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just Belt.

426
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've made a decision.

427
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to that mountain.

428
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

429
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just feels right.

430
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, Grug.\nWe've never really walked that far.

431
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think my feet can do that.

432
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never live long enough to get there.

433
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it.

434
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, just think.

435
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our whole family packed together\non a long, slow, trip across country?

436
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Days and nights with just each other.

437
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

438
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll become closer as a family.

439
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get her off!

440
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not ready to challenge her,\nthen don't look her in the eye.

441
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you keep your big giant arms\non your side of the trail?

442
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't this fun?\nWe're taking our first trip together.

443
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop shoving,\nor I will pull out your tongue!

444
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want me to\nturn this family around? Do you?

445
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I will\nturn this family around so fast!

446
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I gotta go!

447
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, you can hold it.\n- I don't think so.

448
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

449
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm touching...

450
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I still gotta go!

451
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Just go behind one of those\nlumpy things and make it fast.

452
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:08,838
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Something bit me!\n- I don't blame it.

453
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

454
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

455
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How about now?\n- No.

456
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now?\n- No.

457
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now?

458
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can do this all day long.

459
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no and still no.

460
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

461
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, we're all pretty tired!

462
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll eat when we get there.

463
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's taking too long!

464
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm grabbing a snack.

465
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do that. He will cut you.

466
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

467
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a pet?

468
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An animal you don't eat.

469
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We call those "children."

470
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No man should have a pet.\nIt's weird and wrong.

471
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's food!\n- No, please!

472
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that. That!

473
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Food fixes everything.

474
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me your hunting face.

475
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not you. You're still grounded.

476
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Thunk.

477
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My feet hurt.

478
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You look tense.\n- I'm not tense.

479
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Angry girl wants to be doing\nwhat they're doing.

480
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't ready.

481
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

482
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this?

483
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they doing?

484
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hunting.

485
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it off! You stay away from me.

486
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, seriously, what are they doing?

487
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got a ton of eggs.\nJust make another egg.

488
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you're just rubbing it in.

489
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, who's hungry for scorpion?

490
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to the egg and the bird?

491
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We lost him.

492
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when the bird stepped on me\nand pushed me into the ground...

493
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

494
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:07,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and one thing led to another\nand here we are eating him.

495
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, win-win.

496
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not enough. Not enough!\nI need more.

497
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need more.

498
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that.\nShe's not going to eat me, right?

499
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're too skinny.

500
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If she was going to eat anyone\nit would be...

501
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom!

502
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's locked her jaw!

503
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get a stick! Get a stick!

504
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away!

505
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sick old monster!

506
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

507
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold her still. Use a rock.

508
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

509
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you rolling away?

510
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want something to eat.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

518
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you call this?

519
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A trap.

520
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,035
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it do?

521
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

522
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have you been alone?

523
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do we do?

524
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's your acting?

525
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're good at this.

526
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Sorry.

527
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

528
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, that's yours.\n- Excuse me.

529
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your other hand...

530
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's my arm.\n- Okay, I'm moving it.

531
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't step in your trapything.

532
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I noticed!

533
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Eep?

534
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's awesome.

535
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep!

536
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, no!

537
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an avalanche of flavor.

538
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like we won't be\nhaving any leftovers.

539
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are "left overs"?

540
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you have so much food to eat,\nyou have some left over.

541
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never have that much food.

542
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, how about a story?

543
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good idea. How about a story?

544
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, tell us a story!

545
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once upon a time,\nthere was a little tiger...

546
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who lived in a cave with her family.

547
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were a lot of rules...

548
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the big, simple one\nwas to never leave the cave at night.

549
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the door was so heavy,\nyou'd think it would be easy to remember.

550
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So easy to remember!

551
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

552
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, while everyone was asleep...

553
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she went out anyway.

554
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No!\n- Yes!

555
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no sooner than she did,\ntheir cave was destroyed...

556
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and everyone had to go\non this long, sucky walk...

557
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with some weirdo they met...

558
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and die!

559
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The end.

560
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

561
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My stories never end like that.

562
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Two stories in one night!

563
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

564
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once upon a time,\nthere was a beautiful tiger.

565
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She lived in a cave\nwith the rest of her family.

566
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her father and mother told her,\n"You may go anywhere you want...

567
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"but never go near the cliff,\nfor you could fall."

568
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And die. Good story.

569
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when no one was looking...

570
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she'd go near the cliff...

571
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the closer she came to the edge...

572
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the more she could hear,\nthe more she could see...

573
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the more she could feel.

574
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally...

575
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she stood at the very edge.

576
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She saw a light.

577
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She leaned out to touch it...

578
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she slipped.

579
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she fell.

580
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she flew.

581
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,679
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did she fly?

582
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow.

583
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow?

584
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A place with more suns in the sky\nthan you can count.

585
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would be so bright.

586
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A place not like today, or yesterday.

587
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A place where things are better.

588
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow isn't a place.

589
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't see it!

590
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it is.

591
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen it.

592
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where I'm going.

593
00:47:36,797 --> 00:47:39,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

594
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when we wake up...

595
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're going to find the place\nthat has everything we want.

596
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow?

597
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A cave.

598
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was too close. It almost caught us.

599
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was watching. We were fine.

600
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta move faster.

601
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you people have any other speed\naside from "wander"?

602
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take a shamble at this point.

603
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, do you have a minute?

604
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did the tiger fly?

605
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only share when I'm outside the log.

606
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm funny that way.

607
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave this to me.

608
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Thunk...

609
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you have a spider on your face.

610
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's loose!

611
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

612
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mean these rocks?

613
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not step on these rocks!

614
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step aside, girls.

615
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Nobody's listening!\nNo one is listening.

616
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot walk on those!

617
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back here now!

618
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There goes our chance for survival.

619
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And our log!

620
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

621
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

622
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it doesn't get better.

623
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't walk on your hands.\nThe hands do not help at all.

624
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

625
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can help you...

626
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we're going to have to\nmake a few changes around here.

627
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The log ride is over.

628
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the log.

629
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, kick it away.

630
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farther.

631
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

632
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, smart "Guy"...

633
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}now what?

634
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good fish, good fish.

635
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Now you can look.

636
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love them!\nWhere are my feet?

637
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're still there!

638
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

639
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're really heavy.

640
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

641
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you!

642
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Wait!

643
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

644
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's up. We're good. I'm good.

645
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These shoes are great!\nWhere do you get these ideas?

646
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm calling it a "brain."

647
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure it's\nwhere ideas come from.

648
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I don't have a brain.

649
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've gotten along just fine\nwithout brains until now.

650
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cavemen don't need brains.\nWe have these.

651
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I'm talking about!\nIdeas are for weaklings.

652
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, let's get to that mountain!

653
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! I love those!

654
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

655
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:58,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how did the tiger fly?

656
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She jumped on the sun...

657
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and rode it to Tomorrow.

658
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

659
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Dad!

660
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Dad!

661
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've seen rain before, right?

662
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't get out much.

663
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eep, looks dangerous.

664
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, you say that about everything.

665
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful.

666
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,674
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Okay.

667
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Not cool!

668
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been\ndumping my bones here since last week."

669
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last week!

670
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a funny story!

671
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a story. It's a joke.

672
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a "joke"?

673
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just making something up\nto make you laugh.

674
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One for you.\n- Thanks.

675
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One for you. And this one's for you.

676
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

677
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay! That's enough!

678
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see why the kids\nneed their own shells.

679
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if anyone gets in trouble,\nwe can call the others.

680
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, you're saying we should split up?

681
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can try more paths at once.

682
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the fastest way through.

683
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Croods stick together.\nYour way isn't safe.

684
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can handle it.

685
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can do it, Dad.

686
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

687
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job to keep you safe.

688
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still in charge\nand we are not splitting up.

689
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for you two.

690
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's final.

691
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

692
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone all right?

693
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're okay, Grug.

694
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

695
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me what to do.\nWhat do I do? What do I do right now?

696
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay where you are. I'll find you.

697
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Too slow.

698
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, keep moving forward\nand we'll get out.

699
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

700
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

701
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

702
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,828
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, never not be afraid.

703
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can do this!

704
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's going to be okay,\nit's going to be okay.

705
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to pass out.

706
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sandy. Sandy!

707
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me another one.

708
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You dropped these.

709
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come with me.

710
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, boy! Catch!

711
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gran?

712
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

713
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

714
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug?

715
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go get him.

716
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good boy! Who's a good boy?

717
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

718
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need a name. You want a name?

719
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to call you Douglas.

720
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do tricks? Roll over.

721
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Douglas, roll over.

722
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good boy, Douglas!

723
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was in love once.

724
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

725
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was quite a scandal.

726
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We fed each other berries, we danced.

727
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then my father smashed him with a rock\nand traded me to your grandfather.

728
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Croods!

729
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down here.

730
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

731
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy is with them. Okay.

732
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

733
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for bringing me\nthat interesting Guy update.

734
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'm going to go up...

735
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and why don't you join us\nwhen you stop being a big drag!

736
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep pile?

737
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a story?

738
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone?

739
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then Torg said,\n"Know it? I drew it."

740
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes no sense.

741
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it was hard for you\nto bring us along...

742
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they had the\nbest day of their lives.

743
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for that.

744
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to show you something.

745
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More suns in the sky than you can count.

746
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every sun that crosses our sky\ncomes to rest up there.

747
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow.

748
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where we'll be safe.

749
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with Guy.

750
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Not my little girl.

751
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come with us.

752
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't go without Grug.

753
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes one of us. Count me in.

754
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, Mom? Now?

755
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug has no idea how to protect us.

756
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, he has no ideas at all!

757
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's not true.\nWhat about that one time when he...

758
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Face it.

759
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he actually had an idea of his own...

760
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have a heart attack and die!

761
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug?

762
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad!\n- Dad!

763
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:04,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a big guy. How could he\njust disappear like that?

764
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:08,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady\nif she's seen Dad.

765
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't seen him.

766
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

767
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was up all night, because\nall these ideas just kept coming to me.

768
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a snake?

769
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belt, new and improved.

770
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's even self-tightening!

771
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that on your head?

772
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called desperation.

773
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."

774
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this one, I call it a "ride."

775
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rhymes with "Grug."

776
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't rhyme...

777
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's going to get us\nplaces faster than shoes.

778
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Try to keep up!

779
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I had a ride.

780
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And painting is a thing of the past.

781
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I call this a "snapshot."

782
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

783
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I call them "shades."

784
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

785
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you get these great ideas?

786
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since I don't have a brain...

787
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're coming from my stomach,\ndown deep below...

788
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then up again into my mind.

789
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug, we have to keep moving.

790
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

791
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

792
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that something?

793
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

794
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

795
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. It's bad.

796
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost feel sorry for him.

797
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't.

798
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you trying to do, Grug?

799
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I thought if I could have ideas...

800
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Iike Guy...

801
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe Eep would listen to me.

802
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And maybe she wouldn't\nwant to go with Guy.

803
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grug.

804
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what this is all about?

805
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I also thought\nit would kill your mother.

806
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So win- win.

807
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're here!

808
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cave!

809
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone inside.

810
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up. Let's go.

811
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. Go!

812
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

813
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more caves, Grug.

814
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

815
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to jump on the sun\nand ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

816
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. So you're all going to do this?

817
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thunk?

818
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Dad.

819
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to stop worrying for all of us.

820
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job to worry!\nIt's my job to follow the rules!

821
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rules don't work out here!

822
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They kept us alive!

823
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't living!\nThat was just not dying.

824
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a difference.

825
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugga, everyone,\nyou have to listen to me.

01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this stuff that saves you\nfrom my punches?

842
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tar.

01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I have to get back to them.

01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one gets out of this.

848
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me...

01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like you forget to tell her.

01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I was just busy\nkeeping them all alive.

01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. That's what dads do.

01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the point of all this?

914
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To follow the light.

01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have ideas.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's all you need.

920
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we don't know what's over there.\nMaybe nothing!

921
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too risky!

922
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a chance.

923
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take that chance.

01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a joke, right?

926
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a "joke"?

927

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made it.

929
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking of calling it a "hug."

949
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it rhymes with "Grug."

950
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can change it if you want.
