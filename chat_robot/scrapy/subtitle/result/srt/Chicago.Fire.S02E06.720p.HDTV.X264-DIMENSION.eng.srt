1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,640
Herrmann.
Been slow the last few weeks.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,420
Previously on Chicago Fire...

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,860
Come up short again,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,980
and you'll be serving beer out of a tent.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,000
If Arthur finds out I'm a cop, then I'm a dead cop.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,750
Can I come back to the firehouse?
Anytime you want.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,870
Maybe there's a way to get her into a minimum-security facility.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,860
Let me make some calls.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,130
I have some friends at the state's attorney's office.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,750
The official Randall McHolland for union president campaign poster.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,640
We're taking Sullivan down.
Why don't we clear the air, Shay?

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,470
There's nothing to talk about.
Well, there is if you're still pissed at me.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,840
How'd you get mixed up with these gossipy bitches?

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,500
The state believes that Firehouse 51 is worth saving.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,450
It's your leadership that we're unhappy with.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,580
I'll do whatever it takes to save 51.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,870
My resignation.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,720
I'm taking over 51.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,550
This thing's broke.
What? Hey.

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,090
That's not helping.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,580
What's going on?
Someone doesn't know how to make coffee.

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,230
Guys, does anybody have any advil on them?

23
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Man, you got to have something better than Munter's brown roast.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,040
Yeah, we got Starbucks.
Where?

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,370
About two blocks down on the north side of the street.

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,170
I'm going running.

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,320
Kelly?
Yeah?

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,300
I don't know if you remember... I'm Beth...

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,940
Benny's wife.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,480
I know Benny's been hanging out with you.

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
And he won't return my phone calls.

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,840
The boys miss him.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,080
They need to see their father.
I'm a little confused.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,700
He told me he was going back to Kenosha every weekend.

35
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,910
He hasn't been home in months.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,540
Look, I'm sorry to dump all this on you.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,610
No, it's... it's... it's... I'll...

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,220
I'll talk to him.

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,910
Thank you.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,300
Hey, Chief. It's Kelly.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,040
Listen, I got to stop by O.F.I. and see my old man.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,870
I might be a few minutes late to shift.

43
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,470
Anyway, I'll explain everything to you when I get there.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,610
I'm sorry about this.

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,110
Have Clarke cover for me. Thanks.

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,110
Right. So I will need your signature just here

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,910
and one more just here.

48
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,480
I need to be assured that this means that 51 is safe.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,930
Yes, it does.

50
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,020
Okay.

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,030
You're doing the right thing, Chief.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,930
Now, I figure it'll take a few weeks to put it all together.

53
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,970
I understand.
In the meantime, I would appreciate it

54
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,040
if you would help us make this transition as efficient as possible.

55
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,620
I'll help any way I can.

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,510
You're gonna walk away with a very nice pension.

57
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,610
WE CARE ABOUT YOUR SAFETY

58
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,380
Whoa... what...

59
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,150
Help!

63
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,150
Hey, buddy. What's your name?
Nathan.

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,470
Nathan, I need you to close your eyes and cover your face. Can you do that for me?

65
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,580
You can open your eyes now, Nathan.

66
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,840
Can you wiggle your toes?
I think so, yeah.

67
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,610
Good, good, good.
But my arm...

68
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,480
Listen, just stay tough for me, okay?

69
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,390
All right, hold on. I'm gonna get you out of here.

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,720
Come on. Good girl.

71
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,860
Good morning, Lieutenant. That was Lasky down at headquarters.

72
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,830
It looks like McLeod is making her final decision today about which house she's gonna close next.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,700
And?
He thinks it's between us and Firehouse 17.

74
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,900
Oh, man.

75
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,150
This has got to be weighing pretty heavy on the Chief.

76
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,460
I just wanted to remind everyone, today is election day for the union presidency.

77
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,990
Polls will be open all evening starting at 5:00 P.M.,

78
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,950
so I urge you all to exercise your right to vote,

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,490
unless you plan on voting for Greg Sullivan, in which case, forget what I just said.

80
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,700
Listen, Otis and I have been going over this and going over this,

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,620
and we think that we need to involve the cops at this point, you know, in an official capacity.

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,190
I told you guys I'd take care of it.

83
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,350
Antonio is...
Okay, no offense, but I feel like we need to go beyond Antonio at this point.

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,800
Reach out to the higher-ups, get somebody with a little bit more juice.

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,540
I think maybe you guys just might be overreacting a tiny bit.

86
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,170
If we just stick to the plan and pay what he wants...
Overreacting?

87
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,280
Did you have something in your eye, or did you see Game Day explode into smithereens?

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,870
Listen, if Arthur's willing to go that far with them,

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,480
you don't think he would do the same to Molly's?

90
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,600
Has anyone seen Severide?

91
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,570
No.
Nope.

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,210
So messed up. I had to take the bus here.

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,730
One, two, three.

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,080
I can't!
Pull!

95
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,630
I can't... stop! Stop! My leg!

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,980
I can't!
Okay.

97
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,210
Okay, okay. All right.

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,130
All right, okay. Let's take a look at this arm.

99
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,480
Nathan, I'm not gonna be able to get you out unless I try and pull this out.

100
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,440
It's gonna be just like ripping a band-aid off, okay?

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,970
It's gonna hurt at first, and then it'll feel much better.

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,700
Ready?

103
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,940
All right... Okay. Damn it. Damn it.

104
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,840
I think the rebar nicked an artery in your arm.

105
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,090
Listen, bud, I got to do something to get this bleeding under control.

106
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,700
You got to stay tough for me, okay?

107
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,290
I gotta pinch off this artery.

108
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,010
Okay. I... I got it.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,660
All right, there we go. It's done. It's done. It's done.

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
There we go.

111
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,190
Help!

112
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,700
Somebody help us!

113
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,390
Help!

114
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,510
Hey, there he is.

115
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,370
How you feeling champ, huh?

116
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,620
Okay, okay.
Okay, all right.

117
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,970
I was just trying to be supportive.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I know. I'm just... I'm nervous about this debate.

119
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,390
There's not, like, a chance that more than five people are ever gonna hear this thing.

120
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,700
I'll have you know that more than 600 firefighters have preregistered to hear this debate.

121
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,220
That is the biggest audience I've ever had.

122
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,530
Okay. Hey, that's great.

123
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,950
Just be yourself.
Be better than yourself.

124
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,650
I've got some great news.
Let's hear it.

125
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,300
I just found out a little something interesting about Sullivan.

126
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,560
His ex-wife is taking him to family court for failure to pay his child support.

127
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,750
And it isn't the first time.
Are you serious?

128
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,790
We got to hit him with this hard, Randy.
Yeah, I don't know.

129
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,200
Randy, I know you're all about maintaining your integrity throughout this process, but trust me,

130
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,200
we've got to hit him with everything we've got.

131
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,790
She's got a point, buddy.

132
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,280
Yeah?
Detective Helling...

133
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,380
Area north.
How can I help you?

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,920
I need to have a word with a few of your firefighters.

135
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
What about?

136
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,430
Wait. So you're saying we're suspects in this?

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
Unbelievable.
Is it?

138
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,960
An old bar goes up in flames,
you three buy the place at a great discount,

139
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,570
I'm sure, fix it up. Then Game Day comes along.

140
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,950
Suddenly, business ain't so good. They call the cops on you.

141
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,120
You call the fire marshal on them. That's what we call an escalation.

142
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,980
From there... 
Did we have a professional rivalry with Game Day? Absolutely.

143
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,180
But would we ever consider in a million years torching the place?

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,330
Absolutely not! We're good "salt of the earth" people.

145
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,500
You ask anyone.
Okay.

146
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,970
Just wanted to let you know where we stand.

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,790
I'll come back with some follow-up questions if I have any.

148
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,110
Hey, Clarke, have you seen Severide?

149
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,660
Chief said he had some family business and to cover for him.

150
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,940
So I talked to my friend. He said he's reviewing Heather Darden's case personally.

151
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,420
He said minimum security's a real possibility.
That's great. Thank you.

152
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,980
No worries.
All right.

153
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,430
Hey, buddy.
Hi.

154
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,580
Thanks for coming.

155
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,300
Ready to do a shift?
Are you sure that's okay?

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,700
Are you kidding? We're lucky to have you.

157
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,970
Somebody blow the bells. We got a V.I.P. here.

158
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,620
Before you say anything, you're not suspects, okay?
Oh, no?

159
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,960
'cause someone forgot to tell that to Detective Helling.

160
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,940
He thinks we burnt down the competition. I'll make sure he's set straight.

161
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,060
I'm on this, Gabby.
Yeah, tell that to Game Day.

162
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,070
I was with Arthur when Game Day went up.

163
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
Now, whether he gave that order ahead of time,

164
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,330
I don't know... I didn't see it.

165
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,170
We are so close here.

166
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,670
I just need him provoked.

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,770
What what are you asking?

168
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,930
The next time he comes to collect,

169
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,730
tell him no dice.

170
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,090
What are you gonna do?

171
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,570
Just tell him no dice.

172
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,060
I hope you know what you're doing.

173
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,490
This is it.

174
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,660
Is this where you sleep?
Sometimes, yeah.

175
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,260
He's the lucky one. I got to sleep out here with the riff-raff.

176
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,240
You should try catching a couple of winks next to Mouch.

177
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,330
It's like the foghorns of bar harbor all going off...
51, Squad 3...

178
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,160
Catch you later, kid.
I gotta go.

179
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,110
We'll do something fun when I get back, I promise.

180
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,990
Please, my wife!

181
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,650
You got to help her!
We just need you to back up so we can do our work, okay?

182
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,880
She's still alive.
She won't be for long if that steel moves.

183
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,580
It's like a house of cards. The bike is the only thing stopping it from crushing her.

184
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
We got to stabilize this truck.

185
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,680
Can't move an inch.
Got it.

186
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,280
Mouch, chalk the wheels. Otis, kill the engine.
Got it.

187
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,230
Capp, bring the jaws. Tony, I need some cribbing.

188
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,620
Herrmann, I need that other set of jaws.
On it!

189
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,790
Hey, let's take a look at you. Come on.

190
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,580
Okay, that should hold it in one piece.

191
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,510
Hop in, Capp.

192
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,500
Go nice and easy.

193
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,760
All right, now.

194
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,310
Now! Now!
Slide.

195
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,510
It's going, it's going!

196
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,900
Okay. On my count.

197
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,870
One, two, three.

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,770
Right?

199
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,060
Hey, Nathan, do... do you got a phone?

200
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,240
It's in my backpack.

201
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,640
Where?
I put it down.

202
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,700
Um, listen, Nathan, you've been incredible so far.

203
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay? Superhero.

204
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,220
But I got to ask you to dig just a little deeper, okay?

205
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,280
I need you to pinch this artery tight yourself, just for a few seconds.

206
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,900
Okay, just think about it like you're holding a piece of spaghetti.

207
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,200
I use a fork for spaghetti.

208
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,780
Attaboy. Okay.

209
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,170
You got me there. Here, just use your hand.

210
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,660
Use your hand there. Yeah... Pinch.

211
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,240
There you go. Pinch that.

212
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,460
I know, I know, I know, I know.

213
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,330
It hurts so bad.
I know it does.

214
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,250
Just hold your hand as still as possible, okay? I'll be right back.

215
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,150
You're doing great. You're doing great.

216
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,720
Hi. This is Kelly Severide. Leave a message.

217
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,780
Hey, Kelly. Chief Boden.

218
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,860
Just checking to see how much longer you think you're gonna be.

219
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,910
Probably gonna get a relief Lieutenant here if whatever you got going's gonna take much longer,

220
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,410
so just, uh...

221
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,690
let me know.

222
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,120
Thanks.

223
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,050
How we doing, bud?

224
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,430
I don't know how much longer I can hold this.

225
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,570
Okay. Hold on.

226
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,320
Ah, damn it.

227
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.

228
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,920
You... you're doing great.

229
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,720
Hang in there. Stay tough for me.

230
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,850
There you are. I was gonna show you how to dry the hoses.

231
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,260
Is someone else wearing my dad's coat now?

232
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,630
Uh, no.

233
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,580
Nobody else is wearing it.

234
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,050
It was, um...

235
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,150
it was damaged in the fire.

236
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,630
That's what I figured.

237
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,700
He's still a very big part of this house.

238
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,740
Yeah, everyone keeps saying that.

239
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,470
Hey, that was some quick thinking out there with the jaws, man.

240
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,380
Yeah, how'd you know to do that?
Had to improvise.

241
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,230
In Iraq we were under-equipped most of the time, so we had to make do with what we had.

242
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,980
Yeah, I... I read about some of the "MacGuyvering" you guys did to upgrade gear.

243
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,460
Last thing you want, get caught with your pants down.

244
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,340
I guess that's the reason I like what we do,right?

245
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,960
A firefighter needs three things to survive... water, common sense, and balls.

246
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,870
Hello, there.

247
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,450
Greg Sullivan. Appreciate your support.

248
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,830
Hi.

249
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,470
Greg Sullivan, running for union president.

250
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,500
Looking forward to your vote tonight.
Mr. Sullivan.

251
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm Isabella Thompson. We spoke on the phone.

252
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,380
And aren't you even prettier in person?

253
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,960
If you'll follow me into the briefing room, we can get started.

254
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,980
Into the lion's den I go, huh?

255
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,740
Halstead's an undercover cop?

256
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,950
How long have you known about this?

257
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,530
Not long. And I'm... I'm sorry that I didn't tell you guys.

258
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,490
It's just, he wanted me to protect his cover.

259
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,400
He needs us to provoke Arthur so that he can make a case.

260
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,680
It's showtime.

261
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,320
Hey. Greg Sullivan.
Next question goes to Mr. Sullivan.

262
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,110
Mr. Sullivan, if elected union president,

263
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,550
what would you do to better the lives of the firefighters in this city?

264
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,740
Well, that's a great question, Brian. I'm glad you asked it.

265
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,370
As your union president, my first order of business

266
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,180
would be to put an end to the crippling interference

267
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,660
by state officials and do away with policies, like the mandatory wellness program.

268
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,190
That's actually a pretty good answer. And on to you, Mr. McHolland.

269
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,230
I would have to say

270
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,060
that I am in agreement with, uh, Mr. Sullivan here.

271
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,880
All right, um, I'm gonna throw a little curveball at you guys.

272
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Mr. Sullivan, um, if you could be any kind of animal,

273
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,780
any kind at all, what would you be?

274
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,020
Well, I know what I wouldn't want to be.

275
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,960
I wouldn't want to be a Mouch.

276
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm... I'm sorry.
Oh, a Mouch.

277
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,800
You know, half man, half couch.

278
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,220
It's Mr. McHolland's nickname at this firehouse, am I right?

279
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,440
I don't see how that's remotely...
I mean

280
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,860
You must admit that nickname does not inspire leadership.

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,860
In fact, it implies the opposite... laziness, slovenliness.

282
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,980
Do you care to respond to that, Mouch? Uh, Mr. McHolland?

283
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,870
I don't feel the need to dignify Mr. Sullivan's remarks

284
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,340
except to say that the nickname that he's referring to is a term of endearment

285
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,940
given to me by my coworkers out of friendship and respect.

286
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,480
Well, I guess that's to be expected from Firehouse 51.

287
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,200
Excuse me?
Well, isn't it true

288
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,120
this firehouse has had its share of scandal in recent years?

289
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,280
Sexual harassment lawsuit, a questionable on-duty death,

290
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,130
not to mention the fostering of a serial arsonist within its ranks.

291
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,350
I don't know who you think you are, coming in here and badmouthing our house.

292
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,560
Just being honest.
Well, you want some honesty?

293
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,720
How about your own personal...

294
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,750
You know what? Never mind.

295
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,430
I've said what I need to say.

296
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,910
And we're out of time. I'd like to thank our two candidates

297
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,910
and remind everyone that polls open

298
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,320
promptly at 5:00 P.M.

299
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,560
We're gonna need an act of God now.

300
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,310
Hey! Hey, help!

301
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,970
Over here!

302
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,650
Hey, Nathan. Nathan, hey.

303
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,710
You with me?

304
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,110
Yeah.
Yeah?

305
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,350
I need you to pinch this tight again for me, okay?

306
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,700
Come on, you can do this.

307
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,910
You got it. A little more.

308
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,700
There you go.

309
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,680
I'll be... I'll be right back.

310
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,770
Hey, I need help! Hey, help!

311
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,770
Over here.

312
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,830
Help!

313
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,450
Nathan!

314
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,820
Hey, Nathan!

315
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,270
Hey. Wake up, buddy.

316
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,730
Wake up, buddy. You got to wake up.

317
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,830
Damn it.

318
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,980
Help!

319
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,430
Wallace.

320
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,450
Thanks for meeting me.

321
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,350
Have you told the house yet?
No, I have not.

322
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,580
I'm telling everyone next shift.

323
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,090
You want me to come by and introduce myself as the new chief after?

324
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,030
No.

325
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,240
I didn't campaign for your job, Wally.
No?

326
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,300
No.

327
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,610
But I want my son to stay safe.

328
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,260
So, when it was offered to me, I took it.

329
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,600
I'm giving up my job to save 51.

330
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,320
I know.

331
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,530
And you've accomplished your mission.

332
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,230
They're closing 17.

333
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,800
Can I have your attention, please?

334
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,070
Word just came to me... they're closing Firehouse 17.

335
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't mean to be insensitive, Chief, but does that mean we're safe?

336
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,330
I've been told we are.

337
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,390
Casey.

338
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,840
Benny?

339
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,490
I had no say over my replacement.
Yeah, but Benny...

340
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,690
Will you please just wait until I announce it next shift?

341
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,960
I don't need to disrupt the union vote.

342
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
It's...

343
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,540
it's Mouch's night.

344
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,360
I'll tell you what I do need...

345
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,900
for you to be a leader...

346
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,170
now more than ever.

347
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,450
How we doing, Nathan? You hanging in there?

348
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,010
Hey, buddy, you still with me?
I'm here.

349
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,530
Don't give up on me, okay? I want you to promise me.

350
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,100
I've seen guys a lot bigger and a lot stronger than you give up,

351
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,230
and once they do, you're done. You're gone.

352
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,330
There's nothing I can do for you. So I want you to promise me, kid.

353
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,100
I promise.

354
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,670
Yeah, good... good man.

355
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,600
Nathan.
What is it?

356
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,780
Why didn't you... look at this.

357
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,280
So what were you doing joyriding this thing, anyway?

358
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,300
My father... he's in construction.

359
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,750
He promised me over and over again, ever since I was little,

360
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,100
that he'd teach me how to drive a loader.

361
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,330
That was before he left.

362
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,480
So I figured I'd teach myself so if he ever came back,

363
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,500
I could show him that I didn't need him.

364
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,990
I know the feeling, bud.

365
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,050
My dad was a firefighter, and now I am too.

366
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,630
But I did it without his help.
Is it hard?

367
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,020
No, it's the best job in the world.

368
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,250
Look, I'll tell you what.

369
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,100
As soon as we get out of here, I'll take you down to the firehouse,

370
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,590
and we'll go for a ride in the truck... how's that sound?

371
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,010
Cool.

372
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,330
Last chance.

373
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,500
I can call the union secretary right now and send out an email blast to the entire C.F.D.

374
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm sorry, but no.
I don't understand.

375
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,240
This is the one-yard line.

376
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,110
The last thing anybody heard is that podcast.

377
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,930
I always said I was gonna run this campaign on the issues that affect firefighters.

378
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,850
Personal business is off-limits.

379
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,580
Now, if that means I lose...

380
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,870
Yeah, it does.

381
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,790
I mean, what have we been working for here?

382
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,960
Look, if you want, I'll take the hit.

383
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,460
The email doesn't have to come from you.

384
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,660
This isn't Washington, Isabella.

385
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,660
I think he means it.

386
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,290
Fair enough.

387
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,090
I'm gonna go home and get some rest.

388
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,650
Thanks, Randy. I've enjoyed it.

389
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,810
Best of luck tonight.
Thanks.

390
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,970
Damn.

391
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,080
I sure do love me a woman in uniform.

392
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,310
Hey. What you doing here?
Oh, I was in the area.

393
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,710
I thought I'd swing by and check out your digs.

394
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,270
Oh, you did, did you?

395
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,980
That's my partner, Gabby.

396
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,180
This is Devon.
We got a lot of inventory here, so...

397
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,400
When can you get out of here?
My shift goes until tomorrow morning.

398
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,540
Well, you get a break or something?
Mm, not officially, but...

399
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,130
Ambulance 61...

400
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,340
Woman in distress...
Hey, why don't you come on a ride-along?

401
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,250
For real?
Yeah.

402
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,800
We do ride-alongs all the time. Hop in back.

403
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,100
Hey, with all the eyes on this house,

404
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,710
you really think it's a good idea to bring people on ride-alongs?

405
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,390
What, I can't have a friend here?

406
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,390
You know what, Shay?

407
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,030
Whatever you want to do.

408
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,990
She showed up here about 20 minutes ago, acting all kinds of crazy...

409
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,940
slapping her own face, chewing on her hair.

410
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,620
I can try...

411
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,890
I want to be the boom.

412
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,360
Oh, you have to feel the weather to be the boom.

413
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,720
Think it's bath salts?
You better prep 2 milligrams of midazolam.

414
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,890
People smoke bath salts like amphetamines these days.

415
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,850
I want to be the boom.

416
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,770
Hey, ma'am. Hi. Hey, there.

417
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,770
We're here to help you, all right?

418
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,140
Just calm down. Tell me your name.

419
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,470
You want to take it from me? Take the boom in me?

420
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,780
No, just want to help.
You fingerprint me?

421
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,530
And you want to take it off me.
Oh, my God.

422
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,790
This chick is flat whacked.

423
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,590
Don't laugh at me!

424
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,550
You wait... and you take it!
Easy, all right?

425
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,210
Everything's gonna be all right?

426
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,140
Okay.
Hold on.

427
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,080
Hold on.
It's gonna be all right...

428
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,990
It's okay.You're okay.It's okay

429
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,190
Okay, let's get her on the backboard.

430
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,950
That was wild, man.

431
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,390
Hey, Nathan.

432
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,150
How'd you start this thing, buddy?

433
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,340
There's no key.

434
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,370
Nathan. Hey.

435
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,370
It's easy.

436
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,470
You span the two contacts with something metal.

437
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,350
What'd you use to do it?
Screwdriver.

438
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,600
Hey. What's up?

439
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,100
I thought only cops had badges.
Nope. We do too.

440
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,310
Wear 'em on our dress uniforms.

441
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,190
Really?

442
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,820
What happened to my dad's?

443
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,490
Your mom never took you to see it?

444
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,730
Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour.

445
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,600
Cool.

446
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,410
Um, I don't know if you ever spoke to Kelly today?

447
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,750
No, I haven't.

448
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,900
Well, you tell him when you see him...

449
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,940
missing today's shift was unacceptable.

450
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,730
I expect a phone call and an explanation.

451
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,580
Of course, Chief.

452
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,490
Carry on.

453
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,860
Rise and shine, Griffin. Shift's over.

454
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,080
We gonna eat breakfast?
After we run an errand.

455
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,030
Kelly!

456
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,710
Kelly, you here?

457
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,620
Kelly?

458
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,710
Kelly?

459
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,830
No, it's just me.

460
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,230
Have you heard from Severide at all since yesterday?

461
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,010
No, not since he went jogging.

462
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,030
Give me your car keys.

463
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,920
Thanks, buddy.

464
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,060
I'll be back.

465
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,210
No, come on.

466
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,600
No.

467
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,020
Good morning.

468
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,000
No one was here, so I figured I'd just serve myself.

469
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,860
Well, you have to leave... right now.

470
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,490
I want my money.

471
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,730
What if I can't pay?

472
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,020
You know, all things considered,

473
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,670
I like to think of myself as a fair man.

474
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,620
I believe in taking people at their word,

475
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,280
offering second chances, that kind of thing.

476
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,370
Now, you take the owners of Game Day...

477
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,460
I gave them a chance to pay.

478
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,530
They refused.

479
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
I gave them a second chance,

480
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,200
and once again, they refused.

481
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,090
Then...

482
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,850
they had that bad luck.

483
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,480
Hey, Arthur, there's no need to...

484
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,720
Shut up!

485
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,620
Jay!

486
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,070
Drop the gun. You're under arrest.

487
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,350
You son of a bitch.

488
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,400
Put the gun down, Arthur.

489
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,120
I swear to God, I'll make you eat it.

490
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,140
Don't move.

491
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,890
Were you shot?

492
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,050
Would you mind taking my cell phone out of my pocket and putting it to my ear?

493
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,370
You got to dial 911.

494
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,110
This is Detective Jay Halstead, badge number 51163.

495
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,630
Nathan?

496
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,980
Buddy?

497
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,780
Nathan.

498
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,790
Answer me, damn it. Wake up, bud.

499
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,040
Kelly!

500
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,000
Brachial artery bleed.

501
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,570
I don't know how much longer he can hold out.

502
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,260
We've been at it all night. Hang on, buddy.

503
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,720
We're almost there, all right?

504
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,450
Don't give up on me, okay?

505
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,480
Got it.

506
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,960
This is Randy.

507
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,550
Yeah.

508
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,630
Yeah?

509
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,700
Okay. Thanks.

510
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,620
Well?

511
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,070
I, uh, lost.

512
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,820
Was it even close?

513
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,110
We ran a good campaign.
You really did, Mouch.

514
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,870
And who the hell cares what the numbers were? You got every vote where it counts...

515
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,920
Firehouse 51.

516
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,220
And I know that I'm sure as hell proud of you.

517
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,670
We all are.

518
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Thanks, guys.

519
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,690
You lucked out, cowboy. It's pretty much a through-and-through.

520
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,280
You'll need some stitches, but otherwise you're fine.

521
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,230
Thanks.

522
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,050
You two okay?
Yeah.

523
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,660
I got to say, this didn't turn out the way

524
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,240
I thought it would, but you got the job done.

525
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,140
Yeah, and I caught a bullet in the process.
You say that like it's a bad thing.

526
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,940
You know, since you were shot on a job, that pretty much means you get to choose your next detail.

527
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,530
Intelligence. I want intelligence.

528
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,650
Yeah, well, we'll see what we can do about that.

529
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,310
You know...

530
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,100
this doesn't have to change things for us.

531
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,480
I wish that were true.

532
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,730
What do you mean?

533
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,630
I mean that when we first met...

534
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,830
I didn't sign up for this.

535
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,740
My brother and sister-in-law have the best relationship

536
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,310
I've ever seen... except for when he goes undercover.

537
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,700
It changes people.

538
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,810
Maybe if the circumstances were different.

539
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,820
Maybe one day they will be.

540
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,310
Maybe.

541
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,950
What the hell happened?

542
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,820
I saved our damn bar. That's what happened.

543
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,160
That she did.

544
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:00,290
There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for another.

545
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,570
This badge case stands as a memorial

546
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,310
to our fallen firefighters and paramedics,

547
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,690
who gave their lives in service to the citizens of Chicago.

548
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,430
ANDY DARDEN SEPTEMBER 2012

549
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,990
It's okay to cry here.

550
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,070
I have.

551
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,830
Kelly. Kelly.

552
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,880
Mom, this is him.

553
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,980
This is the man who saved me.

554
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,740
