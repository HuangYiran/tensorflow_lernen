00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey.

100
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is that?

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's investigate it.

102
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're hearing a weird sound.

103
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You hear it?

104
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is it the fridge?

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the icemaker.

106
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Damn it!

107
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It will only come out when we sleep here.

108
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd like to take this moment...

109
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to illustrate the beauty of this fine instrument.

110
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I meant her. This is just my guitar.

111
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're sweet.

112
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is this?

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just like your feet. They're sexy.

114
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need to repaint my toenails.

115
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You shouldn't film my feet.

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sex type thing. Can I get a little striptease?

117
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please? Just a half of one.

118
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just bra and panties.

119
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. - All right. I'll do anything you want.

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

121
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bullshit.

122
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, the Venus. Hey, go back in your Venus pose.

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. So where are we gonna put it?

124
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've got the bathroom or the hallway.

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it should point down the hall,

126
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that's where we heard its footsteps.

127
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's kinda dark.

128
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can't see me here?

129
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Not at all. - What if I turn this one on?

130
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, that's good.

131
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's cool? Need more light?

132
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I think you're fine.

133
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- All right. - Come check it out.

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened with putting the camera out here?

135
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We could get... - It's gotta get old, right?

136
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Careful. You're about to run into the shower.

137
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We could get extracurricular with this.

138
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mentioned it before.

139
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We could... but no. - OK.

140
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nice try, though.

141
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want you to know I'm crying inside.

142
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm putting this thing back.

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, now hook up the FireWire. Going off.

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Is it working? - It is, or isn't?

145
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I think it's good.

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God.

147
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How am I supposed to sleep with that?

148
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Lt'll be fine.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's looking at me.

150
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is what Katie looks like in the morning.

151
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She is so pretty.

152
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you want for breakfast?

153
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever. What the hell...

154
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Whatever" isn't an answer.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about scrambled eggs?

156
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sounds pretty good. - Yeah? Good.

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey, babe? - What?

158
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you drop my keys on the floor?

159
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold on.

160
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My keys are in the middle of the floor.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just... Look where I found my keys.

162
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where did you leave them?

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I left them on the counter.

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you sure?

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. I always leave them in the same spot,

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}next to your wallet.

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Obviously, this is incontrovertible evidence...

168
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that evil forces came from beyond the grave...

169
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to move your keys.

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Make your breakfast.

171
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That would be a 3.0 on the splash scale.

172
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What are you doing up there? - I'm filming you.

173
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah? - Yeah.

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Very, very mature. I think that's my...

175
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got a big one!

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think that's my favorite quality in you,

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it's your maturity.

178
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Big day. It's the day of the psychic, he's coming.

179
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He should be here within the hour.

180
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're gonna go find Micah...

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and see how he's feeling about it.

182
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My guess? Very excited.

183
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, tell me how excited you are...

184
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to meet our psychic.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who will be here within the hour.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The doctor will be here? Great.

187
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So excited, I can't contain myself.

188
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't contain yourself?

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let it all out. Don't be shy.

190
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got something...

191
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}quite appropriate for your psychic,though,I think.

192
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - I just, you know, stumbled upon it.

193
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Show me.

194
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I'll play this when he gets here.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and welcome in his own environment?

201
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not gonna make him feel at home.

202
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is gonna make him leave.

203
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're not gonna insult... You, not me. You.

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you smile like you're so happy with yourself.

205
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How 'bout less music?

206
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was good.

207
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is the psychic gonna give me some...

208
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}stock tips while he's here?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Haven't bet on the horses in awhile.

210
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe if you're good.

211
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}An opinion on the hundred-to-one shot?

212
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Stock? - I'm done with you.

213
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you'd think a psychic would be on time.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, like he could foretell...

215
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}if the traffic was gonna be bad?

216

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're clever.

217
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, let me get my music.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you even think about turning that on.

219
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hi. Dr. Fredrichs? - Yes. Hi.

223
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry for the camera.

224
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,400

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that kind of thing?

226
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Like know when traffic's gonna be bad? - Cut.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, usually it depends on the day of the week,

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or the time of the day.

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You know. - Like all of us.

230

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never hesitate when somebody says,

231
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Will you come to San Diego?"

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm always ready to do that.

233
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm certainly glad you could make the trip today.

234
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We really do appreciate it.

235
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd like to spend time getting to know you,

236
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}getting a bit more information than...

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}what we shared over the phone.

238
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Getting to know both of you, what's your life like,

239
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}what's your relationship like...

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's good.

241
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's good? That's one good step.

242
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Straight to the point there.

243
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How long have the two of you been together?

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Three years. - Three years?

245
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're engaged to be engaged after she graduates.

246
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And your jobs? Both your jobs? - I'm a student.

247
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm an English major, hoping to be a teacher soon.

248
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know where yet. Micah is a day trader.

249
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah. - How about your health?

250
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're in good health.

251
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And no medications involved?

252
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. - OK.

253
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}More often than not,

254
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}things that you've shared with me...

255
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}can be explained away by simple things,

256
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like squeaky houses or rattling pipes

257
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or you know, some normal thing that's going on

258
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that has people more freaked because...

259
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}they're under a high degree of stress.

260
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So... So this... let's call it a haunting,

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}has happened to you before moving into this house.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. It started when I was eight.

263
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I, you know, I lived with my family, of course,

264
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and shared a room with my younger sister,

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Christi. She was five.

266
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And at that time we both,

267
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you know, experienced whatever it was.

268
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We had... I would feel the breathing...

269
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it would wake me up,

270
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I would wake her up. And I would see the...

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I guess you'd call it like the,

272
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like just a mass, like the shadowy figure

273
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that would be at the foot of my bed.

274
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was always at the foot of my bed,

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}never at the foot of her bed.

276
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But she did see it. - She saw it also?

277
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Absolutely. And we were both absolutely terrified.

278
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK. - I mean, you know, couldn't even move.

279
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, you just... It was just...

280
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was horrifying.

281
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And we would just pray.

282
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, please let it just go away.

283
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then, eventually, it would.

284
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So this happened for a while in our first house.

285
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then we... There was a fire. We managed...

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everyone got out, no one was hurt,

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}thank God... Thank goodness.

288
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But we lost everything. So we moved.

289
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was it ever determined what caused the fire?

290
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. - OK.

291
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I... You know, I'm not saying it had to...

292
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}do with the haunting stuff.

293
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not saying that at all.

294
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know what it was.

295
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did the fire department do any investigation...

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of the causes of the fire?

297
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know if there was a criminal investigation,

298
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I know that they tried to figure out...

299
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}what was the cause, and they couldn't.

300
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK. - It wasn't electrical or anything,

301
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you know, simple like that.

302
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So then,

303
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}from the time you were eight years old until now,

304
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}have you experienced this periodically...

305
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}over the ensuing years?

306
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. From 13 on it's happened,

307
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it's happened periodically.

308
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Over the past few weeks...

309
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}things have started happening again.

310
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So when you tell me that it's moved from where you were living

311
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}when you were eight, again when you were living

312
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}someplace else when you were 13, and now here,

313
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it seems to me that's what we're dealing with.

314
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something that's basically connected to you.

315
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}These lights have been flickering,

316
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}these ones that are in the ceiling.

317
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've had water from the faucets...

318
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}turn on and off unexplainably.

319
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK. - Or we'll come down.

320
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not turn on and off,

321
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but we'll come down and it'll be on.

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've heard banging on the walls, scratching sounds,

323
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like, you know,

324
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like dragging down the wall kind of scratches.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Most of the activity is in here, isn't it?

326
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. The vast majority of it.

327
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've heard whispering.

328
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sometimes I can't understand it,

329
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}sometimes it's saying my name.

330
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, so it specifically calls to your name?

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It has before. - You've heard this too, Micah?

332
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I've heard weird noises.

333
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I haven't really heard anyone...

334
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}say Katie's name, except for me.

335
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That might've been me in my sleep.

336
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can tell the difference between you...

337
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}saying "Katie" from over there in bed

338
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and something right here...

339
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}whispering distinctly in my ear.

340
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, so, look. And I got like a FireWire...

341
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}going into my laptop, you know,

342
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}we can record all night what...

343
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You want to take this?

344
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Got the tripod, wide angle lens, get the whole room

345
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}EVP recorder, just to catch any sounds.

346
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you'll go to bed and have the light on

347
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and have the camera going as you're going to bed.

348
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is this, do you do this all the time?

349
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've just started with the camera.

350
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our extra bathroom right there.

351
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Guest bedrooms. Lights flickering in here.

352
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is there something we can do...

353
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to make the stuff happen?

354
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To get it on tape?

355
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've told him I don't want to mess with that.

356
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't want him to get the camera.

357
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}These hauntings, they feed off of negative energy.

358
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So if there is something negative going on here,

359
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it will help spur on the haunting.

360
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know the entity may feed off of that.

361
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You shouldn't let your mother come over anymore.

362
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's really mean.

363
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop joking, Micah.

364
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My area of expertise is dealing with ghosts.

365
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's what I've built my career on,

366
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}helping people get in touch with...

367
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}people who have died.

368
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Communicating with ghosts.

369
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The spirits of dead human beings.

370
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A demon is something different.

371
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's an entity that relates...

372
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to something that is non-human.

373
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK.

374
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A lot of debate and discussion about what...

375
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that could be, but it's not a person.

376
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK?

377
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dealing with demons is not my area.

378
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm very uncomfortable with it,

379
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I'll tell you, quite frankly,

380
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I sense there's something going on in this house.

381
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You cannot run from this. It'll follow you.

382
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It may lay dormant for years.

383
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something may trigger it to get...

384
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}become more active,

385
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it will, over time,

386
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}reach out to communicate with you.

387
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, I want to give you the name of...

388
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dr. Johann Averies.

389
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's a colleague. He's a demonologist,

390
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}he specializes in this sort of thing.

391
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's in Los Angeles. - OK.

392
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, check this out. What if we...

393
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}just get this Ouija board, right?

394
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We find out what it wants,

395
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}then we give it what it wants and then...

396
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}gone.

397
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because what it probably wants is Katie.

398
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And if you do pick up a board...

399
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and try to play games with it,

400
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the entity will sense that...

401
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you're trying to communicate with it,

402
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and that's opening the door, inviting it in.

403
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Do you understand me? - Yeah, I'm with you.

404
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope so. You're gonna be fine. OK?

405
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Glad to hear you say that.

406
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you so much for coming.

407
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I will definitely give Dr. Averies a call.

408
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have a very safe trip back.

409
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I will. Bye-bye, both of you.

410
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Later. What a fruit!

411
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you think you could try...

412
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}not to be completely rude to him?

413
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I feel like it was good information,

414
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}like I'm not nuts.

415
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I feel like at least we're doing something.

416
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna call that guy tomorrow.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What guy?

418
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Dr. Johann Averies? - That demon guy?

419
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Don't laugh at him. - No, don't.

420
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Seriously, don't call the guy, OK? That's insane.

421
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He said to call him tomorrow.

422
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe. Don't call the guy.

423
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, promise me you're not gonna call that guy.

424
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please?

425
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Want me to promise? - I talked with the one dude,

426
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not putting up with like a team, a legion of...

427
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK. - ...Jesus freaks.

428
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- If it gets worse I'm gonna call him. - All right.

429
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. You sound way better...

430
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}when you're brushing your teeth.

431
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have a little extracurricular activity...

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with this camera?

433
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not with this camera on us, no.

434
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, taking the camera off for ten minutes.

435
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ten minutes, huh?

436
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's all I need. I don't know about you.

437
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's go to bed. Turn it off.

438
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. I'll set up in the bedroom.

439
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Turn it off! - Katie is in the bathroom.

440
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Turn it off. Turn it off! - Hi, Katie.

441
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want to pee! Turn it off.

442
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dr. Johann. I am Dr. Johann.

443
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK, I'm about to pee. - I'm a demonologist.

444
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go away. I can't hear you, can't hear you.

445
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm here to save you from the demons.

446
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come to bed.

447
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I will! Just let me turn this off... Play time?

448
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait!

449
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Excuse me. - What?

450
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The camera's not off.

451
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's off. That's the standby light.

452
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's not the standby light.

453
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's the record light.

454
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Don't lie to me. - All right.

455
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think that probably was illegal...

456
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in Kentucky and another 12 states.

457
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This girl is a wild animal.

458
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What time you getting up?

459
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't know, six o'clock or so.

460
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you set your alarm?

461
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sleep good?

462
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that the video?

463
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was looking at the footage from last night.

464
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Check it out. This is about 2:10 in the morning.

465
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- The doors... - A minute.

466
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got it?

467
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The doors and windows all over the house are closed.

468
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just checked them.

469
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The flowers are not moving. But something else is.

470
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The door's fricking moving by itself.

471
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God.

472
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's not over. Check it out. It moves again.

473
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, Micah, that is... - That's impossible.

474
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I told you this was a good idea.

475
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think you can get that ghost back?

476
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Think I can do what? - Get the ghost back.

477
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get us some more interesting... you know.

478
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not interested in that.

479
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want him to go away.

480
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Micah! Oh, my God.

481
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you doing? Come here! Come here right now!

482
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

483
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's right there. It's right there! Get it!

484
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get rid of it. Please.

485
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You scream like that for a spider?

486
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, God. - Jesus.

487
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Did you go get the camera first? - Yeah.

488
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought it was a ghost...

489
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or something like real scary...

490
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm nearly losing my mind and you grab the camera.

491
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, little friend! What's your name?

492
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I turn the camera off?

493
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. I need to not be around you.

494
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- All right. We're going. - Straight outside. OK.

495
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, you out here?

496
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, tell me what the point of this was.

497
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was part of your master plan just to move the door?

498
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or are you just doing random shit?

499
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well. Basically, it could be two things:

500
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It could be a ghost, or it could be a demon.

501
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dr. Fredrichs said that it wasn't a ghost.

502
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And whatever... - I'm going by the evidence.

503
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm doing my research and...

504
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna find out what it is.

505
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, whatever it is that's following me,

506
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it doesn't feel...

507
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It doesn't feel human.

508
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It feels like a monster.

509
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, like it wants to hurt me.

510
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, that sounds actually like a demon.

511
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, that's what he said.

512
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ghosts are spirits of human beings.

513
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. It's definitely not human.

514
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then maybe you're right, which is bad,

515
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause demons suck!

516
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Basically, they're these malevolent, evil spirits

517
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that only exist to cause pain...

518
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and commit evil for their own amusement.

519
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's pretty creepy. I mean,

520
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}they stalk people for years, like decades.

521
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They're sometimes really intelligent...

522
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in the way they do things to freak you out.

523
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So this could be a really rare phenomenon,

524
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it's cool we got it on tape.

525
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm surprisingly not as excited as you,

526
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}considering I'm the one that's being terrified.

527
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's all good. We'll take care of it.

528
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I understand that this stuff is new to you,

529
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and exciting in some ways,

530
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so I get your whole filming thing.

531
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But it isn't new to me,

532
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I think this thing could be very dangerous.

533
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I just...

534
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want you to know that as things get...

535
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}things progress or get worse in any way,

536
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to mess with the camera.

537
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't want to make it mad.

538
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I understand where you're coming from,just remember

539
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you didn't exactly warn me about this stuff

540
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- before we moved in together. - I know.

541
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I think I have a little bit of say in what we do.

542
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I get that, honestly.

543
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But what was I supposed to say?

544
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On our first date,

545
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"There's a demon that has been foll..."

546
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, but maybe on our 15th date or our 30th date

547
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or when we decided to live together,

548
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that might've been a good thing to bring up.

549
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here.

550
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. The windows are locked,

551
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}doors are locked, alarm is on.

552
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Anything gets in here, we're gonna know about it.

553
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't think it cares about alarms and locked doors.

554
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It can go wherever it wants,

555
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it can do whatever it wants.

556
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you know?

557
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Whatever's happening, it's already here.

558
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

559
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What is this?

560
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's the matter?

561
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just... I just had a nightmare.

562
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry, did I scare you?

563
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's all right, don't worry about it.

564
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, my God. - You OK?

565
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yeah. - You sure?

566
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My head.

567
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you hear that?

568
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm going down. - No, no, no, Micah!

569
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, no!

570
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, don't leave me here.

571
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't leave me here.

572
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take this.

573
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where do you think that came from?

574
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Micah! - Is anyone down here?

575
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- This all you got? - Oh, Micah, stop!

576
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please don't do that. Oh, baby, come on.

577
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You OK, baby?

578
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm OK.

579
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You sure? - I'm still creeped out.

580
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey, girls? - No, but you know what?

581
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- If you can just show me... - Hello! Excuse me!

582
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know it's bead time, but I have a little...

583
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}something I want to show you guys.

584
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can it wait?

585
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're having very intense girl time right now,

586
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and we cannot be interrupted by Micah and his camera.

587
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you, OK. I understand.

588
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I need a little break from...

589
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck!

590
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to show you guys something.

591
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey! You be sweet.

592
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. This is the tape from...

593
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the digital audio recorder

594
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I set up in the bedroom.

595
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is the tape from about ten seconds...

596
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}before we woke up.

597
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the hell was that?

598
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I listened to it 50 times. It's not saying anything.

599
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not a language that I recognize,

600
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it's not a dog, it's not, like,

601
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}noise from the street, it's not any kind of

602
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}electrical interference that I recognize, so...

603
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, God! - What I figure it is...

604
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think the thing is right in the bedroom.

605
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This thing wants to communicate.

606
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, I figure I'm gonna go out and get a Ouija board

607
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No!

608
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to know what this thing has to say.

609
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want it to leave us alone.

610
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Trust me. Bad idea.

611
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He specifically said,

612
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Don't do anything to antagonize or..."

613
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Whatever it is. - Sorry I told you about it.

614
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're going to use a Ouija board...

615
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and invite whatever it is in,

616
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it's not going to go away.

617
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me do my thing.

618
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The camera is your thing.

619
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You do a Ouija board, there's no more.

620
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nothing. Promise me. Micah, promise me, please!

621
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fine! I promise you I won't buy a Ouija board.

622
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK? - Thank you.

623
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Micah, smile.

624
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, we haven't had anything...

625
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}interesting happen in a while!

626
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Micah? - You scared?

627
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What you got?

628
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Put the camera away, we're going to bed.

629
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Go back to sleep. - Come on.

630
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey! Don't antagonize...

631
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What you got? I'm calling you out!

632
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey! Hey, that's enough! Micah! Come on.

633
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your demon's worthless. You're worthless!

634
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got nothing.

635
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Put the camera away. - OK.

636
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's up?

637
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just thought I heard something.

638
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What? What'd you hear?

639
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just a thud.

640
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- A thud? Where? - Maybe downstairs.

641
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

642
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are you going? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

643
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, wait, wait, wait.

644
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, wait, wait, wait, please.

645
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where'd you go?

646
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm right here. I'm over here, babe.

647
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm over here. Over here.

648
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God.

649
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hear that?

650
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God.

651
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You OK, baby? - Yeah.

652
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God.

653
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It looks like it's gone now, whatever it was.

654
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, come on.

655
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's video proof of that noise, though.

656
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you hear that?

657
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold on.

658
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You hear that?

659
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, I do. I don't know what that is.

660
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is really good stuff, Katie.

661
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm telling you. This is, this is the...

662
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope that guy... it, whatever,

663
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}shows us a little more action.

664
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is grade-A shit.

665
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't think we should be messing with this.

666
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is why it scares me,

667
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you don't take it seriously.

668
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I take it seriously. I think it's pretty...

669
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have a camera in my face in the bathroom.

670
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You look beautiful in the morning, by the way.

671
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe we shouldn't have the camera.

672
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello. This is really golden shit. Come on.

673
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,630

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You went downstairs, sat in the swing.

771
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I went to get you a blanket...

772
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause you refused to come back.

773
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fast forward it to where I go downstairs.

774
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm freaking leaving the room. Where...

775
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You went outside and sat on the swing.

776
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I went inside to bring you a blanket

777
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}'cause you refused to leave in this catatonic,

778
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}weird state you were in.

779
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I don't know... - Wait, wait. Did I talk to you?

780
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wouldn't call it talking.

781
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I come upstairs and there's like footsteps,

782
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and the TV's on.

783
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So that's...

784
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, maybe this kind of thing's been happening...

785
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}for a long time...

786
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you just never knew about it.

787
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't remember anything. I know that I had...

788
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}nightmares all night and that...

789
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

790
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't want to talk about it.

791
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They were gruesome. Let's leave it at that.

792
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's trying to scare us.

793
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It scared you and me... - It's working!

794
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm scared! - Just got to stay strong.

795
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And not let it get to you, not let it get to us.

796
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, bringing in somebody else,

797
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}some exorcist or whatever,

798
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}lot of times it just gets worse.

799
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't want it to get worse.

800
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No, I don't. - No. Me neither.

801
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, all right, you little fucker.

802
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Got something to say? Now's your chance.

803
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie! Where are you?

804
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be down. Hang on a second.

805
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't wait to get out of this house,

806
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}go out and hang out with my boyfriend.

807
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, we got, like, ten minutes.

808
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What in the hell are you doing, Micah?

809
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Come on, help me. - What are you doing?

810
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm gonna talk to it. - Look at me!

811
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I told you I was...

812
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You promised me you weren't gonna...

813
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you look at me like that. You promised me

814
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you weren't gonna mess with that.

815
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! I promised you...

816
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wasn't gonna buy a Ouija board.

817
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't buy a Ouija board.

818
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You knew exactly what I meant!

819
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I borrowed a Ouija board.

820
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How dare you? You knew exactly what I meant!

821
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I said don't mess with that because it scared me,

822
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and what do you do? You go out and get...

823
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the best looking fucking Ouija board I've ever seen,

824
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you put it in the middle of our living room?

825
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Explain that to me! - I borrowed it.

826
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, I don't care what you did.

827
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're gonna throw it away. We're gonna leave.

828
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Katie... - There's no more camera,

829
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}there's no more nothing. I don't want to hear it.

830
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I don't even want to hear it. - Katie.

831
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, don't "Katie" me. I'm leaving

832
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you're either coming with me or you're not.

833
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Chill it, babe! - I don't want to hear it.

834
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take your shoes off and go to bed...

835
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

836
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What'd you do? What'd you do, Micah?

837
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at me! What'd you do?

838
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't do shit, babe. Look...

839
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I cannot fucking believe you, Micah.

840
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am finished. No more fucking camera, nothing.

841
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll take care of this.

842
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you're not gonna do it, then I will.

843
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Looks like someone drew something on it.

844
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. Hey, Katie?

845
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

846
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can you come down here...

847
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and help me figure this out, please?

848
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry?

849
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think this thing left a message.

850
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On the Ouija board.

851
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't give a fuck what that...

852
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}thing says on the Ouija board!

853
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe...

854
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie! Look...

855
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Kate. Hello. Hey. - Micah, get the fuck out!

856
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I don't want to look at that! - Chill!

857
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, this is not the time for this.

858
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get out!

859
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get out!

860
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think she's pissed. That's not good.

861
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Katie? Katie? Hello?

862
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I know you're pissed, but...

863
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do we have any lemon?

864
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do I have to do?

866
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have to turn off the fucking camera.

867
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The camera's... Fuck. Forget the camera, OK?

868
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,570

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and other things. Whatever.

871
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that good enough for you?

872
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it needs to be a little more sincere.

873
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I...

874
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,650

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or whatever it is, in any way,

878

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}shape, or form, so help me God.

879
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I promise not to betray Katie's trust.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good.

883
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

884
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I at least get a kiss for that? Please?

885
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodnight.

886

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie. Do you want to know...

887
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}what happened to the Ouija board?

888
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I saw the tape, you know.

889
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just want to forget about it, OK?

890
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's go to sleep.

891
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think I found something pretty cool,

892
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and I'd like you to help me figure it out.

893
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So, sit down. No? Or stand up.

894
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I caught on camera everything...

895
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that happened after we left.

896
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- When the cursor was moving by itself. - OK.

897
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to figure out what it said.

898
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I couldn't figure out exactly what it said,

899
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but there's a lot of possibilities.

900
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you know anyone named Edina or Diane?

901
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Could be Nadine, without two N's... No.

902
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No. - All right. Well, I'll work on it.

903
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, it may...

904
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It could be this thing's fucking with us...

905
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it doesn't mean anything.

906
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Or it could be... so many possibilities,

907
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, I could be wrong.

908
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know.

909
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't really...

910
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't really care what it means.

911
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're done playing with it.

912
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want it out of the house.

913
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We haven't gone a week without something happening.

914
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- That's crazy. - I can't...

915
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What're you guys talking about?

916
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm at my... Just everything.

917
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come stay with me.

918
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You remember, it's not the house.

919
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's me. You know, wherever I go, it goes.

920
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What am I gonna do, go to your house,

921
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}mess things up for you?

922
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got a plan. Don't worry about it.

923
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, what's your plan?

924
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I got a plan. - What? What're you gonna do?

925
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You know what... - Don't worry about it, OK?

926
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- All right? So. - OK, here's the compromise...

927
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

928
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can have your powder,

929
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you can do your little experiment.

930
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If it doesn't work, if it doesn't help us,

931
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm calling the demonologist...

932
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and we're getting this taken care of.

933
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Deal.

934
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can you look at me and not the camera?

935
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Deal. All right, so.

936
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Happy, yeah? - Yeah.

937
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Deal. - All right.

938
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that thing on?

939
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. And exactly what is this gonna prove?

940
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:35,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, if anything walks through here,

941
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}it's gonna leave a pretty good footprint.

942
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. I think we've pretty much...

943
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}established something's happening.

944
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. So tomorrow, I'm making the call.

945
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can have your powder.

946
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can clean it up tomorrow.

947
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take a deep breath, pop a pill, it's fine.

948
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Excuse me? - Figure out what we're dealing with.

949
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Micah! - OK?

950
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Then we can go crazy. - Pop a pill, my ass.

951
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does that look good to you?

952
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It looks like our floor is covered with powder, yes.

953
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'll clean it up. - All right.

954
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a thing of beauty.

955
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey. - Yeah.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've been doing my research.

957
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm taking care of this.

958
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nobody comes in my house, fucks with my girlfriend,

959
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}gets away with it. Here.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you want to do about it?

961
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Want to call in the demon guy?

962
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yes! Exactly! - Call an exorcist?

963
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want to take care of this!

964
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get a quack to tell us what to do?

965
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is my house, you're my girlfriend.

966
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna fucking solve the problem.

967
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- OK? - OK.

968
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe. Just have a little faith, huh?

969
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is it.

970
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's it?

971
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The powder is the last. The last thing.

972
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tomorrow I'm gonna make the call.

973
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Too cute to be talking.

974
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you hear that?

975
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, shit!

976
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

977
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know what?

978
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's footsteps in, but there's no footsteps out.

979
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God!

980
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't leave me in here.

981
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Turn on the light, baby.

982
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's just get out and go downstairs.

983
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's still here. Let's go!

984
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It finally can't run. Where is it?

985
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

986
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The prints stop over here.

987
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, this could be a trap. Please, let's go!

988
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God!

989
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you do that?

990
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You didn't... You didn't, did you?

991
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tell me you opened that.

992
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course not. What the hell is that?

993
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not going up... You're not going up there.

994
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you're not going up there.

995
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not going in there. Just gonna...

996
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Just gonna look. - No, you're not!

997
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I gotta go check it out. I'm getting the ladder.

998
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. It's all set up.

999
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, I really don't want you to go up there.

1000
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please.

1001
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not going in there. I'm just gonna look.

1002
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You have no idea what's up there. You've no idea!

1003
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know.

1004
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Micah.

1005
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Give me the camera. Yeah.

1006
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Be careful.

1007
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, if something goes wrong,

1008
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna throw you the camera and jump out, OK?

1009
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you see anything?

1010
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, I don't want to be down here by myself.

1011
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be right back.

1012
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck is that?

1013
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's something over there stuck in the stuff.

1014
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God, Micah, come back down! Come on.

1015
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, please, come on.

1016
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now this...

1017
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold on. Here.

1018
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Just take the camera.

1019
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. Come on.

1020
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll hold the ladder. Come down.

1021
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something up there, I got to look.

1022
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah! Oh, God.

1023
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, please be careful.

1024
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you OK?

1025
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:56,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, answer me! Micah. Micah!

1026
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm fine. - I'm com... Ah, thank God.

1027
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

1028
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I found this up there.

1029
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. No, no, no, no. Let me see that.

1030
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What're you talking about?

1031
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is our old house.

1032
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What in the hell is this doing in the attic?

1033
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I thought all that stuff burned down.

1034
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no way.

1035
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There is no way you found that in our attic!

1036
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There is no way that that even exists!

1037
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I haven't seen that picture in 15 years.

1038
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That makes no sense. That makes no sense at all.

1039
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You OK, babe?

1040
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you turn the light off, please.

1041
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry.

1042
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where was it when you found it?

1043
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was over our bed.

1044
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm gonna go clean up that stuff. - OK.

1045
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't have any idea if...

1046
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna get to class today.

1047
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God, I'm so tired.

1048
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why are you filming me? I'm just making coffee.

1049
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm actually sick of this.

1050
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think we could both use a little more sleep.

1051
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think I could use a new life.

1052
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so tired of this.

1053
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Take a look at this. - Take a look at what?

1054
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I lightened up the footage from last night.

1055
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can see the footsteps.

1056
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, my God.

1057
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- So? - What?

1058
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you gonna do?

1059
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know yet.

1060
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I do. We're calling Dr. Averies.

1061
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've had your camera work,

1062
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}your powder on the floor,

1063
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and it's just gotten worse, OK?

1064
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We should've done this two weeks ago.

1065
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're calling him. Today.

1066
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's talk about this first.

1067
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, I'm in control, think I'm making progress.

1068
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, you haven't been having progress...

1069
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and you're not in control!

1070
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It is in control. If you think you're in control,

1071
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- you're an idiot! - Hey! Stay cool.

1072
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not a single thing you've done has helped.

1073
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I'm sorry, I don't mean to burst your bubble,

1074
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but the camera hasn't helped,

1075
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}the footprints haven't helped.

1076
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Think that thing would've left footprints...

1077
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}if it didn't want to? No!

1078
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It did it because it wanted to.

1079
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It wanted you to find my photo.

1080
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It can be anywhere. It hears what we're saying now.

1081
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey! How the fuck do you know?

1082
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are absolutely powerless!

1083
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's not true at all and you know it.

1084
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, get over it!

1085
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I called Dr. Averies and he's gone.

1086
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Didn't know what else to do,

1087
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so I called Dr. Fredrichs.

1088
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know you don't love him, but I did.

1089
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And he's coming back tomorrow.

1090
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That was as soon as he could get here.

1091
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So maybe if we make it till then,

1092
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}we could hold off...

1093
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll make it till then!

1094
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just saying that we could just...

1095
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Make it till then." God!

1096
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We could hold out, we'll be OK,

1097
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and maybe tomorrow he'll help us.

1098
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fucking people! Ridiculous.

1099
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck!

1100
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened?

1101
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What're you doing? Micah.

1102
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What're you doing? What'd you hear?

1103
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something out there.

1104
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Fuck! - Oh, God.

1105
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goddamn it!

1106
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Baby, come here. Please don't go...

1107
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, just stay, please. Don't go.

1108
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm going out there and see...

1109
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, Micah, don't go. Don't, please.

1110
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please. Please don't open it.

1111
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, come on. Come on.

1112
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right now. Come on. Micah.

1113
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's there?

1114
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Baby, come on! - You gonna fuck with us?

1115
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:20,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, don't. Come on. Let's go.

1116
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Show yourself!

1117
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, Micah. Let's go. We've got to get out.

1118
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Got a problem? - Stop!

1119
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, hon, I'm sorry.

1120
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah...

1121
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please let go of it.

1122
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, it's scaring us.

1123
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey.

1124
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not gonna make a difference.

1125
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not going in that bedroom.

1126
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Look... - I'm not going in that bedroom.

1127
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, please... - Baby, look, if it comes back...

1128
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, downstairs. Let's just... Please.

1129
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe. It's not gonna make a difference.

1130
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I can't... - Come on.

1131
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't wanna be in here.

1132
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't wanna be even downstairs.

1133
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, please... Please, please. Please.

1134
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

1135
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the hell is in here now?

1136
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know if down here is gonna be much better.

1137
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah. I don't want to be here.

1138
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think we should go upstairs. Again. Come here.

1139
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie?

1140
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe?

1141
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know, gotta get some sleep once in a while.

1142
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just scared.

1143
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I couldn't be in that room anymore.

1144
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I understand.

1145
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't even be in this house, Micah.

1146
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can't even be in our house.

1147
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck is that?

1148
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll check the mirrors.

1149
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Our picture!

1150
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What picture? - That one, look!

1151
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck! What the hell?

1152
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How come my face is scratched and yours isn't?

1153
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something's here.

1154
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- This is bullshit. - It's here.

1155
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's here? What? What're you talking about?

1156
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:12,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. I feel it. I feel it breathing on me.

1157
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, come on! Come on! Please!

1158
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuckin'-A, man.

1159
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuckin'-A.

1160
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:35,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Babe. Come downstairs. - Jesus Christ.

1161
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on.

1162
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Has this shit happened in the daytime before?

1163
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's getting worse.

1164
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

1165
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hey, baby, stop pacing, please. - I'm sorry.

1166
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's making me nervous. - Well, I'm nervous.

1167
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie, hi.

1168
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hi, come in, please.

1169
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you so much for coming back.

1170
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, we've gotta follow up. Micah, hi.

1171
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. We called Dr. Averies, but he's gone.

1172
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, he's out of the country.

1173
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He'll be back. He'll be... Wow.

1174
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We need your help. - This is overpowering.

1175
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's worse. - Yes. It doesn't like that I'm here.

1176
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I cannot help you. - What?

1177
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got to get out of here. This thing is...

1178
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}aggravated by the fact that I'm here.

1179
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You can't leave us alone here.

1180
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Everybody calm down. We need your help.

1181
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I've got to tell you,

1182
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I am not the person to help you in this situation.

1183
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not my area of expertise.

1184
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, I think I'm doing more harm being here...

1185
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}than any good.

1186
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Yes, I have got to leave.

1187
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dr. Averies will be back in a few days.

1188
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When he gets here he'll take care of your problems.

1189
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What should we do? Should we leave?

1190
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Leaving won't help at all.

1191
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:50,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me see what I can do.

1192
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I've got to leave this room now.

1193
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- This is no joke. - I will help you.

1194
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But I can't do this now. - No, no, no, no!

1195
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You serious?

1196
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll take care of this ourselves, OK?

1197
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie?

1198
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck.

1199
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so fucking tired of this.

1200
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know you are.

1201
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want it to be like this.

1202
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:08,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Micah! Micah, wake up. - What's the matter?

1203
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just... I just felt him breathing.

1204
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right there. He was right there,

1205
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I felt him breathing.

1206
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you doing?

1207
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where're you going? Micah, come back!

1208
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not going anywhere.

1209
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Chill. There's nothing happening.

1210
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know, I'm telling you. I'm telling you.

1211
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I... Please.

1212
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, OK. I won't leave you.

1213
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you feel it?

1214
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I feel it, he's still here.

1215
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Something, something's wrong.

1216
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take a deep breath, OK?

1217
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can feel it watching me.

1218
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right now.

1219
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck. You're freaking me out, babe.

1220
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We have to do something. - What?

1221
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. We've got to figure something out.

1222
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We have to... - OK. OK, OK.

1223
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:29,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll figure something out.

1224
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll do some research.

1225
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's gotta be some other options.

1226
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK.

1227
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Jesus. - This is creepy.

1228
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew something happened last night.

1229
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:51,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ah, shit.

1230
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've got to do something.

1231
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can feel something's wrong.

1232
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I was doing some research,

1233
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}just trying to figure out our options.

1234
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Right. - I found this website.

1235
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This chick, Diane,

1236
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}one of the possibilities from the board?

1237
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah.

1238
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All the same things happened to her...

1239
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in the 60's that's happened to you.

1240
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait. What do you mean she has the same things?

1241
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Like everything. You're eight years old...

1242
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and like you had a house burning down,

1243
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}seeing shadows and whatever. God knows.

1244
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And she called an exorcist.

1245
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:33,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that her?

1246
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're telling me there's some girl from the 60's

1247
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}who had the exact same things happen to her.

1248
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Down to a T. You say...

1249
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe this thing is the same thing.

1250
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It just jumped to you instead.

1251
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And that's just its m.o., or whatever.

1252
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And he's trying to warn us,

1253
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}with this Ouija board, trying to tell us...

1254
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}to find this woman so we know...

1255
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait. So what happened to her? Is she OK?

1256
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They tried to get rid of it,

1257
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}sometimes that just pisses it off more.

1258
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Before the exorcist got there,

1259
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}she wasn't like this.

1260
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She was just hearing voices and having bad dreams.

1261
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:14,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to find some kind of reason

1262
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}this thing would pick you after haunting her.

1263
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't find anything.

1264
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}From what I've been reading,

1265
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}these things are totally random.

1266
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's just no reason. Like...

1267
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did she die?

1268
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's pretty.

1269
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:33,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now she is. I think this thing's trying to warn us

1270
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:36,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}not to fuck with it. I don't want to take a chance.

1271
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, God!

1272
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no way that we're doing this.

1273
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:47,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's gone away on its own before.

1274
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is not worth the risk.

1275
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm gonna go lie down.

1276
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, Katie, I got a idea about what we can do.

1277
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Some more stuff. In fact...

1278
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you please get away from me with that camera?

1279
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to study.

1280
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right.

1281
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I kinda want to talk to you about this thing.

1282
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:15,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, please. Will you give me five minutes?

1283
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go! Please!

1284
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, chill out! All right?

1285
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to help this situation here.

1286
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have ideas I want to talk to you about.

1287
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, you and your stupid camera are the problem.

1288
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What the fuck?! - Just leave me alone.

1289
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you stop following me with the camera!

1290
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm trying to solve the problem.

1291
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:35,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't bring that thing to the house.

1292
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Well, don't do me any favors. - You did!

1293
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you, Micah. Thank you so much.

1294
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, hang out with your friend upstairs.

1295
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be down here.

1296
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:48,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Shut up! - Whatever.

1297
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey.

1298
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm sorry. - You didn't do anything wrong.

1299
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You didn't do anything wrong.

1300
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not your fault.

1301
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now listen to me, it's not your fault.

1302
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You haven't done anything wrong.

1303
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK?

1304
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah. Micah! Micah!

1305
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah! Micah!

1306
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Katie! - Micah!

1307
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let her go!

1308
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:08,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah! Micah!

1309
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Micah, make it stop!

1310
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't care, I just want to go. I just want to go.

1311
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't... I can't, I can't be here. I can't.

1312
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just, let's go. Please, let's go.

1313
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's just go right now.

1314
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's get in the car and let's go.

1315
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. All right, we're leaving. I'll get us a hotel.

1316
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll stay there tonight,

1317
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}until we figure out what we're doing.

1318
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're not staying here another night.

1319
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here, let me get a shot of...

1320
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}that thing it made on your back.

1321
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK? Is that OK?

1322
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Jesus!

1323
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:24,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sorry. Looks like something bit you! - I know.

1324
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's go.

1325
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey! Baby, you ready to go?

1326
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Car's packed. Let's go. Hey, babe?

1327
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe, hey!

1329
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jesus Christ.

1330
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:59,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe? Oh my God!

1331
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,620

1332
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Jesus. I've had it with this shit!

1333
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Babe! Come on, let's go.

1334

1335
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's get to the couch.

1336
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. I've had it with this shit.

1337
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm taking care of this right now!

1338
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:50,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fuck this shit, I'm done!

1339
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:00,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Katie. Ready to go? Let's get out of here.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I packed the car. Let's go.

1342
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to go.

1343
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What're you talking about, you don't want to go?

1344
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,790

1345
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,590

1346
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the fuck are you talking about?

1347
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:21,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think it'd be better if we stay.

1348
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please. Just...

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and be dragged down the hall? I don't think so.

1353
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll be OK. We'll be OK. It's better if we stay.

1354

1358
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:04,330
