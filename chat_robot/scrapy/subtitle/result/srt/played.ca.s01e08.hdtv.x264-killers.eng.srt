00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,770
(DON'T STOP LOVE)

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,580
Ice! I need more ice!

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,410
Comin' up.

4
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,860
Chris, buddy.

5
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,280
I need help man. I don't feel good.

6
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,730
I'm in Chinatown somewhere, some alleyway.

7
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,970
I need you to come pick me up.

8

11
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,430
We should probably get some sleep, don't you think?

12
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,910
Yeah, we should probably get on that.

13
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,900
What? What?

14
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,400
So which is it?

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,450
Am I your boyfriend, or is this just... you know.

16
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,210
Are we having "the talk"?

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
I'm just saying.

18
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,310
Yeah, you're right, I mean...

19
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,480
We're in the same unit.

20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,880
It's against the rules.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,450
It has to stop.

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,730
Tonight's the last time. Ever.

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,260
You're so full of it.

24
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,430
We can't tell anyone, Jesse.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,120
Moreland, Rebecca.

26
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,220
Yeah. Done.

27
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,190
We're good liars, right?

28
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,400
So all we have to do is lie.

29
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,030
Ben Trinder. Twenty-one years old.

30
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,300
Coroner did a tox screen.

31
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,550
He was positive for GHB and get this, liquid nicotine.

32
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,270
Seriously? That stuff's lethal.

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,780
GHB is a party drug.

34
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,550
It's low-tech, made in basement labs.

35
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,750
Drug Squad's best guess is dealers add in the nicotine to pump up the high.

36
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,830
So what, they overshot, put in a little too much?

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,250
If there's a bad batch of drugs out there, things can get real ugly.

38
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,010
Remember a few years ago that dealer that was cutting coke with novocaine?

39
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,690
Yeah, eight people died and thirty more in I.C.U.

40
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,060
So we need to move fast, before we end up with more dead kids.

41
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,070
So what we got?

42
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,800
Not much, a location. Before he died, he went to a place called Stem.

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,110
It's an illegal after hours club.

44
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,680
Never heard of it. I've been there.

45
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,890
It moves around every few months to avoid getting busted.

46
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,880
Word of mouth, invitation only.

47
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,020
See John, basically, if you're over thirty...

48
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,100
Drug Squad doesn't want to do a raid, they think it will spook the dealer.

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,650
He'll disappear into thin air, and the drugs stay out there.

50
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,910
So they're handing the case over to us.

51
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,830
The owner of Stem is Joe Kane.

52
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,750
He's gone down twice for assault, once with a broken bottle, took out someone's eye.

53
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,250
This guy's got a temper.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,440
Guaranteed, he's going to know who the dealers are and who's selling.

55
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,490
Drug Squad sent this over, it's an invitation card.

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,100
We use it to get by the doorman.

57
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,210
Jesse, you're under thirty, you can take point.

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,250
See if you can get inside and get an idea on this dealer.

59
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,190
Cool.

60
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,740
Why don't I go with him? I've been there before, I know the scene.

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,030
You wanna go undercover?
They grow up so fast.

62
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,150
Hey, I've done plays before.

63
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,410
Small ones. But, yeah, good idea,

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,780
Let's unleash you into the world.

65
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,260
The entrance to the club is in a Chinese restaurant on Spadina.

66
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,060
According to Drug Squad, you go through the restaurant into the kitchen.

67
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,740
There's a stairway in back. It'll take you down to the club.

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,300
You'll both be wired.

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,930
Maria and John will run cover. They'll be right upstairs.

70
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,450
Private party tonight.

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,600
Seriously? This card doesn't work?

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,450
Not tonight, man. Turn around.

73
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,800
What about this? This help?

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,250
It's a private party, bro. Sorry.

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,490
OK, so... What's it going to take? Look, it's not happening, alright?

76
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,980
So turn around, stop wasting my time.

77
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,630
I don't think Joey would be very happy with you turning away pretty girls.

78
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,210
You know Joe do you?

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
I used to go to these parties all the time. Oh yeah?

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
So what does Joe hang on top of the DJ booth at every location?

81
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,920
Dude she was high, she wasn't paying attention.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,750
No, no, no, I got this. It was a... sign.

83
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,020
It's one of those scrolling... "Don't Stop Love. "

84
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,530
Am I right?

85
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,060
I'm totally right. I got two coming down.

86
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,460
Thank you so much. Don't stop the love, baby.

87
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,380
Okay they're in.

88
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,100
Do you really know that guy, Joe the owner? Nope. Never met him.

89
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,750
(DON'T STOP LOVE)

90
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,320
Your job is to ID the dealer, that's it.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,610
You're looking to score. Talk to waiters, bartenders, the owner if you see him.

92
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,710
Be careful. Anyone smells you're a cop, the dealer will vanish.

93
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,590
What can I get you? Beer and a vodka soda.

94
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Behind you. Is that Joe?

95
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,480
I don't know. It's hard to tell without the bruises

96
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,240
Let's get a closer look.

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,180
You know what, it should just be me.

98
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,540
I can get closer to him without you.

99
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Wait just a sec.

100
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,170
I'll be careful. Girlfriend?

101
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,640
Yeah. No, it's complicated.

102
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,150
So you're a dick.

103
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,090
No.

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,700
I want her to be my girlfriend, I just have to convince her.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,540
Good, I hate dicks.

106
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,920
Joe, hi.

107
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,950
I love the new building.

108
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,120
You don't recognize me, do you?

109
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,120
Seriously? You're one of those guys, huh?

110
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,500
Khali. Khali, right.

111
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,920
What's happening? Khali's ID'd the owner.

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Nice try. Give me a break, I meet a lot of beautiful women.

113
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,180
Oh right, good save.

114
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,200
Cheers. Cheers.

115
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,250
So who do I talk to if I want to party?

116
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,310
Just point me in the right direction and push.

117
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,720
She's blunt as hell. You want to party.

118
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,430
The direct approach.

119
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,910
No one's ever told you to say no to drugs, little girl?

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,630
Not even once.

121
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,550
Wish I could help you out, I just can't do that.

122
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,680
Really?

123
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,960
Sorry.

124
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,550
You're a photographer, right?

125
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,060
Yeah.

126
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,400
Are those yours?

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,430
You like? Are you kidding?

128
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,050
I love, they're amazing. Thank you.

129
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,510
Are you a photographer? I always wanted to be.

130
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,560
Maybe you could give me some pointers.

131
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,850
What would you like to know? What does this do?

132
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,520
You want another beer?

133
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,660
Will you do a shot with me? Two shots of vodka. One for you.

134
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm Jesse.

135
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,290
Beetle. What?

136
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,450
Like the bug.

137
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,550
There's gotta be a guy around here who's selling, right?

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,950
I'm looking to score.

139
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,810
Is what I'm saying, hoping you could help me.

140
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,810
I wish I could, but our guy's not in tonight.

141
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,220
Nothing gonna do with you.

142
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,030
Really?

143
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,430
You look so disappointed. Thanks for the drink, Jesse.

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,420
Let's go. Aliright.

145
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,050
What's going on? Joe's confirmed the dealer's not in the house.

146
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,130
Is Khali going somewhere with that guy? I've got a bad feeling about this.

147
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,620
He's got an apartment upstairs, he's going to show her some photos.

148
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,620
I want you to stay with them, okay? I don't like it either.

149
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,990
But we got ears. We're going to let this one play. Don't lose her.

150
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm right behind them. They're going in back.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
All right. Stay with them, OK? Done.

152
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,900
Is this a good idea? She'll get more from him when they're alone,

153
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,670
then with a bit of luck, the dealer might make a house call.

154
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,470
You okay?

155
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,620
I lost her. Bouncer won't let me through.

156
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,350
Alright, just get back up here fast.

157
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,770
Well, it's kind of mess but...

158
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,600
come in, come in, make yourself at home.

159
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,380
Wow, this place is great.

160
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
She's inside.

161
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,820
Third floor, apartment six.

162
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,330
Have some drinks, look at some photos, then I have a surprise for you.

163
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,760
Surprise, what is it? You're going to like it.

164
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,580
???

165
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,140
What are we doing?

166
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,630
On the third floor there's a fire escape, let's go.

167
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,160
If anything bad happens, you know what to do, alright?

168
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
I got it, get up there, hurry.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,720
Let me just pull this up. Be my guest.

170
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,800
Oh wow, these are amazing.

171
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,460
Look at how you captured all those people.

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,830
That's what I do.

173
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,190
What are you pouring me? A big fat cocktail.

174
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,360
You trying to get me loaded or something?

175
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,020
Then I'm going to take advantage of you.

176
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,830
Good luck with that.

177
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,500
John, hurry. I don't like what I'm hearing. A little of this...

178
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,420
Alright, and...

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,480
Be right there...

180
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,850
You are so talented.

181
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,320
This is amazing. Thank you.

182
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,640
Cheers. Cheers.

183
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,430
So, I have something for you. A little gift.

184
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,630
Hold out your hand.

185
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,960
Best way to get to know someone.

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,960
You get high with them.

187
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,500
You get right 'under their skin'. 

188
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,770
John, he's offering her drugs. 

189
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,630
We're almost there.

190
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,350
How is she? She's holding her own, but you gotta move.

191
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,290
Where do you get this stuff, you got a dealer?

192
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,550
Don't worry about it, just enjoy, alright.

193
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,440
I want to.

194
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,880
I just feel so bad for ditching my friends like this.

195
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,560
You can't call. Have you ever had GHB before?

196
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,150
This stuff is very pure, very clean, it's very designer.

197
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,110
Just like liquid E.

198
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,360
My friends are going to want me downstairs. So I...

199
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,820
Stay a little. Let me help you out here.

200
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,450
Open your mouth, open your mouth.

201
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,960
You know what I'm going to have to bail.

202
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,700
What I don't get it? Thanks for the drink.

203
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,990
How can I talk you into staying?

204
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,020
Why are you freaking out on me? We're just having drinks.

205
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,610
Hey! Things are getting tense.

206
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,460
Where are you?

207
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,190
We're at the top. The door's locked!

208
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,250
Hey, get off me!

209
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,590
What makes you think you're going to leave?

210
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,750
She's in trouble. Get in there, get her out.

211
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,270
Get off me! I wanna go!

212
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,380
You wanna party? We're gonna party, you little bitch.

213
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,590
Police!

214
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,110
Get off her!

215
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,710
Khali?

216
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,330
She's OK. She's OK.

217
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
Jesse, that's enough.

218
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,130
What ???

219
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,870
You OK?

220
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,270
I got him.

221
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,400
Right there, yeah.

222
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,680
He was trying to get me to take GHB.

223
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,170
Then he slams me up against the wall. It came out of nowhere.

224
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
But I'm fine, it's fine. It's fine.

225
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,990
You're not fine. Your lips.

226
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,050
It's okay.

227
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,620
It doesn't hurt.

228
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,550
You're going to drive her to the hospital anyway,
get it checked out.

229
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,250
We need the medical report, you know that.

230
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm fine. Don't argue.

231
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,880
Look, this was a tough situation, you did good.

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,260
Come on.

233
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,090
What's going on?

234
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,970
This just came in. Tyler Clarke.

235
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,950
Twenty years old. GHB laced with liquid nicotine.

236
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,370
We got another overdose on our hands.

237
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,350
I thought he was going to kill you.

238
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,300
You were in there with him, and I couldn't get to you.

239
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,900
Hey. I'm okay. It's okay.

240
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,580
No it's not okay! That was brutal.

241
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,550
You nearly blew our cover with Rebecca, you know.

242
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,260
I don't care.

243
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,930
You're really upset.

244
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,110
You just figured that out now?

245
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,060
I'm getting blood on you.

246
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,350
C'mon on, I'll drive.

247
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,690
This is entrapment. I was set up.

248
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,910
Yeah? How's that?

249
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,800
Those weren't my drugs, they were hers.

250
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,830
She must've brought them up to my place, happens all the time.

251
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,730
I didn't touch her, she attacked me, I was defending myself.

252
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,470
Joe. It's her word against mine.

253
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,350
Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe the judge'll believe you.

254
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,960
At this moment, I couldn't care less.

255
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,720
Ben Trinder, Taylor Clarke.

256
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,240
Both of these kids bought drugs at your club.

257
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,720
GHB, you know all about it. We found a dozen caps in your kitchen.

258
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,010
It killed them. These kids were barely twenty.

259
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,310
Maybe they got them somewhere else,

260
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,810
All right, cause I don't allow drugs in my club. That would be illegal...

261
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm not in the mood to play games... I don't care what the hell you're in the mood for, lady!

262
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,250
You drag me down here, you throw all this crap at me.

263
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,630
If anymore of these drugs get sold... That's not my problem!

264
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,330
I have done nothing wrong!

265
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,540
Now can I please make my phone call?

266
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,290
We got nothing from Joe Kane, but we're holding him, for assault and running an illegal bar.

267
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,660
A second OD has been linked back to the club. Same cause of death.

268
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,180
I should warn you. I'm getting big pressure from the brass.

269
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,360
They want to shut the club down.

270
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,070
That's a bad idea, it'll just pop up somewhere else.

271
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,890
They're giving us 24 hours to get this done.

272
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,180
What? You're kidding me.

273
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,370
You wanna show us the spoils of your evening?

274
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,770
I grabbed over a 1,000 photos from Joe's laptop.

275
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,060
So far, fifteen of them, from fifteen different nights.

276
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,000
This guy, he's in the background.

277
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,080
Standing in one spot and people coming up to him.

278
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,260
That looks like a buy if I could see their hands.

279
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,250
We need a name, that's not gonna come from our friend Joe.

280
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,300
The bartender, Beetle. You got an angle?

281
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,840
She likes nice guys.

282
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,230
I'm thinking I could be a little heart broken.

283
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,400
That's our best move. Okay, so I'll head back into the club.

284
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,570
Not you. You got the night off.

285
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,530
We should also be working the street. Check with your CI's maybe they've heard something.

286
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,240
We need to get this dealer now.

287
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,260
Khali, got a second?

288
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,150
Can you shut the door?

289
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,060
How's your face? It's hurting.

290
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,630
Hypothetical.

291
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,880
If two of my officers were becoming personally involved,

292
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
it would be a problem for me. I'd have to follow procedure.

293
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,080
Transfer one of them out of the unit.

294
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,680
If they were. Yeah.

295
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,260
That kind of emotion, you can't think clearly.

296
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,490
This isn't a game Khali, kids are dying.

297
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,780
You make bad choices, you get distracted.

298
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,830
You put everyone's life in danger.

299
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,250
I wouldn't want that to happen. Me either.

300
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,520
Do I need to have this talk with anyone else?

301
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,510
No, you're good.

302
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,400
I've done some crazy-ass things to impress her.

303
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,580
This is the girl from last night?

304
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,000
This one time in high school... this is kinda embarrassing.

305
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,800
You did something stupid.

306
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,630
I wanted to show her how agile I was so I jumped out of a window and I broke my leg.

307
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,790
But it worked, big time. So you're sweet, huh.

308
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,000
That's how you get laid, by being a sweetheart?

309
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,660
Should try being hardcore, see if girls like that better?

310
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,000
No, no, stick with sweet, sweet is good.

311
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,600
So where is she tonight, your soulmate?

312
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,850
I don't know, she's probably out cheating on me.

313
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,100
What, that's funny?

314
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,250
She's banging some guitar player. This guy wrote a song for her.

315
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,250
How am I suppose to compete with that? You got out-sweeted.

316
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,890
The way this night is going, I need to get high.

317
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,020
I need to get completely messed up.

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,780
I should not be doing this.

319
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,070
Mention my name, and he will hook you up, okay.

320
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,550
Off I go. You're the best. Watch yourself, okay?

321
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,350
Liam's a little crazy. No sudden moves around him.

322
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,790
Help! We need help in here! This guy isn't breathing!

323
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,730
I don't know. He just keeled over, right in front of me.

324
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,610
Hey. Are you OK?

325
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,300
Can you talk? Did you call an ambulance?

326
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,550
Yeah, I'll call back and see how far they are.

327
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,440
Mark!

328
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,700
What happened to him!? You know this guy?

329
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,080
What did he take? Who gave it to him?

330
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,650
I don't know. I just came in, he was lying on the ground.

331
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,020
Mark, wake up! Oh God, what did he take?

332
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,650
I need help, emergency, in the men's washroom, now!

333
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,190
His name is Mark Cameron. He was DOA at Mount Sinai.

334
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,050
Three OD's. Three different nights. All from the same club.

335
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,810
The bouncer seemed to really take it hard.

336
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,590
Take a look at this, it's Mark's phone.

337
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,570
That's the other two victims. So they knew each other, all three of them?

338
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,990
They were all friends?

339
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,020
They partied together, had the same dealer? Presumably Liam.

340
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,040
Okay, but wait.

341
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,200
The night he died, Mark got a text.

342
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,400
"Hey, baby, you should come to Stem tonight, I'm partying, dying to meet you. "

343
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,010
Came from a burner cell, it's impossible to trace.

344
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,530
And check out Ben's phone, two nights earlier.

345
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,450
("Hey, baby, you should come to Stem tonight, I'm partying, dying to meet you. ")

346
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,030
Same text word for word.
They were lured to the club.

347
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,680
Someone is targeting these boys, one by one.

348
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,350
We're dealing with multiple murders.

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,370
OK, Danny, we need to find Liam and make a buy.

350
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,090
We need to bring him in for questioning.

351
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,250
You got it. I'm on the third floor now.

352
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,650
Tell me what you see. Looks like a sweatshop, must be at the back.

353
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,760
Be careful, Beetle said he's crazy.

354
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,090
So this should be fun then?

355
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,680
Hey, I'm looking for Liam.

356
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,190
Drug Squad's following up with the families of the boys.

357
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,910
Maybe they know something. Ben Trinder has a sheet.

358
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,290
Possession for the purpose, two counts.

359
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,000
So what, these guys are in the drug business?

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,850
Honing in on Liam's turf and he didn't like the competition, and decided to take them out?

361
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,130
It's possible. Could be a motive.

362
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,890
Hey, I'm Daniel. I'm the one that called.

363
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,750
Daniel from the suburbs, how you doing?

364
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,910
I'm out.

365
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,320
Come over here, let's talk over here.

366
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,390
Listen...

367
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,230
I heard you could help me out, maybe. You heard that, huh?

368
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,860
I could make it worth your while, man.

369
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,250
I'll take everything you got right now.

370
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,900
You want to talk about it or should I turn around?

371
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,260
You're a friend of Joe's? Yeah.

372
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,670
I like Joe. He's a stand-up guy.

373
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,490
Really? I think he's a dick.

374
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,420
This guy's a comedian.

375
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,420
Can I show you something?

376
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,060
Look at this, I just got this, it's like four hundred years old.

377
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,030
Are you a cop, Daniel?

378
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,590
'Cause if you are, I'm going to gut you with my antique knife.

379
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,050
Goes in like butter, that's how sharp it is.

380
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,270
I know.

381
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,830
I already tried it, on the last cop who wanted to be my friend.

382
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,350
Let's relax, alright?

383
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
If I was a cop, you'd be in cuffs right now.

384
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,690
You're scared.

385
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,630
Oh boy, you're scared.

386
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,580
What are you doing, man?

387
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,490
Are you putting a hole in my shirt? Is that what you are doing?

388
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,830
You know how much this shirt cost?

389
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,240
Oh man, I wrecked it.

390
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,270
Look, Joe said you had good stuff, and I'm buying in bulk.

391
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,260
So if you think I'm a cop, then I'll go buy my stuff somewhere else.

392
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,090
From someone less paranoid, maybe.

393
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,850
What's that mean:

394
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,470
"bulk".

395
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,250
Two liters to start?

396
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,750
OK, Khali, what have you got?

397
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,180
Lab reports.

398
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,410
The blood work from Mark Cameron is a match.

399
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,060
All three boys died of the same thing. GHB?

400
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,890
Same bunch of GHB.

401
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,570
It's identical and matches what Crazy Liam sold to Daniel.

402
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,430
Except for one thing.

403
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,260
The nicotine.

404
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,890
Yeah. What Daniel bought wasn't laced, it was clean.

405
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,130
So Liam was lacing the individual caps.

406
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,720
Targeted killings. He wanted to take out his competition.

407
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,460
We should talk to the bouncer, Orlando.

408
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,890
When Mark was on the floor there, his reaction? I think he knows them.

409
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,630
Makes sense if these boys want to take over Liam's business.

410
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,410
Orlando worked there, he could be involved.

411
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,010
I'm going to go pay him a visit. See if he can fill in some blanks.

412
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,750
You wanna have a go at Liam there? Yeah.

413
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,820
No.

414
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,850
I don't want you, I want the cop that tricked me.

415
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,700
Why don't you go out there and get him and bring him back

416
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,550
cause I got a couple of things I want to say to him.

417
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,320
You finished? 'Cause I got some bad news for you, Liam.

418
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,000
Trafficking was bad enough, but now manslaughter.

419
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,150
You're screwed.

420
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,570
What the hell are you talking about?

421
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,940
Oh you know. Those GHB caps you're selling at the Stem,

422
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,560
you've been cutting them with poison, liquid nicotine.

423
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,730
No, I'm not. Oh yes, you are.

424
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,070
Three dead kids, Liam, that's not good.

425
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,210
Whoa, whoa, just stop!

426
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,970
Just think about it for a second.

427
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,290
A, I'm an artist, alright, I take pride in my work.

428
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,560
B, I'd be killing off my own clientele.

429
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,670
What? You think I'm trying to put myself out of business?

430
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,920
I don't know, maybe you're trying to put them out of business.

431
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,530
What are you talking about? Were those kids stepping on your turf, Liam?

432
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,170
Look. Any one of my customers could have done it.

433
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,640
Do the math, hundreds of kids in that club.

434
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,720
Then you tell me, which one did it Liam?

435
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,550
My lawyer, right now, before I say another word.

436
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,350
Let's get this kid a lawyer.

437
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,720
He's going to need one.

438
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,460
Good morning, Orlando. Rebecca Ellis, Detective Sergeant.

439
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,300
I have a couple of questions for you. About what?

440
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,750
Your friend, Mark.

441
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,240
He died at the hospital. I'm sorry.

442
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,550
Yeah... come in.

443
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,550
So you're crashing at Joe's place?

444
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,920
Yeah, he got arrested. I'm looking after it for him.

445
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,160
How'd you know I was here? I'm the one who arrested him.

446
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,420
Did you know these two boys as well?

447
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,070
Tyler Clarke and Ben Trinder. No.

448
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,380
I mean, yeah they came to the club. They OD'd.

449
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,300
That's all I know.

450
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,960
Who gave them the GHB?

451
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,350
Who wants them dead Orlando? They were dealing drugs maybe? Pissed someone off?

452
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,020
C'mon you work at the club, you see things.

453
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,940
Like I said...

454
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,060
They come to the club, they like to hang out at the club.

455
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,470
We're friendly, that's it.

456
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,320
And what else?

457
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,680
Nothing.

458
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,380
Orlando, you know something about this.

459
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,860
Tell me what happened.

460
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,880
You'll feel better when you do.

461
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,840
No I won't, believe me.

462
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,670
I can't stop thinking about it. What did you see?

463
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,830
Something bad.

464
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,610
Something very, very bad.

465
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,010
There's this stock room, in the club, in the back.

466
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,420
And there's a girl. Bro, you in or out?

467
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,640
It was Ben, the guy that died, that OD'd.

468
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,500
Ben Trinder?

469
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,040
Yeah. And Mark was there too.

470
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,700
And they were... They were taking off her clothes.

471
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,820
Who is she?

472
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,700
I don't know, man, some girl, named Sadie.

473
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,710
So you in or out?

474
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,750
And I did nothing.

475
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,860
I went to the bar.

476
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,610
I got shots, I got wasted.

477
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,070
I saw the girl come out, Sadie.

478
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,250
She looked bad, she was crying.

479
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,490
I don't know who she was, I never saw her at the bar before.

480
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,600
I should've done something, I should have. I should have... why didn't I call the cops?

481
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,970
Why didn't I go in there, myself?

482
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,450
How many guys were in the room with Sadie?

483
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,000
Five... five.

484
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,570
Mark, Tyler, Ben, and two more.

485
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,380
I don't know them.

486
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,240
Orlando, someone's targeting these boys.

487
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,600
If there's two out there...

488
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,500
I'm sorry, I don't know their names.

489
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,820
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

490
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,620
Sadie what? No last name.

491
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,540
Just pull up sexual assaults in the last month.

492
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,580
Nothing. She probably didn't report it.

493
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,740
Do a general search. Girls, 16 to 24, first name starts with "S"...

494
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,670
Okay. There's like five hundred.

495
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,720
What?

496
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,210
Sadie Jansen.

497
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,890
Oh God, she committed suicide two weeks ago.

498
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,320
Hanged herself. Who called it in? Does it say?

499
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,900
Her parents were out of town, she was found by...

500
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,410
What?

501
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,740
Her sister. Brynne Jansen.

502
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,080
Nickname, Beetle.

503
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,020
She's targeting the boys who raped her sister.

504
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,300
So she buys the drugs, adds the nicotine,

505
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,550
lures them into the club, spikes their drinks.

506
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,880
Makes it look like an OD. So it's revenge, pure and simple.

507
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,250
And she has two more targets out there. She could poison them any minute.

508
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,130
We got names? We're not there yet.

509
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,140
Why don't we just pick her up? Have you talked to Homicide?

510
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,170
She's not at home, she's not answering her phone.

511
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,380
Besides, we don't have enough evidence, not yet.

512
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,610
Jesse you're going to the club tonight, you and Khali.

513
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,160
We need to get a confession. Okay? All right, let's get this done.

514
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,710
It's going to be all hands on deck tonight, including Khali, everyone has ears.

515
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,670
Jesse will take point.

516
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,530
John and Daniel will be upstairs in the restaurant for back up.

517
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,280
Maria and I will be in the van.

518
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,450
We're good, we got audio.

519
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,330
She's not at the bar.

520
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
You wanna hang back for a second?

521
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,530
I'm looking for Beetle. You and me both.

522
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,170
She's not working tonight?

523
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
When you find her, tell her to get back here, I need help.

524
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,750
She's here somewhere.

525
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,500
She's gone AWOL.

526
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,270
Okay, let's take a look around.

527
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,600
Khali, you need to search the entire club.

528
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,930
Orlando mentioned a stock room, see if you can find it.

529
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,240
No sign of her yet, we're going to split up.

530
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,570
I found her.

531
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,470
Beetle's in the stock room. What's she doing?

532
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,380
Sitting there, on the ground. She's looking pretty rattled.

533
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,420
I just keep thinking.

534
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,740
If somebody I care about got hurt, if I could picture that.

535
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,440
How I'd feel.

536
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,650
That's good, Jesse, use it, try and get a confession.

537
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,770
You've got five minutes, if it doesn't work, we arrest her on the evidence we have.

538
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,700
Which isn't much, so give me your best shot.

539
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,390
I'll be right outside.

540
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,440
Oh sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

541
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,330
What are you doing?

542
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,750
I just ran into my ex again. From that night, I told you?

543
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,420
She was with that guy, again. The guitar player.

544
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,060
Sorry, I just... I need a second.

545
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,240
You can't stay here, you should go.

546
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,140
I just need a drink. You wanna do a shot?

547
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,400
To tell you the truth, you look like you could use one.

548
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,490
Sorry, it's not my business.

549
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,690
That guy with Khali, he's bad news.

550
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,060
I can tell.

551
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,320
I keep getting these pictures in my head.

552
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,930
If he ever hurt her...

553
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,490
I'd go crazy.

554
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,980
You'd get mad.

555
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,900
Hell yeah.

556
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,360
How mad?

557
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,990
Honestly? If he hurt her bad?

558
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,820
The way I feel about her.

559
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,750
I don't see how I wouldn't lose control.

560
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,550
You wouldn't be able to think,

561
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,240
or breathe.

562
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,690
Exactly.

563
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,350
It would take you over.

564
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,150
Sounds like you've been there before.

565
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,810
Yeah. What makes you say that?

566
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,280
Because I've been there before.

567
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,670
It's true. I've done some bad things.

568
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,160
What happened, Beetle? Did you do something?

569
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,060
My little sister.

570
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,380
A bunch of guys got her drunk and high and...

571
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,200
they hurt her.

572
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,720
Yeah? How bad?

573
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,920
They raped her.

574
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Right here, right in this room.

575
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,230
And I wake up every day thinking,

576
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,700
all I want is for those guys to be dead.

577
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,990
Alright here we go.

578
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,410
But you're not that big, though. You don't have to be.

579
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,690
How would you do it?

580
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,710
The thing about poison is, they don't know what's happening to them.

581
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,040
You don't get to tell them why you're killing them.

582
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,450
But this last guy,

583
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,270
I told him.

584
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,620
I said "You raped Sadie"

585
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,520
And he begged and cried.

586
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,900
Who did?

587
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,220
Who begged and cried?

588
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,020
Did you do something? Where is he?

589
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,580
I shouldn't have told you.

590
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,340
Beetle, where is he?

591
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Is he in there?

592
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,080
Stay back, stay back! Put it down. Take it easy.

593
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,290
John, get in there. There's weapon in play.

594
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,100
Oh, God. Khali, stay where you are.

595
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,330
I will shoot you. I want him dead. Put it down.

596
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,690
He stays in there until he's dead!

597
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,860
Get back, stay right where you are!

598
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,300
Get back! Get Back! Beetle!

599
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,000
Khali! Khali!

600
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,200
Beetle.

601
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,340
Beetle, You don't know me.

602
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm a cop, Beetle.

603
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,450
So is Jesse. We're undercover cops.

604
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,610
Khali, out of here, go, get out.

605
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,520
Are there more cops outside? Are there more cops outside?!

606
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,060
Yes, yes there are. Beetle, please just put down the gun.

607
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,560
If they come in here, I will shoot him.

608
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,250
I don't care, I will kill him. You tell them that.

609
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,040
Okay, okay. I don't care.

610
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,900
OK, I'll let them know. Listen to me.

611
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,690
I know that your sister got hurt.

612
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,260
That those boys hurt her in the worst way, and that she took her life.

613
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,830
Are you trying to talk me down now or something? You kidding me?

614
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,360
That's what I'm supposed to do, but I've never done this before, so...

615
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,180
Shut up!

616
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,530
OK, OK, alright, alright. Alright.

617
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,680
John, it's escalating, are you close?

618
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,400
Almost there.

619
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,990
Get out! Go!

620
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,690
Just listen to me, okay?

621
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,970
I came in here not because I'm a cop,

622
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,110
but because I...

623
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,940
I love him.

624
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,980
I'm in love with him and no one knows.

625
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,530
None of the people we work with, not even him.

626
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,160
So if you... if you hurt him,

627
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,570
I'll be exactly, where you are right now,

628
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,510
with the person I love dead and gone.

629
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,110
And I'll be in all the pain you're in.

630
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,920
So I'm asking you, not because I'm a cop,

631
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,580
but because I don't want to lose him.

632
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,080
I love him, please.

633
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,850
Please.

634
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,800
Please Beetle. It's alright. 

635
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,900
It's OK.

636
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,300
Police! Don't move!

637
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,930
Where is he? Where is he?

638
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,510
Call an ambulance.

639
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,430
Thought maybe you could use a drink after today.

640
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,260
Thanks.

641
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,680
At least we saved that boy's life, that's something, right?

642
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,310
Cheers.

643
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,080
Cheers.

644
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,310
So Jesse and Khali, what's happening between those two?

645
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,970
It was just Khali working the target.

646
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,270
Whatever it took. Good.

647
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,810
'Cause relationships in the same unit,

648
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,580
they never work.

649
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,890
No. No.

650
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,670
You know, you saved my life today, I think. That's right.

651
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,100
You owe me big time.

652
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,960
So...

653
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,630
Did I mean everything that I said?

654
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,950
Yeah.

655
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,220
Or was it just a way to talk down Beetle?

656
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,100
You know that I like you.

657
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,950
You know... we gotta stop this, right?

658
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,550
And we will.

659
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:14,280
