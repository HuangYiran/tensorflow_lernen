00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,578
I'll never forget my time
here as a Hillford girl.
在Hillford读书的日子仍记忆犹新

00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,586
It's so wonderful to be back.

00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:08,607

As school captain of Hillford,
身为HILLFORD的学生主席

6
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,626
I'd like to thank Mrs Dorothy Watson

我要十分感谢Dorothy Watson女士
和Iris McKenna女士

7
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:22,586
for coming to talk to us today as
part of our Centenary Celebrations.
在学校百年庆之际与大家分享美好回忆


8
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,570
 Iris师姐.敢情的,

9
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:27,614
To meet the oldest surviving
Hillford girl is a privilege.
能见识您这位算是活得最久的Hillford校友
真是荣幸无比

10
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:32,562
I'd now like to introduce
to the stage my Year 12 prefects
现在我十分荣幸地为大家请上台的是

11
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:36,610
wearing the uniforms of
the last 100 years of Hillford.
穿着过去历经百年变迁的本校各款校服的
高三学生会干事们


12
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:39,634
From Morgan in the uniform of
yesteryear
从Morgan身上最古老的款式

13
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:43,642
all the way through to me, wearing
the familiar uniform of today.
一直延伸到我身上这件你我身上的最新款

14
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:46,586
We would now like to thank the ladies
接下来我们将以之前精心准备的

15
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,602
by showing them
our dance presentation
舞蹈表演来给予这些美好的设计

16
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:50,623
that we prepared especially for them.
最诚恳的致敬

17
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,594
Hi. My name's Ja'mie.
大家好，我叫Ja'mie

18
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:12,606
I used to be Jamie,
but I added the apostrophe in Year 8.
本名应该是Jamie，
但在初三的时候我就私自强加了个单引号

19
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,562
I'm 17 years old.
我今年17岁

20
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:15,634
I live in Sydney, Australia.
我家住澳大利亚的悉尼

21
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,602
And I'm a private school girl.
我在女私校读书

22
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:21,562
This series is about
my last few months of school
这个短剧是在展示我高中毕业前

23
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:24,603
and the events
that changed my life forever.
那些成为我人生转捩点的
最后几个月的人和事

24
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,638
We're the most expensive
girls' school in the State.
我们是本郡最贵的女子私校

25
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,606
The most expensive?
我们有那么贵么？
Yeah, we are.
当然啊

26
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:35,630
It is, we are.
我们真的最贵

27
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,570
Yeah, and we top the State
academically as well.
而且哦我们教育评级也是最强大的

28
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,562
Yeah, that's because of
the Asian factor. Yeah.
那还得多谢学校的亚裔生


29
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,606
They're all on scholarships.
她们全都拿奖学金的要知道
There's heaps of Asians here.
我们学校确实贼多亚洲人

30
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:43,642
Hillford's pretty much known
Hillford最出名的自然是

31
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:46,570
for having the hottest girls
in the whole of Sydney.
我们囊括全悉尼最正的妹子们

32
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:47,614
It's like a known thing.
这都算是常识了拜托
Yeah. Yeah.
嗯~嗯~

33
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,634
If you go to Hillford, people are like
'Oh, my God. You must be so hot.'
就像你说你来自Hillford，别人就会说“叼呀 你实靓爆镜”
（无责任粤语是猪一贯的字幕作风 以下不时出现 请见谅）

34
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm not even bragging but me and
my friends are all pretty much quiche.
恬不知耻地说我和我这班姐妹们quiche到没朋友~
（quiche-一种烘焙的蛋挞，这里主角利用这个食物自身的温度
来和常作性感一词的HOT做比较 猪就不乱译了 直接引用 后面多次出现）

35
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,646
Like, if you couldn't tell
from looking at us.
不过这眼睁睁的大事实其实也不用点明了，不是么？


36
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,606
Oh, if you didn't know 'quiche'
is a word that I made up.
对了，或许你们不了我说的quiche，
那是我自创的用词


37
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:01,638
It basically means 'hot'
but, like, it's a step above 'hot'.
就和性感的hot的意思差不多
但你懂的，它就是比hot再高温那么一点点

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,590
It's, like, more than just hot.
就是，你了的，比hot在给力那么一点点~

39
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,602
No, I'd say basically quiche
is hot to the point
我真心觉得quiche就是最能说明正点的一种hot（双关 热度|性感）了

40
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,566
where you wanna have sex with them.
尤其当那种热度带来的口感高潮占领一切的时候。
（这里只能意译，猪能力不够）

41
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,578
Rootable.
从宇宙根源学上说

42
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,586
Like, there's hot
and then there's quiche.
就好比这里要是hot的状态
那么这里就是quiche了

43
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,650
One of the main measures of
quicheness is your box gap.
要知道作为衡量你的quiche指数的标准
就是你的股间距了

44
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,566
Yeah, box gap.
对 没错

45
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,646
Basically what it is, is, like...
Maybe you could pop up, Immy.
简单来说就是指..
Immy不如你来给演示一下吧

46
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:19,598
You don't want the thighs
to touch at all,
你绝不该让两边粘合在一起


47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,566
so you want sort of like
at least a three finger,
标准应该最少有三个手指的间距

48
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,614
and I'll just demonstrate that.
就像我现在比量的这个

49
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,558
The more, the better basically.
而且 平心而论

50
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,594
If you've got your thighs rubbing
together from fat
你是因为肥胖而造就不够间距

51
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,606
then you need to think
about what you're eating
那我们建议要好好考虑节食了

52
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,574
or maybe just accept the fact
that you'll never be quiche.
再不是就是面对你quiche不起来的现实吧

53
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,626
We should do, like,
a mega sleepover at my house.
我建议我们不如都到我家来个华丽丽地过夜吧

54
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:37,622
- Ja'mie's like our leader.
-Ja'mie是我们的大姐大
- We're all prefects.
-我们都是学生会的

55
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,558
That's what brought us
together this year. We're all BFFs.
所以造就我们今年的相识和最终的结义金兰

56
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,614
I had a different friend group
last year
我去年其实还有另一个小圈子的

57
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,598
but I had to get rid of them because
但我也只能忍痛脱离她们

58
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,630
Brianna, my bestie,
kind of got really weird and fat.
因为我那亲Brianna不知怎的越来越奇葩圆润了

59
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,566
She's kind of a bit indie now.
Yeah...
她现在也有点挺特立独行的
大概..

60
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,630
I'm still really nice if I see them
around the playgrounds.
但当我在操场喜见她们我还是会热脸相迎的

61
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,618
Hi, Ja'mie.
Hi.

62
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:56,579
Oh, my God. Awkies.
妖~吐艳~好尴尬~

63
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:00,646
Sometimes it's better to kind
of let your friends go, in a way.
有些人有时还是得更潇洒的看待友谊嘛

64
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,558
- You need to move on.
- 不要再纠缠旧感情了
- Move on.
- 不要再认亲认戚了

65
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,642
I'm the school captain. So I'm like
the boss of the whole school.
我这学生会主席就相当于全校的大姐大

66
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,598
Um, and this is my team, my prefects.
这些是我的队友，我的好学生会妹妹们

67
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,631
We're family.
我们就是一家人
Hi.
跟大家打声招呼吧

68
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,614
OK, guys, let's set up here.
来~姐妹们，让我们站两列

69
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,642
So every morning, we do gate duty.
每天早上，我们都要站校门岗

70
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:18,590
So we have the ability
to give out Friday detentions.
而且能给违纪的同学周五留堂处分

71
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,570
Phone off and in your locker.
You're on school grounds.
记得关手机和一定要锁在私人柜里
要知道你们已经走进校园领域内了哦

72
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:22,638
Write her name down.
What's her name?
记下她名字
她叫啥来着？

73
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,622
Three warnings and you get a Friday.
三次记过你就要周五留堂了哦

74
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,634
No wristbands in school.
在校不给戴这个

75
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:29,602
- No coffee on school grounds.
-校道内不许喝着咖啡
- Oh, wow.


76
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,650
I feel like a lot
of the younger girls
我能感觉到其实很多低年级的妹妹

77
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,606
really look up to us though.
是很崇拜我们的

78
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,634
Get your mum to sort that out,
Celeste.叫你妈妈好好帮你整理一下


79
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,618
I've spoken to you before about this.
我记得之前就跟你提过这事了

80
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,626
Get that pink shit off your bag.
Take it off.
你书包上那粉瞎的鬼东西给我撤了

81
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,602
This is the prefect room
这里是学生会的专属间

82
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,570
so this is like the room
where us as prefects chill out.
这里就是我们姐妹们舒展的好地方

83
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,558
It's a prefect-only zone.
别人是不许进的

84
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,622
Excuse me, can you get away
from the prefect room entrance?
不好意思，能麻烦你们给学生会入口让出个道么


85
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,582
Move, away from the entrance.
快~别挡着碍眼

86
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,638
I mean, being in year 12,
it's such a stressful year.
我想说高三真不是给人过

87
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,642
We've got a mat and stuff and we do
yoga some mornings and just chill.
我们要是在早上不执勤找几个垫子让咱们好好做个瑜伽
放松放松那该多好

88
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,582
Yeah. It's really good.
啊 你一说我就点赞了

89
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,630
I can't believe I've got
a whole day ahead of me.
一想到还有一天的课我就 怒CRY

90
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,594
Did the cleaners vacuum this or not?
话说那清洁工到底吸尘了没啊

91
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,610
Like, there's something about being
a prefect that feels really good.
要知道 其实做学生会的感觉还是挺爽的

92
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:06,574
I always knew I wanted to be one.
我很早就立志要成为其中一员了

93
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:09,602
Totes. I definitely knew I was going
to be one from, like, Year7.
绝逼的，我那啥 初一时就已经密谋要当了

94
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,566
And we all have the Prefect Promise
that Ja'mie made up.
我们还有Ja'mie帮我们订立的学生会盟约

95
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:13,574
The Prefect Promise.
噢~说到盟约啊~

96
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:15,618
Basically, the Prefect Promise
is like a promise
简单来说吧 盟约的主旨就是

97
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:19,606
that we'll all, like, stick together,
as prefects, no matter what happens.
一日成军 终日一体

98
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,590
Yeah, like a family...
Any bad stuff that like goes down...
对 我们就是一家亲
家人有难

99
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:24,562
..then, we'll be there for each
other.
绝对一同共度

100
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:27,606
For example, if one of us got depression
and wanted to, like, kill themselves
打比方说 如果我们其中一人抑郁了
接着想自杀的说

101
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:31,618
then as part of the Prefect Promise,
we'd probably all kill ourselves.
根据盟约 我们就要集体自杀

102
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah.
噢~
Like.
类似的~对~

103
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,602
I didn't know it was that extreme.
我们要走得那么极端么~

104
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:35,618
Yeah, it is.
当然要 ，我说的算

105
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:39,562
Have a good first period, everyone!
I'm gonna miss you guys.
亲~第一课时要好好的哦~
我会想乃们的~

106
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,614
I love you, Ja'mie, so much.
Ja'mie，我爱死你了

107
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,602
Have the best time in English.
You too.
好好享受英文课哦~
你们也要好好的哦~

108
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:47,578
I'm the leader. I'm sort of like
the mother hen of the group, you could say.
我是会长，自然就是大家的好姐姐 好慈母~之类的~

109
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,630
Like, I have to look
after my little chickens.
她们就是我护翅下的小鸡们~

110
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,598
Send me anything.
记得给我捎个信什么的~

111
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,650
Send me selfies, just whatevs.

All of you, I fucking love you.

116
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,562
- Mwah!
-啵个~

The usual spot.

- Bye.
- Oh, my God.

able to get money out of people.

back a bit like that?

210
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:50,558
Oh, my God. Seriously, I'm praying
that someone videoed it.
姐妹们 我说啊 我求爷爷求奶奶
刚才要有人给我拍下来啊

211
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,634
I think I saw Hannah had her phone
up. I know she had it.
我好像看到Hannah举起她的手机了
对 我就知道她会拍

212
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,587
Oh, my God. What about
when you did the slut drop?
你知道么 你刚才的M字腿赞B了

213
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,638
Girls, girls, I saw the dance.
The gesture is great.
同学同学 我刚才看了你们的表演
我觉得动作很流畅

214
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,598
But we've got to be careful that
in delivery there's nothing inappropriate.
但是不是要注意一下不要太过火了呢

215
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,618
-There wasn't.
没有啊 
-In the first place,
we start with uniforms.
在一开始的时候是得体的


216
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,574
I want them done up now.
但最好就一直得体下去

217
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:11,566
There is to be no undergarments
seen at any time.
我决不允许任何内衣部分外露的情况出现

218
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,638
Buttons done up.
扣子一定要扣好
You can't even see anything.
这样根本没有露内衣啊

219
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,634
OK. And the other thing...
Excuse me. The other thing is
好了 还有
那个听着 还有一件事

220
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:20,586
we need to get rid of some of those
more risque dance movements.
你们还试着删减一下潜在问题的动作

221
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,582
But sir... They were totally
into it. Those women loved it.
我明白你说的 校长 但是，要知道她们其实
挺喜欢我们的表演的啊

222
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,602
Those dance moves are OK
for things like schoolies.
如果这是毕业典礼 我也就算啦


223
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:28,630
Do you know how much work
we put into that dance?
你知道我们练了多久么

224
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,594
I can see that.
That's not the issue.
我能理解 
但是这不是问题的核心

225
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,570
The issue is the way in which
you represent the school.
问题是你们的一举一动都代表着我校

226
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:38,598
You are young women
representing Hillford Girls Grammar.
你们就是学校 学校就是你们

227
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:41,574
I'm not here
to negotiate what goes on.
总之我说了不许就是不许

228
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,614
There is a line, and we mustn't
cross it in the future.
我现在说得很明白了 以后一定要注意

229
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,594
Alright.
Are we clear on that?
-好吧
-明白了吗?

230
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:48,650
Sorry, sir.
明白了校长
Alright, girls. Off to class.

231
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,570
Quick, let's go.

We won't do it again, sir.
我们下次不敢了 校长

232
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,582
Make sure you don't.
知错就好
We won't.
知道的哦

233

Bye, sir.
校长 再见

艹他没天理 什么不知廉耻嘛
那你还不是往我胸罩里盯

235
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,562
Obviously, his wife's
not giving him what he wants.
我肯定他老婆没有好好给他泄欲

236
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,566
Seriously, why are you looking
at my tits? It's so awkies.
说真的 你有本事别看人家的凸点啊~
吐艳死了


237
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,611
It's like you're 60.
老古董 不知丑

238
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,650
Immy. I saw your new DP.
It's so quiche.
Immy 我看到你新微博的照片了

is 'I love pussy'?
你知道你先在脸书的状态是：我爱你个B

241
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,626

00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,590
Well, at school, I'm
pretty much friends with everyone.

Like, everyone thinks
I'm really nice.
每个人都特爱我

246

I'm gonna get a photo of the Asians.
Oh, my goodness.
我一定要拍那边的亚洲妹子们
太萌了

247
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,590
I think, as school captain,
我很标榜自己作为学生会会长

248
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,598
that's a really good thing for me
to be the cray ambassador of niceness.
就一定要成为大家的亲善大使

249
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,638
Hello! Hello!
嘿·嘿

250
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,590
Oh, my God.

00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,574
I'm gonna gram it.
I'm going to hashtag 'fried rice'.
我要微博它
接着标签为‘炒饭’

252
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:58,566
I'm so random!
我太不识相了

253
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,610
But YOLO.
但是就是很萌

254
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,618
Oh, stop it!
妖~不要啦

255
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:05,574
Like, I've got my BFFs,
你瞧 我姐妹一堆

256
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:09,642
but I'm nice to pretty much everyone
in the school, except the boarders.
但我基本来说还是人见人爱的 除了对着那些寄宿生

257
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:12,638
Hi, Lauren! Hi, boarders.
嘿Lauren 寄宿生们你们好哦

258
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,574
Oh, my God.
How are you going?
天啊 
你们今天过得可好

259
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,598
How's the boarding house? Looks fun.
宿舍可好？萌不？

260
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,622
You guys got changed really quickly.
你们这身装还换得挺快的哦

261
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:24,582
I like how you just get into the
school jersey straight after school.
我特么欣赏你直接课后就套运动服

262
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,578
The boarders are these girls,
right, they live at the school
这些寄宿妹子 基本因为家是务农的还是之类的

263
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,570
and they're from like farms and
stuff.
就偏远只好住校

264
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:32,562
Like, they're rich but they're,
like, really kind of rural
她们就一爆发户
土气是甩不掉的

265
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,558
and all of them
are pretty much lesbians.
还有我想她们都应该是女同

266
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,566
So, what are you having
for dinner tonight?
你们晚餐想好了么

267
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,626
Lesbianese food or...?
Ja'mie, you're so funny.
-女同餐还是？
-Ja'mie你太贱了

268
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,634
So is it true that you guys
are all vagitarians?
话说你们是不是真的就都是素食者啊

269
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,622
Oh, my God. That is so mean.
矮油 太贱了啦

270
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:45,602
How fat is Erin?
Disgusting.
Erin你瞧她那身段
太恶了吧也

271
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:48,590
She's put on so much weight.
Put down the fucking fork.
她吃太多了啦
好心她就别老端着碗筷不放啦

272
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:52,595
She looks fucking ridiculous. It's like
someone has pumped her up or something.
她看上去好傻B 就像给人打过气似的

273
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:57,562
Hey, Erin, have you lost weight
lately? You look really good.
喂~Erin你最近是不是瘦了 看上去变美了

274
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,630
Need a tampon, Ja'mie?
'Cause you're being a fucking bitch.
你来大姨妈了？JA’mie
难怪你一副贱相

275
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,650
Oh, why? Do you wanna stick it in me?
Heavy.
你想帮我塞卫生棉么？
肥婆

276
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,638
I don't even know
why I don't like them.
其实我也不知道为什么我就是不喜欢她们

277
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,570
It's just like... they're just really
annoying. You know what I mean?
总之呢 她们看着就闹心 你了的


278
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,562
They're sort of, like, fat and weird
and they have stupid haircuts.
你瞧瞧她们那身段啊 恶心啊还有那傻不溜秋的发型

279
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,614
You know, it's like...
you're a girl, act like one.
你们不是女孩子么 就不懂得洁身自好啊

280
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:16,574
Hey, boarders, like,
you know, on farms,
嘿 寄宿生 你们在农场啊

281
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,622
do you have to have, like,
a licence to drive a tractor?
开卡车到底要不要执照啊

282
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,566
I seriously wanna know.
我真心想知道嘢

283
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,622
Do you have tiny tits
for any particular reason, Ja'mie?
那我问你那颗粒般小的的奶头
是不是什么病啊，JA'MIE

284
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:26,602
First of all, why the fuck
are you looking at my tits anyway?
首先 我要说你干嘛看人家的奶头！

285
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:28,598
More proof that you're a lesbian.
说你就是女同志了吧！

286
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,626
And, secondly, shut the fuck up
or I'll give you a Friday detention.
接着你再给我乱吼我就给你记过留堂

287
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:34,586
Don't ever bag Ja'mie's tits.
Yeah.
别给人家乱吼Ja'mie的奶头
就是

288
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:36,650
The reason they're small
is because I had a eating disorder
我奶头小是因为人家有饮食紊乱


289
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,650
so it's not exactly a laughing
matter, OK?
你怎么将自己的开心建立在别人的痛苦之上

290
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,642
So go fucking fist yourself.
去吃你妈的草皮蛋

291
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,590
Alright, horse face. I will.

292
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:45,558
Fucking bitch. Give me that.

Here, take it, take it.

I'm writing it up.
你周五走不掉了！我铁定记你过

296
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,602
What's going on here?
怎么了孩子们
Hi, miss.
老师好

297
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,610
The Year 7s
are throwing food and stuff.
没啥 初一生他们随地乱扔杂物

298
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,606
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.
I'll get them to clean it up.
不用担心 我会管教她们收拾的

299
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,558
Alright.
真乖
See you, miss.
老师再见

300
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,626
Year 7s, get up.
Go and fucking clean up the milk.
初一的 给我起来 
好好给我清干净那些牛奶渍

301
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:09,638
And don't throw food around.
Pick it up. Hurry up.
以后别给我再乱扔了 知道不
快清

302
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,570
Oh, my God. That was so Year 7.
就是啊 真没规矩的初一生
See you, Lauren.
Lauren 回见哦

303
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,590
Enjoy checking out my arse
as I walk away.
我转身离去的倩影你也不要放过哦

304
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:19,575
Oh, my God.
哈 你太强了

305
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,594
Well, after school, like,
if we don't have sport or whatever,
接着一如往常 如果我们没有课外活动的话

306
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,610
then we usually go to the bus stop.
That's like the place to go.
我们一般会跑去巴士站附近
那可好了

307
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,586
It's just down the road
out the front of Kelton Boys Grammar
最重要那里就是在Kelton男校的校门旁

308
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:37,574
and, like, me and the girls,
we know heaps of Kelton guys,
我还有姐妹们可是有很多男校的蜜闺什么的呢

309
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,650
so it's just really good to chill.
所以绝对是个好去处

310
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,614
News? Goss? Go.
八卦？趣闻？快说
Oh, my God.
等个嘛~

311
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,582
How was the dance? Was it cray?
你们那群舞怎样？华丽丽么？

312
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,634
Oh, my God. It was so legit.
Ja'mie looked so quiche.
潮爆了 我给你说
JA'MIE是万人焦点啊

313
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,642
Seriously, I went like full slutty,
I had like my buttons undone
你要知道 我跳得可骚了
我将扣子都一字排开

314
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:51,578
and then Hayes afterwards busted me
for showing too much cleavage.
接着就被校长说东说西的了

315
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,618
But, seriously, he wants me so badly.
但他明显就是想吃了我那副死相
Yeah, you can tell.
对啊 真恶心

316
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:57,594
Yeah, I reckoned he like full jizzed
while I was dancing.
我敢肯定我一边跳他一边鼓鼓地支帐篷了都

317
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:00,574
Is he hot? Like silver fox or...?
Um, no. He's chat as.
-他帅不？是宽叔款还是...
-哪有 就一老宅男

318
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:01,622
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.
娘亲的 太恶了吧

319
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:03,634
I think it's important
as a girl of my age
我真心觉得就我现在的花样年华

320
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:07,598
and also my status within the school
as school captain to socialise,
还有作为母校学生会主席的身份来说

321
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,646
especially with the other
elite private schools.
交际。尤其是和其他等级别的精英私校的互动是
必不可少

322
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,582
So Kelton, like, the guys there,
拿Kelton男校来说吧

323
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,562
like, they're the future leaders of
the country, if you know what I mean.
你要知道那边的学生可各个都会是将来的达官贵人啊

324
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:19,602
So, like, as me, it's good for me
to sort of get in with them now
所以呢 小妮子我现在要是能和他们好好处处

325
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:22,626
so in the future, I'll have, like,
connections for later in life.
不久将来就能各种人脉广布啦

326
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:25,578
Oh, my God.

You have to focus now.
Jamie 你要驾车了 所以你要好好留心周遭

376
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,610
You put your windscreen wipers on,
not your indicator.
你把雨刮给开了
而不是指示灯


377
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,558
Why do they put it on the same side
as the indicator?
为什么这车要设计成两种控制在同一区啊

378
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,570
OK, I'm going, drive, here we go.

Jamie, have you checked
your blind spot?

380

Because the handbrake is still on.

Well, take the fucking handbrake off.

before I get in. It's annoying.
我一上车就叫你帮我松了啊 真烦

Jamie, we've had this discussion
before.
Jamie我们之前谈得好好的

384
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,562
If you're not confident in driving
then you're not allowed to drive.
如果你没能力开 我就不该让你来开

385
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:11,558
Soz, I thought that was the
accelerator.
对不啾~我踩错刹车当油门了

386
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,590
For heaven's sake, this is ridiculous.
I want you girls to keep quiet.
天啊 这咋整啊 你们后座的能不能先别吵啊

When I first saw him I was like,
'Oh, my God.'
要知道第一眼我见他
我就直接萌晕了

00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,626
He's got the eyebrows,
he's got the best body.
他那浓眉毛
他那六头肌

really mature for his age.

Please watch on
the side of the road again.
求你好好看路况

394
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:35,590
Courtney, move so Madison
can get her fucking seatbelt on.
Courtney滚一边去好让Madison能扣上安全带

395
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,598
He looks really, like,
mysterious and stuff.
他越看就越给力啊

396
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,570
Fucking little bitch. Grow some tits.
死妹子 奶头都未长齐

Don't speak to your sister like
that! You can't talk, flatty.
你不许这样说你妹妹
肥婆
Courtney 你也不许回嘴

398

and when I was in year 7,
我在你这年纪的时候我奶头就已经成人了

my tits were fucking way bigger
than yours.
总之是永远比你的贼大！

你那就两个蚊叮的包
我那两颗是芒果懂不！

tits an adult has ever had
你啊就等着做一辈子全世界奶头最小的


402
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,566

you're a fucking little bitch.

403
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,602
Jamie, I'm going to tell
your father about this.
Jamie我要向你爹告状了哦

404
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,638
I am trying to drive
while that little bitch
我可是好心顺路载这丫

405
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,570
is preventing my friend
from wearing her safety device.
但她却不给我朋友安全出行的权利嘢

我真不知为什么我倒八百辈的霉了

The world doesn't evolve around you.

Jamie你却乱花钱给你买爱屁股

Courtney没有手提是因为她之前盗用我微博账号

445
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,618

things without our permission.

470
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,650
which I believe she's getting
at Hillford.
所以我们送她去读Hillford


471
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,646
Her Year 12 results
are vitally important,
而高中最后一年又尤其关键

472
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,610
and I expect a lot
from both my daughters.
我对我两个女儿都充满期望

473
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:15,602
We expect big things.
俺们 都很望女成凤

474
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:18,646
But, Jamie...
Man, she's special though.
但大姐她 
唉 她真太有前途了

475
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,610
She's not only a very clever girl,
but she has proven herself
她不仅聪慧

476
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:25,602
to be a very kind
and compassionate girl as well.
而且还处处对自己高要求 
努力做到坚韧不拔善良贤惠

477
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:28,622
'A nest of ferns
was her only place to rest.
‘巢蕨是她唯一能栖息的地方

478
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:32,598
It had been a thrilling day,
but a day she would rather forget.
今天过得无比漫长艰辛
但是她将永生难忘

479
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,598
The end.'
完

480

I know, how fucking cute is he?
天啊 他好萌

484
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,618
So how often do you read to him?
Like, every night, pretty much.
你那啥 经常给他读书么
额~基本每晚上啊就这样

485
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,614
I'm doing The Hunger Games at the
moment and he fucking loves it.
我现在在读【饥饿游戏】 他超爱的

486
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:52,610
He's pretty quiche
for an African guy.
他在非洲人那块算萌的了

487
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:55,558
I love it when he smiles
'cause he's all black
我最喜欢他笑得时候

488
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,650
and then, just bang,
this white thing.
因为刷白的牙齿一出现就华丽丽了

489
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,622
Yeah, this gleaming white thing
coming out of his mouth.
对啊 和黑皮肤一对比 铮亮铮亮的

He's so cute.

491
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:04,574
I'm trying to get him to take his top
off, like, on Skype, but he won't.
我一直想叫他裸上身视频的 但他不肯

492
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:07,606
Can I sleep in the bed tonight?
I'm really sick of the mattress.
我今晚能睡床上么
我不想再打地铺了


493

the lesbian prevention guard.
那我得先建起不许女同我防线

You're so funny, Ja'mie.

I'm fucking serious.

fingers in my vagina. 'Accidentally.'
我才不想明早一起来发现你手‘不小心地’
在我私处游动


497
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:20,602
Check your phone and see if Mitchell
has accepted your friend request?

I really want him to.

up. Would that be trag if we went?
对啊 高一新生要办派对 你觉得我们去会不会有点怪

going, so Mitchell will be there.
所有高一橄榄队员都会去 所以Mitchell也会在

I'd go, the Year 10s are hot
but it's kind of a bit creeps.
我要去 虽然里面都是萌物但总有点怪怪的

507
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,602
Fucking hell.
I've just thought of an idea.

at my house!

Oh, my God. Are you serious?

00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,650
Seriously, we haven't had a party
for months.
你想啊 我们好几个月都没有好好疯过了

512
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:55,558
Invite Mitchell,
invite all the Year 10s.
叫上Mitchell 还有所有高一的

513
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,578
How much does Ja'mie
have the best party house?
话说还有谁得家能比JAMIE家更适合呢


514
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,578
That is genius, Ja'mie.
Around the pool.
JAMIE你太棒了
我们要泳池趴

515
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,586
We can have, like, a bubble machine
and a smoke machine and a DJ.
接着配上泡泡机还有干冰机和DJ

516
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:05,602
And we can light up all the trees
with fairy lights and shit.
接着所有树丛都给亮得华丽丽


517
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:07,598
Costume one, or what?
I don't know.
主题趴还是啥好呢

518
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,614
Too much pressure.
妈呀 突然好大鸭梨
Yeah, dress really nice.
对啊 还要精心打扮

519
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,602
You can do slutty anyway.
我们可以走骚货路线
Want to look classy.
但我比较像走高贵

520
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:14,562
Fuck. Oh, my God.
This is the best idea ever.

Should I ask my dad?

-求你了 我好想搞

I'm not having a bunch of teenagers,

528
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:33,570
especially ones I don't know,
in this house.

Daddy, please.

Jamie can be very persuasive
when she wants to be.
Jamie每次有求于我总会使劲招数

531
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,602
She has this habit of biting me
on the shoulder
她有一绝招就是咬我的肩部

532
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,562
when she wants to get her own way.
这招一用必灵

533
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,646
She's done it
ever since she was little.
她从小就学会了

534
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,562
It gets me every time, eh?
结果就成为她有求必应招

535
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:47,642
She can be very flirtatious,
you know.
她有时候真的很会让我脸红心跳

hand. I don't know.
我听说一疯起来会很可怕 我拿不定主意

562
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:03,618

563
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:05,634
Oh, my God.
Gross!

564
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:10,618
They're choosing the best dance soloists to
perform in front of the wholeschool.

565
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:13,602
Are you fucking serious?
Are you trying to sound bad?

566
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:16,598
We sound fine. Grow some tits
and shut your fat face.

567
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,562
So I told Josh and all his friends
to meet us after choir practice.

568
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:23,571
OK, quick, get in, get in.
I didn't think you were gonna come.

569
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,582
Some of us are straight in here.

570
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,626
Don't look.

571
