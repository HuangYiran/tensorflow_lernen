00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,326
你以为你一天的工作很糟糕吗？
You think you've had a bad day at work?

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,412
我觉得我比你惨
I think I got you beat.

4
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,168
这不是我
That's not me.

5
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,380
不 这是我的搭档
Nope, that's my partner.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,433
去你的！
Suck it!

7
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,602
我在这儿
There I am.

8
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,700
三四天前
Three or four days ago,

9
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,146
我不知道有这个世界的存在
I didn't know this world existed.

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,443
但三四天前
But three or four days ago,

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,653
我还不是冥界警局的一份子
I wasn't in the Rest In Peace Department.

12
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:17,070
片名：冥界警局

13
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,323
三、四天前…

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,712
一里之外我就听到你过来了
I heard you coming a mile away.

15
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,133
奇怪 法国女孩都该骑在波士顿最棒的男人身上
Look at this, French girl gets the drop on Boston's finest.

16
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,176
你却骑在我身上啊 对吗？
You got the drop on me, huh?

17
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,928
我现在感觉自己像个天才
But I feel like a genius right now.

18
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,680
如果您打算要更好的
I couldn't have planned this better.

19
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,224
好吧 天才 有棵桔树倒在后园里
Well, genius, there is an orange tree in the backyard.

20
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,226
怎么会如此？
How did that get there?

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,398
是的 后园里有颗桔树
Yeah, there is an orange tree in the backyard.

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,774
真奇怪
How weird.

23
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,903
我不知道它是怎么到这儿来的
I don't know how it got here.

24
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,405
我也不知道
Me neither.

25
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,240
你知道它象征繁荣吗？
You know it's a symbol of prosperity, don't you?

26
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,616
没有 我从来没听过
No, I've never heard that.

27
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,993
是真的 问问佛罗里达州的人们
It is, yeah. Ask anyone in Florida.

28
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,327
不 你疯了吗
No, you're crazy.

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,454
它可能无法活过冬天
This tree is never gonna make it through the winter.

30
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,332
可能有人无法活过冬天
We might not make it through the winter

31
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,710
因为这房子里很冷！
in this freezing little house!

32
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,421
但我就爱我们的冷房子
I love our freezing little house.

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,714
你也爱 对吗？
You do, do you?

34
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,924
是吗？
Yeah?

35
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,260
你别无所求了吗？
But don't you want more?

36
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,845
你总是担心钱不够
You're always worried about money.

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,597
你不是想要好房子吗？好车子吗？
Don't you want a real house? A car?

38
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,516
我才不担心钱 是你担心
I don't worry about money, you do.

39
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,935
我需要的一切都在这里
I have everything I need right here.

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,563
我的丈夫陪伴着我
My husband, with me.

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,941
你将会一直拥有的
Well, you'll always have that.

42
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,285
我得去上班了
I gotta go to work.

43
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,120
我会告诉你什么时候你可以上班
I'll tell you when you can go to work.

44
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,331
真的吗？
Really?

45
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,051
当心扭到脚 爱你 亲爱的
Watch that ankle. I love you, baby.

46
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:44,388
再见 我也爱你
Bye. Love you.

47
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,074
什么时候我照片和奖杯才会在陈列柜中
Got my picture in a trophy case, I see.

48
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,034
看看这个 可以永垂不朽了
Look at that. Already immortalized.

49
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,246
那需要天时地利 我还能说什么？
Right place, right time. What can I say?

50
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,081
- 嘿 鲍比  - 你好
- Hey, Bobby. - Hey.

51
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,417
墨菲！天啊 加件浴衣吧
Murph! Jesus, get a robe or something.

52
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,503
那围巾可支撑不了
You're asking too much of that towel.

53
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,923
- 早上好 伙计  - 早上好
- Morning, partner. - Morning.

54
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,841
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

55
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,593
记得周一员工聚会上见
Love to have you at the union meeting Monday.

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,178
不 不！上帝啊 墨菲
No, no! Sweet Jesus, Murphy.

57
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,305
我会射爆那东西
I will shoot that thing.

58
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,556
真令人受不了
That's pretty devastating.

59
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,142
这可能令我对工作留下创伤
It's gonna be a while before I get that image out.

60
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,145
嘿 你那份怎么样了？
Hey, what did you do with yours?

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,024
- 我埋了  - 真的吗？
- I buried it. - Really?

62
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,600
没开玩笑？
I thought you were joking about that.

63
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,152
不会有更糟的主意了
But it's not the worse idea.

64
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,530
它是黄金 你却埋了它 对吧？
It's gold, you bury it. Right?

65
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,742
听着 鲍比
Listen, Bobby.

66
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,536
我要退出
I'm out.

67
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,080
退出？
You're out?

68
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,290
听着
Look.

69
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,875
这对你不会有任何影响
Nothing has to change for you.

70
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,000
做你想做的
You do whatever you want,

71
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,670
对于我 它已结束了
but I'm putting mine in evidence. It's done.

72
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,631
老弟 我说我会处理好
Nicky, I said I would move it for us.

73
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,966
我会搞定一切的
I'll take care of everything.

74
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,301
我不是说这些 鲍比
That's not what I'm talking about, Bobby.

75
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,262
我是说今早她已怀疑我有问题
I'm talking about the way she looked at me this morning,

76
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,346
我早估到
I knew.

77
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,406
听着 我们只是去那里打击毒品的
Look, we went in there to make a drug bust,

78
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,975
仅此而已
which we did.

79
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,102
我们没想到天上竟然掉黄金
We didn't expect this gold to fall into our laps.

80
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,021
我们又不是故意的 但它就这么发生了
We weren't looking for it, but it happened.

81
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,733
我看出来了 你是为了朱莉娅做的
The way I see it, you do it for Julia.

82
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,027
为了你们的未来 这很简单
For your future together. It's simple.

83
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,362
不 她很幸福 我不想拿她的幸福冒险
No, she's happy. I'm not gonna risk that.

84
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,033
对不起 伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

85
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,705
你说得对
You're right.

86
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,208
但我讨厌你说得对
I hate it when you're right.

87
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,045
我们要是上交东西的话
We gotta turn the whole thing in.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,881
买游艇就没希望了
There goes the speedboat.

89
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,174
听着
Look.

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,885
别担心 我不会出卖你的
You don't have to worry, I'm not wagging my finger at you.

91
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,178
你做你想做的
You do whatever you want to do.

92
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,388
不 这仍令我不安
No, it's bothering me, too.

93
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,807
那就让我们一起变成老穷鬼
So, let's grow old and poor together.

94
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,435
听着 发现加尔萨了 还得到个地址
Listen up, we got Garza. We got an address.

95
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,104
等等 发现加尔萨？你真的肯定是他吗？
Wait, you got Garza? You got actual eyes on him?

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,856
有线人供出了他所有的冰毒交易
An informant gave up his whole meth operation.

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,274
他就在那儿 他跑不掉了
He's there, we got him.

98
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,943
好吧 我们开工吧 伙计

再为陈列柜再加些新照片了
Get another picture in the trophy case.

100
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,996
你知道我们等待加尔萨出错等了多久吗？
You know how long we've been waiting for Garza to slip up.

101
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,800
这家伙是个毒贩 警察杀手
This guy's a meth dealer, a cop killer.

102
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:15,957
有30多个手下
He's got 30 guys with him.

103
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,167
抓住他不容易
He's not gonna go easy.

104
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,878
现在 准备好了 听听激动人心的
Now, stand by for inspiring,

105
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,047
来自侦探鲍比・海耶斯的有启发性的训话

106
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,882
我们今天不要吃枪子 如何？
How about we don't get shot today?

107

很好的建议 你是一个好警察
That's great advice. You're a good cop.

圣克里斯多夫手链啊 你个白痴
Saint Christopher medal, jackass.

112
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,228
真可爱
It's adorable.

113
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,604
我依赖它的保护
I wear it for protection.

114
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,023
它的保护？这个才能挡子弹
It's for protection? Well, this stops bullets.

115
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,234
你戴那个是约不到女孩子的
Yours stops you from getting dates.

116
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,547
上吧！

120
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,205

他在楼梯上！

127
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,115
天啊！
Jesus!

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,909
- 这真危险啊  - 你干什么呢？
- That was close. - What the hell are you doing?

129
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,035
你差点打到我了
You almost got me.

130
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,037
但是
But,

131
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,581
我不会让你上交黄金
I can't let you turn that gold in.

132
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,542
什么？
What?

136
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,528
这是正常的 起初是会有点吃惊的
It's normal to be a little tongue-tied at first.

137
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,948
我想让你明白我是来帮你的
I want you to know that I'm here to help you.

138
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,118
我也坐过那把椅子
I've sat in that chair.

139
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,328
所以放松点
So take your time.

140
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,830
慢慢来了解吧
Ease into it.

141
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,040
我要了解什么？
Ease into what?

142
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,545
来吧 天才 我知道你能行
Come on, genius. I know you can get there.

143
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,134
这是一个笑话吗？
This is a joke.

144
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,137
很滑稽
Hilarious.

145
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,098
我死了吗？
I'm dead?

146
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,058
说实话 当一个黑警察
Let's be honest, being a dirty cop

147
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,602
是一个被当面射杀的比例较高的职业
is one of the higher shot-in-the-face-percentage jobs.

148
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,813
我不是黑警察
That's not who I am.

149
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,898
真的吗 帅哥？
Really, pretty boy?

150
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,402
当你朝着审判之路行进时感觉如何？
How did it feel as you were headed towards Judgment?

151
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,528
舒服吗？
Comfortable?

152
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,447
你觉得自己够光荣能上天堂？
Feel like you were bound for glory?

153
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,949
还是有点担心会下地狱？
Or were you a little worried that you were going down?

154
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,494
我是这么认为的
I thought so.

155
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,663
你很幸运 尼克
You're lucky, Nick.

156
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,947
你有我们想要的技能
You have skills that we want.

157
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,751
所以我们给你一个选择
So we're giving you a choice.

158
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,879
你可以选择受审判
You can take your chances with Judgment,

159
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,714
或
or,

160
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,010
你可以加入RIPD
you can join the R.I.P.D.

161
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,430
什么RIPD？
The R.I.P.D?

162
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,307
冥界警察局
Rest In Peace Department.

163
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,976
我懂了 好名字
I get it. It's cute.

164
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,979
简单地说
Simply put,

165
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,317
我们专捉那些设法逃脱审判的死人
we find dead people that have managed to escape Judgment.

166
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,489
送他们回到属于他们的地方

这合约是100年期限

168
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,200
如果你答应了
If you say yes,

169
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,452
我们可以把你送回波士顿 你的老家
we'll send you back down to Boston, your home turf.

170
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,828
我答应
I'll do it.

171
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,207
这行不通的
That's not gonna work.

172
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,708
什么行不通？我说了我加入
What's not gonna work? I said I'm in.

173
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,800
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

174
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,419
你耍赖 你想要回以前的生活

176
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,000
不是 你问我能否加入
No. You asked me to help you,

177
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,800
我说我能加入
and I'm here to help.

178
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,928
你真的以为我看不穿你吗？
You really don't think I can read you?

179
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,559
这里有关于你的一切资料
I know everything there is to know about you.

180
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,521
千万别浪费这个机会 尼克

而且我肯定你会需要一封好的

推荐信去参加审判日的 对吧？
recommendation on Judgment Day, okay?

183
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,362
我觉得我提起了你的兴趣了
I think you're smelling what I'm selling.

184
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,323
还有其他问题吗？
Any more questions?

185
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,577
这是史提利丹乐团的什么歌？

186
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,375
我不知道  总是在唱
No idea. It's always playing.

187
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,002
使人轻松的
It seems to relax people.

188
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,800
- 开始吧  - 很好 开始了

189
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,053
可能会有点痛

肃静！
Settle down!

195
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,644
这儿是扣押室 我们称他们为“腐尸”
This is holding. We call them "Deados."

196

直到消亡前 他们看起来都像人
Until they pop, they look like regular people,

197
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,235
只有我们知道他们实为怪物

198
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,779
你看 如果从这里偷偷溜走了
You see, if you slip through the cracks

199
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,156
死后还留在人间的话
and stay on Earth after you die,

200
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,574
你灵魂会腐烂

被这些死人占领了

用什么办法留下来的？

每天有150000人死亡
A hundred-and-fifty-thousand people die every day.

209
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,968

This system wasn't designed to handle that kind of volume.

210
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,764
欢迎加入大家庭

我告诉你 女孩子喜欢它

死后第一天要学习这些是有点多了
It's a lot to take in on your first day dead.

220
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,633
不过放心 你的搭档会解释一切
But don't worry, your partner will explain it all to you.

221

不！放开你的手！
No! Get your hands off me!

222

别这样 罗伊！
Come on, Roy.

226
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,244
别你个头
You come on.

227
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,663
只因为我是唯一敢开枪见血
Just because I'm the only one willing to lethal-up.

228
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,872

他都走到门口了
He was going for the door.

232
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,759
如果你不满意 那我就光用枪指着他们得了
I'll plant a gun on him if it makes you feel any better.

233
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,762
你想不想把问题闹到“永恒部门”？
Would you like to take this up with Eternal Affairs?

234
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,600
我们都知道事实并非如此 亲爱的？
We both know what this is about, don't we, honey pot?

235
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,935
不是时候 罗伊
Not the time, Roy.

236

你就沉思一分钟吧

你个王八蛋
You piece of shit.

280
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,702
离开这里 放松一下
Get out of here. Just relax.

281
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,374
别忘了吃药啊 伙计
Get back on the meds, buddy.

282
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,043
- 把他弄出去！  - 把他弄出去！
- Get him out of here! - Get him out of here!

283
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,837
让我走！
Let me go!

284
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,304
真好吧
That went well.

285
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,640
看我多为你设想
I tried to do something nice for you.

286
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,100
到底发生了什么事？
What just happened?

287
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,102
为什么她不认识我？
How could she not know it was me?

288
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,500
因为在他们看来 你外表不像你
To them, you don't look like you,

289
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,273
你声音不像你
you don't sound like you.

290
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,200
如果你试着告诉他们真相
If you try to tell 'em who you are,

291
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,734
你的言词会化为胡言乱语
it comes out all garbled up.

292
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,611
宇宙的最高智慧
The universe, in its ultimate wisdom,

293
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,571
不会让你表露身份
will not let you reveal yourself.

294
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,365
他们比我们聪明
It's smarter than us.

295
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,200
太恶了
That's sick.

296
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,121
把它当作是宇宙版的保护证人计划吧
Consider it the universe's witness protection program.

297
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,247
那么 我是什么样子？
So, what do I look like?

298
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,331
给你
Here.

299
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,376
这些是你的身份证
These are your IDs.

300
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,132
几个联邦 很多部门 方便我们行事的
Some federal. A lot of utilities. Whatever gets us access.

301
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,386
不会吧？一个中国老头？
Really? An old Chinese guy?

302
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,930
那么你呢？
What about you?

303
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,769
那你赢了 罗伊
Well, I guess you win, Roy.

304
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,431
我来为你加快进度吧
Let me bring you up to speed with what's on my plate.

305
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,852
你跟我并肩同行 是你最好的选择
When you ride with me, you ride with the best.

306
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,190
步伐要快 期望值要高
The pace is lightning, expectations high.

307
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,734
事情往往来得又快又急 可能又热
Things are gonna come at you fast, they're gonna come hot,

308
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,860
可能又湿
and they're gonna come wet.

309
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,570
湿？
Wet?

310
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,158
怎么开的车 白痴！
Learn to drive, bimbo!

311
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,452
你以前开过车吗？学驾照了么？
You've done this before? Driving?

312
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:56,332
先教你我们这行基本做事方式#
You're gonna get your feet wet with a standard pickup.

313
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,919
发现犯罪嫌疑人 并试探他
Find the suspect and then test him.

314
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,004
看看他是不是个腐尸
See if he's a Deado.

315
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,840
然后…
And then...

316
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,552
瞧那女孩的脚踝
Look at the ankles on that girl.

317
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,945
那就是你喜欢的… 脚踝？
That's what you're into, ankles?

318
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,055
那个能让你兴奋？
That's what does it for you?

319
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,682
我那时代的女人 她们穿得很保守
In my day, women, they dressed very conservatively.

320
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,227
这就少了很多尴尬
That makes you way less creepy.

321
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,939
你那时是什么时候？
When exactly was your day?

322
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,191
18世纪 老兄
1800s, buddy.

323
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,777
我们的工作那时叫“执法官”
I'm what we used to call a "lawman."

324
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,738
马歇尔・罗伊史费斯・普尔斯菲
Marshal Roicephus Pulsipher.

325
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,156
“罗伊史费斯”？
"Roicephus"?

326
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,617
当时被认为是个性感的名字
It was considered a very sexy name at the time.

327
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,411
听起来像是某种性病
It sounds like an STD.

328
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,835
能小心点开车吗？
Would you care to drive?

329
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,462
我没有偷窥你妻子的脚
I didn't get a peek at your wife's ankles.

330
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,423
别再提起她了
Not one more word about her.

331
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,384
听着 菜鸟
Listen, rook.

332
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,500
你最好和她保持一定距离
You better work on getting a little distance,

333
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,139
因为你俩的事已结束了
because you two are over.

334
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,099
还是考虑你自己吧 搭档
You just worry about yourself, partner.

335
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,394
你不是我的搭档 菜鸟
You ain't my partner, rook.

336
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,063
你只是旁边座位上的混球 直到我认可你
You're just the ass in the other seat until I say contrary.

337
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,065
我曾有个搭档
I had a partner.

338
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,401
是我见过最棒的人
Greatest man I ever knew.

339
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,236
直到我背部中了他一枪
Right up until he shot me in the back.

340
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,071
这就是“搭档”会做的事
That's what "partner" will get you.

341
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,865
跟我说说 你觉得我是如何来到这里的？
Tell me about it. How do you think I got here?

342
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,492
你被一颗现代的子弹枪杀
You got shot with a modern bullet.

343
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,495
我喜欢现代的子弹 至少比较卫生
I would've loved a modern bullet. Sanitary, at least.

344
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,665
对啊 我觉得它穿越我脸时的感觉
That's exactly how it felt as it passed through my face.

345
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,791
真卫生啊
Sanitary.

346
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,753
“搭档”两字和我一起死了
The term "partner" died when I did.

347
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,213
明白了 罗伊屎忽屎
You got it, Roicephus.

348
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,340
- 罗伊史费斯  - 罗伊屎忽屎？
- "Roicephus."   - Roicephus.

349
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,592
叫我“罗伊”好了
Just call me "Roy."

350
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,177
我本想如此
I was gonna do that.

351
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,304
或“史费斯”
Or "Cephus."

352
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,306
现在听着
Now, listen up.

353
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,851
这是一个战术 菜鸟
This is tactical, rook.

354
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,520
战术？印度食品？
Tactical? A bag of Indian food?

355
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,858
没错  有线人说这楼里可能有一具腐尸
Yeah. I got a tip on a possible Deado in this building.

356
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,401
现在 边听边学
Now, listen and learn.

357
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,572
腐尸会放出一种坏死巫术
Deados put off a bad dead mojo.

358
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,366
用灵魂阴气感染周围的一切
Infect everything with their soul stank.

359
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,036
令一切都更糟
Infect everything for the worse.

360
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,913
对人和事物都有害
People and things.

361
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,711
注意看 腐尸会损坏东西 这就是痕迹
There you go. Broken shit is a dead giveaway.

362
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,808
灵魂杀手
Soul killers.

363
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,620
开枪射击它们的头部
Hit a Deado in the head with one of these,

364
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,271
必须是头部…
and it's got to be the head...

365
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,774
我个人更喜欢射脸
Personally, I find the face most gratifying.

366
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,859
灵魂就会被消灭
he's erased from the cosmos.

367
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,903
子弹不会伤害活人 却会伤害我们
Won't hurt live ones, will hurt us.

368
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,738
所以小心别走火
So, you be extra careful where you point that thing.

369
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:36,740
枪械安全 我很在行
I'm pretty solid on gun safety.

370
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,810
我看到你脚踝上绑的东西了
I saw that ankle piece you're strapping.

371
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,871
那些人间武器没有作用
Live-world gun don't do diddly-squat here.

372
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,791
把你眼睛远离我的脚踝 谢谢
You can keep your eyes off my ankles, thank you.

373
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,468
让我们来看看是什么事
Watch me sniff this out.

374
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,685
相当明显了
Even more promising.

375
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,917
一向都是最安静的那个
It's always the quiet one.

376
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,169
你准备好了吗？上好了弹？
You ready? You pumped?

377
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,339
我需要你专心抓猎物 抓雪人
I need you all here. Get your snowman on, get frosty.

378
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,842
警戒 冰火
Alert, icy-hot.

379
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,261
你是不是尽力表现得像个警察？
Is this you trying to sound like a cop?

380
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,179
我感觉到你有点在装腔作势#
Because it throws up a lot of red flags for me.

381
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,182
你该学点行话
You gotta learn the lingo, hombrito.

382
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,061
我准备好了 不用担心
I'm frosty. Don't worry about it.

383
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,189
高级警员才能先出手 菜鸟
Senior officer gets to knock, rook.

384
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,941
我之前做了15年的警察
I've got 15 years on the force.

385
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,693
别再叫我“菜鸟”那种废话
Knock off the "rookie" bullshit.

386
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,862
你从警多年？
You've done this before?

387
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,157
知不知道门后在等你的是什么？
You know what's waiting for you behind the door?

388
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,328
你可以把15年警察经验放到马桶冲走
You can take your 15 years, you can flush it down the toilet,

389
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,580
因为现在情况不同
because this ain't that.

390
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,041
我敲门 你展示证件
I knock, you do the cards.

391
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,057
史丹利・纳维奇
Stanley Nawicki.

392
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,267
我们是卫生部门的
We're with the Department of Health.

393
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,062
有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem?

394
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,563
是这样的 纳维奇先生
Well, Mr. Nawicki,

395
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,733
我们怀疑你已死了
we suspect that you might be dead.

396
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,778
这真的有必要吗？
Is this really necessary?

397
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,029
无意冒犯 但这听起来真疯狂
No offense, but you sound kind of crazy.

398
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,238
我们不介意
None taken.

399
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,158
这只是个例行检查 完事后走人
Just a routine test and we'll be out of your hair.

400
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,077
但我没死啊
I am not dead.

401
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,205
我是说 检查我的脉搏 来啊！
I mean, Check my pulse, go ahead!

402
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,998
菜鸟 第一个问题
Rook, first question.

403
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,087
“在一个圣灰星期三晚上”(基督教圣日)
"It's late on Ash Wednesday.

404
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,256
“一位开旧的阿库拉车的亚洲年轻人”
"An Asian teenager in a slammed-out Acura

405
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,385
“请你吃一盘咖哩鸡”
"offers you a plate of chicken vindaloo.

406
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,387
“你会不会接受？”
"Do you accept?"

407
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,432
我应该如何应对？
How am I supposed to answer that?

408
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,017
你告诉我
You tell me.

409
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,524
好吧 答案是不
Okay, the answer is no.

410
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,068
这是什么原因？是不是这个年轻人？
What's the problem? Is it the teenager?

411
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,070
圣灰日？
The ash?

412
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,948
还是日本车？
Is it the Japanese performance sedan?

413
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,659
也许是因为印度菜
Maybe it's the Indian food.

414
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,868
什么？
What?

415
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,995
也许你讨厌印度人
Maybe you hate Injuns.

416
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,081
不 那实在…
No. That's...

417

给我一个理由
Give me a reason.

462
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,377
不需要是个好理由

463
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,379
其实也不需要有什么意义
Actually, doesn't even have to make sense.

464
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,132
很有趣 对吧？
Fun, right?

465
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,842
你或者已经发现我们身体很能受撞击

我认为这在情绪上是可以理解的
I guess that's emotionally understandable.

472
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,710
你真的要检查那些东西吗？

行动后的简报

474

你在房间中表现欠佳
Now, you were below average in the room,

475
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:28,612
但飞行时对我的操纵反应良好
but you did respond well to my steering during the airborne portion.

476
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,823
你的身体令我成功软着陆
Your internal organs provided me a very soft landing.

477
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,910
缓冲效果很令人满意
You have a very impressive crumple zone.

478
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,954
不好的地方就是让你自己
With the exception of letting yourself

479
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,956
直接面对腐尸的攻击…
get attached directly to the beastie...

480
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
闭嘴！
Stop talking.

481

闭嘴

是你一直在说啊
You're the one who's talking.

485
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,383
在我葬礼上你就说个不停
You ran your mouth at my funeral.

486
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,635
你把我推下楼时也说个不停
You ran your mouth when you pushed me out of a building,

487
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,178
还用我的身体当垫子
and used my body as a cushion.

488
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,597
从我俩见面开始就一直废话连篇！
You've run your mouth non-stop since the minute we met!

489
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,057
我想我明白这是怎么回事了
I think I know what's going on here.

490
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,644
不 不 不！ 闭嘴！！闭嘴 让我来处理了
No, no, no! Shut up! You shut up and let me deal.

491
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,981
好 你来处理一地呕吐物
All right, you deal. Deal with the upchuck.

492
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,276
再细想一下 就冲你这个态度
Come to think of it, with all this tantrumery,

493
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,821
我开始觉得也许我有点太慷慨了
I'm beginning to think that I might have been a little too generous

494
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,698
要是给你个C+的话
with the "plus" on that C.

495
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,033
降一点比较好
I might just have to lower your grade.

496
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,619
身体放松啊
Relax body.

497
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,751
我的帽子！
My hat!

498
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,132
我的帽子！
My hat!

499
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,639
新评分 F！（不及格）
New grade. F!

500
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,434
巴士的事 我能原谅你
The bus, I can forgive.

501
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,520
但我的帽子 现在我连提都不想提
My hat? I can't even talk about that now.

502
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,064
去 去 去！时间是关键 走吧
Let's go, go, go! Time is a factor. Let's go.

503
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,483
到底搞什么呢？消防演习？
What the hell is this? A fire drill?

504
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,860
我从来没有见过这样的事
I never seen it this busy.

505
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,446
似乎上周所有腐尸全来波士顿了
Seems like every Deado moved to Boston last week.

506
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,364
我怎么说的？快回到岗位上
What did I say? Get back out there.

507
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,284
不许任何人出去 直到事态被控制住
No breaks for anyone until this surge is under control.

508
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,202
如果不是我需要你在街上的话…
If I didn't need you back on the streets...

509
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,038
如何？你踢我屁股吗？
What? You'd have my ass?

510
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,205
别在陈词滥调了
Don't be a cliche.

511
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,260
你放任他由窗户跳出去了
You let him get out the window.

512
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,124
你是不是做的比这更好？
Aren't you better than that?

513
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,960
是你把训练菜鸟的活儿丢给我的
You're the one who put me with training wheels, here.

514
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,879
继续啊 作秀啊 当老板嘛
But go on, make a show. Be the boss.

515
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,506
你还是和“老板”相处不好 是不是？
You still have a hard time with the "boss" part, don't you?

516
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,467
游戏你玩过了 得到你想要的了
You played the game, got what you wanted.

517
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,594
我不玩游戏
I don't play the game.

518
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,597
我的屁股是我的 只属于我的！
And my ass is mine and mine alone!

519

眼巴巴地看着呢！
Eagerly noted!

520
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,601
拜托 反正你屁股也不正
Come on. It's flat, anyway.

521
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,568
罗伊 纳维奇誓死保护这块金子
Roy, Nawicki was trying awfully hard to protect this gold.

522
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,487
你不觉得我们应该搞清楚是怎么回事吗？
Don't you think we should try to figure out what it is?

523
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,696
相信我 无事可查
Trust me, it's nothing.

524
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,990
这种事百分之九十九是

525
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,409
各种宗教类的筹款物品
fundraising items for various religions.

526
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,827
一堆废物
Just crap.

527
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,371
那百分之一呢？
What about the one percent?

528
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,749
那就是我们把它们锁在这里的原因
That's why we lock them up in here.

529

打个包 标记一下 深藏起来

他试图对我们有所隐藏 为什么？
He was trying to hide it from us. Why?

537
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,415
现在 你倒是相当热心了？
So, now you're all gung-ho, huh?

538
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,669
我觉得应该追查下去
I'm thinking we should follow up.

539
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,255
让我猜猜 天才已有计划了
Let me guess. Genius has a plan.

540
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,799
天才觉得我们应到外面去查一查
Genius wants to get out on the street and work this.

541
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,134
我觉得你可以帮我
I think that you can help me with that.

542
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:37,900
你知道吗？
You know why?

543
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:40,137
因为每个我认识的好警察
Because every great cop that I've ever known

544
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,638
都会有一个线人

545
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,098
大罗伊…
Big Roy...

546
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,892
大罗伊 他会有一个的
Big Roy, he's gotta have one.

547

你想要线人吗？
You want an informant?

548
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,068
大罗伊有最好的线人
Big Roy's got the best informant.

549
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:03,577
现在击球的是红袜队的34号 大卫・奥提兹
Now batting for the Red Sox, number 34, David Ortiz.

550
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,580

Elliot. He's a pain-in-the-ass Deado.

551
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,624
但他只关心红袜队
All he cares about is the Sox.

552
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,295
所以我留他在人间打探消息

553
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,755

554
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,094
人在早上会有个大洞要填
You're in mourning. You got a hole to fill.

555
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,182
我没有感觉到味道啊
You know, I can't taste anything.

556
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,434
当然没有 你死了啊
Of course not, you're dead.

557
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,103
RIPD探员不吃 也不睡
R.I.P.D. don't eat, we don't sleep.

558
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,772
我们的存在只为处理腐尸
You're here to kick Deado ass, that's about it.

559
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,441
那么你为什么吃它？
Then why would you eat this?

560
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,501
我喜欢那口感
I enjoy the mouth feel.

561
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,118
近来怎么样 艾略特？
How's it going, Elliot?

562
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,870
我们领先
We're up.

563
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,623
但比赛打得真烂 我们搞砸了
But they're hitting like crap. We'll blow it.

564
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,708
随你便
Knock yourself out.

565
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,543
你好 艾略特
Hello, Elliot.

566
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,974
你的某个朋友要舍身保护这个东西
One of your buddies was willing to get erased for this.

567
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,340
为什么？
Why?

568
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,634
菜鸟
Rook.

569
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,389
那是物证部门的事
That belongs in evidence.

570
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,569
我以为你具有某种反叛精神的 罗伊
I thought you were some kind of rebel, Roy.

571
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:10,475
我为北方联军打过仗
I fought for the North.

572
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:14,481
你不介意我回去调查吧？
Would you mind terribly if I got back to my investigation?

573
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,358
继续调查吧
Go continue your investigation.

574
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,198
告诉我这是什么 艾略特
Tell me what this is, Elliot.

575
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,533
它看起来像一块巨大的黄金
That looks like a big hunk of gold.

576
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,077
回答不满意 请再试一次
That's not gonna cut it. Try again.

577
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,623
放开你的手！
Get your hands off me!

578
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,917
你好自为之吧 艾略特
You behave yourself now, Elliot.

579
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,900
是因为我 所以你现在才坐得舒服
Because of me, you're sitting there all cozy

580
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,170
而不是躺在棺材里
and not lying in a pine box.

581
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,300
也不是走过沙漠
Not walking the desert,

582
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:41,466
想从一只土狼那里寻回你的骨头
trying to get your femur back from a coyote.

583
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,468
你们这些警察都是一个样子
You cops are all the same.

584
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,637
总是念念不忘如何勒索别人
Always obsessing about how you bit it.

585
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,889
你的葬礼怎么样 菜鸟？
How was your funeral, newbie?

586
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:53,103
你妻子接到美丽的国旗时 你哭了吗？
Did you cry when they gave your wife that nice folded-up flag?

587
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,024
很有趣 对吧？
That's fun, right?

588
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:58,931
你该很清楚
I think we both know

589
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:00,235
那个世界里是没有红袜队的
there's no Red Sox on the other side,

590
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,528
你为什么不合作呢？
so why don't you cooperate?

591
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,490
我为我的态度道歉
I apologize for my poor attitude.

592
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,785
我可以仔细看看吗 先生？
May I take a closer look, sir?

593
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,078
当然
You may.

594
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,462
抱歉让你失望 但这只是件废物
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint, but this is crap.

595
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,508
听着 腐尸也很情绪化的
Look, Deados, they're sentimental.

596
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,636
很多都会相信这种护身符之类的废物
A lot of them believe in this talismanic junk.

597
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,259
如果这有用
If it was something else,

598
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,390
外面必然有人宣扬了
there'd be some chatter out there.

599
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,309
那我就会知道
I would know.

600
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,185
好 我们走吧
All right, we're done here.

601
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,063
这帽子糟透了
These hats are crap.

602
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,982
帮我多留意这件事
Keep your ears open for me.

603
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,525
好的 警官
Yes, sir.

604
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,287
你把黄金给了他？
You gave him the gold?

605
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,165
没看到他很紧张吗？我看穿了他
Did you see him squirm? We got him.

606
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,042
“看穿了”？什么意思 我们有吗？
"Got him"? What do you mean, "we got him"?

607
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,293
哪里得手了？
What did we get?

608
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,337
告诉你他拿了什么 他拿走了黄金！
Tell you what he got, he got the gold!

609
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,130
是你给他的！
Which you gave him!

610
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,090
你这到底是怎么了？
What the hell is the matter with you?

611
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,760
我着急我的帽子
I'm pissed about my hat.

612
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,599
那好吧 快瞧 快瞧
Well, then. Looky, looky.

613
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,853
我要教你什么叫现代执法
I'm gonna treat you to a little modern law enforcement.

614
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,022
这就是所谓的“丢狗骨头”
This is called "giving the dog a bone."

615
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,148
骨头？
Bones?

616
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,077
他这是干嘛？
What's he doing?

617
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,789
好吧 感觉很怪
Okay, that's weird,

618
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,249
因为他看起来很像你的前任搭档
because that looks exactly like your ex-partner.

619
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,793
枪杀你的那个人
The one who shot you dead.

620
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:50,637
好吧 我感兴趣了 很感兴趣
Okay, I'm interested. Color me interested.

621
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,266
我觉得你受刺激了 是吧？
This must be chafing you, huh?

622
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,897
首先 这家伙追踪你就像闻到了一根香肠
First, the guy smoked you like a knockwurst,

623
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,899
然后他找人拿走你的黄金
and now he's got guys just handing him gold.

624
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,192
让我想想 让我想想
Let me think, just let me think.

625
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,825
这有什么好想的？
What's there to think about?

626
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:08,113
这家伙是在训练你往左往右
The man's just schooling you left and right.

627
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,906
你自己的搭档
Your own partner.

628
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,173
一箭三雕
And the trifecta.

629
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,259
与你妻子上床
Sleeping with your wife.

630
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,095
这是你的房子 是不是？
Because this is your house, isn't it?

631
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,390
活活的屈辱啊
Total humiliation.

632
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,518
就像脱了裤子在市场上瞎跑
It's just a pants-down spanking in the supermarket.

633
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,940
他不会和朱莉娅睡的
He's not sleeping with Julia.

634
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,775
想打赌吗？
Want to bet?

635
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,277
好 来吧
Yeah, let's.

636
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,700
赢家可随便打输家的脸
Winner shoots the loser in the face

637
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:49,779
多少次都可以
as many times as he wants.

638
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,199
我不是百分百对我的判断有自信的
I'm not 100 percent confident with my read.

639
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,371
迈克店的卡诺里煎饼
Some cannolis from Mike's.

640
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,208
以前尼克经常让我停下来专门为你买
I was thinking how Nick used to make us stop and get them for you.

641
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,796
谢谢 谢谢你 鲍比
Thank you. Thank you, Bobby.

642
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,551
嘿 朱莉娅 你认为尼克以前还好吗？
Hey, Julia, did Nick seem all right to you?

643
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,930
我意思是 他有担心什么吗？
I mean, was he concerned about anything?

644
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,641
没有
No.

645
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,102
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

646
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,397
为什么呢？
Why?

647
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,400
很抱歉我提起这事
I'm sorry I got to do this now.

648
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,903
尼克说他埋葬了一些东西
Nick said he buried something.

649
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,600
若他不是为了上床
If he's not sleeping with her,

650
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:36,326
来这里就太奇怪了 对不对？
it's kind of funny he's here, isn't it?

651
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,245
或是你们约好晚死者要帮另一人
Unless you guys have a pact where he

652
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:42,164
清理电脑里的色情片
scrubs the porn off your laptop for you.

653
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:43,290
这我理解
I get that.

654
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,543
事实上 太经典了
Classy, actually.

655
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,842
他给了我这个 他知道我想要什么
He gave this to me. He knew I wanted it.

656
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,000
如你所言
What are you saying,

657
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,679
他这样做 是想在底下藏些什么？
that he just did this to hide something under it?

658
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,889
我不知道
I don't know.

659
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,225
但是 我必须看看
But I've got to take a look.

660
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,280
我真希望是我错了
I was hoping I was wrong.

661
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,790
真的？他偷的？
Really? He stole this?

662
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,500
天啊 我觉得恶心
God, I feel sick.

663
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,500
你个王八蛋
You crooked son of a bitch.

664
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:29,879
你要到何时才告诉我呢？
When were you gonna tell me about this?

665
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,257
- 放下枪  - 闭嘴
- Put the gun down. - Shut up.

666
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,425
把它们带走吧 我不想见到它们
Just get it away from me. I don't want to see it.

667
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,636
别担心 什么都不需要担心
Don't worry. Don't worry about a thing.

668
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,138
他是我最好的朋友
He was my best friend.

669
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,976
我甚至不知道他是谁
I don't even know who he was.

670
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,734
放开我 否则我打断你的腿
Get off of me or I'll break your legs.

671
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,111
现在给我个解释！
Explanation, now!

672
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,741
我们从一群小混混手中得到那些黄金
We took something from a bunch of shit-rats

673
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,035
他们原是想利用它换枪支和毒品什么的
who would have turned it into guns or drugs or who knows what.

674
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,246
这是没有受害者的犯罪 就这样而已
It was a victimless crime. End of story.

675
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,789
那腐尸拿它干嘛？
Why would the Deados want it?

676
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,959
你以为海耶斯和我知道那腐尸要干什么吗？
You think Hayes and I knew about this Deado shit?

677
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,000
对我来说那只是金钱
It was just money to me.

678
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:10,545
我只是想让日子过得更好点
I was trying to make our life better.

679
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,840
你的工作是干得不错 对吧？
Well, you did a good job of that, didn't you?

680
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:16,367
你为什么不再试试中国佬那一招呢？
Why don't you go try the Chinaman thing again?

681
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:19,094
跟她解释一下 绝对实用啊
Explain it to her. That went well.

682
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,849
再来啊 如果能让你…
Try it again if it makes you...

683
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,352
黄金要逃了
Gold's getting away.

684
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,436
来吧 别紧张
Come on, tighten up.

685
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,813
我妻子认为我是个混蛋
My wife sees me as a piece of shit.

686
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,983
事实上 她把你当成个中国佬
Actually, she sees you as an old Chinese guy.

687
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,986
不过 陈大爷外表忠厚老实
And by the way, Grandpa Chen's a pretty solid look.

688
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,488
对监视有帮助
Helps with stakeouts.

689
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,661
我只在乎她怎么看我
The only thing that I ever cared about is what she thought of me.

690
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,811
这是唯一重要的事
That's all that matters. The only thing.

691
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:30,332
她对我的印象和看法
What she thinks, that's who I am.

692
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,918
而我搞砸了 毁掉了一切
And I blew that. Destroyed it.

693
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,504
呜呼
Boo-hoo.

694
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,672
说什么？
Excuse me?

695
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,340
你听到的 哭泣吧
You heard me. Boo-de-hoo.

696
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,722
你是我见过的最糟糕的人
You might be the worst person I've ever met.

697
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,800
不幸的是 你不能告诉她
Sadly, you do not get to tell her

698
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:48,184
你的所作所为全是为了她
how you did it all for her.

699
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,145
你觉得这是天大的悲剧
And where exactly do you think your tragedy ranks

700
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,356
那宇宙正义在哪里？
on the scales of cosmic injustice?

701
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,316
那巴基斯坦地震又如何？
Pakistan-earthquake level?

702
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,777
- 那杀人战场又如何？  - 这对我个人是很重要的
- Killing Fields level? - For me, it was pretty big.

703
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,364
你以为你是唯一一个发生这种情况的人？
You think you're the only one who was cut down in his prime?

704
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,491
你以为我没有感觉了
You don't think I felt unresolved

705
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,743
当我的脸被一只秃鹫吞噬吗？
as my face was being devoured by a buzzard?

706
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,078
神啊
Christ.

707
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,081
你必须学会承受痛苦和悔恨
You are just gonna have to learn to sit on your regret and pain

708
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,959
直到转化为一种单调的持续的疼痛为止
until it turns into a dull, persistent ache.

709
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,878
我是那样做的 这才是男人的做法
The way I do it. The way a man does it.

710
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,764
我是拍音乐录影带的
I do music videos.

711
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,892
私人电话号码在背面
Home phone number's on the back.

712
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,477
什么？
Excuse me?

713
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,300
我来地球上不是作为一块肉
I'm not a piece of meat put on this earth

714
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:36,357
去让您满足的
for your gratification.

715
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,442
我是个女人
I'm a woman.

716
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,200
放尊重些 不然我就阉了你
Respect me, or I will castrate you

717
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:41,154
把你变回3岁小孩
like a three-year-old steer.

718
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,577
看起来很好 我们有收获了
Look sharp. We got something.

719
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,051
是的 这是一具腐尸
Yeah, that's a Deado.

720
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,179
这人应该是海耶斯的销赃犯
That has got to be Hayes' fence.

721
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,989
- 我们跟着黄金走  - 我明白了
- We stay on the gold. - I got this.

722
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,116
等下 让你老爹我先去
Hold up. Daddy's on point.

723
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,284
不 谢了 我看过你怎么行动了
No thanks, I've seen you in action.

724
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,744
你在质疑我的方法吗？
You questioning my methods?

725
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,370
你根本没有方法
You don't have a method.

726
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,424
打扰了 先生 就说几句话
Excuse me, sir. A quick word?

727
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,053
去冷冻室
Freezer.

728
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:49,825
小茴香种子

729
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,265
让我来开门
Allow me.

730
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,393
我的错
My bad.

731
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,441
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

732
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,401
RIPD 对不对？
R.I.P.D. , huh?

733
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,739
外观不错啊！
Great looks, man!

734
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,242
你和你的熊猫快餐都在这儿
You, with your Panda Express over there.

735
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,244
别说种族笑话
Easy with the racial.

736
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,745
你 和你的…
And you, with your...

737
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,955
小心点！
Watch it!

738
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,040
难以置信的豪乳
magnificent breasts.

739
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,086
嘿 络腮胡 告诉我们有关黄金的事
Hey, sideburns, tell us about the gold.

740
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,840
瞧啊 在这里大家都是朋友
Look, we're all friends here.

741
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,926
来个互相帮助
Let's help each other out.

742
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,100
你不想现形
You don't want to get popped,

743
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,304
我也不想强迫你现形
and I don't want to pop you.

744
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,139
- 你不想？  - 不想
- You don't?    - No.

745
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,542
所以你只要把箱子给我们
So you're just gonna give us that case,

746
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:34,433
之后谈一谈
you're gonna start talking,

747
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,060
然后你可以继续四处逛逛
and then you get to keep roaming around

748
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,770
还保留着你的骚胡须
with your bitchin' ginger sideburns.

749
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,402
你知道吗？
You know what?

750
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,656
我厌倦了躲藏
I'm sick of hiding.

751
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,709
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

752
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,298
那再好不过了！
That's better!

753
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,596
好吧 我们来吧！
Hell, yeah. Let's do this!

754
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,435
控制住！
Contain!

755
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,563
控制住！
Contain!

756
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,358
控制不住！
Didn't contain!

757
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,869
去你的
Suck it.

758
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,710
正中屁股！
Straight butt!

759
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,004
看吧！
Come on!

760
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,548
马术表演时刻
It's rodeo time.

761
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,342
老爹要玩绳子了！
Pappy's got some roping to do!

762
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,181
帮个小忙怎么样？
How about a little help?

763
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,368
好吧
Okay.

764
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,453
你没事吧？找人拨打911！
Are you okay? Somebody call 911!

765
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,622
我没事 没有什么可看的
I'm okay. Nothing to see.

766
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,165
我得走了！
Got to go!

767
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,474
头部！目标是射头部！
The head! Aim for the head!

768
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,611
还在这里 狗娘养的！
Still here, you son of a bitch!

769
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,830
我的屁股啊！
My ass!

770
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,873
这是什么？
What is that?

771
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,637
借过！
Coming through!

772
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,099
对不起 原谅我
Excuse me, pardon me.

773
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,794
我来了！
Here I come!

774
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,676
放松身体
Relax body.

775
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,557
菜鸟！
Rook!

776
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,435
在这里！
Over here!

777
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,854
他弄出太多麻烦了
If it's not too much trouble.

778
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,365
非常感谢你
Thank you very much.

779
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,953
我从来没见过像这样的事
I've never seen one like that before.

780
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,037
从来没有！
Never!

781
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,831
这从来没有发生过！
Never before has this happened!

782
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,792
恭喜 伙计们 弄出这一堆烂摊子！
Congratulations, guys, on your unprecedented cock-up!

783
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,835
好吧！
All right!

784
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,695
你让一只现形的腐尸
You let an exposed Deado loose

785
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:14,171
光天化日出现在街上
on the streets in the middle of the day.

786
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,300
本来可以控制的
You were supposed to contain.

787
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,465
这是最基本的任务
That is your most basic job.

788
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,578
那东西失控了
There was no containing that thing.

789
00:52:17,578 --> 00:52:18,676
但你们却大大地失败了
And you failed spectacularly to contain.

790
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,636
他说得对 小甜心 这一次是不同的
He's right, sweetie pie. It was different.

791
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,804
我们有证据
We have evidence.

792
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,000
没有调查任务
You don't investigate,

793
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:24,100
不需要这么有创意
you don't get creative.

794
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,224
只需按章做事
You do as you're told.

795
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,809
否则 就会发生这种情况
When you don't, this happens.

796
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,893
令人恐惧
It was terrifying.

797
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,666
暴走在波士顿街上的不是人类
Whatever rampaged through the streets of Boston today was not human.

798
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,702
现在看看我们在哪里
Now look where we are.

799
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:35,317
你需要与他们打交道
You get to deal with them.

800
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,653
说了半天 到底谁是“他们”？
Who in this endless stream of freaks is "them"?

801
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,947
永恒部门 锤子从天而落
Eternal Affairs. The hammer's dropping.

802
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,180
怎么样？
Well?

803
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,016
他们很生气 理所当然的
They're pissed. Justifiably.

804
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,109
但是 明显地
However, apparently,

805
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,935
看来你们的确撞上一些重要的事情
you stumbled upon something important.

806
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,563
别那么惊讶 亲爱的
Don't act so surprised, honey pot.

807
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,692
普尔斯菲和沃克警官带来的那块黄金
The gold that officers Pulsipher and Walker brought in

808
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,028
是极其危险的神器的一部分
are part of an incredibly dangerous artifact

809
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:22,280
称为“杰里科权杖”
known as the Staff of Jericho.

810
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,994
废话
Crap.

811
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,417
能为菜鸟讲解下是怎么回事吗？
Maybe feather it in for the new guy a little bit?

812
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:37,463
你还记得你死时经过的隧道吗？
Remember the tunnel we pulled you out of when you died?

813
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,899
这是获得来世的唯一方式
That's the only way to get to the afterlife.

814
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:41,050
它是一条单行道
It's a one-way street.

815
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,553
此神器如果建成了 能倒转隧道
This artifact, if built, reverses the tunnel.

816
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,305
让腐尸如下雨一样闯进人间
The dead rain down on the earth.

817
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,057
结束人类世界
That's it for the living world.

818
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,558
大规模破坏
Yeah, massive destruction.

819
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,921
我们在3000年前撞到过这件事
We broke it to pieces 3,000 years ago.

820
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:52,978
现在它回来了
Now it's back.

821
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,276
直到我们得到剩下的黄金为止
Until we get the rest of the gold,

822
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,856
我们处于红色警戒
we're on red alert.

823
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,734
而且很显然 需要“你敌人的血”
Also, apparently, you need "the blood of thine enemy."

824
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,152
还有一大堆图画
There are more diagrams.

825
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,320
什么？
Why?

826
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,448
为什么会有人做这样的东西？
Why would someone make something like that?

827
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,824
真是的！
Come on!

828
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:09,995
我在这里 希望能维护秩序
Here I am, willing the streets into order,

829
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,165
我努力工作一年又一年！
making headway, year after dominant year!

830
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,251
而现在我所做的一切处于威胁之中
And now, everything I've done is being threatened

831
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,087
就因为古代五千年前某傻瓜做的器物
because of some ancient totem forged for kicks

832
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,673
而前功尽弃吗？
by some asshole 5,000 years ago?

833
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:25,010
我为什么要再试？我的意思是我怎么做？
Why even try? I mean, how am I supposed to do it?

834
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,764
看看你 真为你骄傲
Look at you. So proud of yourself.

835
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,184
“我只得到另一个大桶子而已”
"I got an important tube."

836
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,357
什么？
What?

837
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,901
这是什么？
Well, what is it?

838
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,448
其实
Actually,

839
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,742
看来你们两个似乎可以
it looks like you two don't need to

840
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,036
不用担心红色警报了
concern yourselves with the red alert.

841
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,038
我很不高兴
It brings me no pleasure

842
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,834
通知你们 因为近期你们那史诗式的失败
to inform you that because of your recent epic failure,

843
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,877
你俩被停职 不能处理这案件了
you've both been suspended, you're off the case.

844
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,381
等一会 这是我们的案子
Hold on a sec, we are the case.

845
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,174
是我们把案件带给你的！
We're the ones who brought it in!

846
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,968
感觉就像是碰运气了
The feeling is that luck was involved.

847
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,594
明天将有个正式的听证会
There'll be a formal hearing tomorrow,

848
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,346
之后你们很可能会被删除
after which you'll most likely be erased.

849
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,639
“删除？”
"Erased"?

850
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,894
所以在这个危机时刻 我们要被停职
So in this moment of crisis, they're gonna suspend

851
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,647
然后再删除最优秀的警员？
and then erase their best officer?

852
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,774
还有这个家伙？
And this other guy?

853
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,776
还有更好的警官会来接手
Better officers are taking over.

854
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,361
没有的事 报个名吧
No such thing. Name one.

855
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,946
雅各森 杜博
Jacobson, DuBow.

856
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,156
- 沃特森 - 真可笑
- Waterson. - Come on.

857
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,198
卡森
Carson.

858
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,742
- 杰克逊  - 他算不错
- Jackson. - He's pretty good.

859
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,618
那在塔科工作的人
That guy who works at the taco cart.

860
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,203
- 要继续吗？  - 好吧 好吧！
- Shall I go on? - Okay, okay!

861
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,122
明天是我的最后一天？
Tomorrow is my last day?

862
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,082
很有可能
Most likely.

863
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,584
对不起
I'm sorry.

864
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,420
该死
Well, shit.

865
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,505
监察员女士 谢谢
Miss Proctor, it's been a delight.

866
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,688
罗伊 非常感谢你的指导
Roy, thank you very much for your mentorship.

867
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:46,967
我确信这对你也意义重大
I'm sure it meant a lot to you.

868
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,845
我需要去个更重要的地方
I got somewhere more important to be.

869
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,507
你是谁？
Who are you?

870
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,889
你为什么要跟着我？
Why are you following me?

871
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,102
不要靠近我
Stay away from me.

872
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,446
我一直没有离开过
I haven't left you.

873
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,412
是我
It's me.

874
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,336
不
No.

875
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,679
所以
So.

876
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,101
表示祝贺 你最终做到了
Congratulations. You finally did it.

877
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,227
你得到你想要的了？
You get what you wanted?

878
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,700
我或许明天被删除
I might get erased tomorrow.

879
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,022
你以为我会怎么做？
What do you think I'm gonna do?

880
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,359
你吓着她了 要是你没注意到的话
You're freaking her out, if you haven't noticed.

881
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,155
我不是来自于什么敏感与浪漫主义时代的人
I'm not from a time of sensitivities and emotionalism.

882
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,783
在我的时代 我花钱买我的钟点爱情
And yes, in my day, I bought my love by the hour.

883
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,536
但我知道 你做什么都不起作用的
But I do know that what you're doing is not helping.

884
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,874
这叫鬼痴迷 会造成她的痛苦
It's called haunting, hoss. You're causing her pain.

885
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,960
你觉得为什么我们在这里？
Why do you think we're here?

886
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,296
我们所做的是什么？
Why we do what we do?

887
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,090
就是令朱莉娅有个能够生存的世界
It's so that Julia can have a world to live in.

888
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,634
是啊 这代表没有你在
And, yeah, that means without you.

889
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,916
她需要忘掉你
She needs to survive you.

890
00:57:55,591 --> 00:57:57,848
结交新友 重组新家庭
Meet someone new, maybe have a family.

891
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,059
因为你回不去了
Because you are not coming back.

892
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,145
永远
Ever.

893
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,022
你有的只是工作
The job is all you have now.

894
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,733
我们连工作都失去了
Well, we don't have the job anymore.

895
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,319
尼克
Nick.

896
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,571
放下你的情感 像我一样
Resolve your crap. Do like me.

897
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,489
像你？
Like you?

898
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,365
是的 效仿我的平静
Yes, emulate my peace.

899
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,576
这像佛法一样的心境？
Your Zen-like calm?

900
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,496
我花了很多时间才做到当前的这状态
It's taken me a very long time to achieve this state.

901
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,831
你也能做到 但你太弱了
You could get there, too, but for your weakness.

902
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,166
你知道吗？我受够了
You know what? I've had it.

903
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,753
我再也受不了听你嘴里蹦出自以为是的老掉牙的故事了
I can't listen to one more self-righteous chestnut out of your mouth.

904
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,507
我不想每天都听你那很奇怪的过去
I don't want to live in your weird past with you.

905
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,009
说起这个 那些土狼…
Speaking of which, those coyotes...

906
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,260
你小心点说话
You be careful now.

907
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,013
那些土狼啃你的骨头而且在你脸上拉屎？
Those coyotes who ate your bones and crapped out your face?

908
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,350
在这个故事中 土狼才是英雄
In that story, the coyotes are the heroes.

909
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,728
你也许认为旧西部全是狗屁
You may think the Old West was all shits and giggles,

910
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,064
全是荒草和便宜的妓女
and sarsaparilla and two-cent whores.

911
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,315
它就是！
It wasn't!

912
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,692
它是臭的 是暴力的
It was smelly, it was violent.

913
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,529
满地都是痢疾和不可靠的印弟安人
It was ridden with dysentery and no-account Injuns.

914
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,574
我曾经都充满怒气 明白吗？
I've had a lot of anger to get past, okay?

915
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:58,284
而你…
And you...

916
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:02,037
你呢 尼克 说这么多的废话
You, Nick, are bringing a lot of shit out

917
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,832
而我却压抑了很长时间！
that I've been suppressing for a very long time!

918
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,757
其中一只土狼
One of them coyotes,

919
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,093
用我的骷髅交配
he made love to my skull.

920
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:20,264
你知不知道那种行为通常叫做什么吗？
Do you know what that practice is commonly called?

921
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,474
我知道
I do.

922
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,061
我希望它能干你的双眼 罗伊
And I certainly hope he got both eyes, Roy.

923
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:38,156
# 言语 就像匕首刺伤我们的心 #
# Words, like daggers stab our heart #

924
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,617
# 孩子 #
# Boys #

925
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,497
# 得做个好男人 #
# Gotta be the better man #

926
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,040
这首歌被称为“好男人”
The song is called Better Man.

927
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,709
是的 我知道
Yeah, I got that.

928
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:53,005
# 有人可能伤了你的心 #
# PeopIe, they can break your heart #

929
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,465
# 孩子 #
# Boys #

930
00:59:56,467 --> 01:00:00,220
# 就像从来没有小狼可以… #
# Like no coyote ever can... #

931
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,473
也许我有点太过分了
Maybe I took things a little too far.

932
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,185
“也许”？
"Maybe"?

933
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,522
对不起
I'm sorry.

934
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,361
你应该拿起一个乐器 尼克
You ought to take up an instrument, Nick.

935
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,905
也许你可以柔和悦耳地
It might be a tuneful way for you

936
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,116
渡过你的最后一刻
to spend what may be your last moments.

937
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,831
你对待工作是正确的 罗伊
You were right about the job, Roy.

938
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,500
我们应该回去了
We gotta get back out there.

939
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,378
不-可-能
"Sus-pen-dato."

940
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,881
如果想要我回去 他们应该要来求我
If they want me back, they're gonna have to beg.

941
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,175
我不要留下来等死 你呢？
I'm not gonna take this lying down. You?

942
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,886
要在这里消沉下去吗？
Are you gonna sit there and mope?

943
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,097
或者你想不想帮我停止这浩劫？
Or do you want to help me stop an apocalypse?

944
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,309
你居然把它说成这样
When you put it that way, hell,

945
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,561
你是要把我挤进死角
you kind of paint me into a corner.

946
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,396
我知道海耶斯坐拥一堆黄金
I know Hayes is sitting on some of that gold.

947
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,523
他不可能只是个交易者
There's no way he's just a bagman.

948
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,859
让我问你一件事
Let me ask you something.

949
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,111
他喜欢印度食物吗？
Did he like Indian food?

950
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,113
他不喜欢
He was not a fan.

951
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,657
但是我有点困惑
But something's bugging me.

952
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,300
我和这个家伙搭档都五年了
I rode with this guy for five years,

953
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:07,245
我没有发现任何“阴气重”的情况
I never noticed any kind of "soul stank."

954
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,750
我听说某种稀有护身符能掩盖阴气
I heard talk of a rare kind of artifact that could mask it.

955
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:14,419
像除臭剂 灵魂香水
Like a spiritual deodorant.

956
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,422
定是他随身佩戴的东西
It would be something he carried with him all the time.

957
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,425
祖母的圣克里斯多夫项链
Like Grandma's Saint Christopher medal.

958
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,802
就是那个了
That'd do her.

959
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,766
让我们令那混蛋现形吧
Let's go pop the son of a bitch.

960
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,788
你知道要做什么？
Do you know what to do?

961
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,624
是的 我等了很长一段时间了
Yeah. I've been waiting a long time for this.

962
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,543
你等了很长时间吗？
You've been waiting a long time?

963
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,087
你知道腐尸花了多少年要做成这件事吗？
Do you know how many years Deados have been trying to pull this off?

964
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,380
3000年
Three thousand.

965
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,134
这些废物没有一个能收集起所有的黄金
Not one of those jag-offs could get all that gold together,

966
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,760
直到我出现
until me.

967
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,806
RIPD根本不知道是什么重击了他们
R.I.P.D. is not gonna know what hit them.

968
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,684
现在你亲自去惹点麻烦
Now, go find yourself some trouble.

969
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,519
非常乐意
My pleasure.

970
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:25,991
你好 朱莉娅
Hey, Julia.

971
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,868
我想和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

972
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,870
我碰到了很奇怪的事情
Something really strange happened to me.

973
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,080
怎么回事呢？
What's going on?

974
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,665
我昨晚在跑道上
I was at the track last night,

975
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,917
你还记得葬礼上的那个家伙吗？
and do you remember that guy at the funeral?

976
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,252
小个子的中国佬？
The little Chinese guy?

977
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,920
大叫大闹的那个？
The one who was yelling?

978
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,714
慢慢说 慢慢说 深吸一口气
Slow down, slow down. Take a deep breath.

979
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,382
我不知道 我觉得
I don't know. Somehow, I feel like

980
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,430
那像是尼克试图跟我说话的感觉
it's Nick who's trying to talk to me.

981
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,305
好吧
Okay.

982
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,724
我知道这听起来很疯狂
I know it sounds crazy.

983
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,018
我知道你想念他 我也想念他
I know you miss him. I miss him, too.

984
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,104
我认为现在你不该独自去面对
I don't think you should be alone right now.

985
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,356
我去接你 一起吃个午饭
I'm gonna come pick you up, and I'm gonna take you to lunch

986
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,901
我们可以好好谈谈
and we could talk about everything.

987
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,652
好吗？
All right?

988
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,531
好吧
Okay.

989
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,950
好的 谢谢你帮助我
All right. Thank you for this.

990
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,745
应该的  回头见
Absolutely. I'll see you later.

991
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,431
你负责前面 我绕到后面
Take the front. I'll go around back.

992
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,058
看我的
Works for me.

993
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,700
鲍比・海耶斯？
Bobby Hayes?

994
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,619
什么事？
Yeah?

995
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,746
我要问你一些问题
I need to ask you a few questions

996
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,998
关于印度式粘土烤箱的问题
involving a tandoori clay oven.

997
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,626
宝贝 你可以问任何你想要的事情
Sweetheart, you can ask me anything you want.

998
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,096
请不要拘束
Make yourself comfortable.

999
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,770
喝一杯怎么样？
How about a little drinky-poo?

1000
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,940
好的 让我润润嘴
Sure. I'll wet my beak.

1001
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,441
马上就来
Coming right up.

1002
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,244
你在找这个吗？
Are you looking for this?

1003
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,454
身手不错啊
Nice moves,

1004
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,581
尼克
Nick.

1005
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,293
这外表不佳啊
Hey, tough look to pull off.

1006
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,379
我已习惯了
I'm getting used to it.

1007
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,047
你知道那只是个交易而已
You know, it was just business.

1008
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,424
试试再动一下
Make a move, please.

1009
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,508
放松点 尼克
Easy, Nick.

1010
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,554
“在圣灰星期三”
"It's late on Ash Wednesday."

1011
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,556
我们能跳过那一步 罗伊
We can skip that part, Roy.

1012
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,642
摘掉圣克里斯托弗项链
Take off the Saint Christopher's medal.

1013
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,394
快
Now.

1014
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,479
好吧
Okay.

1015
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,513
很强大的阴气
Powerful stank.

1016
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,350
黄金何在 死鬼？
Where's the gold, dead man?

1017
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:39,684
检查这里的热水器
Check the water heater.

1018
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,853
这里有超级警察在
Freaking super cop, here.

1019
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,111
好吧 上马鞍
All right, saddle up.

1020
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,699
我们要带你回去
We're gonna ride you in.

1021
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,285
我知道这是错的
I know it's wrong,

1022
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,300
可整个一个牛仔的说话方式
but the whole cowboy-talk thing,

1023
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:01,122
这有点吸引我了
it's kind of working for me.

1024
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,421
为什么你笑成那么样？
What do you got to smile about?

1025
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,105
你喜欢和这个家伙共事吗？
Hey, how do you like working with this guy?

1026
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,731
他是有点紧张 对不对？
He hangs on a little tight to stuff, huh?

1027
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,484
我们在一起做什么与你无关
What we got together is none of your damn business.

1028
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,152
剩余黄金在哪 海耶斯？
Where's the rest of the gold, Hayes?

1029
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:33,613
明白我的意思了吗？他不会死心的
See what I mean? He won't let it die.

1030
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,117
嘿 尼克 记得我中弹那事吗？
Hey, Nick, remember when I got shot?

1031
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,494
我得奖了 而你不相信我会挺过去吗？
I got that medal, and you couldn't believe I pulled through?

1032
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,204
瞎猜的 你没有挺过去吗？
Wild guess, you didn't pull through?

1033
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,081
被一名吸毒者杀死 去了地狱
Get killed by some junkie and go to hell

1034
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,000
就因为我贪污小钱为了看脱衣舞娘跳舞吗？
because I took a little on the side to pay for lap dances?

1035
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,835
不 我认为不会
No. I don't think so.

1036
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,671
谁去决定我命运？我接受不了
Who gets to make that call? I don't accept it.

1037
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,839
嘿 让我问你
Hey, let me ask you something.

1038
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,174
你认为永恒的惩罚是什么 海耶斯？
What do you think eternal punishment is gonna be like, Hayes?

1039
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,302
可以亲我的屁股
Hell can kiss my ass.

1040
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,721
我会留在这里
I'm staying right here.

1041
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,724
“脱衣舞”
"Lap dancing."

1042
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,969
看起来很漂亮
That's a nice look you got.

1043
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:05,687
真漂亮 那脸蛋还有头发
That's nice, with the face and the hair.

1044
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,147
来吧 坐下
All right, sit down.

1045
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,697
你也许想要登记一下黄金
You might want to book that gold

1046
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,615
在你的搭档出手之前
before your partner gets his hands on it.

1047
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,783
这是什么？
What's this?

1048
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,201
私人物品
That's personal.

1049
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,870
那这个也得登记
Then it gets booked,

1050
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:25,540
还有我带来的那堆黄金
along with this gold that I brought in.

1051
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,300
听好了 娃娃脸
That's right, doll face.

1052
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,962
别管我那胆小鬼似的停职令
Despite my chicken-shit suspension.

1053
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,200
我或者可以提供提示
I'm available for a tutorial-type thing,

1054
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:35,884
如果你或你们想要一些建议
if you or the guys want a few tips.

1055
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,720
也许把你们提高到接近我的水准
Maybe get yourselves up near my level.

1056
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,472
为什么我要爱你呢？
Why did I have to love you?

1057
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,057
我们曾有过美丽的时刻
We had a beautiful moment in time.

1058
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,641
一个灾难性的错误
Catastrophic mistake.

1059
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,478
说清楚啊 可你感受到你要的东西
Run it down, but you felt what you felt.

1060
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,271
坐下来
Take a seat.

1061
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:49,814
好的 这可以让我
This is good, it's gonna help me

1062
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,441
摆脱朝脸开枪的事
get over the shot-in-the-face thing.

1063
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,015
无论在另一边等你的是什么
Whatever is waiting for you on the other side

1064
01:07:57,015 --> 01:07:59,324
那都是不“好”的
is gonna be bad.

1065
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,909
不要担心 只是永远而已
Don't worry, it's only forever.

1066
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,584
把这块黄金跟其余部分储藏起来
Stash this gold with the rest of it.

1067
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,960
还有这个
And here.

1068
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:14,089
嘿 我们刚刚登记了跟这一样的东西
Hey, we just booked something just like this.

1069
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,007
是的 在那里的篮子里
It's in the basket over there.

1070
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,763
你必须填写另外一份表格
You're gonna need to fill out another form.

1071
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,600
非常乐意 我也没有其他好事可做
I'd love to. I've got nothing else better to do.

1072
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,817
做腐尸还是有一件体面的事情 对吧？
There's one decent thing about being a Deado, right?

1073
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,654
我们无法确切听到某些频率
We can't hear certain frequencies so well.

1074
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:43,868
罗伊！
Roy!

1075
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,096
来吧 尼克
Come on, Nicky.

1076
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,722
你以为我会让你带我来这里吗
You thought I'd let you bring me here

1077
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,474
要是我始终不想来这里的话？
if I didn't want to be here all along?

1078
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,892
是不是很酷呢？
Isn't this thing sweet?

1079
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,311
把你们都定住了 却对我们没影响
It freezes you guys up, does nothing to us.

1080
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,480
他们得到了神器的所有一切
They got one of these artifacts for everything.

1081
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,736
上 上 上！来吧！
Go, go, go! Come on!

1082
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,781
拿走金子 带上所有东西！
Get the gold. Take everything!

1083
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,493
全都在这儿吗？
It's all there?

1084
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,037
接住！
Catch!

1085
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,081
用所有手臂接住 来吧！
Fill up all these hands. Come on!

1086
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,377
走了！走了！
Let's go! Let's go!

1087
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,515
怎么了？
What's up?

1088
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,602
安静
Peace.

1089
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,111
冲洗
Flush it.

1090
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,740
不！黄金！
No! The gold!

1091
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,121
找你的 老板
Here, boss.

1092
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,497
我都拿到了
I got it all.

1093
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,166
我来了
I'm on it.

1094
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,668
爸爸有黄金了！
Daddy's got gold!

1095
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,254
动手兴建吧 孩子们！
Let's build it, boys!

1096
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,270
该死的！卡住了
Damn it! It's jammed up.

1097
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,364
这里就像是古代西部城市的主要街道
Just like Main Street, Dodge City.

1098
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,574
这帮家伙
Them dudes,

1099
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,827
他们选错了站立的地方
they picked the wrong venue to make a stand.

1100
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,166
这东西就是我发明的
I invented this shit.

1101
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,132
烫！
Hot!

1102
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,479
修好了！真好！
I fixed it! Yeah!

1103
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,405
上吧！
Go time!

1104
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,331
教你一些古代西部射击的东西
Let's learn you a few things about Old West fighting.

1105
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,665
第一
First,

1106
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,085
只有菜鸟才藏在教堂塔尖上
only a novice hides in a church steeple.

1107
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,338
这是我看的第一个地方
It's the first place I'm gonna look.

1108
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,673
第二个地方 酒店的窗户 次次都中
Second place, hotel window, every time.

1109
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,763
我估计在他的团队中只有一个菜鸟
I guess there's only one novice in their crew.

1110
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,976
有时窗口的家伙是在屋顶上
Sometimes, the window guy is on the roof.

1111
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,789
我从未看过这样的
I haven't seen that before.

1112
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,917
这是监察员所说的大规模破坏
Must be the massive destruction Proctor was talking about.

1113
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,835
上马鞍！
Saddle up!

1114
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:06,964
嗨 朱莉娅
Hey, Julia.

1115
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,050
海耶斯叫我们来接你
Hayes sent us to give you a lift.

1116
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,969
大家好 我可以开车啊
Guys, I can still drive.

1117
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,429
外面很乱
It's pretty hairy out there.

1118
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,723
他只是担心你而已
He's just worried about you.

1119
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,902
封锁这里
Close it up.

1120
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,904
好的 封锁这里
All right. Lock it up.

1121
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,532
没人可以通过联合大厦
Nobody gets through to the Commonwealth building.

1122
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,075
没有！
Nobody!

1123
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,097
看起来这个大家伙是在联合大厦附近
Looks like the big one is right over the Commonwealth building.

1124
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,265
我们要去那里
That's where he'll be headed.

1125
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,724
是的 我同意
Yeah. Good read.

1126
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,394
你会同意我的看法？很奇怪啊
You're agreeing with me? That's weird.

1127
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,688
是的 有点奇怪
Yeah. Feels strange.

1128
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:06,691
还有点激动
Kind of tingly.

1129
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,243
开车的腐尸
Deados on wheels.

1130
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:18,453
令人失望
That's disappointing.

1131
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,288
我还希望可以休息一阵
I was hoping to get a little break here.

1132
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,728
让它走开 尼克！
Make it go away, Nick!

1133
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,411
我明白
I got it.

1134
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,668
我的天啊！
Holy shit!

1135
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,154
刚才真的把我吓坏了
That actually scared the shit out of me.

1136
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,364
黄金拿到顶上去
Get the gold up top.

1137
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,908
我留下等最后那块
I gotta wait for the final piece.

1138
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:52,547
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1139
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,631
这到底是怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

1140
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,883
发生了很多情况 很高兴你能在这里
Lots going on. I'm glad you're here with me.

1141
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,176
我们需要进去
We need to get inside.

1142
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,220
听着 有件事我应该早说
Listen. There's something I should tell you.

1143
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,805
我一直隐瞒着
It's something I've been hiding.

1144
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,139
鲍比 可以等一等
Bobby, I think it can wait.

1145
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,016
这可能有点怪
And it might seem a little weird.

1146
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,727
但我想你应该保持开放的心态
But I think you should just try to keep an open mind,

1147
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,146
不要马上评价 好吗？
and not judge right away, okay?

1148
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,417
天空摄影4台正在现场连续直播
Skycam 4 is on the scene with continuing coverage.

1149
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,377
我们在联合大楼上空往下看
We are looking down on the Commonwealth building

1150
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:32,446
那里密集了…
which is swarming with,

1151
01:16:32,446 --> 01:16:34,088
我不知怎么说只能形容为
there's really no other way to say this,

1152
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,214
怪物
monsters.

1153
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,216
我呼吁大家留在室内 直至情况…
I urge everyone to stay inside until this situation...

1154
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,467
戴夫！
Dave!

1155
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:45,516
好险
Wicked.

1156
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,812
看起来他们制造了一个路障
Looks like they built a barricade.

1157
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,652
又是那肥猫王
And there's Fat Elvis.

1158
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,863
撞死这肥胖子
Hit him in the jiggly.

1159
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,758
不错！
Not bad!

1160
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,761
放开我的车门！
My door!

1161
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:23,888
摆脱不了我的！
Can't shake me!

1162
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,432
仍在这里！
Still here, dicks!

1163
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,480
放松身体
Relax body.

1164
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,194
死去吧
Death.

1165
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,034
我希望他们能有电梯
I hope they have an elevator.

1166
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:51,248
该死的
Shit.

1167
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:00,675
扭转死亡隧道 死人将回落下来
Reverse the tunnel, the dead come pouring back.

1168
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,551
我们将永远地留在这里
We stay here forever.

1169
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,638
现在是击掌的时候了
Kind of a high-five moment.

1170
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:10,476
我们所要做的就是激活这坏小子
All we gotta do is fire up this bad boy.

1171
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,445
好！
Yeah!

1172
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,280
好的
Okay.

1173
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,785
这可能会令人有一点点不舒服
This is where it gets a little uncomfortable.

1174
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,955
因为没法好好形容 我只能直说
There's no great way to say this, so I'll just say it.

1175
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,958
这种古老仪式 往往包含了一种要素
These ancient things, they often involve an element of,

1176
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,668
我不想说的就是“人祭”
I don't want to say "human sacrifice,"

1177
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:36,877
但就是人祭
but human sacrifice.

1178
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,130
你碰到我之前 我会跳下去
I'll jump before you can even touch me.

1179
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,216
朱莉娅 拜托 冷静点
Julia, come on. Be cool.

1180
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,700
这是种荣耀
This is an honor.

1181
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:45,594
我信任你才选择你担负重任
I'm trusting you with the heavy shit.

1182
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,105
朱莉娅！
Julia!

1183
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,357
时间刚刚好
Just in time.

1184
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,859
鲍比！不要！
Bobby! Don't!

1185
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:05,990
不！
No!

1186
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,654
闪开！
Move!

1187
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:55,498
射的好
Nice shot.

1188
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,211
我要去救朱莉娅 你处理那东西
I'm gonna go get Julia. You take care of the Staff.

1189
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,713
那黄金东西会倒塌的
That golden pecker is coming down.

1190
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:05,132
你准备好了吗？
You frosty?

1191
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:07,551
冰火 搭档
Icy hot, partner.

1192
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,181
现在怎么样 尼克？
What now, Nick?

1193
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,567
你知道的 不一定是朱莉娅的
You know, it didn't have to be Julia,

1194
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,403
但是我总想把事情弄的圆满些
but I just couldn't resist bringing it full circle.

1195
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:09,780
来吧 很不错 对吧？
Come on. It's good, right?

1196
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,545
给我过来！
Get over here!

1197
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,133
你怎么样了 罗伊？
How's it coming, Roy?

1198
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,343
这比想像的更难处理！
It's harder than it looks!

1199
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:44,565
杀你这件事我总玩不厌 尼克
Killing you never gets old, Nicky.

1200
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,026
随时都行啊！
Any time now!

1201
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,736
我听到了！
I hear you!

1202
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,365
来吧 罗伊！
Come on, Roy!

1203
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,576
做些牛仔会做的事情！
Do some cowboy stuff!

1204
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:16,513
拜托！
Please!

1205
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:17,681
罗伊！
Roy!

1206
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,440
这就对了！
There it is.

1207
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:32,571
不
No.

1208
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:52,257
那么 好搭档
Well, partner.

1209
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,595
我有一个新搭档了
I have a new partner.

1210
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:54,778
我很想念你
I missed you.

1211
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,158
我太想念你了
I missed you so much.

1212
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:06,123
抱歉 非常抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1213
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,126
没关系 现在你和我在一起了
It's okay, you're back with me now.

1214
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,087
这就是我想要的一切
That's all I wanted.

1215
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,049
但并非以这样的方式
But not like this.

1216
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:21,305
朱莉娅 你要好好生活下去
Julia, you gotta live your life,

1217
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:23,932
即使没有我
without me.

1218
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,645
我不想说再见
I don't want to say goodbye.

1219
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,483
你不能呆在这里
You can't stay here.

1220
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,445
没关系
It's okay.

1221
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,282
去吧
Go.

1222
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,410
我永远爱你
I will always love you.

1223
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:47,623
再见
Goodbye.

1224
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,853
她会没事的
She's gonna be okay.

1225
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,938
谢谢你
Thank you.

1226
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:12,731
这回你欠我了
You owe me for that.

1227
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,238
我们来算帐吧
Let's settle up.

1228
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:20,447
当然
Sure.

1229
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:22,783
我希望允许我设计我自己的奖牌
I would like to be allowed to design my own medal.

1230
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:23,867
没有这么快
Not so fast.

1231
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,538
永恒部门在你们没出席的情况下继续进行了纪律审判
The Eternals went ahead and had your disciplinary hearing without you.

1232
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,665
在我们拯救世界的时候？
While we were saving the world?

1233
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:33,001
尼克 作为新警员 仅一次警告
Nick, as a new recruit, you've been let off with a warning.

1234
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,378
还算合理
Reasonable.

1235
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,380
- 罗伊 有惩罚…   - 惩罚？
- Roy, as punishment... - "Punishment"?

1236
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,800
是的 你的任期再增加53年
Yes. Fifty-three more years have been added to your term.

1237
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,009
53年？
Fifty-three years?

1238
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,261
那太多了
That's a lot.

1239
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:45,305
这全是扯淡
This is honky-tonk bullshit.

1240
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,350
你就是喜欢把我留在身旁 是吧 米尔德丽德？
You just like having me around, don't you, Mildred?

1241
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:58,735
我的帽子
My hat.

1242
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:03,240
你帮我找到了它？
You went off and found it?

1243
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,914
我想我可以时不时再买一些花送你
I guess I could've bought you flowers once or twice.

1244
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:19,923
我喜欢紫罗兰(暴力)
I like violets.

1245
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,477
她咬了我的胡子
She "billy goat-ed" me.

1246
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:34,688
这是我们以前常做的事情
It's something we used to do.

1247
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:40,652
她刻意用白色的靴子把脚踝包起来
Why she covers up them ankles with them damn white boots

1248
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:42,529
我永远无法理解
I'll never understand.

1249
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,198
你还有53年 不是吗？
Fifty-three more years, huh?

1250
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:47,576
不 我还有一些工作要做
Well, I still got some things to work on.

1251
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,120
我这已是第三次延长了
Hell, this is the third time I've been extended.

1252
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:53,332
对了 我给你带了点东西
Say, I got you something.

1253
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,792
是什么？
What's this?

1254
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,712
我知道你不喜欢陈大爷的外表
I knew you weren't happy with Grandpa Chen,

1255
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:02,633
所以我走了点关系 给你一个新的身份外表
so I pulled a few strings, got you some new ID.

1256
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,596
我很感激  谢谢你 罗伊 我是认真的
Thank you. Thank you, Roy. I mean that.

1257
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,306
那太捧了
This is great.

1258
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,434
你是在跟我开玩笑吧
You gotta be shitting me.

1259
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:15,854
我做了我所能做的  毕竟资源有限啊
I did what I could. Inventory is what it is.

1260
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:18,398
你认为这算是一种进步吗？
You thought this was an improvement?
