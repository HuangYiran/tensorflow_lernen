139
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,450
他感覺無法呼吸
He felt like he couldn't breathe.

140
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,210
我們不得不跟他說
And we would have to say,

141
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,270
"你得往頭上套個袋子"
"You've got to put a sack over your head."

143
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,260
他不喜歡那樣做
He didn't like doing it,

144
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,240
但如果是在我家  我們就會給他套個袋子
but when he was at my house, we put a sack over his head.

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,890
隨著時間推移
So as time went on,

146
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,510
我會偷偷溜進家里的某間臥室
I would sneak into one of the bedrooms in our house

147
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,970
然后撥911  說我快死了
and I would dial 911 and tell them that I was dying.

148
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,790
突然間
And all of a sudden,

149
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,260
我看見車道上有很多燈在閃
I see these flashing lights in the driveway,

150
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,100
我就想  "出什么事了"
and I thought, "What is going on?"

151
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,070
我上樓之后  急救人員說
And I go upstairs, and here is the ambulance

152
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,180
家里有人遇到麻煩了
saying that somebody is in distress in this home.

153
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,320
有人噎住了  有人窒息了
Somebody was choking. Somebody was suffocating.

154
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,380
她就會說  "謝恩  該死的"
It led to her being like, you know, "Shane, god damn it!

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,870
"警察怎么又來了"
The cops are here again."

156
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,060
從他六年級開始一直到高中
From sixth grade, till I got that kid through high school,

157
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,810
我都不知道自己是怎么撐下來的
I didn't know if I was gonna survive.

158
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,330
我敢說他報了10到15次警
I bet 10, 15 times he called 911.

159
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,480
我花的錢
The money

160
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,910
那么多年來我在那上面花的錢
That it, you know, cost me through the years --

161
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,290
可以說是壓力不小
It was very stressful.

162
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,160
但他的確很痛苦  我知道他很痛苦
But it was real to him, and I knew it was real to him,

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
我想要他有安全感
And I wanted him to feel he was safe.

164
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,460
她最終發現
She finally decided

165
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,470
狀況已經嚴重到超出她能掌控的地步了
that this is maybe more serious than she can handle,

166
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,310
所以她帶我去看了心理醫生
so she set me up with a therapist.

167
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,030
等謝恩完成他的療程之后
When Shane got done with his session,

168
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,450
醫生把我叫進去  對我說
he asked me to come in, and he said,

169
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,180
"你兒子需要接受他是同性戀這個事實"
"Your son just needs to admit to himself that he's gay,

170
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,980
"一切都會好起來的"
and everything will be fine."

171
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,090
我說  "你怎么能這樣說呢"
And I said, "How can you say that?

172
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,550
"他不是同性戀"
He's not gay."

173
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,950
豪瑟醫生說  "那好吧"
And Doctor Hausser said, "Well, you know,

174
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,040
"看來你也需要坦然接受這個事實"
That's something you're gonna have to come to peace with."

175
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,970
我一直很懷疑  不騙你
I always suspected -- I'm not gonna lie to you.

176
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,140
我花了幾天時間接受這個事實
It took me a couple days to process,

177
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,510
然后我就決定
and the thing it come down to is,

178
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,190
"我不會再要其他孩子了"
"I ain't making any more kids --

179
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,460
"我還是跟這幾個孩子好好過吧"
I better stay in good with the ones I got."

180
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,270
我無條件地愛他  所以這并不重要
And I love him unconditionally, so it just doesn't matter.

181
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,710
有趣的是  當我還是個小孩子
It's kind of funny now that, here I was a little boy,

182
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,290
我跪在地上  向上帝祈禱自己不是同性戀
on my knees, praying to God that I wouldn't be gay,

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,940
與此同時有另外一個男孩
and there was another little boy

184
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,470
在2400公里以外的印第安納做著同樣的事
1,500 miles away in Indiana doing the same thing.

185
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,190
同性戀孩子想在印第安納諾克斯市
Knox, Indiana, is not the easiest place

186
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,060
長大很不容易
for a gay kid to grow up.

187
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,420
那里文化很單一  不夠多元
It's very homogenous -- not much diversity there.

我認識湯姆
I knew Tom

190
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,470
是因為我倆的哥哥都曾當過童子軍
when both of our brothers were in boy scouts together.

191
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,470

他就是那種人見人愛的孩子
And he was just the popular kid.

193
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,280
非常有同情心
He had a lot of empathy.

194

我永遠不會忘記  我母親去世那天

湯姆是第一個來我家的人
Tom was the first person to come over to my house.

196
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,720
他走進大門  哭哭啼啼的
He walked in the door, and he was crying --

197
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,050
好像他比我還傷心
You know, almost like he's sadder than I am.

198

都有各自的孩子
from previous marriages.

200
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,740
湯姆則是他倆唯一共同生下的孩子
So, Tom was the only child between the two parents,

201
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,920
是全家人的掌上明珠
and he was the center of attention in the family.

211
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,660
對湯姆來說  怎么表現都不為過
For Tom, there was never any such thing as too much.

日復一日
and, you know, did it again.

215
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,610
他父母為了湯姆的幸福犧牲了很多
Both of his parents sacrificed a lot for Tom's happiness.

216
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,100
為了讓湯姆進柯爾沃
His mom took a job as a janitor

217
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,410
他母親找了份清潔工的工作
so that Tom could go to Culver.

湯姆的父親曾在越南服役
Tom's dad was in Vietnam, and that's why

223
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,230
因此他高中時去了趟越南
he went to Vietnam when he was in high school.

224
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,560
他十分欽佩父親為國奮戰的行為
He definitely respected his dad for fighting for his country.

225
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,050
我覺得  隨著湯姆不斷長大
I think, as Tom got older,

226
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,900
隨著他逐漸萌生自己的想法
as Tom became his own person,

227
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,670
他倆也變得愈發難以溝通
it just became difficult for them to connect.

228
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,060
湯姆總是固執地
Tom was always very adamant

說著自己的想法
about saying what he believed in,

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,120
他總是無條件支持你
He always had your back.

402
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,270
我認為湯姆沒有去本地的高中
I think Tom went to Culver

403
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,630
而是選擇了柯爾沃
instead of the high school in his hometown,

404
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,730
是因為他覺得這是個
because he saw it as an opportunity

405
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,500
開闊眼界的機會
to open his horizons,

406
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,930
為此  他的父母功不可沒
And, you know, his parents played a big role in that.

407
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,570
他媽媽在柯爾沃工作
His mom worked at culver,

408
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,750
因此他們才能支付減免的學費
primarily so that they could afford the reduced tuition,

409
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,790
因此湯姆才有了以后那些機會
so that Tom would have all those opportunities.

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,870
高三那年  他向我吐露心聲
He came out to me our senior year.

411
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,350
那天晚上  我們坐在草地上
It was at night, and we were sitting in the grass,

412
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,640
我只記得  他突然變得很嚴肅
and I remember he got really serious all of a sudden,

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,960
他說  "我有事要告訴你"
And he said, "I have something to tell you --

414
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,360
"我是同性戀"
I'm gay."

415
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,080
之后他就把頭埋了下去
Then he put his head in his lap,

416
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,090
哭了出來  他的情緒很激動
And he was crying and really emotional about it.

417
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,120
我想他真的很害怕被人說三道四
I think he was really afraid of being judged.

418
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,020
可我并沒有感到驚訝
It didn't surprise me at all.

419
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,550
因為這位男性朋友
This is coming from my friend who,

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,030
剛在他家后院里玩蹦床的時候
was singing "I'm a barbie girl,"

422
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,270
高歌過一曲《芭比娃娃》

他認識所有人  大家也都知道他
He knew everybody, and everybody knew him.

426
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,200
因為總和他在一起
I felt like my popularity scale rose

427
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,850
我覺得自己也變得出名了
just because I hung out with him.

428

上學的時候  湯姆和安妮·海瑟薇是朋友

Corn-fed, american-pie-eating guy,

435
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,780
來自印第安納州的一個小鎮

436
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,780
他上過軍校
who then went to military school.

437
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,080
他總是能在社交
He was able to get along and succeed

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,590
和學業之間游刃有余
in that entire social circle and academic circle.

439
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,220
后來他來到了自由的瓦薩學院
And then went to Vassar, which is this liberal place

440
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,400
那里的氛圍完全不同
and a completely different vibe.

可他從不關注別人的長相
He did not care at all about how other people looked.

446
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,990
他不在乎你是從哪里來的
And he did not care where you came from,

你開什么樣的車
what car you drove.

448
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,460
他只是很單純地接納你這個人
He just accepted anybody and everybody for who they were,

449
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,230
可能是由于他的同志身份
and I think because he was gay,

450
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
他了解那些逆主流
and because he knew what it was like

他對我說過很多次

因為我有聽力障礙而對我十分欽佩
how much he respected me because I was hearing-impaired.

454
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,800
與其他20出頭的年輕人不同  他經常對我說
What 20-something-year-old says to you,

455
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,790
"天哪  太不可思議了  你怎么做到的"
"Wow, you're amazing -- you've done so much"?

456
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,110
"我真是太崇拜你了"
"I'm in total awe of you --"

457
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,860
誰會這樣說呢  沒人這樣說
Who says that? Nobody.

458
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,770
他會吟唱古典音樂
He gave recitals of classical music.

459
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,600
他寫出的歌詞感人肺腑
He wrote incredibly heartfelt lyrics.

460
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,030
但他同時也是個硬漢  可以把你打得落花流水
But he was tough, 'cause he could kick your ass.

461
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,120
能夠把你摔倒在地
He could wrestle you down.

462
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,050
我知道他爸爸很嚴厲
I know that his dad was very stern.

463
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,130
在一定程度上  他認為
The idea of manhood and masculinity

464
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,250
男子漢一定要有陽剛之氣
and presenting yourself in a certain way

465
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,680
這一點對他來說很重要

466
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,410
他希望湯姆也能夠成為那樣的男子漢
I think he wanted to have Tom basically play that role.

467
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,330
在這一點上  湯姆做得很好
And Tom knew how to play it very well.

468
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,470
我和湯姆之間
There was definitely

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,430
有一個從沒說出口的共識
an unspoken understanding between Tom and I

470
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,510
那就是他的同志身份
that he was gay.

471
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,120
我知道他一直在為此掙扎
And I know that was a struggle for him,

472
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,030
因為他始終沒有告訴自己的父母
because he still hadn't told his parents.

473
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,340
我想湯姆一定是擔心
I think Tom was literally worried

他爸爸知道后會宰了他吧

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,690
邀請我去和她的一個朋友打保齡球
she invited me to go bowling with one of her friends.

533
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,150
我們有個想法
We had this idea

534
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,500
讓湯姆和謝恩相互認識一下
that we had to get Tom and Shane to meet each other.

535
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,120
{\an1}{\pos(40.8,213)}麗茲 好友

536
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,120
不過沒告訴他們這是我們刻意安排的
But we didn't tell them that it was a setup.

537
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,560
她跟我說有個叫湯姆的人也會去
She said that there was gonna be this guy there named Tom

538
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,150
他在這個行業中十分活躍
and that he's active in the industry,

539
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,590
{\an8}《新聞周刊》平面模特照

540
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,960
所以她覺得結識他  會對我今后的發展有幫助
So she thought that maybe it would be a good person to be connected with.

541
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,180
我們到了那里
We get there.

542
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,310
他非常引人注目
He is ridiculously attractive --

543
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,000
可以說帥氣逼人  魅力非凡
gorgeous, if you will -- so charismatic.

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,310
他當過演員
He was an actor.

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,290
拍過幾部戲
I think he had been in a few things.

546
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,530
就在此時
And almost immediately,

547
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,530
謝恩開始懷疑我們的目的
Shane became skeptical.

548
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,940
{\an1}我們喜歡這些男人

549
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,940
{\an1}性感的鄰家男孩

550
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,400
他開始問"這家伙是誰"
He was like, "who is this guy?"

551
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,540
我反問他"他為何讓你如此糾結  謝恩"
And I'm like, "why is he bothering you so much, Shane?"

552
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,540
他比我大四歲
He was four years older than me.

553
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,510
去過很多地方
Like, he had traveled the world,

554
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,100
會說外語
you know, spoke a different language.

555
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,470
會演奏好幾種樂器
He played a bunch of instruments.

556
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,410
他總是自信滿滿的樣子
He was just so cocky and confident,

557
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,980
當然  保齡球也打得很好
and, well, of course, he, like, was bowling really well.

558
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,080
而我  連五個瓶都擊不倒
And then here I am, like, can't even knock five pins down.

559
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,410
在打完保齡球不久之后
So, it wasn't too long after we went bowling

560
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,580
我們又在我朋友莉茲的公寓里碰到了
that we all got together again at my friend Lizzy's apartment.

561
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,310
就在那天晚上
It was that night

562
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,400
我們終于互換了手機號碼
that we finally exchanged phone numbers.

563
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,230
我們一起出去玩
We ended up hanging out,

564
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,010
四處周游
you know, a few times here and there.

565
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,890
他一直唱歌  總是很開心的樣子
And he was always singing. He was always happy.

566
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,120
{\an9}?生活就像高速公路
♪ Life is a highway

567
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,320
{\an9}?我要星夜兼程
♪ I want to ride it all night long

568
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,940
我和湯姆  我們白天一直待在一起
Tom and I, we would spend all day together,

569
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,920
之后他回自己家
and then he would go home,

570
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,970
然后  晚上的時候
which would lead to, later in the evening,

571
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,810
我們還要講上幾個小時的電話
talking on the phone for a few hours.

572
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,320
沒過多久
It did not take long

573
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,970
我就覺得與湯姆相處很愉快
for me to really feel comfortable with Tom,

574
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,160
可以對他無所不談
that I could tell him anything.

575
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,820
可以信任他一輩子
Like, I trusted him with my life.

576
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,340
湯姆是個很自信的人
Tom was a very confident person.

577
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,150
是他主動追求謝恩
He went after Shane.

578
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,000
起初  謝恩的反應是"天吶"
At first, Shane was like, "aah,"

579
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,530
因為他從沒談過戀愛
'cause he had never been in a relationship before.

580
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,730
這對他來說是初戀
This was his, you know, first love.

581
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,020
我們有次去聽湯姆演唱
We went to hear Tom one time,

582
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,070
謝恩會在他表演的時候環顧四周
and Shane would look around the room while he was playing

583
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,310
因為他想讓所有人都專心聽他唱歌
because he wanted to make sure everybody was paying attention

584
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,570
并對他同樣狂熱
and seeing what he saw.

585
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,890
有一個猶太單詞叫做自豪
And there is a Jewish word called kvell.

586
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,670
那正是湯姆表演時他臉上的神情
And that's what he looked like when Tom performed --

587
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,590
他無比自豪
he was kvelling.

588
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,240
熱情洋溢
He was glowing.

589
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,440
終于體驗到愛情的滋味非常美妙
It was incredible to finally experience that feeling of love,

590
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,400
有如心花怒放一般
you know, like the butterflies.

591
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,290
這正是我想象中我的朋友們有過的感受
It's what I always imagined that all my friends felt.

592
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,150
沒過多久  我就搬進了他的公寓
It didn't take long for me to move into his apartment.

593
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,510
他們很快就走到了一起
They got very close very quickly.

594
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,700
我認為他們能走到一起并不是因為搬去了洛杉磯
I think their freedom wasn't moving to L.A.

595
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,790
而是由于湯姆為謝恩創造了
I think Tom was definitely the door for Shane

596
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,480
認同自己的機會
to come to terms with himself.

597
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,840
湯姆是他的避風港
Tom was a safe place.

598
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,030
湯姆認識謝恩的時候  他就像只迷失的羊
When Tom met Shane, he was a little, lost sheep.

599
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,430
湯姆真的把謝恩照顧的很好
And Tom really looked out for Shane.

600
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,870
他喜歡給我做飯  哪怕他累了一天
He loved making dinner even when he was really tired.

601
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,280
他喜歡替我系領帶
He loved tying my ties --

602
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,000
甚至用專門的方法幫我疊襯衫
even properly tucking my shirt in,

603
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,460
因為柯爾沃教過他該怎么弄
because at Culver, they teach you how to do all that.

604
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,100
湯姆一心追求他的夢想
Tom truly was pursuing his dreams,

605
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,400
而謝恩明白賬單需要有人支付
and Shane knew that bills had to be paid.

606
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,610
謝恩是個很理性地人
Shane was the level-headed one.

607
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,750
一人沒考慮周全的地方  另一人可以互補
What one couldn't think of, the other one could.

608
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,470
他們發現彼此之間有很多共同點
They found an awful lot in common.

609
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,870
他們都是浪漫主義者
They were both romantics.

610
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,160
他們都來自小鎮
They're both from small towns.

611
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,040
都希望讓世人對他們刮目相看
Both wanted to make an impression on the world.

They were always smiling and always having a good time.

614
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,530
他們是那種讓你相信愛情的情侶

I just loved their bickering,

617
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,640
那簡直是打情罵俏
which was really flirting.

618
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,330
在他們感情中  我最喜歡那個部分
That was probably my favorite part of their relationship.

I did this once in military school --

621
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,140
最后那孩子不得不剃成光頭
the kid had to shave his head.

622

你為什么告訴我這事
Why are you telling me that?

623
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,390
說真的  別太用力
Seriously, don't press so hard.

624
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,450
他們就像一對老夫老妻
They were like an old married couple --

625
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,590
他們很年輕  又是同性戀  卻不愛外出消遣
they were young, gay, but they never wanted to go out.

626
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,210
我有時提議"我們去酒吧吧  我們去夜店吧"
I'm like, "let's go to the bar. Let's go to the club."

They didn't go out a lot,

629
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,110
因為他們總是在努力工作
'cause they were always working,

想方設法地構建自己的生活
trying to build something.

631
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,240
我知道對湯姆而言  這不僅是為了忠貞
I know that, for Tom, it wasn't just about fidelity,

632
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,560
當然  這很重要
which, of course, was like number one.

與此同時
It was also about being

他將自己的情感

精神和靈魂都完全交給了謝恩
mentally available, spiritually available to Shane.

636

當你到了我這把歲數
When you get to my age,

637
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,580
會對一切抱有懷疑態度

比如感情那種事誰都說不準
that anything like that can occur.

Shane and Tom started doing online promotion for musicians.

650

他們有個小小的工作室

665
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,220
偶比飛行員更膩害
This is better than a pilot.

666
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,050
你知道自己會這么說話吧
You know you do that voice.

667
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,910
-那必須滴  -好吧
- Oh, I know. - Okay.

668
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,640
他們成了冒險家
They became adventurers,

669
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
電影制片人  紀錄片制作人
filmmakers, documentarians.

670
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,520
我覺得他們真的很喜歡這個想法
I think they just really liked the idea

671
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,910
拍下他們所經歷的美好時光  并與世人分享
of taking the excitement that they had and sharing it.

672
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,410
我和湯姆越是相愛
The more Tom and I fell in love,

673
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,490
我們越想告訴我們的父母
the more we wanted to tell our parents about it.

674
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,450
但是我們有個想法
But each of us had the philosophy

675
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,740
在沒有找到那個
that there was no need to tell your family

676
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,330
{\an1}{\pos(40.167,238)}謝恩的姐妹

677
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,380
能夠與你共度余生的伴侶之前
until you found that person

678
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,340
沒必要告訴自己的家人
that you were gonna spend the rest of your life with.

679
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,230
我媽和阿姨來看我
So, my mom and my aunt were visiting,

680
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,940
那天已經很晚了
and it was very late at night,

681
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,810
但我跟我媽說我得和她談談
but I told my mom that I had to talk to her.

682
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,070
當著湯姆的面  我說"媽"
With Tom by my side, I said, "mom."

683
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,130
我說"親愛的  如果你想告訴我你是同性戀"
I said, "honey, if you're gonna tell me you're gay,

684
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,340
"沒關系  我知道這事  我可以接受"
that's fine. I know it, and I'm okay with it."

685
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,280
接著我問"湯姆是你的伴侶嗎"
And I said, "and is Tom your partner?"

686
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,790
湯姆說"是的  我是他的伴侶"
And Tom goes, "yep. I'm his partner."

687
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,270
湯姆坐在那  本以為會有一場激烈的爭吵
Tom was sitting there waiting for a big blowup or something,

688
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,070
而我只說了句  "太好了"
And I just said, "Well, great.

689
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,410
"我不用再像以前那樣擔心謝恩了"
You know, I don't have to worry about Shane like I did."

690
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,150
湯姆是上天賜予我的禮物
Tom was my godsend.

691
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,280
謝恩的焦慮癥再也沒發過
Shane didn't have his anxieties anymore.

692
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,510
他更有自信
He was more confident.

693
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,370
生活得很幸福
He was happy.

694
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,560
變得更像一個男子漢了
He was just more of a man.

695
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,300
我從沒想過
I never imagined

696
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,210
我會比以前更愛我母親
that I could love my mom even more than I did.

697
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,850
當我為自己是同性戀而掙扎時  她一直陪在我身邊
She had been there through all my struggles of being gay.

698
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,930
我們從沒有開誠布公地談過這件事
And we never said out loud what the real deal was,

699
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,450
但現在終于說出來了
but now we had.

700
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,010
那感覺真的好極了
It was the greatest feeling ever.

701
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,560
{\an1}{\pos(41.367,238.8)}演唱: 湯姆

702
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,930
我和湯姆知道
Tom and I knew

703
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,130
向他父母坦白會是個巨大的挑戰
it would be a challenge to come out to his parents.

704
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,700
他去印第安納州過圣誕節
So, he was in Indiana for Christmas.

705
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,640
當時只有他和他母親兩個人
It was just him and his mom.

706
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,860
電視上播放了一檔
And there was something that came on TV

707
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,310
關于女同情侶的節目
about a lesbian couple,

708
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,850
湯姆的母親說那太惡心了
And Tom's mom made a comment about how that was disgusting.

709
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,480
就在那時  湯姆意識到
And Tom, at that moment, just realized,

710
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,860
"我得告訴她真相"
"Like, I need to tell her."

711
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,150
他對他母親說  "媽  我是同性戀"
He told his mom, "Mom, I'm gay.

712
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,760
"你說那樣的話  其實也在說我"
When you say things like that, you're talking about me."

713
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,900
我覺得他以為事情會像
He was, I think, sort of building

714
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,550
謝恩出柜時一樣
on what had happened when Shane came out.

715
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,660
謝恩向他母親坦白的時候
Shane had come out to his mother,

716
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,140
她母親已經猜得八九不離十
and she basically filled in the blanks --

717
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,910
"你是同性戀  我早知道了"
"Oh, you're gay. I knew that already.

718
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,020
"我一直都知道"
I always knew that."

719
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,470
我一直以為他母親知道他是同性戀
I was sure that his mom knew that he was gay.

720
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,530
但她立馬給他父親打了電話
But she immediately called his dad

721
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,210
讓他下班回家
to come home from work

722
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,280
就因為這條令人震驚的消息
because of this breaking news.

723
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,300
她一直不停地說
And she went on and on

724
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,400
這是罪過
about how it was a sin

725
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,110
說湯姆應該早點告訴他們
and that Tom should have told them sooner

726
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,710
這樣就可以帶他接受治療
so he could have gotten medical help.

727
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,460
他父親對他說了一些很難聽的話
His dad said a lot of hateful things towards him

728
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,820
他怪謝恩把他兒子變成了同性戀
and blamed Shane for making him gay.

729
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,870
"都是謝恩的錯  他讓你變成了同性戀"
"It's Shane's fault. Shane turned you gay.

730
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,360
"在洛杉磯生活讓你變成了同性戀"
Being in L.A. Turned you gay."

731
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,900
"你所有的成就都變得一文不值"
"All of your accomplishments so far mean nothing now."

732
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,160
他們說  "你得改變想法  你必須改變想法"
They said, "Change your mind. You have to change your mind."

733
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,950
湯姆一直說不
And Tom said that he just kept saying no --

734
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,620
他說  "我改變不了"
Like, you know, "I can't change my mind.

735
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,420
"這是沒法改變的事"
It's not a mind-change thing."

736
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,720
湯姆打電話給我
Tom called me.

737
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
說他父親拿槍指著他
He told me that his dad pulled a shotgun on him.

738
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,400
當時我非常害怕
And at that point, I was really scared.

739
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
我倆通電話的時候
So, while Tom and I were on the phone,

740
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,130
他父親諾曼把門從門框上扯了下來
His dad, Norman, literally ripped the door off the hinges.

741
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,990
他母親拿起電話對我說
And his mom got on the phone, and she said to me,

742
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,280
"聽著  你個狗娘養的"
"Listen here, fucker --

743
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,320
"我不知道你對我兒子做了什么"
I don't know what you did to our son,

744
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,680
"但我們會去洛杉磯  把你揪出來"
but we're gonna come to L.A., and we're gonna find you."

745
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,160
我記得他父親說的原話是
I think the phrase his dad used was,

746
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
他要去加州把他的腸子扯出來
He was gonna come out to California and gut him.

747
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,810
我以前總有這樣的幻想
I used to always have this fantasy

748
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,810
我和湯姆去印第安納過圣誕節
of Tom and I going to Indiana for Christmas

749
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,480
一同進入夢鄉
and just, you know, going to bed

751
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,550
然后在圣誕節早晨醒來
and waking up on Christmas morning,

752
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,170
大家聚在客廳里
all of us going out to the living room --

753
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,720
客廳里有棵圣誕樹
You know, there's the tree,

754
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,300
我和湯姆跟他家人坐在一起
and Tom and I just sitting there with his family,

755
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,830
一起拆開禮物
opening presents together,

756
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,550
我會說一些我覺得有趣的事情
and me just saying something that I think's funny,

757
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,530
放眼望去  湯姆的父母在開懷大笑
and I look over, and Tom's parents are laughing.

758
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,120
我知道這想法很蠢  但是...
It's stupid, but it's just...

759
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,520
如果真能夢想成真
It would be like an incredible thing

760
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,850
那該多好啊
if something like that happened.

761
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,280
警察趕到家里的時候
When the police showed up at the house,

762
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,330
湯姆的父親不屑一顧地說
Tom's dad just kind of pooh-poohed it off, and he said,

763
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,260
"你知道那些加州小孩是什么德性"
"Ah, you know how these California kids are."

764
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,950
之后兩天的電話
Those phone calls for those next two days,

765
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,660
直到湯姆離開那之前  真的是...
until Tom got out of there, were just...

766
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,180
這兩個孩子都讓我心疼極了
My heart just broke for both of those boys.

767
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,440
真是太可怕  太讓人難過了
It was just so scary and so sad.

768
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,450
第二天一早
So, that next morning,

769
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,740
湯姆的父母在廚房里
Tom's parents were in the kitchen

770
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,670
桌子上放著一本圣經
with a bible on the table.

771
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,850
他們大聲誦讀里面的篇章
Out loud, they were saying the verses,

772
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,730
{\an8}圣經說教開始了
他們正在找對應的篇章

773
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,120
像是在為昨天發生的事找理由
almost, in a way, just to justify that, the day before,

774
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,200
{\an8}我為他們祈禱
湯姆  真心的

775
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,300
他們打了他們的兒子  只因為他是同性戀
they beat up their son because he was gay.

776
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,450
他說  "我真不敢相信"
He's like, "I can't believe this.

777
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,580
{\an8}糟透了...
我不小心咬了我媽

778
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,560
"我竟然被打了  他們還說"
"I just got attacked and told

779
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,740
"我應該把我是同性戀這件事"
"that I should have taken the fact that I'm gay

780
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,670
"帶進墳墓里"
to the grave."

781
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:43,210
{\an8}我父親從未如此害怕我
我看見他眼里的恐懼  我差點殺了他

782
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,360
情況很糟糕
It was just an awful situation,

783
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,950
于是湯姆盡快離開了
and Tom, you know, got out of there as soon as he could

784
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,250
飛回了加利福尼亞
and flew back to California.

785
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,500
最后瑪莎還是來了加州
So, eventually, Martha made her way out to California,

786
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,140
我非常非常緊張
and I was really, really nervous.

787
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,160
這是自那次糟糕的經歷后
This was like the first time that I was going to see Martha

788
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,670
我第一次見到瑪莎
since that, you know, horrible experience.

789
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,880
我覺得瑪莎之所以來這
I think Martha came here

790
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,410
是因為她不想失去她的兒子
because she did not want to lose her son.

791
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,940
所以她必須接受謝恩
So she had to embrace Shane

792
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,260
表現出她似乎接受了這段感情
and act like she accepted the relationship.

793
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,170
開始有點尷尬
It was a little awkward for awhile.

794
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,180
但漸漸地  我們熟起來了
But, eventually, you know, we warmed up to each other.

795
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,700
我們一起去吃晚餐
We would go to dinner.

796
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,200
湯姆跟她一起歇斯底里地笑
Tom and her would laugh, like, hysterically.

797
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,150
他倆在一起時
When they get together,

798
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,130
就像兩個小老太太
it's like two little, old ladies.

799
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,270
盡管她沒有明說
And although she didn't say, like, you know,

800
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,950
"謝恩  對不起"  或是  "湯姆  對不起"
"Shane, I'm sorry," or, "Tom, I'm sorry

801
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,860
"我們之前不該那么對你"
for how we handled everything,"

802
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,740
對我們來說  她是在用自己的方式
To us, it was like this is her way

803
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,450
表示她接受我們了
of showing that she's accepting us.

804
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,810
她不僅愛她兒子  她真的愛死他兒子了
It wasn't that she loved her son -- she loved her son.

805
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:49,080
她會不惜一切代價接近他
And whatever it took to be near him, she did.

806
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,670
哪怕去耕地她都愿意
If she had to push a plow, she would,

807
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,210
只要能接近她的兒子
just to be near her son.

808
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,470
這張照片是他們去格勞曼劇院的時候拍的
She has this picture where they went to Grauman theatre

809
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,700
當時還看了埃爾維斯的手印
and saw Elvis' handprints.

810
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,830
她說那是她一生中最快樂的日子
She said that was the happiest day of her life.

811
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,750
我覺得她很享受在加州的生活
I think she truly enjoyed coming out to California.

812
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,750
然后她回到印第安納之后
And then she would get back to Indiana,

813
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,070
又基本上全盤否定湯姆在這的生活
and, basically, wouldn't acknowledge Tom's life here.

814
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,640
進展就像嬰兒學步一樣緩慢
And, you know, again, it was kind of like just baby steps.

815
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,520
幾次之后
Truly, after like a few times,

816
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,300
我們覺得她接受了我們
we felt like she was okay with us

817
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,720
她為我們高興
and she was happy for us.

818
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,070
她還堅持讓我和湯姆睡臥室
She even insisted on Tom and me taking the bedroom

819
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,200
她和我們的狗一起睡沙發
while she stayed on the sofa with our dog.

Okay, I miss you, and you just want to stay with her.

沒錯  低頭懺悔去吧
Yeah. You put that head down.

828
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,900
湯姆很喜歡他的狗
Tom was obsessed with his dog.

829
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,640
總是給它拍照片
Tom was always, always taking pictures of him.

830
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,720
就像是他的親生寶寶
It was like someone with, like, a newborn baby.

還有些其他稀奇古怪的服飾

835
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,330
我就想  "天吶"

"這不會是兩個同性戀人"

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,650
每一年  她都會記錄自己殺了多少條蛇
You know, every year, she keeps track of how many snakes she kills.

928
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,290
我總是跟蛇過不去
Well, I'm always after a snake --

929
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,240
我不希望它們出現在附近
I don't want them around.

930
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,490
你每年春天最多能殺多少條蛇來著
I mean, you killed up to how many in a spring -- every spring?

931
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,560
能有40條甚至更多
Oh, I killed up to 40 or better.

932
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,220
有一次我和湯姆陪兩個祖母去散步
After Tom and I went for a walk with both of my grandmas,

933
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,860
在回家的路上
when we were coming back into the house,

934
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,840
帕特祖母摟著湯姆
Grandma Pat like put her arm around Tom.

935
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,020
她說  "歡迎加入這個大家庭"
She was like, "Welcome to the family."

936
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,600
她已經九十歲了
She's 90 years old,

937
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,960
但仍然能接納了我們的關系
and, you know, she's accepting our relationship.

938
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,570
對他們品頭論足的那些人
People that talk about them,

939
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,690
他們對此一知半解
they don't understand a lot of it.

940
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,920
他們認為  如果他倆去教堂
And they think that, if they go to church and everything,

941
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,520
上帝自會懲罰他們
that God will take care of it --

942
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,070
就像懲罰其他同性戀一樣
They can be just like all the rest of the guys.

943
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,870
所以你沒法說服他們
And so you can't get through to them.

944
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,840
說實話  那些話我都聽膩了
To tell you the truth, I'm tired of hearing about it --

945
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,090
他們的確不是羅密歐與茱麗葉
So they're not Romeo and Juliet.

946
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,440
沒錯  他們是羅密歐與羅密歐
That's right -- they're Romeo and Romeo.

947
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
多大事啊
Get over it.

948
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,290
我不喜歡在公共場合表露自己的情感
I did not like to show any public display of affection --

949
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,800
即便是坐在飛機上
Whether it would be us on a plane flying somewhere,

950
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,010
我們想親熱時
and we wanted to be affectionate,

951
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,780
會用大衣或是毯子遮住手臂
we would actually take a coat or a blanket and cover our arms,

952
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,420
然后在毯子下緊握雙手
and like hold hands under the blanket.

953
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,020
{\pos(190,237)}不要太明顯啦

954
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:07,160
我認為謝恩很在意他們所處的場合
I think that Shane was very conscious of where they were

955
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,390
不想讓別人感到不舒服
and not making other people uncomfortable.

956
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,300
我從不會當著朋友或其他人的面
I never really wanted to say, "I love you"

957
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,250
說"我愛你"
in front of friends or anyone.

958
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,490
所以我倆就發明了個小暗號
So we developed this little code --

959
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,540
無論在晚宴或是派對上
Whether we're at like a dinner or a party,

960
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,730
其中一人會設法敲三下桌子
one of us would find a way just to tap the table three times

961
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,560
以此代替"我愛你"
just to say, "I love you."

962
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,930
因此  這個聲音對我倆來說很特殊
So, that became a very special sound for both of us.

963
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,190
湯姆熱情洋溢
Tom was just so passionate,

964
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,930
他的滿腔愛意
and he was so affectionate

965
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,740
在一定程度上慢慢瓦解了謝恩的心理障礙
that it sort of brought Shane out of his shell a little bit,

966

不會因此而感到羞愧或難堪

972
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,490
有一次  我們在巴黎
Once, we were in Paris,

973
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,200
我們站在埃菲爾鐵塔前
and we were in front of the Eiffel Tower,

974
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,220
我突然想  "去他媽的"
I just decided like, "Screw it --

975
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,430
"我就要偷偷親他一下"  我真這么做了
I'm just gonna sneak in a kiss," and I did.

976
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,800
湯姆的表情像是在說  "剛才發生了什么"
Tom's face -- he was just like, "What just happened?"

977
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,620
他非常激動
He was so excited.

978
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,590
但親完之后我倆的第一個反應是
But then the first thing we did after the kiss,

979
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,530
"有被人看到嗎"  四處張望
we like looked around, like, "Did anyone see us?"

980
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,210
但我很高興這么做
But I'm so happy that I did that

981
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,670
因為他欣喜若狂
'cause he was just thrilled.

982
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,740
湯姆想和謝恩結婚
Tom wanted to marry Shane,

983
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,720
但他想要真正合法的婚姻
but he wanted it to be legal.

984
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,410
而不是所謂"原則上合法"的說辭
He wasn't gonna settle for a technicality,

985
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,520
或是"現在還算合法  但明天就說不準了"

but tomorrow it could not be."

00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,010
他是那種有擔當的男人
He was the kind of man that just stood up for things,

988
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,450
我覺得在他的內心深處
and I think part of it

989
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,780
他是想向家里所有人表態

"我是認真的  這就是我"
"I'm serious. This is me."

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,340
他買了個戒指作為我的圣誕禮物
He bought me a ring for Christmas,

993
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,310
我們曾約定不在對方身上花錢
and we had agreed to not spend any money on each other.

994
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,910
他對我說  "謝恩肯定會生我氣的"

1002
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,510
我曾幻想過他們結婚時的場景
I had the image of their wedding played out in my head.

1003
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,230
我知道這一天遲早會到來
I knew it was gonna happen someday.

1004
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,900
毋庸置疑的是
There was no question

1005
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,610
他們想要和對方共度余生
that they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together

1006
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,980
并組建家庭
and have a family.

1007
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,490
這正是他所渴求的
That was something he wanted so bad.

1008
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,120
他過去常說
He used to say,

1009
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,860
"我好想要個小湯姆跑來跑去"
"You know, I'd love to have a little Thomas running around."

1010
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,830
我在思考謝恩和湯姆的故事時
And I guess one of the saddest parts,

1011
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,800
我覺得最令人傷心的部分是
when I really think about Shane and Tom, is the fact that,

1012
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,820
他們基本上實現了"美國夢"
essentially, they were living the American dream,

1013
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,950
除了他們沒法結婚這條
with the exception of being able to get married to each other.

1014
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,970
當然很多人會提到"同居伴侶"這個概念
Well, everyone, like, brings up domestic partnership,

1015
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,410
這在某種程度上挺令我氣憤的
and it angers me in a way,

1016
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,740
因為任何小姑娘都不會坐在自己的房間里
because no little girl is sitting in her room

1017
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,570
幻想著說

1018
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,690
"我等不及想要個同居伴侶"
"I can't wait to have a domestic partnership.

1019
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,960
"我等不及在同居期間穿上婚紗"
"I can't wait to wear a white dress during my domestic partnership."

1020
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,980
這不是大家夢想中的事情

而他們卻沒法結婚
And they weren't allowed to do that.

1023
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,260
即使現在同性婚姻合法了
And if it is ever legal,

1024
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,540
他倆也無法步入婚姻殿堂
they'll never be able to experience it,

1025
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,010
因為他已經不在了

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,180
我說  "沒問題"
And I was like, "Okay."

1056
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,740
他說  "不  我想為你做些事情"
He was like, "No, I want to do something good for you.

1057
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,460
"我們去拍照吧  這會讓心情好起來的"
Let's do a photo shoot. It'll turn this day around."

1058
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,050
我剛開始跟一個男生約會
So, I had just started dating this man,

1059
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,880
那天是他的生日  可我沒去陪他
and it was his birthday, and I wasn't with him,

1060
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,360
湯姆說  "我就是想讓他吃醋"
so Tom was like, "I want to make him jealous,

1061
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,420
"我們把你的照片發到Facebook上去"
so let's put pictures of you on facebook."

1062
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,080
他一直在喊  "來拍嘛  來拍嘛"
And he was the one that was like, "Let's do it. Let's do it."

1063
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,230
"我可以給你做發型嗎"
"Hey, can I do your hair?"

1064
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,290
我說  "好吧"
I was like, "Um, okay."

1065
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,080
然后我往胸罩里塞滿了襪子
And I have, you know, my brassiere filled with socks,

1066
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,250
因為...  我并沒那么豐滿
'cause, you know, there's just not much there.

1067
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,920
{\an8}湯姆  我愛你勝過一切  真的

1068
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,040
湯姆一整天都在跟我發信息
So, Tom and I were texting throughout the day.

1069
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,070
{\an8}我愛你  謝恩

1070
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,330
我們最終和好了
And we eventually made up.

1071
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,980
我們根本沒討論去不去屋頂
It wasn't even a discussion whether or not to go to the roof,

1072
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,590
因為我們經常到屋頂上去
because we always went to the roof.

1073
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,910
我們在短信里說深愛著對方
And we told each other that we love each other.

1074
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,670
我很欣慰我們和好了
And I'm so thankful that we did,

1075
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:42,140
因為這已成了我永恒的回憶
'cause I have that forever now.

1076
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,300
我們去屋頂的時候
And so, by the time we get up to the roof,

1077
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,620
湯姆拿著他的照相機
Tom has his camera.

1078
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,360
他準備就緒了
He's all ready.

1079
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,610
我們差不多上去過50多次
We'd all been up there like 50 times,

1080
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,330
但每次我都很害怕
and every time, I'm just paranoid.

1081
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,360
因為護欄其實不高
'cause it's not like a tall wall.

1082
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,740
是很矮的那種
It's a short wall.

1083
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,950
他就拿著相機各種拍
He was just playing around with the camera,

1084
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,650
我知道他同時也在給謝恩發信息
and, meanwhile, I know that he had just been texting to Shane.

1085
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,620
{\an8}不要靠近邊緣

1086
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,160
我告訴他別跑到邊上去
I told him to stay away from the edge,

1087
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,080
{\an8}我可不是開玩笑  湯姆

1088
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,830
因為我們都知道他是個笨手笨腳的人
'cause we all know that he's a klutz.

1089
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,500
他回復我說
And he even wrote back.

1090
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,160
"哈哈  我不會的"  好像我在跟他開玩笑
He was like, "Ha-ha! I will" Like, I was joking.

1091
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,820
我說  "湯姆  我是認真的"
And I said, "Tom, I'm serious.

1092
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,350
"別跑到邊上去"
Like, stay away from the edge."

1093
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,660
他照了幾張照片
So, he takes a bunch of pictures.

1094
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,250
我盡量表現得風騷
I'm trying to be as slutty --

1095
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,400
不是性感  因為確實不性感
You know, not sexy, 'cause it wasn't sexy.

1096
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,020
我在屋頂的一個角落  然后我們換了位置
I'm in one corner, and then we suddenly switch.

1097
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,410
他說  "我拍到了  我拍到了"
And he's like, " I've got it! I've got it!"

1098
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,670
然后他往后退了三四步
So, he takes like three or four steps back.

1099
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:42,200
{\an1}{\pos(40.167,240)}湯姆為艾麗克斯拍的最后一張照片

1100
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,520
誰都想不到他會掉下去
I don't think it registered that he was gonna fall.

1101
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,610
他當時看起來像這樣  而我則是這樣
He was like, "Ha-ha!" And I was like, "Ohh."

1102
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,140
然后我看著他
You know, and I looked at him,

1103
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,900
當時的感覺就是  "天吶"
And it was like we both thought, "Oh, no.

1104
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,150
"謝恩會氣死的"
Shane's gonna be so mad."

1105
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,610
好像他知道了我們離邊緣這么近一樣
You know, just like if he knew that we were that close.

1106
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,200
之后  便是一場噩夢的開始
And then, after that, it was a nightmare.

1107
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,580
我甚至沒去邊上往下看
I didn't even go look over the edge.

1108
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,440
我把鞋子一扔  跑下樓去
I just, like, threw my shoes on, ran downstairs.

1109
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,110
我的手機在后兜里
I had my phone in my back pocket,

1110
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,770
我撥了911  但什么都聽不到
And I dialed 911, but I couldn't hear.

1111
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,300
所以我就把手機給了走廊里的人
So I just gave it to somebody out in the hallway,

1112
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,310
因為大家聽到他墜樓的動靜
'cause people heard him.

1113
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,960
我收到艾麗克斯的短信說湯姆掉下去了
I received a text from Alex to tell me that Tom had fallen.

1114
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,070
湯姆掉下去了

1115
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,170
我以為這是個玩笑  "這不可能是真的"
And I thought it was a joke -- "There's no way this is real."

1116
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,950
所以我回復她說  "這一點也不好笑"
So I texted her back, and I said, "That's not funny."

1117
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,620
湯姆掉下去了

1118
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,620
說真的  別亂開玩笑

1119
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,660
湯姆掉下去了

1120
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,660
說真的  別亂開玩笑

1121
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,710
之后我沒再收到她的回復
And then I didn't hear back from her.

1122
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,450
于是我打了湯姆的手機
And so then I called Tom's phone,

1123
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,530
但沒人接
and no one picked up.

1124
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,090
就在那時  我開始著急了
So at that moment is when my heart just started racing.

1125
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,450
我跑到樓下的時候  他趴在地上
By the time I got there, he's on, you know, his stomach.

1126
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,040
我撫摸著他的背
And I'm rubbing his back.

1127
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,320
我說  "沒事的  湯米  沒事的"
And I'm saying, "It's okay, Tommy. It's okay, Tommy."

1128
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,840
而我穿的像個妓女
Meanwhile, I look like a total hooker.

1129
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,920
救護車過了好久才到
But it takes forever for the ambulance to get there.

1130
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,650
差不多過了有25分鐘吧
I want to say 25 minutes later.

1131
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,350
他們問我  "你有他的身份證件嗎"
They were like, "Do you have his I.D.?

1132
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,320
"你有他的身份證件嗎"
Do you have his I.D.?"

1133
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,440
我說  "身份證有那么重要嗎"
And I was like, "What the fuck does it matter?!

1134
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,690
"趕緊把他抬上救護車呀"
Just get him on the ambulance!"

1135
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,750
我趕到急診室
So, I got to the E.R.,

1136
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,290
他們把我帶到艾麗克斯的房間
and they took me into a room where Alex was,

1137
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,100
她情緒很激動
and she was hysterical.

1138
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,790
我一看到謝恩
And when I first saw Shane,

1139
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,050
我說  "要是墜樓的是我就好了"
I said, "I wish it were me."

1140
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,950
我說  "因為你們擁有彼此"
I said, "Because you two have each other,

1141
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,020
"你倆愛得那么死去活來"
"and the love you have is so strong,

1142
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,130
"我真希望掉下去的是我"
I wish it had been me who fell over."

1143
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,470
我問她  "現在是什么狀況"
I asked her, you know, "Well, what's happening?

1144
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:34,110
"他們還在搶救嗎"  我完全不知情
are they working on him?" I didn't know anything.

1145
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,380
她也一無所知
And she didn't know anything.

1146
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,570
我們抱在一起  說愛著對方
We hugged, you know, and we said we loved each other.

1147
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,560
我仍抱有希望  覺得他會沒事的
And I was still hanging on to hope that he was okay.

1148
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,380
我試著給謝恩打電話
I tried calling Shane,

1149
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,010
但總聯系不上他
and I couldn't get through to him.

1150
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,650
后來  他終于給我回了電話
And, finally, he calls me back.

1151
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,820
他說  "媽  湯姆去拍照"
He said, "Mom, Tom was doing a photo shoot,

1152
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,800
"從屋頂上墜樓了"
and he fell off the roof."

1153
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,380
我說  "天吶"
And I just -- "Oh, my god."

1154
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,620
我說  "親愛的  要一直祈禱"
I said, "Honey, just keep on praying.

1155
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,220
"他會沒事的  咱們都會為他祈禱的" 
He'll be fine. You know, we'll get the prayers going here."

1156
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,990
我收到謝恩的短信說
I got a text message from Shane saying,

1157
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,760
"米凱拉  求你快祈禱  湯姆受傷了"
"Michaela, please pray -- Tom's hurt."

1158
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,260
我立刻跪在地上  開始祈禱
And I immediately got down and started praying.

1159
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,660
過了一會兒  他打給我
So, a little bit later, he calls me,

1160
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,260
他說  "媽  他們不讓我進去看他"
and he says, "Mom, they won't let me in to see him."

1161
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,750
我問  "怎么會這樣"
And I said, "Well, how come?"

1162
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,680
他們說  "因為我不是他的家屬"
And they said, "Because I'm not family."

1163
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,900
我說  "天吶  謝恩"
And I just -- "Oh, my God, Shane."

1164
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,190
于是我打給了湯姆的母親
So, I called Tom's mom.

1165
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,120
那時印第安納州已是深夜
And it's, you know, late at night in Indiana.

1166
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,330
她一開口便問道
And, you know, the first thing she says was,

1167
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,190
"他喝了多少酒  謝恩"
"Well, how much was he drinking, Shane?"

1168
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,710
我能聽到他爸在后面說
And then his dad, in the background, was saying,

1169
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,580
"他跑到屋頂上去做什么"
"Well, what the hell was he doing on the roof?"

1170
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,380
隨后  我就把電話給了
And I just, from that point forward, I made sure

1171
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,130
在場的醫護人員  讓他們說了情況
to let the nursing staff or the doctors speak to her and to him.

1172
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,990
等了差不多一小時之后
And it had been probably about an hour later,

1173
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,600
醫生來到我們的房間
the doctor came into the room,

1174
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,720
我立馬就知道了
and, like, I just, I knew.

1175
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,570
我知道他要說些什么
Like, I knew what he was gonna say.

1176
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,680
當他開始講話的時候
And when he was talking,

1177
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,890
我跟本什么都沒聽進去
like, it wasn't registering in my head.

1178
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,630
好像左耳進右耳出
Like, I wasn't processing what he said.

1179
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,400
他說他沒挺過來
He just said he didn't make it.

1180
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,490
真的非常...
And it was very, you know...

1181
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,070
我們都失聲痛哭
And we all just lost it.

1182
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:22,770
我必須離開那個房間  因為我真得聽不下去
I had to just leave the room because I couldn't hear it.

1183
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,570
艾麗克斯一直在哭  她不停地做這個動作
Alex was crying, and she was continually doing this --

1184
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,410
我想她受了很大的打擊
I think because she was just so traumatized.

1185
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,570
艾麗克斯的媽媽不停的說  "天吶"
And Alex's Mom was saying, "Oh, my god."

1186
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,960
"天吶"
"Oh, my god."

1187
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,680
或是  "他可憐的媽媽"
And sometimes she would say, "Oh, his mother."

1188
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,610
因為第二天就是母親節
'Cause Mother's Day was the next day.

1189
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,010
于是我走出房間
So, I went outside.

1190
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,050
給我媽打了電話
I called my mom, and...

1191
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,780
我說  "媽  他走了"
And I was like, "Mom, he died."

1192
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,750
她說  "我很遺憾  謝恩"
And, you know, she just said, "I'm so sorry, Shane.

1193
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,120
"真的很遺憾"
I'm so sorry."

1194
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,920
他一直在哭  我也在哭
And he was just crying, and I'm crying.

1195
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,010
但再一次  你卻在2400公里之外
And, you know, here you are, again, 1,500 miles away,

1196
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,530
無法陪著自己的孩子
and you can't be there for your child.

1197
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,610
我接到了他的電話
I got ahold of him,

1198
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,280
說湯姆在醫院里去世了
and Tom had just died in the hospital, and...

1199
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,880
我永遠不想再回憶這個時刻
I don't know. It's not a moment I want to ever go through again.

1200
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,510
沒有什么比這更痛苦
The worst pain I have ever felt in my heart.

1201
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,500
我的腦子一片空白
Like, I just sunk.

1202
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,670
我說  "你他媽開玩笑吧"
I just said, "Are you fucking kidding me?

1203
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,730
"真的嗎"  我說  "真的嗎  誰會這樣死掉"
Seriously?" I said, "Seriously, who dies like that?"

1204
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:30,220
我以為在他斷氣的瞬間
I figured Shane was probably there when he passed,

1205
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,710
謝恩會陪在他床邊  緊握他的手
by his bed, holding his hand.

1206
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,380
他卻說沒有
And he said no.

1207
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,410
于是我沖向護士站  我說
So, I went to the nurse's station, and I said,

1208
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,230
"我朋友的男朋友在這"
"You know, my friend's boyfriend is here.

1209
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,210
"他剛剛去世  能讓他們見最后一面嗎"
He just passed away. Can you take him back?"

1210
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:49,360
她卻說  "在他父母來這之前"
And she said, "We can't allow non-family members to see him

1211
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,900
"所有非親屬都不能見他"
until his parents arrive."

1212
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,210
于是我一直和護士爭論
So I kept trying to argue with this nurse.

1213
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,120
那位女士說  "親愛的  我理解你的心情"
And the lady was like, "I understand, honey, I do.

1214
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,040
"但這有違醫院規定"
But it's against the hospital rules.

1215
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,180
"他不是他的家屬"  我說  "他就是他的家屬"
He's not his family." I said, "But he is his family.

1216
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,630
"他們擁有一棟房子  擁有共同的事業"
They have a house together. They have a business together.

1217
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,810
"他們還有一條狗"
They have a dog together.

1218
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,690
"他們在一起六年了"
They've been together for six years."

1219
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,810
最后  我們坐在一個房間里
Finally, we were sitting a the room,

1220
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,200
一位護士打開房門
and this one nurse opened the door,

1221
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,510
她問  "謝恩在這嗎"
and she said, "Is Shane in here?"

1222
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,070
于是我們走出房間
And so we went outside,

1223
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,060
她拿著湯姆的駕駛證
and she was holding Tom's license,

1224
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,050
她說  "天吶  他真是個帥小伙"
And she said, "Man, he was a good-looking guy. Geez.

1225
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,720
"所有護士都在談論他是多么的帥氣"
And all the nurses back here are talking about how handsome he was,

1226
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,620
"我們剛才在努力讓他恢復..."
and we've been working back here to try to kind of...

1227
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,570
"恢復成你記憶中的樣子"
make him look the way that you remember him.

1228
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,720
"跟我來  我們帶你去見他"
Come with me. We're gonna take you back."

1229
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,910
我想  護士們最終弄明白了
I think, at the end of the day, the nurses knew,

1230
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,820
無論是同性戀
you know, it's not a gay thing.

1231
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,010
還是異性戀
It's not a straight thing.

1232
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,560
不變的是愛情
It's a human thing.

1233
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,760
但那些護士給謝恩的
But it was definitely a gift, I think,

1234
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,430
絕對是上天的恩賜
that those women gave to Shane.

1235
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,600
于是我們來到了他病房
So, they walked back to his room.

1236
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,010
他渾身插滿了管子
There was tubes all over his body,

1237
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,890
管子直接插進他的胸部
tubes coming out of his chest.

1238
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,630
他的臉被蓋了起來  但你仍能看到
His face was covered, but you could see that

1239
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,190
他的臉上滿是血跡
there, you know, had been blood, like, all around his face.

1240
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:10,250
我感覺這不是真的
And it didn't really seem like this was happening.

1241
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,060
我在旁邊站了一會兒
I just stood there for a while.

1242
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,040
不知道該做什么
I didn't know what to do.

1243
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,180
他全身上下我唯一能碰的地方
But the only place that I could put my hand

1244
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,850
就是他的腿
was like on his leg.

1245
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,770
于是最后一次  我在他腿上敲了三下
And I did, you know, one final "Tap, tap, tap."

1246
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:43,370

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,090
昨晚在洛斯費利茲區
A man fell to his death

1262
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,410
{\pos(107.113,151.881)}意外墜亡

1263
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,700
一名男士從四層高的公寓上
from a four-story apartment building

1264
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,790
意外墜亡
in Los Feliz last night.

1265
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,830
警方稱他當時在為一名女士拍照
Police say he was taking pictures of a woman.

1266
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,230
警方排除了他殺可能
They don't suspect foul play,

1267
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,710
稱之為令人心痛的意外
and are calling his death a tragic accident.

1268
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,020
死者是一名演員兼電視主持人
He was an actor and TV host.

1269
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,420
我想不起湯姆去世后的那段日子是怎么過的
The days after Tom passed away are kind of a blur.

1270
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,900
我只想讓家人
There was nothing I wanted more

1271
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,500
陪在我身邊
than just to have my family there with me.

1272
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,370
盡管我的父母離婚了
And so it really meant a lot

1273
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,390
但他們還是說
that my parents, although they're divorced,

1274
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,390
"我們都會來陪你的"
that they were able to just say,

1275
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,300
這對我意義重大
"Look, like, we're gonna be there for you."

1276
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,860
我的姐妹們也說要來
And my sisters were going to, as well.

1277
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,500
我和我爸從艾麗克斯家里開回了湯姆的車
My dad and I, we went to go pick up Tom's car at Alex's place.

1278
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,210
在回家的路上
And during the car ride home,

1279
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,930
我們第一次討論了我是同性戀這件事
we talked about me being gay for the first time.

1280
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,600
我想讓他知道
I wanted him to know,

1281
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,230
盡管他出柜后我什么也沒說
even though I had never said anything since he'd come out,

1282
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,820
但我全心全意地接受他
that I fully accepted him.

1283
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,240
我們甚至討論了湯姆爸爸的感受
I think we even talked about how Tom's dad must feel,

1284
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,870
因為湯姆的爸爸從未接受過湯姆
because Tom's dad never accepted Tom,

1285
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,140
我想讓我兒子明白  我接受他
and I wanted it be known that I accepted my son.

1286
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,310
這是有史以來第一次
For the first time ever,

1287
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,120
我不介意告訴爸爸我是同性戀
I didn't care about telling my dad that I was gay.

1288
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,090
我不介意向他坦白
I didn't care about acknowledging

1289
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,010
我和湯姆在一起了
that Tom and I were in a relationship.

1290
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,900
我感到無所畏懼
I just felt, like, fearless.

1291
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,300
但這一切都沒有意義了
But it didn't matter anymore.

1292
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,540
湯姆已經走了
And Tom was gone.

1293
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,290
我去機場接了瑪莎
So, I picked Martha up from the airport,

1294
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,270
我們回到了家里
and we went to our house.

1295
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,580
她想談談銀行賬戶
She wanted to talk about bank accounts --

1296
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,600
所有那些我不想提及的事
All these things that I did not want to talk about.

1297
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,630
我記得她一直四處打量房間
I remember her looking around the rooms a lot.

1298
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,980
我也不愿那樣去想
And I didn't really want to think that way.

1299
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,720
但我覺得她只想翻看他的東西
I had the feeling that she just wanted to go through his stuff.

1300
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,980
她想翻弄謝恩和湯姆的所有衣物
She wanted to go through all of Shane and Tom's clothes.

1301
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,960
他讓她翻遍了所有抽屜
He let her go through all the drawers.

1302
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,950
她甚至想帶走謝恩和湯姆共用的電腦
She tried to take the computers that were Shane and Tom's.

1303
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,180
就好像謝恩不存在一樣
It was just like Shane didn't exist anymore.

1304
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,880
謝恩一直很配合她
Shane was more than willing to work with her,

1305
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,570
把她想要的湯姆的東西都給了她
give her anything she wanted of Tom's,

1306
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,530
但這侵犯了他的隱私
but it started to invade his privacy,

1307
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,080
而他對此毫不抱怨
and he wouldn't say anything.

1308
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,160
瑪莎會就一些東西說三道四
Martha would make a comment about something,

1309
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,560
而謝恩則收起了一切感情
and Shane would just stuff the emotions away,

1310
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,750
就像小時候孩子們給他起外號時一樣
like back when kids would call him names.

1311
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,520
我無權說任何話
I couldn't say anything, anyway.

1312
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,700
我無權阻止她
I had no legal right to stop her.

1313
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,010
湯姆的媽媽和我們一起
So, Tom's mom was waiting, along with us,

1314
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,040
等著驗尸官移交他的遺體
for the coroner to release his body.

1315
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,600
介于這次意外的情況
Due to the circumstances of the accident,

1316
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,760
他的遺體必須進行尸檢
they had to do an autopsy.

1317
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,540
我們開始討論起葬禮的事
We started talking about the funeral.

1318
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,680
她說  不  我們都會被邀請參加
And she said that, no, we're all invited.

1319
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,590
我們可以住在他們家
We could stay at their house.

1320
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,090
作為家屬出席葬禮
You know, "Come as a family.

1321
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,360
我們會一起舉行葬禮
We'll just do all this together."

1322
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,210
她一直在說  "我要帶我的寶貝回家"
She was very, you know, "I'm taking my baby home.

1323
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,710
"你們都要來  我希望你們出席"
You guys are all coming with. I want you to be there."

1324
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,050
然而隨著一天天的等待
And then, as the days go on,

1325
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,340
她不再談論葬禮的事
she pretty much quit talking about the funeral

1326
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,530
不再提我們出席葬禮
and about us all going

1327
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,060
與東部家鄉的親人一起悼念湯姆的事
and sharing Tom with everybody back east.

1328
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,850
湯姆的母親待在另一個房間
Tom's mom was in the other room or even sometimes

1329
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,420
甚至有時就坐在我旁邊策劃葬禮
right next to me making the funeral arrangements

1330
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,760
卻不讓我參與其中
and planning it all out, and I was not a part of it.

1331
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,650
好像我是空氣  是幽靈
It was like I wasn't there. It was like I was a ghost.

1332
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,310
她是一位剛剛失去兒子的母親
She was a mother who'd just lost her son --

1333
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,060
她那20多歲的兒子
her 20-something-year-old son --

1334
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,250
除了悲傷  你不能指望她有其他的情緒
So there were no expectations other than grief.

1335
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,020
但我沒想到她會傷害謝恩
But I didn't think that she was gonna hurt Shane.

1336
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,470
我以為她愛謝恩
I thought that she loved Shane.

1337
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,770
我覺得肯定有什么不對勁
The feeling I got was something was awry,

1338
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,500
但沒人會指責她
but nobody could put their finger on it.

1339
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,090
然后到了周四早上
And then, that Thursday morning,

1340
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,220
瑪莎突然說  "我要離開了"
Martha was like, "I got to go."

1341
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,820
謝恩說  "我開車送你去機場"
And Shane's like, "I'll drive you to the airport."

1342
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,170
她說  "不  我坐出租車"
She's like, "No, I'll get a taxi."

1343
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,740
我告訴她  "我不會讓你坐出租車的"
I told her, "I'm not gonna let you take a taxi."

1344
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,480
我有一種預感
I kind of had a feeling

1345
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,110
她知道一些我不知道的事情
that she knew something that I didn't know,

1346
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,210
她知道湯姆的遺體隨時可以移交
that she knew that his body was gonna be released any moment.

1347
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,000
她打包了湯姆的所有衣物
She was packing all Tom's clothes up

1348
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,420
好讓其陪著他長眠于地下
that she was gonna bury him in,

1349
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,380
而她準備給他遺體穿上的夾克
and the jacket that she wanted to put him in

1350
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,600
則沒有放進行李箱
was not fitting in the suitcase.

1351
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,190
謝恩說  "沒關系  瑪莎"
And Shane's like, "It's okay, Martha.

1352
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,220
"我到時候帶過去"  但她卻說  "不"
I'll just bring it." And she was like, "No.

1353
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,630
"絕對不行"
Absolutely not."

1354
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,760
現在回過頭看
So, maybe looking back now,

1355
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,860
那可能就是要發生的事件的征兆
it could have been foreshadowing what could have happened,

1356
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,020
她那時候就知道
that she knew then

1357
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,820
她不會讓謝恩參加葬禮
that she wasn't gonna let Shane come to the funeral.

1358
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,070
我把她送到目的地  擁抱了她
And I dropped her off, and we hugged.

1359
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:16,140
請求她有什么情況及時通知我
And I asked her to please keep me updated

1360
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,240
以便我知曉那邊的情況
so I know what's happening,

1361
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,340
她答應我會那樣做
and she promised me that she would.

1362
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,660
但是我再也沒有聽到她的消息
But I never heard from her again.

1363
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,130
她很感激我們為她兒子做的一切
She was so grateful and so loving towards us

1364
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:27,920
她對我們十分友善
for everything that we did for her son.

1365
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,130
她一直哭  擁抱我們  拉著我們的手
She just was crying and hugging us and holding on to us

1366
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,400
說什么"我希望成為你們生活的一部分"
and, "I want to be a part of your life.

1367
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,020
"我想常來拜訪"
I want to come visit."

1368
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,230
感覺我們和她建立了感情
It was like we were bonded with her.

1369
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,510
到了第二天  她就不見了
And then, the next day, she was gone.

1370
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,110
湯姆去世的第二天  我跟他媽媽通過話
I talked to Tom's mom the day after he died.

1371
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,550
她說  "一旦葬禮定好時間"
And she said, "I'll let you know

1372
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,920
"我會及時通知你"
as soon as I know when the funeral is gonna be

1373
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,720
"好讓你能夠出席"
so that you can be there."

1374
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,200
之后就什么動靜也沒有了
Then, it was pretty much radio silence.

1375
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,720
他們沒回電告訴我葬禮什么時候舉行
They never called me back to tell me when it was,

1376
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,130
我很受傷
and I was very hurt.

1377
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,900
我看到了報紙上的告示
I see the notice in the newspaper --

1378
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:02,060
{\an8}他去世后留下了父母諾曼和瑪莎  姐姐金和哥哥大衛
可通過殯儀館向此家庭捐贈

1379
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,200
守靈是當天  葬禮是第二天
Wake is this day. Funeral is the next day.

1380
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:02,390
我給湯姆家打電話確認
I called Tom's house to verify,

1381
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,920
接電話的親戚說
and, you know, the relative who answered just said,

1382
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,950
"如果報紙上這么說"
"If that's what the paper says,

1383
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,570
"那應該沒錯"
then I would probably go by that."

1384
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,100
之后我親自給
And I personally called back

1385
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,060
他家鄉不同的太平間打電話
to different mortuaries in his hometown

1386
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,580
試圖確認這一消息
to try to get information,

1387
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,960
可沒人愿意告訴我們
and nobody would give us any information.

1388
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,730
盡管我們再沒聽到瑪莎的回音
So, although I never heard from Martha,

1389
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,720
我媽媽  艾麗克斯和我還是訂了機票
my mom and Alex and I, we all booked our plane tickets.

1390
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,370
在中途停留時
During our layover,

1391
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:28,290
我接到了湯姆親戚打來的電話
I received a phone call from one of Tom's relatives.

1392
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,390
她告訴我
And she wanted to let me know

1393
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,820
湯姆的葬禮不歡迎我
that I wasn't welcome to attend his funeral,

1394
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,490
如果我出席
because, if I do show up,

1395
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,690
湯姆的叔叔和父親將對我進行人身攻擊
his uncle and his father had planned an attack.

1396
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,370
她想讓我知道
and she wanted me to know

1397
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:44,220
為了我的人身安全  我不應該出席
that it's for my own safety that I don't go.

1398
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,660
我就想  "難道他們要對他開槍嗎"
All I could think of -- "Are they gonna shoot him?

1399
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,230
"他們要殺了我的兒子嗎"
Are they gonna kill my son?"

1400
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,670
當我們到了印第安納州
When we got into Indiana,

1401
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,720
湯姆的好友來接我們
one of Tom's best friends picked us up.

1402
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,610
艾麗克斯的情緒有些激動
And Alex was hysterical.

1403
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,210
離諾克斯市越近  她越抓狂
And the closer we got to Knox, the more hysterical she got.

1404
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:02,330
她一直說"我已經失去了湯姆  我不想再失去你"
And she was saying, "I lost tom. I don't want to lose you, also."

1405
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,590
我害怕
I was terrified

1406
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:07,270
他們會對謝恩開槍
that they were gonna come and pull out a gun on Shane.

1407
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,290
我記得他[謝恩]說過不止一次
I remember him saying more than once,

1408
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,140
"他們很傷心"
"You know, they're in a lot of pain.

1409
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,190
"傷心難過的不只是我"
It's not just me that's going through this,"

1410
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,800
幾乎是在為他們辯解  有點讓人受不了
and almost arguing for them, which was maddening.

1411
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,380
我是說換了我  我會很生氣
I mean, I'd be angry --

1412
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,490
會說些"你們不能這樣對我"之類的話
"You're not gonna do this to me."

1413
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:24,340
但他沒有  他沒有如此回應
Nope. He didn't respond that way.

1414
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,080
我們找了個秘密地點  商量出了對策
We had a secret location to come up with a plan about,

1415
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,000
那就是不去打擾他們
you know, just kind of staying out of their way.

1416
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,460
盡管我不能去教堂
And even though I couldn't be in the church,

1417
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,210
我還是希望能盡可能的接近湯姆
Like, I still wanted to be as close as I could to Tom.

1418
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,340
離他近一點  也算是一種寬慰
You know, just being near was somehow comforting.

1419
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,450
當我知道
Once I realized

1420
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,350
謝恩被拒絕參加葬禮
that Shane had been banned from attending the funeral,

1421
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,420
我便意識到
I realized that's why

1422
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,680
他們為何會對具體情況只字不提
they weren't telling anybody when things were.

1423
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,840
他們不想讓任何消息走漏出去
They basically were keeping all the information close-hold

1424
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,510
以阻止謝恩出席
so that Shane couldn't get there.

當我起身走到瑪莎身邊時
When I got up to Martha,

1440
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,520
我腦中所想就是
all I could think in my head was,

1441
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,460
"為了謝恩  我得親吻棺材"
"I have to kiss the casket for Shane."

1442
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,300
我走到棺材旁邊  親吻了它
And I made my way over to the casket, and I kissed it,

1443
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,030
低聲說道"謝恩愛你"
and I whispered, you know, "Shane loves you."

1444
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,040
葬禮上描述的湯姆
The funeral depicted Tom

1445
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,450
基本上剔除了他去加州后的人生
up until the point where he left for California, basically.

1446
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:56,470
發言人都是些湯姆童年時代的人
And the speakers were all from Tom's childhood.

1447
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,020
他的鋼琴老師
You know, it was his piano teacher

1448
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,210
以及柯爾沃的人
and people from Culver.

1449
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:03,900
我從2000級送的花束中拿走了幾支花
I took the flowers from the bouquet that the class of 2000 sent,

1450
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,360
將其風干  以便我能送給謝恩
and I dried them so I could give those to Shane.

1451
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,770
我給他留了份葬禮流程單
And I saved him a program

1452
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,590
因為他是湯姆此身的摯愛
because, you know, he is the love of Tom's life.

1453
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,330
他值得擁有這些東西
He at least deserves that.

1454
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,690
不幸的是  其中并有沒提及他
Unfortunately, he wasn't mentioned in it.

1455
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,480
做了將近30年的親人
Families, for literally 30 years,

1456
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,630
可以藏匿秘密  直到有人死去
can sweep that secret under the rug until someone dies,

1457
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,950
你只得面對現實
and then you have to really face the music.

1458
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,620
我認為湯姆的父母就是這樣
And I think that's what happened to Tom's parents.

1459
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,770
他們有個很棒的孩子
They had this great child.

1460
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:33,890
他聰明  有才華  有很多正能量
He was smart and talented -- lots of positive things.

1461
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,600
但有一個積極的方面
But the one positive thing

1462
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,070
他們不愿向親友吹捧的是
that they didn't want to brag to their friends about

1463
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,560
湯姆有個出色的伴侶
is that Tom had an amazing partner,

1464
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,190
他們因此感到羞恥
'cause they were ashamed.

1465
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,310
所以他們所做的是
And so what they did

1466
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,490
將其從歷史中抹去
is they literally erased it from the history books

1467
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,480
該內容現在無法顯示

1468
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,460
比如關閉他的Facebook賬戶
by shutting down his facebook page,

1469
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,130
拒絕讓謝恩出席葬禮
by disinviting Shane to the funeral,

1470
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,500
甚至在葬禮上對謝恩只字不提
to not even mentioning him there,

1471
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,620

01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,600
他們不是反對有一個同性戀兒子
They're not fighting against having a gay son.

1475
