{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And, anyway, that'show I got my name... Forrest Gump.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Since it was just me and Mama

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and we had all these empty rooms,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}to learn how to retread tires.

96
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We're talking about five little points here.

97
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}There must be something can be done.

98
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We're a progressive school system.

99
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We don't want to see anybody left behind.

100
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

101
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He's on vacation.

102
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son.

103
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You don't say much, do you?

104
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Finally, he had to try.

105
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It looked easy, but...

106
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}oh, what happened. First they...

107

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mama, what's vacation mean?

108
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Vacation?

109
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Where Daddy went?

110
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Vacation's when you go somewhere...

111
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and you don't ever come back.

112
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Anyway, I guess you could say

113
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}me and Mama was on our own.

114
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But we didn't mind.

115
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Our house was never empty.

116
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}There was always folks coming and going.

117
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Supper!

118

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's supper, everyone!

119
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That sure looks special.

120
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sometimes, we had so many people staying with us

121
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that every room was filled, with travelers, you know,

122
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}folks living out of their suitcases

123
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and hat cases and sample cases.

124
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?

125
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}One time, a young man was staying with us,

126
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and he had him a guitar case.

127
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit

128
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And you ain't no

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I told you not to bother this nice young man.

132
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}No, that's all right, ma'am.

133
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar.

134
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}All right. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat.

135
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am.

136
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you did there.

137
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Slow it down some.

138
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You ain't nothing but...

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I liked that guitar.

140
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It sounded good.

141
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I started moving around to the music,

142
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}swinging my hips.

143
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Cryin' all the time

144
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}This one night,

145
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,990

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and guess what?

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You ain't nothin' but a hound dog

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}This is not for children's eyes.

152
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Cryin' all the time

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Some years later,

154
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that handsome young man who they called the King,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}well, he sung too many songs.

156

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Had him self a heart attack or something.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It must be hard being a king.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but some things you can't.

160
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You do your very best now, Forrest.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I remember the bus ride on the first day of school

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}This is the bus to school.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You can't sit here.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Because I don 't remember being born.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}when I went on my first outdoor picnic,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I do remember

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}the first time I heard the sweetest voice

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}in the wide world.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}My legs are just fine and dandy.

188
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I just sat next to her on that bus

189
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and had a conversation all the way to school.

190
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}My back's crooked like a question mark.

191
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Next to Mama, no one ever talked to me

192
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}or asked me questions.

193
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Are you stupid or something?

194
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

195
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm Jenny.

196
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.

197
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}From that day on, we was always together.

198
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.

199
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She taught me how to climb.

200
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Move, Forrest, you can do it.

201
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I showed her how to dangle.

202
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}"A good little..."

203
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She helped me learn how to read,

204
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I showed her how to swing.

205
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sometimes, we'd just sitout

206
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and wait for the stars.

207
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mama's going to worry about me.

208
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Just stay a little longer.

209
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}For some reason, Jenny didn 't never want to go home.

210
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Ok, Jenny, I'll stay.

211
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She was my most special friend.

212
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}My only friend.

213

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, my mama always told me

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that miracles happen every day

215
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Some people don't think so,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but they do.

217
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hey, dummy!

218

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Are you dumb, or just plain stupid?

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Run!

232

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, you wouldn't believe if I told you...

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I could run like the wind blows.

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}From that day on,

235
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}if I was going somewhere,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I was running.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That boy sure is a running fool.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, remember how I told you

239
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that Jenny never seemed to want to go home?

240

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.

241
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Her mama had gone to heaven when she was 5,

242
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.

243
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny?

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He was a very loving man.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And then this one time,

247
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

248
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?

249
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.

250
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny!

251
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Come on!

252
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny, where'd you run to?

253
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You better get back here, girl!

254

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Where you at?

255
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny!

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny, where you at?

257
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny!

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Pray with me, Forrest.

259
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Pray with me.

260
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny!

261

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,

262
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}far, far away from here.

263
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far.

264
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mama always said God is mysterious.

265
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny!

266
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He didn 't turn Jenny in to a bird that day.

267
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Instead...

268
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}he had the police say

269
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.

270
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She was to live with her grandma,

271
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}just over on Creekmore Avenue,

272
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.

273
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Some nights,

274
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny'd sneak out

275
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and come on over to my house,

276
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}just'cause she said she was scared.

277
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Scared of what, I don 't know.

278
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But I think it was her grandma's dog.

279
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He was a mean dog.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}had carried out his symbolic threat

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Because these National Guardsmen

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that is so evident today...

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}A few years later,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that angry little man at the school house door

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But somebody thought that it wasn't.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But he didn't die.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I remember when that happened,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}when Wallace got shot.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I was in college.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}or a girls' and boys' together college?

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It was coed.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It was a college just for girls.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Why did this happen?

935
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,910

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}because I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}there's some things you just can't change.

1394
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He didn't want to be called crippled

1395
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1396
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Happy new year, Gump.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}The U.S. Ping-Pong team

1399
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Wouldn't you know it?

1400
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}A few months later,

1401
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}they invited me and the Ping-Pong team

1402
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,720

1403
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:05,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I went...

1404
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}again.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And I met the president of the United States again.

1406
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Only this time, they didn't get us rooms

1407
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}in a real fancy hotel.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}where are you staying?

1411
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

1412
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

1413
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's brand-new. Very modern.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'll have my people take care of it.

1415
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Security.

1417
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:34,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}you might want to send a maintenance man

1418
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}over to that office across the way.

1419
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}The lights are off

1420

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and they must be looking for a fuse box,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}'cause them flashlights, they're keeping me awake.

1422
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:46,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}O.K., sir. I'll check it out.

1423
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Thank you. Good night.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Therefore...

1425
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I shall resign the presidency

1429
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,350

1430
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Forrest Gump.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yes, sir!

1432
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:19,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}As you were.

1433
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:21,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I have your discharge papers.

1434
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Service is up, son.

1435
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Does this mean I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1436
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}For the army, it does.

1437
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And just like that,

1438
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:38,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}my service in the United States Army was over.

1439
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:45,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I went home.

1440
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm home, Mama.

1441
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I know. I know.

1442
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Louise, he's here.

1443
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, when I got home, I had no idea,

1444
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:19,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but Mama had all sorts of visitors.

1445
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We've had all sorts of visitors.

1446
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:24,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Everybody wants you to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1447
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}One man even left a check for $25,000

1448
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}if you'd be agree able to saying you like using their paddle.

1449
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I only like using my own paddle.

1450
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hi, Miss Louise.

1451
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:36,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hey, Forrest.

1452
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:39,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I know that, but it's $25,000, Forrest.

1453
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,

1454
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:45,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}see if it grows on you.

1455
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That Mama, she sure was right.

1456
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's funny how things work out.

1457
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:52,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I didn't stay home for long

1458
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}because I'd made apromise to Bubba,

1459
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I always try to keep my promise,

1460
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}so I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1461
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}to meet Bubba's family.

1462
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:05,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Are you crazy or just plain stupid?

1463
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1464
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I guess.

1465
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And, of course,

1466
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:14,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1467
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

1468
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I remember everything you said,

1469
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:26,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I got it all figured out.

1470
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:35,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm taking $24,562.47

1471
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that I got, that's left

1472
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:39,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}after a new hair cut and a new suit

1473
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,

1474
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers.

1475
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:47,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Tell me something.

1476
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Are you stupid or something?

1477
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:53,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1478
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That's what's left after me saying,

1479
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}"When I was in China on the all-America Ping-Pong team,

1480
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}"I just loved playing Ping-Pong

1481
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}with my Flex-O-Lite Ping-Pong paddle,"

1482
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}which everybody knows isn't true,

1483
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:08,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but Mama said it was just a little white lie,

1484
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}so it wasn't hurting nobody.

1485
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:13,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So anyway, I'm putting all that

1486
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}on gas, ropes, and new nets

1487
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:18,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1488
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now Bubba told me everything he knew about shrimping,

1489
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:46,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but you know what I found out?

1490
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:49,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Shrimping is tough.

1491
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I only caught five.

1492
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:57,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}A couple more, you can have yourself a cocktail.

1493
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?

1494
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.

1495
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'd never named a boat before,

1496
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but there was only one I could think of,

1497
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:17,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}the most beautiful name in the wide world.

1498
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Do a little dance

1499
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:24,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Make a little love

1500
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Get down tonight

1501
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Get down tonight

1502
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:31,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Do a little dance

1503
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Make a little love

1504
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:34,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Get down tonight

1505
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:37,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Get down tonight...

1506
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny

1507
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}in a long while,

1508
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I thought about her a lot.

1509
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:46,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I hoped whatever she was doing made her happy.

1510
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:51,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Oh, and the bird you cannot change

1511
01:29:55,210 --> 01:30:01,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And this bird you cannot change

1512
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:09,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Lord knows I can't change

1513
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:16,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Lord, help me, I can't change

1514
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:36,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I thought about Jenny all the time.

1515
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:29,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1516
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:33,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1517
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:36,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

1518
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yes, I know that.

1519
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1520
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.

1521
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:47,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I had to see this for myself...

1522
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and...

1523
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:54,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain,

1524
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that I'd be your first mate.

1525
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, here I am.

1526
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm a man of my word.

1527
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:01,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}O.K.

1528
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But don't you be thinking

1529
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1530
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}No, sir.

1531
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's my boat.

1532
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:24,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I have a feeling if we head due east,

1533
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:28,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}we'll find some shrimp, so take a left.

1534
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Take a left!

1535
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Which way?

1536
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:33,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Over there!

1537
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}They're over there!

1538
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:38,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Get on the wheel and take a left.

1539
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}O.K.

1540
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:42,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Gump, what are you doing?

1541
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Take a left!

1542
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Left!

1543
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:51,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!

1544
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:54,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That's where we'll find them.

1545
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:08,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

1546
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}O.K., so I was wrong.

1547
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, how are we going to find them?

1548
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:17,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Maybe you should just pray for shrimp.

1549
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So pray that

1550
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:23,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm homeward bound...

1551
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I went to church every Sunday.

1552
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1553
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:33,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}though I think he left the praying up to me.

1554
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}No shrimp.

1555
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Where the hell's this God of yours?

1556
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that

1557
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:59,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}'cause right then God showed up.

1558
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You'll never sink this boat!

1559
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, me, I was scared,

1560
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:24,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1561
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:25,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Come on!

1562
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You call this a storm?

1563
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Come on, you son of a bitch!

1564
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:38,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's time for a show down!

1565
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You and me!

1566
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm right here! Come and get me!

1567
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You'll never sink...

1568
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:48,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}this...

1569
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:49,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}boat!

1570
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,

1571
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}destroying nearly everything in its path.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And as in other towns up and down the coast,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and has been left in utter ruin.

1576
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}This reporter has learned,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}After that, shrimping was easy.

1581
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:21,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}There will be great bounty

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Oh, my God...

1583
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Since people still needed them shrimps

01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:28,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and we were the only boat left standing,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We got a whole bunch of boats.

1588
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}12 Jennys, big old warehouse.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that say "Bubba Gump" on them.

1591
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Bubba Gump Shrimp.

1592

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's a household name.

1593
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:48,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hold on there, boy.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Are you telling me you're the owner

1595
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:52,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1596

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.

1597
01:36:55,990 --> 01:36:58,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We were sitting next to a millionaire.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}with such enthusiasm.

1603
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:25,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I never thanked you for saving my life.

1609

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He never actually said so,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I think he made his peace with God.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}For the second time in 17 days,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He is indisposed at the moment.

1618
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}His mama's sick.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}What's the matter, Mama?

1626
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm dying, Forrest.

1627
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:50,290

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's my time.

1630
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's just my time.

1631
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Oh, now...

1632
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:17,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}don't you be afraid, sweet heart.

1633
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:20,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Death is just a part of life.

1634
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Something we're all destined to do.

1635
01:40:24,770 --> 01:40:27,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I didn't know it,

1636
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:30,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I was destined to be your mama.

1637
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:32,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I did the best I could.

1638
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You did good.

1639
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well... I happen to believe you make your own destiny.

1640
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You have to do the best with what God gave you.

1641
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}What's my destiny, Mama?

1642
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:56,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.

1643
01:40:57,810 --> 01:41:00,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1644
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You never know what you're going to get.

1645
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:06,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mama always hada way of explaining things

1646
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}so I could understand them.

1647
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I will miss you, Forrest.

1648
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:14,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She had got the cancer

1649
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and died on a Tuesday.

1650
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I bought her a new hat

1651
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}with little flowers on it.

1652
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And that's all I have to say about that.

1653
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Didn't you say you were waiting for the number 7 bus?

1654
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}There'll be another one along shortly.

1655
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:47,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, because I had been a football star and war hero

1656
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:50,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain

1657
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and a college graduate,

1658
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1659
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:57,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}decided to get together and offered me a fine job.

1660
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:02,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1661
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:05,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.

1662
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:08,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.

1663
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So then I got a call from him

1664
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}saying we don't have to worry about money no more,

1665
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:17,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I said, "That's good. One less thing."

1666
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I've got a new hope...

1667
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now Mama said there's only so much fortune

1668
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}a man really needs,

1669
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:27,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and the rest is just for showing off.

1670
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I gave a whole bunch of it

1671
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}to the Four square Gospel Church...

1672
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:38,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...

1673
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and even though Bubba was dead

1674
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:46,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1675
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1676
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You know what?

1677
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:57,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.

1678
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That smells wonderful.

1679
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And 'cause I was a gozillionaire

1680
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:06,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I liked doing it so much,

1681
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:09,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I cut that grass for free.

1682
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:14,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But at night time when there was nothing to do

1683
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and the house was all empty,

1684
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:19,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'd always think of Jenny.

1685
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:27,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And then... she was there.

1686
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hello, Forrest.

1687
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:03,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Hello, Jenny.

1688
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1689
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Maybe it was because she had no where else to go,

1690
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:25,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}or maybe it was because she was so tired

1691
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:29,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}'cause she went to bed and slept and slept

1692
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:31,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}like she hadn't slept in years.

1693
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:34,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It was wonderful having her home.

1694
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:36,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Every day we'd take a walk,

1695
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:40,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1696
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging and shrimping

1697
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:46,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and Mama making a trip up to heaven.

1698
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I did all the talking.

1699
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1700
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:33,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}How could you do this?

1701
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:15,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.

1702
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:19,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I never really knew why she came back,

1703
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I didn't care.

1704
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:23,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It was like olden times.

1705
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:26,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}We was like peas and carrots again.

1706
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:30,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers

1707
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and put them in her room for her,

1708
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get

1709
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}in the wide world.

1710
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}They're made just for running.

1711
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Carry me home to see my kin

1712
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:48,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And she even showed me how to dance.

1713
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:52,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I miss ol'Bammy once again

1714
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:53,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And I think it's a sin

1715
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:56,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sweet home Alabama...

1716
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:01,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Well, we was like family, Jenny and me...

1717
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:07,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and it was the happiest time in my life.

1718
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:33,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You done watching it?

1719
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm going to bed.

1720
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:48,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Will you marry me?

1721
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1722
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:01,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You would, Forrest.

1723
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:05,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}But you won't marry me.

1724
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:10,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}You don't want to marry me.

1725
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1726
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:23,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm not a smart man,

1727
01:49:23,370 --> 01:49:27,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but I know what love is.

1728
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Jenny.

1729
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:10,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Forrest, I do love you.

1730
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:06,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Where are you running off to?

1731
01:51:06,090 --> 01:51:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm not running.

1732
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}That day,

1733
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}for no particular reason,

1734
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:44,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I decided to go for a little run.

1735
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:48,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I ran to the end of the road,

1736
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:51,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.

1737
01:52:51,630 --> 01:52:54,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion...

1738
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:56,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And when I got there,

1739
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.

1740
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:02,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, I figured since I'd run this far,

1741
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:06,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.

1742
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:08,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And that's what I did.

1743
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I ran clear across Alabama.

1744
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}No particular reason. I just kept on going.

1745
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I ran clear to the ocean.

1746
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And when I got there,

1747
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I figured since I'd gone this far,

1748
01:53:26,870 --> 01:53:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}might as well turn around, just keep on going.

1749
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:35,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And when I got to another ocean,

1750
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:38,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I figured since I'd gone this far.

1751
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:42,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I might as well just turn back

1752
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and keep right on going.

1753
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:47,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}when I got tired, I slept.

1754
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:49,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}when I got hungry, I ate.

1755
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}When I had to go.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I went.

1758
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:56,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And so.

1759
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}you just ran?

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1761
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:05,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Lookin' out at the road rushin' under my wheels

01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:42,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that Somebody would do all that running

01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:27,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}for no particular reason.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I just felt like running.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now... for some reason,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}make sense to people.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It was like an alarm went off in my head.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I said, "Here's a guy that's got his act together.

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}So I got company.

1809
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And after that, I got more company.

1810
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And then, even more people joined in.

1811
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Somebody later told me

1812
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}it gave people hope.

1813
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:11,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now...

1814
01:56:11,530 --> 01:56:14,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Now, I don't know anything about that,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but some of those people asked me

1816
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}if I could help them out.

1817
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I was wondering if you might help me.

1818
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:23,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1819
01:56:23,110 --> 01:56:24,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I need a good slogan,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and since you've been so inspirational,

1821
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:29,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I thought you might be able to help me...

1822
01:56:29,450 --> 01:56:31,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Whoa, man! You just ran

1823
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}through a big pile of dog shit!

1824
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}It happens.

1825
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}What, shit?

1826
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Sometimes.

1827
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:45,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And some years later, I heard that that fella

1828
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:47,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}did come up with a bumper sticker slogan

1829
01:56:47,530 --> 01:56:50,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and made a lot of money off of it.

1830
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:52,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Another time, I was running along.

1831
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:55,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Somebody who'd lost all his money in the T-shirt business,

1832
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:59,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1833
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}but he couldn't draw that well,

1834
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}and he didn't have a camera.

1835
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:06,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway.

1836
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Have a nice day.

1837
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:16,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Someyears later, I found out

1838
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:20,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1839
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:22,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}He made a lot of money.

1840
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}Anyway, like I was saying,

1841
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I had a lot of company.

1842
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:31,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}My mama always said,

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}before you can move on."

1845
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:40,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}And I think that's what my running was all about.

1846
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:44,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}I had run for three years...

{\fnCambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45E2EC&\3c&H000000&\b0\i1}two months...
