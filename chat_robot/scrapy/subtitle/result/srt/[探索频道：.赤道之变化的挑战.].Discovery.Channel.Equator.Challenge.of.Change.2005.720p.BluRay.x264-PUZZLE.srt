1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:10,676
太阳
The sun...

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:17,383
施予光线和生命
赤道的太阳最猛烈
giver of light and life,
shines most powerfully at the Equator.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,323
太阳在这里驱动生物丰富的区域
Here, it powers
an extraordinarily rich zone of life.

4
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:33,332
三大洲三大洋瞩目奇异的动物
Brilliant and bizarre species from
three continents... three oceans.

5
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:41,507
赤道不只是地图上的一条线
而是自然的强大力量
More than a line on a map...
Equator is a powerful force of nature.

6
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:48,847
赤道

7
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,338
赤道非洲

8
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,658
变化的挑战

9
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,835
赤道在加蓬海岸
The Equator meets
the western edge of Africa

10
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,670
和非洲西端交汇
on the coast of Gabon.

11
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,476
这是非洲少数森林
It's one of few places
in all of Africa

12
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,845
长至海岸的地方
where forests grow down
to the shore...

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,483
森林动物在这里寻找新机会
and where forest animals come
in search of new opportunity...

14
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:34,626
改变或适应可以是
成功的生存策略
To change or adapt can be
a successful survival tactic.

15
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:41,200
生存也许仰赖探索未知边界
and survival may depend on
exploring unfamiliar frontiers.

16
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,674
这些河马去哪里？
为什么？
Where are these Hippopotami going...
and why?

17
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,680
步向未知
Venturing into the unknown is

18
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,350
在一块经历巨变的
a recurring survival story here
on a continent

19
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,986
大陆上不断重复
that has undergone huge upheaval.

20
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,793
动物要面对改变考验
不然就难逃一死
Animals have had to meet
the 'challenge of change'... or perish.

21
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,438
赤道的东非是干旱草原
In Equatorial East Africa
is the arid savanna...

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,142
这种地形在赤道很罕见
such landscape is rare at the Equator.

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,480
全球赤道土地大多是潮湿森林
Equator lands around the world are
mostly forest covered... and wet.

24
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,254
草原已经几个月没下雨
Here, on the savanna,
it hasn't rained for months...

25
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:45,097
太阳持续的酷热晒干了地面
The unrelenting heat of the sun
has sucked the earth dry...

26
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,700
只有少数动物能够忍受
none but a few animals
can endure it.

27
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,680
能够克服酷热的是秃鹰
Riding powerful heat waves
are vultures.

28
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,684
它们预示死亡
They are winged
harbingers of death.

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,824
在旱季生存是最重要的事
... In the dry season,
survival is all that matters.

30
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:38,383
狮子在旱季不得不偷秃鹰的食物
In the dry season, lions are
forced to steal from vultures.

31
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,471
狮子在长旱季里都在草原
Lions remain on the savannah
throughout the long drought.

32
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,543
它们总是饥肠辘辘
Hunger is a constant companion

33
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,081
只能眼睁睁看着匮乏的猎食地
and they can only gaze out
on depleted hunting grounds.

34
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,818
汤臣瞪羚不能满足它们所需
A Thomson's gazelle
will not satisfy their needs...

35
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,453
但有总比没有好
but it will help.

36
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,011
日复一日，它们都追不到瞪羚
Day after day,
the pursuit ends in failure.

37
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,616
每次追捕都会耗用能量
尤其是有幼狮的雌狮
Each hunt saps energy,
especially for females with young.

38
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,422
母狮乳汁不多
她们的幼狮很虚弱
Mothers have little milk...
and their cubs are weak.

39
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,863
成年狮子一星期必须吃十公斤肉
An adult lion must eat
1 0 kilograms of meat a week...

40
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,734
少于十公斤它们和幼狮
就会性命垂危
any less, and they and their young
will be in peril.

41
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:09,474
九成幼狮会在旱季饿死
In the dry season,
90% of cubs may starve to death.

42
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,744
死也有很多方式
And death comes in other guises.

43
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,517
鬣狗也非常饥饿
它们会猎食幼狮
Hyenas are also desperately hungry,
and they are cub killers.

44
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,102
狮子旱季会留在这干旱平原上
Lions remain on this arid plain
during the dry season

45
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,072
因为它们的命运
和保护猎食地点相连
because their fate is linked to
protecting their hunting domain...

46
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,144
它们的命运
也跟快将发生的事相连
and their fate is linked to
a drama that is about to unfold...

47
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,654
11月清凉的贸易风开始由南吹来
In November, cool trade winds
begin to blow from the south...

48
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,332
动物在风吹来很久之前
就能感受到改变
Animals can sense a change long
before it happens.

49
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,470
大群动物迁移
Great herds are on the move,

50
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,675
几百万只动物开始前往
草原的湿长旅程
millions of animals begin
a long journey toward the savanna.

51
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,935
它们前进时乌云也紧随其后
As they approach,
so do dark heavy clouds,

52
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:21,373
乌云为干燥平原带来急需的礼物
clouds that bring a much
needed gift to the dry plain.

53
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:43,695
改变突然而且惊心动魄
骤雨也是
The change is sudden and dramatic...
and so are showers.

54
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,938
骤雨下了不到一小时就停止了
lt pours for less than an hour...
and stops...

55
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,829
下过骤雨后至少凉快一点
At least it's cooler
after these brief downpours,

56
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:24,202
动物可以喝水，水到处都是
and animals can drink,
there is water everywhere.

57
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,310
每天草地都淹在水里
然后慢慢晾干
Every day grasslands flood,
then slowly dry out....

58
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,947
几星期都会这样
this will be the pattern for
several weeks...

59
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:51,096
这地区在快到一年
最炎热的时候下雨
The rains come as the region
approaches it's hottest time of year...

60
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,300
在太阳移至最高点之时
as the sun advances to
its highest point...

61
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,808
晒裂土地的太阳
The sun that parched and
cracked the land for months

62
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,177
现在带来云雨
now brings clouds and rain

63
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,714
让尘土飞扬的平原解喝
to quench the deep thirst
of the dusty plain.

64
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,193
动物大迁移
The herds of
the great migration

65
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,764
算准丰足之时迁徙
time their journey to coincide with
this abundance.

66
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,207
就肉眼所见
As far as the eye can see,

67
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,512
新生植物
被近二百万只角马吃掉
new growth is feasted on by
close to 2 million wildebeests,

68
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,114
还有瞪羚和斑马
other gazelles and zebras.

69
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,765
动物不仅算好下雨的时候迁移
Animals not only time their
migration to the coming of the rains...

70
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:06,538
而且它们也急不及待产子
it's quickly followed by
a frenzy of births and babies.

71
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,754
所有小角马一个月内就出生
All wildebeest calves are
born within just one month

72
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,557
它们一定要学会走路
and they must quickly
find their feet

73
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,092
跟着母亲
to keep up with their mothers.

74
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,897
出生狂热越发增加了动物数量
The birth bonanza further
swells animal numbers.

75
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,868
赤道东非部份地方现在集合了
Parts of Equatorial East Africa
now contain

76
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,106
全球最多的动物
some of the greatest aggregations
of animals on the planet...

77
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,912
赤道东非不是一直
Equatorial Africa hasn't always

78
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,649
都有这么多动物
hosted such spectacular
animal numbers...

79
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,486
过去这里截然不同
in the past it was
a very different place.

80
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,026
东非长久以来
For a long time, Africa was isolated

81
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,295
和其他大陆隔绝
大部份森林密布
from other land masses
and mostly covered in forest...

82
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:11,436
在这些森林栖息的古老动物
后代存活至今
in these forests lived ancient animals
whose descendants survive today...

83
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:18,643
也许最出名的时期
非洲动物是大象
Perhaps the most famous of
these early Africans is the elephant.

84
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,915
它们的祖先是小得多的生物
lt is descended from
a much smaller creature thought

85
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,850
一般认为和蹄兔有关
to be related to the hyrax...

86
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,721
力大无穷的大象
曾经长得像这样吗？
is it possible the mighty elephant
once looked like this?

87
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,493
灵长类也和非洲祖先毫不相像
Primates also look nothing like
their African ancestors...

88
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,861
吃白蚁的奇怪食蚁兽
Where as the strange,

89
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,666
则六千万年来无甚改变
termite eating aardvark has
changed little in 60 million years.

90
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,237
约二千万年前
About 20 million years ago,

91
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,607
非洲经历巨变
Africa underwent
a dramatic transformation.

92
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,846
陆地和海洋高度改变
将欧亚和非洲拉近
Land and sea level changes brought
Africa and Eurasia closer together,

93
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,383
直至最终连结
until they finally connected.

94
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,723
大陆连结带来大量奇怪新动物
The joining of continents brought
an influx of strange new animals.

95
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,393
大多数栖息在森林
Most were forest dwellers...

96
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,630
包括野猪和奇怪的像马动物
among them were hogs
and strange horse like animals,

97
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,167
还有古代羚羊
as well as ancient antelopes...

98
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,206
随它们而来的有猎兽
and with them came predators...

99
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,510
包括各种猫科动物
including cats of many kind...

100
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,187
一些古老动物
... Some of these ancient species
brought secrets

101
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,556
将秘密传给下一代
that they handed on
to their descendants...

102
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,200
这是霍加披
森林的马
This is the Okapi,
a name that means 'forest horse'.

103
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,537
尽管它和马的大小和外形相同
Although it's the size
and shape of a horse,

104
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:57,609
它和长颈鹿有共同祖先
而且还有一个秘密
it shares a common ancestor...
and a secret, with the giraffe.

105
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,782
非洲林羚保留了
African Bush Bucks retain

106
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,185
欧洲祖先原始外形
the primitive shape of
their European forbears...

107
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,955
但它们也得到
but they also inherited
a very special gift

108
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,291
栖息森林的
祖先的特别礼物
from their forest
dwelling ancestors.

109
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,764
最初的凑羊有多个腔室的胃部
The first antelopes
had multi chambered stomachs.

110
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,534
胃部含有细菌
They contained bacteria,

111
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,336
可以消化低营养植物
that allowed them to
digest low-nutrient plants

112
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,405
其他食草动物吃不下的
that other herbivores could not eat.

113
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,608
它们胃部这秘密武器
This 'secret weapon'
stomach would

114
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,511
有一天会改变赤道附近的生物
one day transform life
near the Equator...

115
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,281
但森林覆盖大陆
but while forests
covered the continent,

116
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,883
这些动物机会不多
there was little opportunity
for these animals.

117
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:47,225
但它们的命运由非洲
其他事情决定
However their fate would be
determined by other events in Africa

118
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,762
其中一件事就是地壳碎裂
and one was
particularly earth shattering.

119
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,638
约三千万年前，东非裂开
About 30 millions years ago,
East Africa was torn apart.

120
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,746
一座大峡谷渐渐成形
Slowly, a great valley opened
and highlands

121
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,916
巨大火山力量挤出了高地
were thrust up by
enormous volcanic forces.

122
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,759
几百万年以来大裂谷
Over millions of years
The Great Rift Valley spread north

123
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:26,097
南北扩张了4500多公里
and south for over four thousand
five hundred kilometers.

124
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,403
埃塞俄比亚高地升至三千米
The Ethiopian Highlands
rose up to 3,000 meters...

125
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,840
阻挡西方的雨云
blocking rain bearing clouds
from the west,

126
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,944
在东非形成雨影带
creating a rain shadow area
in East Africa.

127
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,518
陆地变得干燥，雨林渐渐消失
As the land became drier,
rain forests slowly vanished...

128
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,021
草地出现了
and grasslands appeared.

129
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,433
草慢慢覆盖东非较干旱部份
Grasses slowly covered
the drier parts of East Africa...

130
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,608
这些新草地会大大改变
赤道的生物
These new grasslands would
profoundly change life at the Equator.

131
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,117
植物是最先改变的
And first change was to
the plants themselves...

132
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,756
太阳靠近赤道的
Being close to the Equator,

133
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,960
强大能量养活一群
the intense power of
the sun favoured a group of grasses

134
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:33,097
称为“碳四”的草
called "Carbon 4" or C4 plants.

135
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,933
这些草的方法令人惊讶
These grasses possess

136
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,702
将阳光和二氧化碳
a revolutionary pathway
for changing sunlight

137
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,139
变成糖份
and carbon dioxide gas
into sugars.

138
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:44,776
大多数草里
In most grasses,

139
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,245
进行光合作用的细胞
the cells that carry out
photosynthesis,

140
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,814
靠近叶子的高表面
are near the leaf's upper surface.

141
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:57,055
碳四植物的细胞紧紧聚在
鞘细胞附近
In C4 plants, they are packed
tightly around sheath cells.

142
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,491
二氧化碳进入叶子
...and as CO2 enters the leaf,

143
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,662
外细胞会聚合二氧化碳
the outer cells of this bundle,
concentrate the carbon dioxide.

144
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,568
这是碳四植物的秘密武器
This is the C4 plant's secret weapon...

145
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,572
叶子像有涡轮增压器的引擎
the leaf's like an engine
with a turbocharger...

146
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,774
叶子快速制造糖份
lt rapidly manufactures sugars

147
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:21,045
生长率比其他草快最多八倍
and growth rates are up to 8 times
faster than other grasses.

148
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,719
赤道阳光的能量增加
... and as the power of
Equatorial sunlight increases,

149
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,090
光合作用几乎可以无限量增加
so photosynthesis can
increase almost indefinitely...

150
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,764
整个系统包裹在坚硬外果心
The whole system is
encased in a tough outer core,

151
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:45,536
让这些草难以消化
and this made these grasses
very difficult to digest.

152
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,309
C4草在
C4 grasses out competed

153
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,480
东非最炎热的地方
取代了其他草
and replaced other grasses
in the hottest parts of East Africa...

154
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,751
但这些新草地很多食草动物
But these new "grasslands"
were tough,

155
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,954
视作难以下咽的荒地
inedible wastelands for
many grass eaters...

156
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,324
但有一群动物
however,
the new plants proved to be

157
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,028
对新植物趋之若鹜
highly desirable for
one group of animals...

158
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,497
几百万年以来
For millions of years,

159
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,899
这些动物
就栖身在森林
these animals had been
forest dwellers,

160
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,969
但新草地扩张
but as the new grasslands spread,

161
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,805
它们只好吃这些
they emerged to graze
on these tough,

162
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,573
低营养硬植物
nutrient poor plants.

163
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,813
这种动物叫做有蹄动物
The animals are called ungulates,
a name that means 'hoof'...

164
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,949
但因为可以消化草
but being able to digest grasses...

165
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:36,054
因此又名反刍动物
gave rise to another name...
ruminants.

166
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,093
它们叫做反刍动物
因为它们的超级胃而得名
They're called ruminants,
in honor of their 'super stomachs'...

167
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,030
它们遗传了祖先的三室胃
They'd inherited a 3 chambered
stomach from their ancestors...

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,837
但即使有三室胃
也不足以消化碳四草
but even this was not adequate
for the job of digesting C4 grasses.

169
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,975
这些硬植物需要更厉害的消化
These tough plants required
more powerful digestion...

170
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,347
食草动物可能在干旱草地上
It's probable that it was
on the dry grasslands

171
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,851
演化出新的胃
that grazers evolved
a new model of stomach...

172
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,723
这种胃有一个称为瘤胃的大室
lt had a large extra chamber
called the rumen,

173
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,660
草先在这里分解
where the grass
is first broken down.

174
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,999
消化的媒介是微生物
The agents of digestion
are microbes.

175
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,038
它们攻击草的硬细胞壁
They attack the grass's
tough cell walls,

176
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,307
释出糖份和维他命
releasing sugars and vitamins...

177
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,846
但这只是第一步
but this is only the first stage.

178
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,388
部份消化的草由第二个胃
泵回口中
Partly digested grasses are pumped
from the second stomach

179
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:49,727
再嘴嚼后加快
back to the mouth and
chewed again to speed up the next stage

180
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,363
第三个胃里
发生的下一步骤
that takes place in the 3rd stomach.

181
00:18:54,099 --> 00:19:00,338
草液在这里喂养细菌
细菌快速繁殖
Here, the grassy broth feeds bacteria
that multiply quickly and dramatically.

182
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,076
最后食物流到
Finally, the contents move to

183
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,546
最后一个腔室
也就是真胃
the last chamber
which are the true stomach...

184
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,983
这就是最后消化的地方
This is where final digestion
takes place...

185
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,688
现在动物不仅是消化草
By now, the animal
is not only digesting grass,

186
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,827
也是消化高蛋白质的细菌
it's also digesting
a high protein diet of bacteria.

187
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,966
反刍动物的超级胃
The ruminant 'super stomach'

188
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,271
让一些食草动物长得大而有力
has allowed some herbivores to
grow large... and powerful....

189
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,523
现代反刍动物约在二百万年前
在非洲出现
Modern ruminants arose in Africa
about 2 million years ago.

190
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,427
水牛渐渐长成最大
The buffalo has grown to
be one of the biggest

191
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,829
和最笨重的反刍动物之一
and most lumbering
of ruminants...

192
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,801
但其他反刍动物体积和速度
大相迳庭
but others differ hugely
in size and speed.

193
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,508
汤臣羚羊是短跑好手
Thomson's gazelles
are lightly built sprinters.

194
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,678
角马却是长跑好手
Wildebeests are marathon runners,

195
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,982
但草原上还有很多
速度飞快的动物
but there are many
other swift athletes of the savanna.

196
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,164
最大的是长颈鹿
The biggest of all is the giraffe...

197
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:41,205
反刍动物现在占据很多
不同栖息地，生活方式五花八门
Ruminants now occupy
many different habitats and lifestyles.

198
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,643
东非山羚仍然栖息在
陡斜突出石地
Klippspringers keep to
steep rocky outcrops...

199
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,015
Gerunuk 喜欢灌木丛地区
Areas of low bush and shrubs
are favoured by Gerunuks.

200
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,021
小羚在最茂密的灌木丛深处觅食
Tiny Dik Dik feed deep inside
the thickest bush.

201
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,492
快速灵活的高角羚
是其中一种平原瞪羚
Fast, agile lmpala are
one of many open plain gazelles.

202
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,395
獐羚是隐秘的湿地栖息者
Reedbucks are
secretive wetland dwellers...

203
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,796
水羚也是
as are waterbucks

204
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,069
Nyara较喜欢半沙漠
The preferred range of Nyara
is semi desert...

205
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,942
Oryx则栖息在
最干旱的沙漠地区
whereas, Oryx inhabit
the very driest desert areas.

206
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,849
非洲有125种羚羊
There are 1 25 species of antelope
in Africa...

207
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,518
占了全球羚羊总数近九成
almost 90% of the world total.

208
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,956
它们以壮观的方式征服了草地
They've conquered the grasslands
in spectacular fashion...

209
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:37,261
动物的大小由半米到五米都有
animals range in size from
half a meter to 5 meter giants;

210
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,665
有独行动物也有几百万只的羊群
from loners to herds of millions...

211
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,903
反刍动物的胃有其他好处
The ruminant stomach
has other advantages...

212
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,508
草消化得较慢而且彻底
grass is digested more slowly
and thoroughly,

213
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,543
因为胃部较有效率
and because it is more efficient,

214
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,613
羚羊不需要经常吃草
Antelopes don't have to
graze constantly...

215
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,654
它们察觉到猎兽逼近
When an approaching enemy
is detected...

216
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,224
就会突然迅速逃走
escape is swift and sudden.

217
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:15,399
兽群有很多眼睛、耳朵
和鼻子感应危险
the herd has many eyes,
ears and noses to sense danger...

218
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:20,538
这塑造了猎食它们的主要敌手
猫科动物的进化
and this has shaped the evolution of
their main predators, the cats.

219
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,107
羚羊进化时
As antelopes evolved,

220
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:27,345
猫科动物也变成更致命的猎兽
so cats changed to become
more deadly predators.

221
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,519
一头豹在树顶监视猎物
A leopards spies its prey
from the treetops.

222
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,660
它的祖先或许也栖息在树上
Its ancestors were
probably tree dwellers too.

223
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,436
在草地上，
它是无声的影子…
In the grass,
it's silent as a shadow...

224
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,139
慢慢走近目标
slowly working its way into range.

225
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,155
豹不会立即杀死猎物
The leopard
doesn't kill immediately...

226
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,891
可能会有其他豹偷它的食物
there may be others
that would steal it...

227
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,095
树是最安全的地方
the home tree is the safest place.

228
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,338
豹学会了蹑手蹑脚
The leopard has developed stealth

229
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,342
骗过羚羊对危险的敏锐感觉
to outwit the antelope's finely
tuned sense of danger.

230
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,583
鬣豹是开阔草原的猫科动物
The cheetah is
a cat of the open savanna...

231
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,020
这里没有藏身之地
out here, there's nowhere to hide...

232
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:49,160
它用不同方式猎食
它靠速度
it uses a different tactic to
hunt prey... it uses speed.

233
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,438
如果鬣豹在猎物看到它之前追捕
If it can begin the chase
before its prey sees it,

234
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,673
就会占有优势
the cheetah has the advantage.

235
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,679
在非洲，鬣豹的体型
In Africa, the cheetah's body shape

236
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,683
渐渐能够
追得上飞奔的小羚羊
became adapted to run down small,
fast antelopes.

237
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,489
它的时速达110公里
Exploding to reach speeds of
110 kilometers per hour,

238
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,559
是全球陆上最快的动物
it's the fastest land animal
in the world.

239
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,065
鬣豹的身体变成流线型
It's body became streamlined,

240
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:33,771
爪子就像钩
轻、有弹性、有力
its claws work as spikes,
it is light, flexible and powerful.

241
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,910
草地增加了快速的小瞪羚
The grasslands have boosted
the number of small fast gazelles...

242
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,714
鬣豹以高速追上它们
and cheetahs use blinding
speed to outrun them.

243
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,588
非洲所有猫科动物中
Of all Africa's cats,

244
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,992
狮子受赤道太阳的影响最大
the lion has been most shaped
by the Equatorial sun.

245
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,498
狮子会以血缘聚居，称为族群
Lions live in family groups
called prides...

246
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,668
它们是全球唯一群居的猫科动物
they are the only truly social cats
in the world.

247
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,174
它们也是草原上最大的猫科动物
They are also the biggest cats
on the savanna.

248
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:17,314
雄狮一米多高，重260公斤
Males stand over a meter high
and weigh 260 kilograms...

249
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,383
尽管雄狮体型庞大
yet, despite their size,

250
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,153
它们仍是狮群的边缘份子
males remain on the margins
of lion society.

251
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,560
狮群是大家庭
A lion pride is
an extended family of several

252
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,296
有几只到12只雌狮和幼狮
to dozen females and their young.

253
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,234
这是雌狮的社群
lt is a society of females...

254
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,338
全都平等，全都在相若时间繁殖
all are equal, all breed at
around the same time...

255
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,546
这狮群里最老的雌狮
戴着无线电追踪圈
The oldest female in this pride
wears a radio tracking collar.

256
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:54,285
它是头领，有很多有用的
经验和知识
She's the leader; she has much
useful experience and knowledge...

257
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,123
雄狮的角色是
The male's role is to defend

258
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,493
守卫狮群的地盘
和生育下一代
the pride's territory
and father the cubs.

259
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,464
狮子的庞大体型
The lion's imposing size

260
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,901
和独特社会结构
是有原因的
and unique social structure
exists for a reason...

261
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,103
非洲最大的猫科动物
the biggest cats in Africa,

262
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,941
集体捕食
一些最大的食草动物
work in groups to hunt some of
the largest plant eaters...

263
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:29,820
但即使群猎也不一定成功
Yet, even working together
does not guarantee success...

264
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,191
猎物通常在远处就看到狮子
prey animals often see lions
from a long distance...

265
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,562
所以狮子大多数会在晚上捕猎
so most hunting is done after dark.

266
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:00,684
晚上是杀戮时间
很多动物都很活跃
Night is the killing time...
when many animals are active.

267
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,008
晚上限制了猎物的视力
Darkness restricts the vision of
prey animals

268
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,243
狮子藉机走近
allowing lions to get closer...

269
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,380
但它们晚上猎食主要因为较凉快
but they hunt at night mainly
because it is cooler.

270
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,816
猎食耗费大量能量
Hunting uses a lot of energy...

271
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,487
狮子在烈日下很容易体温过高
lions easily overheat
under the blazing sun...

272
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,056
它们较喜欢晚上猎食
night kills are preferred.

273
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,332
猎食狮群组织严密
A lion hunting party
is highly organized.

274
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,936
它们发现一群猎物后
Once a group of prey animals
is identified,

275
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,607
就会悄悄慢慢包围
they are slowly
and quietly surrounded...

276
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,154
所有狮子都各就各位
When all lions are in position,

277
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,424
有一两只会故意让猎物看到
one or two will
make themselves visible.

278
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,560
瞪羚很快跑开
The gazelles move quickly away...

279
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,995
但陷阱已经布下了
but the trap is set...

280
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,898
它们正向等待的狮群跑去
they run into the waiting jaws
of the group.

281
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,809
猎物会由狮群分食
The kill is shared
among members of the pride...

282
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,389
狮群各有自己的猎食地盘
Each pride has a hunting territory,

283
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,927
雄狮的任务是保护狮群和地盘
and the constant mission for
the male is to protect both pride

284
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:53,430
抵抗可能会推翻它的雄狮
and territory against other males
that would overthrow him.

285
00:28:56,201 --> 00:29:00,037
地盘可以延伸至100平方公里
The territory can extend
over 1 00 sq kilometers...

286
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,373
它的巨吼声地盘
大部份地方都听得到
And his loud roar
can be heard over most of it.

287
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:13,117
它巡行时会在边缘留下气味
As he patrols, he leaves
scent marks along the borders.

288
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,826
猎食成功不一定代表享用猎物
A successful hunt does not
always mean enjoying the kill...

289
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,265
雌狮进食时被一群鬣狗包围
As they feed, the females are
surrounded by a band of hyenas.

290
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,807
鬣狗就体型来说
有非洲最有力的牙齿
For their size, hyenas have
the strongest jaws in Africa...

291
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:41,178
对它们不能掉以轻心
而且它们的数量比狮子多
they're not to be taken lightly...
and they outnumber the lions.

292
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,658
雌狮别无他法
只好放弃辛苦得来的食物
The females have no choice
but to give up their hard won meal.

293
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,131
但现在雄狮回来了
But now the male returns...

294
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,851
鬣狗的胜利只是昙花一现
The Hyenas victory is short lived...

295
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,489
数目多敌不过生气的雄狮
superior numbers are
no match for an angry male lion.

296
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,502
它回来的时候仍然怒气未消
And when he returns,
his mood has not improved...

297
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:47,211
保护的代价是猎物归它所有
The price of protection is
that he takes over the kill.

298
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,087
其中一只捕猎的雌狮离开了
One of the hunting females
now departs.

299
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,997
她和养育狮群所有幼儿的雌狮
She returns to the kill
with the nursing females

300
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,100
回到食物附近
who are caring for
all the cubs of the pride.

301
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,512
雄狮让幼狮和它一起吃猎物
The male allows the young cubs
to feed alongside him...

302
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,556
它不打算让雌狮这样做
It's a privilege he is not prepared to
extend to the female.

303
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,672
雄狮认为幼狮的安全和生存
是最重要的
For the male, the safety and
survival of the cubs is most important

304
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,008
它们遗传了它的基因
as they carry his genes.

305
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,124
雄狮恃势先吃猎物
The male may bully his way
to first helping of the kill,

306
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,694
但雌狮控制狮群
but the females control the pride...

307
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,332
它们的主要工作是保持狮群强壮
Their major imperative
is a strong society...

308
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,635
和保存它们的猎食地盘
and to retain their hunting territory.

309
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:34,584
狮子猎食地盘由雌狮传给女儿
The lions hunting territory is passed
from females to their daughters...

310
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,696
年轻雄狮成年后一定要离开狮群
Young males must leave
the pride once they reach maturity...

311
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:51,001
这样可以防止近亲交配
保持狮群实力
this keeps the pride strong by
removing the risk of inbreeding.

312
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,871
雄狮血统由一个狮群
传至另一个狮群
Male blood moves
from pride to pride.

313
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,577
年轻独雄狮称为流浪狮
Young lone males are called Nomads...

314
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,581
这流浪狮过去一个月
this nomad has
spent the previous month

315
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,883
独自游荡和猎食
wandering and hunting by himself...

316
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12,155
它只有两岁，刚长出鬃毛
He's just 2 years of age,
with just the beginnings of a mane.

317
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:17,027
它太年轻了，不能挑战成年雄狮
He's still far too young to
challenge a full grown male.

318
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:24,468
流浪狮一般会跟随着狮群边缘
Nomads often lurk
on the fringes of prides...

319
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,675
它们会频频挑战
They mount frequent challenges,

320
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,379
测试主导雄狮的力量和速度
to test the strength and
speed of the dominant males.

321
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:51,328
有一天，狮群的雄狮会反应迟钝
虚弱得无法自卫
One day, the pride male will not be fast
or strong enough to defend himself...

322
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,498
但那一天尚未到来
but that day is not today.

323
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:03,507
这流浪狮会回来
它会一直尝试
This nomad will return,
he will keep trying...

324
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,944
如果它独自能够生存的话
if he can survive out there
on his own.

325
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:19,022
流浪狮这阶段确保力量
传给所有狮子
The "Nomad" strategy ensures that
strength is bred into all lions...

326
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,026
面对旱季困苦的力量
strength to face
the hardships of the dry season...

327
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,564
还有猎杀草原上
大食草动物的力量
and strength to hunt large
herbivores on the savanna.

328
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,678
有一种食草动物
比任何动物都要高
There's one plant eater
that's taller than all the rest...

329
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,651
长颈鹿身型庞大
狮子很少攻击它们
Giraffe are so big;
they're rarely attacked by Lions.

330
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:02,065
长颈鹿有反刍动物的胃
但它们不在草原上吃草
The giraffe has a ruminant stomach
but it does not graze the savanna...

331
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,971
它的长颈让它吃得到
金合欢的叶子
Its long neck gives it
access to acacia trees,

332
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,541
少数能在这环境下生存的树
one of very few trees that
can survive these conditions.

333
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,212
金合欢叶子营养丰富
Acacia leaves are rich in nutrients...

334
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,549
但受到绝佳保护
要吃的话要花点心思
but they're well protected...
eating is a delicate art.

335
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,822
长颈鹿能轻易碰到这些树
Giraffes can easily
reach high into the trees...

336
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,594
但它们要弯身吃草或喝水
就有点困难
but they experience some difficulty
bending to graze or drink.

337
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,500
长颈的一个问题是控制血压
One problem from having such a long neck
is controlling blood pressure...

338
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,769
尤其是流到脑部的血压
specifically,
the pressure of blood to the brain.

339
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,205
长颈鹿站直时
When standing upright,

340
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,808
心脏一定要将血压
the giraffe's heart
must raise blood pressure to

341
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,010
提升至人类的一倍
more than twice human pressure

342
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,981
才能将血推上颈部和头部
in order to push the blood up
the neck and into the head.

343
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,285
但它弯下身子
But when it bends down,

344
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,523
所有压力该会突然使血涌到头部
all that pressure should suddenly
rush blood to the head and potentially

345
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,424
可能会流血致命
cause fatal hemorrhage...

346
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,793
但事实上不会
but it doesn't.

347
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:08,331
因为长颈鹿脑部下
有特别的器官
That's because, a giraffe has a
special blood pressure control organ

348
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,933
控制血压
just beneath its brain.

349
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,305
这结构称为网状海绵体
是血管网络
The structure, called a "wondernet",
is a network of blood vessels.

350
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,974
血液涌到头部的时候
As blood rushes to the head,

351
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,243
网状海绵体吸收增加的血液流量
the wondernet absorbs
the increased flow

352
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,045
像海绵一样膨胀
and swells like a sponge.

353
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,850
膨胀的时候，网状海绵体
As it swells,
arteries between wondernet

354
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,519
和脑部之间的动脉
像水喉一样扭曲
and brain bend and crimp
like a water hose,

355
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,521
进一步减少血液流量
further reducing blood flow.

356
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,792
网状海绵体让长颈鹿
成为赤道最高的动物
The wondernet enabled
the giraffe to become

357
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,629
可以吃到营养最丰富的食物
the tallest animal of the Equator
and reach for the richest food...

358
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,499
但这是怎样发生的？
but how did it come about?

359
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,140
可能是草地扩张
lt is likely that as grasslands spread,

360
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,309
巨型长颈鹿
the giant giraffe evolved from

361
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,679
快速自森林短颈祖先进化
a short necked forest ancestor
very quickly...

362
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,448
因为它从森林带来的一个秘密
because of a secret it
brought from the forest...

363
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,652
那秘密仍可以找到
And that secret is still found

364
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,522
在刚果东部最偏远的地方
in the remotest parts
of Eastern Congo...

365
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:09,459
隐藏秘密的是长颈鹿的
森林近似动物
it lives on in
the giraffe's forest relative.

366
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,935
这种近似动物高度
只及长颈鹿1/3
This relative stands only
one third of the giraffe's height

367
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,339
称为霍加披
and is the forest horse,
the Okapi.

368
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,042
短颈霍加披
The short necked okapi

369
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,845
不需要调节血压
doesn't need to regulate
it's blood pressure,

370
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,815
但它也有网状海绵体
yet, it also has a wondernet...

371
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,353
这就能解释长颈鹿怎样进化
and this could explain
how the giraffe evolved.

372
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,691
欧卡皮鹿和长颈鹿有共同祖先
古麟动物
Okapi and giraffe have
a common ancestor... the Paleotragus.

373
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,528
如果能够证明它也有网状海绵体
If it could be proved that
it too had a 'wondernet',

374
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:49,666
就能解开森林古麟动物
it would solve the mystery of how
the Paleotragus of the forest

375
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,671
怎样快速变成草原长颈鹿的谜团
could so rapidly become
the giraffe of the savanna...

376
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:03,013
可能长颈鹿预先适应了草原生活
It's possible that the Giraffe was
pre adapted to life on the savanna...

377
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,552
但非洲一种土生动物
but one of Africa's original inhabitants
went down aquite different path

378
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,056
在赤道
这干燥地区存活的方式大相径庭
to survive life on
this arid region of the Equator...

379
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,494
它改变脑袋和身体
lt changed its brain
as well as its body.

380
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,199
大象没有反刍动物的胃
Elephants don't
have ruminant stomachs...

381
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,236
它们怎样抵挡酷热和干旱？
so, how do they beat the heat...
and the dry?

382
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,406
它们的方法是扩大身形
they do it by being
'super sized'.

383
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,878
较小的动物在旱季会挨饿
In dry seasons,
smaller animals will starve whereas,

384
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,080
较大的动物，例如大象
larger animals, like elephants,

385
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,685
吃的食物不及每单位体重
更有可能活下来
eat less food per unit of body weight,
and are more likely to survive.

386
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,390
但大象的脑部也会生长
But elephants also
grew their brains.

387
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,962
它们用牙当作剥树皮的工具
吸取营养
They use their tusks as a tool to
peel away tree bark for nutrients.

388
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,434
它们在旱季
In the dry season,

389
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,370
记得
最好的觅食场在哪里
they remember where
the best feeding grounds are...

390
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,506
将知识传给下一代
and pass this knowledge
on to their offspring.

391
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,310
大象及不上反刍动物
Elephants might be less efficient

392
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,714
将植物变成能量的效率
than ruminants at turning plants
into energy...

393
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,385
它们生存是靠智力和体型
their survival is
based on brain power and size.

394
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,226
河马也是巨物
Hippopotomi are also giants.

395
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,396
它们一天大多数时间都在湖泊里
They spend much of the day
in rivers and lakes,

396
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,066
躲避猛烈阳光
to protect themselves from
the sun's powerful rays...

397
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,302
粉红色不是晒伤
the pink colour is not sunburn

398
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,206
而是皮肤渗出来的防晒油
but a form of sunblock that
they exude onto their skins...

399
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,477
水也能节省能量
The water also saves energy,

400
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:45,348
可以支撑它们厚皮身体的重量
it helps support the enormous weight
of their thick skinned bodies...

401
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,392
它们和大象一样
没有反刍动物的胃
Like elephants,
they don't have ruminant stomachs.

402
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,994
它们也会扩大身型
They too have increased body size

403
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:02,565
改善能量运用和生存机会
to improve energy efficiency
and their chances of survival.

404
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,908
河马从没有断绝过
与水的亲密关系
Hippos have never shaken off
their strong bond with water...

405
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,879
它们远离湖泊的话就活不成
they cannot survive
beyond rivers and lakes.

406
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,115
但和草原很多动物不同
Yet unlike many animals of the savanna,

407
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,418
它们正面对改变的考验
they are meeting
the challenge of change...

408
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,754
远在东非干旱平原之外
far beyond the dry plains
of East Africa.

409
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,629
沿赤道西行
Moving west on the Equator,

410
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,999
在草原和
非洲的大西洋海岸之间
between the savanna and
Africa's Atlantic sea coast,

411
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,069
有几片森林、湿地和草地
there's a mosaic of forest,
wetland and grassland...

412
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,444
这是赤道非洲草原出现前的面貌
This is what much of Equatorial Africa
looked like before the savanna existed.

413
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,614
帮助维持这斑驳地形的
... And helping maintain
this patchwork landscape

414
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,218
是一种叫做森林农夫的动物
is an animal called
the farmer of the forest.

415
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:03,893
红河猪一般穿梭森林和草地之间
Red river hogs regularly commute
between forest and grassland.

416
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,866
它们带着森林的种子散布草上
From the forest, they bring seeds
that they spread on the grass...

417
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,205
红河猪不仅吃生长的种子
Red River Hogs not only eat
the seedlings that grow up...

418
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,841
也遍布森林
but they also spread the forest.

419
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,217
森林大象身形是草原大象的一半
Forest elephants are half the size
of those on the savanna...

420
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,155
森林里较凉快，食物较充足
life in the forest is cooler,
food is more abundant,

421
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,891
它们不需要长得很大
they do not need to be giants...

422
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,796
但它们总是寻找新食物
But they are always
seeking new sources of food...

423
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,398
雨季时
and during the rainy season,

424
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,668
食欲让它们前往海边
their appetite draws them
toward the sea.

425
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:50,974
它们路经的是交缠的红树林
In their path, is a tangled
forest of mangrove trees?

426
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:59,148
这些树有长种子豆荚
生长在泻湖边缘
These trees with long seed pods,
fringe the edges of lagoons...

427
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,819
这些泻湖也有河马
and in these lagoons,
there are hippopotami.

428
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,627
这些河马和草原上的看来一样
These Hippos may look just
the same as those on the savanna,

429
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,962
但它们的行为非常不同
but their behavior is very different...

430
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,835
它们也被吸引到海边来
they too are drawn to the sea...

431
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,671
但原因至今未明
but for reasons that
remain a mystery.

432
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,947
动物来到海岸
Animals come to the sea shore,

433
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:35,118
赤道和非洲西岸相交的地方
也就是加蓬
where the Equator meets
the western coast of Africa, in Gabon...

434
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,324
森林水牛为何来这里？
Why do forest buffalo come here?

435
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,060
它们来这里是为了食物
They come here for food.

436
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,733
雨水将海岸森林的植物
The rain washes vegetation
from the coastal forest

437
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,770
冲出海
再冲回沙滩上
out into the ocean
and back onto the beaches...

438
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,575
动物找寻的红树林种子豆荚
animals seek out Mangrove seed pods

439
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,945
含有大量矿物质
that contain high concentrations
of minerals.

440
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,957
大象也知道这特别的食物来源
Elephants also know of
this special food source...

441
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,226
它们将这件事告诉小象
and they pass this knowledge
onto their young.

442
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:25,001
但沙滩上还有令人意外的来客
But there is another surprise
appearance at the beach.

443
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,744
河马来到海岸
但不是为了吃红树林豆荚
Hippos come to the coast...
but not to eat mangrove pods.

444
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,751
河马母子看来被吸引到海洋来
A Hippo mother and baby
seem attracted to the ocean.

445
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,091
看到它们离开河流感觉奇怪
It's strange to see them
away from rivers and lakes.

446
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,127
但它们在这里泰然自若
Yet, they seem at home here,

447
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:58,134
小河马完全淹没在浪花里
the baby is completely
submerged by the surf.

448
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,141
是什么驱使它们来这里？
What draws them to the sea?

449
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,979
也许它们游进海洋洗掉寄生虫
Perhaps they swim in
the ocean to wash off parasites.

450
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,854
它们借盐水的浮力在海岸迁移吗？
... do they use the buoyancy of
salt water to travel along the coast?

451
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,592
还是吃生在海浪区的海洋植物？
...or do they feed on sea plants
that grow in the surf zone?

452
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,530
没有人知道为什么它们来这里
No one knows why they come here.

453
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,406
只有加蓬的卢安哥河马
才会在海洋游泳
Only the hippos of Loango
in Gabon swim in the ocean.

454
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,345
在古代
In ancient times,

455
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:47,250
状似河马的动物
入海后变成了鲸鱼
hippopotamus like animals went
down to the sea and became whales...

456
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:52,889
也许游泳的河马在这陌生的地域
Perhaps swimming hippos,
on this unfamiliar frontier,

457
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,359
全新动物进化的开始
are the beginning of what could
become totally different animals,

458
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,861
是几万年后
tens of thousands years from now.

459
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:08,337
我们在加蓬海浪中
看到了进化过程吗？
Are we are seeing evolution
in action in the surf of Gabon?

460
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,808
非洲的赤道还有其他
And are there
other evolutionary experiments

461
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,344
进化实验在别处发生吗？
happening elsewhere
on Africa's Equator.

462
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:22,518
加蓬和刚果的森林
黑暗而且寸步难移
The jungles of Gabon and Congo
are dark and impenetrable...

463
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:28,591
但在某些地方森林伸展成
称为Bal的宽广湿地
but in places they open out into
broad wetlands called "bai".

464
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,497
肉质草和矿物质丰富的球茎
在这里生长
Succulent grasses and bulbs rich
in minerals grow here...

465
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,367
森林动物来此寻找这些植物
and forest animals emerge to
search out these plants...

466
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:41,471
其中有西低地猩猩
among them, west lowland gorillas.

467
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:50,346
这些猩猩不喜欢水
会尽可能避开水
These gorillas don't like the water
and will avoid it if possible...

468
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,584
但得到这些珍贵植物的欲求
太强烈
but the drive to
get these precious plants

469
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,187
一些猩猩会克服它们的厌恶
leads some gorillas to
overcome this dislike.

470
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,202
这只猩猩不仅泡在水里
Not only is this gorilla
immersing itself in the water

471
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,705
还挺直走路
but it is walking upright...

472
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,911
水的浮力帮它垂直站立
The buoyancy of water
helps it stay upright...

473
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,713
它还会走路，举起双手
and it walks, arms raised,

474
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,682
像个不情愿的洗澡者，不想弄湿
like a reluctant bather,
not wanting to get wet.

475
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,294
用双腿走路令人神往
It's tempting to imagine that this is

476
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,899
想像我们的非洲祖先就是这样
how our African ancestors
began walking on two legs...

477
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,908
这里如果未来气候
或其他情况改变
... and if climate or other conditions
change here in the future...

478
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,846
也许步行的猩猩生存的机会会较大
perhaps a walking gorilla
will be better able to survive.

479
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,789
但改变已经发生了
But change is already happening...

480
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:13,129
在东面远处，动物已经改变了
应付酷热
further east, animals are already
changing to cope with extreme heat.

481
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,899
肯亚察沃国家公园
Tsavo National Park Kenya,

482
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,870
位处低海拔
温度极高
is at low altitude and
has very high temperatures.

483
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:24,240
狮子勉强生存
Here, lions live
at their limit of survival.

484
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,512
土地在表面下较凉
The earth is cooler
beneath the surface...

485
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,382
温度上升时它们尝试避开热力
they try to avoid heat
as temperatures soar.

486
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,759
阴凉处温度近摄氏40度
In the shade it is nearly 40...

487
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,497
空旷地方近50度
out in the open it's close to
50 degrees Celsius.

488
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,803
这里的狮子一般在晚上猎食
Lions here, usually hunt at night,

489
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:59,408
但如果猎物走得太近
它们就会难抵本能
but if prey wanders too close,
they cannot resist their instincts.

490
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,727
在酷热下制服水牛极耗体力
To bring down a buffalo in this heat
is hugely taxing of energy...

491
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,764
狮子很容易体温过高
Lions overheat very easily...

492
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:27,536
如果它们体温上升
就会有虚脱和死亡的危险
if their body temperatures rise
they risk heat exhaustion and death.

493
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,377
水牛很快就死了
Death comes quickly for the buffalo,

494
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,147
喉咙被咬，阻碍了气流
和血液流动
a throat bite constricts air
and blood flow.

495
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,185
杀死猎物后
After the kill,

496
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:47,723
狮子一定要找遮阴处
休息后才进食
the lions must seek shade and rest
before they can begin to eat.

497
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,563
白天猎食可引致狮子虚脱
A daytime hunt can induce heat
exhaustion among these animals...

498
00:48:55,165 --> 00:49:00,202
但察沃的雄狮
有克服酷热的另一方法
but in Tsavo, male lions have
another strategy for beating the heat.

499
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,542
这里的雄狮鬃毛稀少
Male lions here have
greatly reduced manes.

500
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,546
雄狮的鬃毛会增加体温
A lion's mane raises body temperature...

501
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,481
为了适应
So, they have adapted to be

502
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,551
它们除去象徵权威的鬃毛
without their traditional symbols
of dominance.

503
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:22,425
雄狮头领仍能看得出来
它们的鬃毛较暗
Dominant males can still be identified
their short manes are darker.

504
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,000
如果赤道更热
If it gets even hotter at the Equator,

505
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:35,838
