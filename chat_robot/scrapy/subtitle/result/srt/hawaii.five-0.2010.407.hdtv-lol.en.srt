1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm still not comfortable with this.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,280
Steve,everyone on this
rock knows you and Five-O.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,270
So if you guys show up,the
clientele's gonna be out the back door

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,060
before you even step foot in
the front,but they don't know me.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,760
Maybe we do a different location.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,070
No,no,no.This guys doesn't want
anyone to know that he's in the casino,

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,840
So it's the only place where he's
not gonna have security with him.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,780
I've surveilled it; I know how to
get in,I know how to get out.Boom.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,590
- What if you get compromised?
- I'll improvise.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,270
You're the one who told me to get back
up on the horse,okay?And you were right.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,450
So you're just gonna
have to let me do this.

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,430
What,are you deputizing me?

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,660
Just in case,all right?

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,500
Don't worry,it's gonna be
fine.I've got this covered,okay?

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,380
It's gonna be fine.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,980
P*****

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,550
Six,pass line wins.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,030
Betting against the table
hasn't been working for you,huh?

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,840
Maybe you can get lucky some other way.

20
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,320
Haven't we met before,miss?

21
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,090
What do you want?

22
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,170
Riku Sato,where is he?

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,710
Who the hell are you?

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,840
Five-O.

25
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,020
Now where the hell is Sato?

30
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,410
Hey,bro,any good sets out there?

31
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,010
Picking up.

32
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,450
If we're lucky,we'll get swell.

33
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,520
B***

34
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,000
How***

35
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,640
You****

36
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,950
that***

37
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,400
G***

38
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,000
Anything else,lover boy?

39
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,440
Nani,you reading over my shoulder?

40
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,470
Only the dirty parts.More coffee?

41
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,580
Just the check,please.

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,060
Oh,it's already taken care
of.Gentleman at the counter.

43
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,330
- Thanks,Nani.
- Sure.

44
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,860
What's that for?

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,540
Well,Captain Grover,let's just say
I've been around long enough to know

46
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,560
that when someone pays for your
meal they usually want something.

47
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,970
Come on.Are you really that cynical?

48
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,990
Where I'm from,cops
do that for each other.

49
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,740
Besides,I figured it was the least I could
do after pointing a shotgun in your face.

50
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,050
Yeah,well,that hostage
crisis was rough on everyone.

51
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,750
I think it's fair to say that
there was fault on both sides.

52
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,180
Lieutenant,I realize the governor
gives you guys a free pass,

53
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,420
but to be honest,that behavior I saw
out there in the field the other day,

54
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,320
that's a surefire way to get yourself
alienated from your brothers in blue.

55
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,910
I mean,I'd hate to see you in a situation
where you call for backup and it doesn't show.

56
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,090
I think you need to be having
this conversation with McGarrett.

57
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,270
I don't think so.

58
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,540
I'm not having this conversation with
McGarrett.McGarrett's not a real cop.

59
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,370
He doesn't think like a
cop,he doesn't act like a cop.

60
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,030
You,on the other hand...I did
my homework; you're a good cop.

61
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,810
Got your badge back after going through
a rough patch.I know what that's like.

62
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,450
Have a nice day,Captain.

63
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,450
I'm coming,I'm coming.I said
I'm coming!All right,all right.

64
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,730
IT'A GITL!c*****

65
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,310
Mary,what...

66
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,520
- You should see your face.
- What are you doing here?

67
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,490
- Who's baby is this?
- Mine.

68
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,100
- No,it's not.
- She's mine.

69
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,490
I adopted her.

70
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,090
What are you talking
about?How could it be yours?

71
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,370
It's been in the works for a while,

72
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,670
but I kept in on the DL in case a certain
someone was gonna be critical about it.

73
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,620
I don't believe it.

74
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,220
Isn't she cute?I named her after Dad.

75
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,400
- Oh,you named her John?
- No,Joan.

76
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,380
Mary,I don't want to be critical,

77
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,500
but you have difficulty
managing your own life.

78
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,450
How you gonna look after the baby?

79
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,810
I think I took care of a
90-year-old man pretty well.

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
For three weeks,and he died.

81
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,410
He died of natural causes,okay?

82
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,600
Okay.You got to give her back,Mary.

83
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,730
Steve,I can't return
her like she's an Xbox.

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,710
She's not an Xbox.She's
a little baby person,okay,

85
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,220
and this is a responsibility you're
gonna have for the rest of your life.

86
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,730
You're really killing my
buzz being a new mom.Thanks.

87
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,620
Yeah?Okay.I'm on the way.

88
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,290
I got to go.All right,listen,we'll
talk about this when I get back.

89
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,170
Bye.

90
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,730
Buddy,listen to me,the way I see
it,Mary didn't adopt a kid; you did.

91
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,580
All right,'cause it's only a
matter of time before that poor,

92
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,220
unfortunate child is looking for some suckling
at 3:00 a.m.,is gonna be looking to you.

93
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,020
No,there's gonna be no suckling,okay?
- No?

94
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,530
'Cause that baby is going back.

95
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,030
Oh,you're gonna send it
back,what,to the orphanage?

96
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,830
- With a bunch of other kids that nobody wants?
- What?

97
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,040
Yeah,no,it's a good idea.

98
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,950
I mean,it's probably a better idea
than leaving it with your sister.

99
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,120
Wait a minute,I thought
you didn't approve?

100
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,170
I don't approve.

101
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,710
Okay,whose side are you on then?

102
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,250
I'm on the side where the kid
has a chance of being loved.

103
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,150
If you think Mary is capable of
doing that,then I'm all for it,okay?

104
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,580
Gentlemen,what we have
here is a male victim.

105
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,980
C.O.D. is quite evident based
on the multiple stab wounds.

106
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,020
He was most likely
attacked in the water.

107
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,840
Maybe a couple of guys got territorial
over this break,and then it got out of hand.

108
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,070
A reasonable theory,but highly unlikely.

109
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,870
The victim's hands are noticeably
free of defensive wounds,

110
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,440
which suggests that the attack
was sudden and unexpected.

111
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,990
Okay,do we get an ID?

112
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,610
I was just getting to that.

113
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,390
Just spoke to a lifeguard
who patrols this area.

114
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,100
He said our vic's a regular,here every
Monday 9:00 a.m.,swell or no swell.

115
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,950
Okay,so predictable schedule,

116
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,110
he's hit up close and
personal,no defensive wounds.

117
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,600
Our victim could've been
attacked by somebody who knew him.

118
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,690
Our victim has been
identified as Bryan Carpenter.

119
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,410
Pinches for assault,drug
charges,grand larceny,

120
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,790
guy's been in and out
of trouble for years.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,440
Looks like his troubles
followed him out to sea.

122
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,390
{\a6}B******

123
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,410
Got signs of a break-in.

124
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,870
Place has been tossed.

125
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,890
Clear.

126
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,250
I wonder if they found
what they were looking for.

127
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,940
What is that?

128
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,500
Something under this drain.

129
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,060
This could be what
they were looking for.

130
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,050
There's something else in there.

131
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,520
- Oh,my God.
- Chin,what is it?

132
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,240
Our victim wasn't Bryan Carpenter.

133
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,680
M*****

134
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,910
His name is Matt Hutchins.

135
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
He was a cadet at the Police Academy

136
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,290
when I was teaching a class on executing
search warrants a few years ago.

137
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,120
Normally,I don't remember students,but
Matt asked a lot of really smart questions.

138
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,640
One day,he cornered me after class and
asked me what the job was really like.

139
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,510
The kid wanted to make a difference,but
wasn't even sure it was possible.

140
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,840
He grew up in a rough
neighborhood,drug dealing,gangs.

141
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,590
When I asked him,"Why be a cop?

142
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,160
" he said that "The game"
was the only thing he knew,

143
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,620
and that he would end up on
one side of it or the other.

144
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,430
He wanted to take the right path.

145
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,470
So he became a cop.

146
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,580
Well,Matt never got his badge.

147
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,310
He was busted for heroin possession.He
got kicked out of the Academy.

148
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,430
I was disappointed.

149
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,330
Special Agent Blake
Kennedy,ATF.I just got a call?

150
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,450
What happened to my guy?

151
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,210
Sorry.Your guy?

152
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,510
Matt,uh,Hutchins was working a
long-term undercover op for ATF.

153
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
I was his handler.

154
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,980
So he was never kicked
out of the Academy.

155
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,130
Kicked out?Hell no.That
was all part of his cover.

156
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,170
What was the op?

157
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,290
We had him infiltrate
a gang of gunrunners.

158
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,300
A network with ties to
Asia and the mainland.

159
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,360
Matt's job was to ID the
players and record transactions,

160
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,410
and we were just about to
drop the net on these guys.

161
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,990
Another few weeks and Matt
would've a career bust.

162
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,280
If you guys were that close,we
have to assume one thing...

163
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,000
Matt's cover was compromised.

164
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,920
How?

165
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,630
He was attacked this morning.

166
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,210
We believe he was deliberately targeted.

167
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,460
- Where?
- Baby Makapu'u Beach.

168
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,820
We were just there today.

169
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,920
A witness told us that he
surfed there every Monday.

170
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,650
My son and I go there every Monday.

171
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,790
Well,he couldn't break cover,but I'm sure
that was his way of keeping an eye on you.

172
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,720
Do you know who did this?

173
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,190
We believe it had something to
do with his undercover assignment.

174
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,690
Those people he was
investigating,he hated them.

175
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,970
- How often did you two speak?
- Every few weeks.

176
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,260
A text here,a quick phone call there.

177
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,120
Always from a different number.

178
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,060
But the last time,his
tone was different...

179
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,030
- How so?
- I don't know.

180
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,200
He sounded happy.

181
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,110
So I was under the impression that maybe
it was coming all coming to an end and...

182
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,770
he'd be home soon.

183
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,170
My husband sacrificed
everything for that job.

184
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,150
Lieutenant,you need to find
the bastards who did this.

185
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,640
This is the guy we're after,J.C.Dekker.

186
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,220
He spent his wayward youth on the North Shore
making a name for himself in the ice trade.

187
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,830
Now,ten years ago,he moved
his operation into town

188
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,340
and he upgraded his clientele,focusing
primarily on weapons distribution.

189
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,290
Guys right below him have been
there since the first dollar.

190
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,360
Everyone else has been
recruited along the way.

191
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,870
Looks like Matt worked his
way up the chain of command.

192
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,190
Well,like I said:
That was Matt's talent.

193
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,640
He was able to talk the
talk,and that earned him respect.

194
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,780
And when it came time,he wasn't
afraid to use some muscle.

195
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
When I first sent him in,we
didn't know what to expect.

196
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,610
We thought it was a
six-month op at most.

197
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,150
But Matt's intel was so good,we soon
realized we were sitting on a major case.

198
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,200
Right,now that Matt's gone,so are
the chances of taking these guys out.

199
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,790
That's why I like Dekker for this.

200
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,350
Motive,means,opportunity.

201
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,640
What about these
guys?What happened to them?

202
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,710
KIA.

203
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,350
As tight as Dekker's operation
is,he has his problems.

204
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,700
In the last few months,these dirtbags
have been robbed a number of times

205
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,030
by a three-man crew we
have yet to identify.

206
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,570
How were these robberies going down?

207
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,200
It wasn't any
street-level,crime-of-opportunity stuff.

208
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,400
I mean,we're talking
well-coordinated hit-and-runs.

209
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,640
Cash drops,they were there.Guns
in storage,they were there.

210
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,380
All right,well,maybe Dekker
thought Matt was selling 'em out.

211
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,850
Giving information to the guys
who were ripping off his boys.

212
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,720
Or maybe Dekker figured
out Matt was a cop.

213
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,320
I mean,either way,Dekker had at
least two motives to kill this kid.

214
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,540
- We're gonna need everything on this case.
- Yeah.

215
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,330
Linda,can you come
over here for a moment?

216
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,090
Linda Davies,this is Steve
McGarrett,Detective Danny Williams.

217
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,330
They're with Five-O.

218
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,040
Now,Linda transcribed
all of Matt's reports.

219
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,410
She'll get you everything you need.

220
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,940
Of course.Right this way.

221
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,200
This is everything.

222
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,850
Ms.Davies,do you mind if we ask
you how well did you know Matt?

223
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,500
We actually never met.

224
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,830
I've listened to his voice
for the past four years.

225
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,670
I transcribed every one of his reports.

226
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,900
So I could tell when he was having
a good week and when,when it was bad.

227
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,810
How did he sound in his last
few reports?Anything unusual?

228
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,510
Did he mention any threats?

229
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,600
If you're asking me if his cover
was blown,I can tell you this:

230
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,450
the longer you leave an undercover out
there,they get tired and depressed,sloppy.

231
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,050
They start making mistakes.

232
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,750
It's not my place to say this,but I,

233
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,080
I really think we had enough to
take these guys down months ago.

234
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,970
What makes you say that?

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,330
I've been working this
job for a while now,

236
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,870
and I've seen this department
take people down for much less.

237
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,680
If we would have done
what we normally do,

238
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,490
I-I just can't help but wonder
if Matt would still be alive.

239
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,630
All right,are you gonna say it or am I?

240
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,580
I'm not saying anything.I'm not
ready to start pointing fingers.

241
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,540
Okay,I'll say it.

242
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,020
If the ATF could have made an
arrest months ago,why didn't they?

243
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,260
Keeping Matt out there past his sell-by
date could have compromised his cover.

244
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,380
Dismantling an operation like
this,it is not as easy as it sounds.

245
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,790
Think about Matt,all right?

246
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,530
This guy,maybe he,uh,maybe he got
tired,maybe he missed his family,

247
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,930
maybe somewhere he slipped up.

248
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,190
Maybe he slipped up,and maybe
Kennedy kept Matt out there too long

249
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,040
because he cared more about making his case
than he did about looking after his boy.

250
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,950
Maybe,but like I said,

251
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,040
I am not ready for pointing fingers
until we have something that is real,okay?

252
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,510
I'll tell you what's real: J.C.Dekker.

253
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
And let me tell you something else.

254
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,940
If he suspected for one second that Matt
was a cop,he would take care of business.

255
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,870
I agree.But to go rattle that
cage right now is a terrible idea

256
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,590
because we could blow the ATF's
entire three-year operation.

257
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,710
So we'll tread lightly.

258
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,430
Got your attention now or what?

259
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,620
Hey,hey,hey,what happened
to "tread lightly," huh?

260
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm giving you three seconds
to get your hands off my throat.

261
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,120
Or what?

262
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,920
How's your girlfriend look in black?

263
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,530
Sit.

264
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,150
Now listen to me very carefully:
You're done mouthing off.

265
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,560
I'm gonna ask the questions from now on.

266
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,210
You're just gonna nod yes or no.

267
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,110
Bryan Carpenter,do you know him?

268
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
That's not technically a yes or a no.

269
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,260
I'm gonna take it as a yes.I'm
also gonna assume that you did this.

270
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,360
What happened?

271
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,520
This morning,where were you?

272
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,210
Complying with the state's unconstitutional
invasion of my physical sovereignty.

273
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,070
Come again?

274
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,740
I was peeing in a cup for
my P.O.You can ask him.

275
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,930
Okay,well,that still doesn't
mean you didn't order the hit.

276
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,300
Why would I do that?

277
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,960
Bryan was my friend.

278
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,500
Let's assume that you're telling
the truth again for two seconds.

279
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,780
Why would somebody want to kill him?

280
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,350
I have no idea.

281
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,750
And why do you care
about one of mines anyway?

282
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,520
Shouldn't you be celebrating at a
donut shop or something right now?

283
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
That sounds excellent.

284
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,340
Get up.

285
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,470
Now here's your itinerary for
the next couple of days: nothing.

286
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,430
You don't move from here,you understand?

287
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,080
HPD's gonna sit on your place
until we straighten this out.

288
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,070
If I hear that you leave,even
to take your library books back,

289
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,340
Detective Williams and I,we're gonna come back
and we're not gonna be as courteous next time.

290
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,570
Well,that was very subtle.

291
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm sure he's calling whoever killed
Matt right now and telling 'em to lay low.

292
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,290
What are you talking?He
didn't order the hit.

293
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,610
Did you see the look on his
face?He didn't know anything.

294
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,220
Okay,well,if that's the case,

295
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,300
then we have to consider the
possibility that Matt was dirty,okay?

296
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,350
- Dirty.
- Yes,dirty,okay?

297
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,710
If he was selling information to the crew that
ripped off Dekker and he slipped off somewhere,

298
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,560
it would've gotten him killed.

299
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,110
Danny,Matt was a cop.

300
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
I know he was a cop,okay?

301
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,890
I knew plenty of guys back in New
Jersey that were undercover for so long,

302
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
they ended up slipping; they
didn't know what the line was.

303
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,070
Just-Just wait.Just wait.

304
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,760
Yes,Mary?Wait...what?

305
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,830
And so it begins.

306
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,800
Salmonella?Really?

307
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,680
- I shouldn't have eaten that egg salad on the plane.
- Yeah.

308
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,690
Mary,this is exactly what
we were talking about before.

309
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,270
Steve,bad eggs have nothing to
do with my parenting skills,okay?

310
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,000
I could be a good
mother,just not right now.

311
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,230
I really need you to watch Joan for
me 'cause I have to stay her overnight.

312
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,730
- No!No,no,no!I can't do that.
- Steve,you have to.

313
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,640
- Mary,no,Mary...
- I don't have anybody else to call!I have to stay here over...

314
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:43,490
Mary,I'm in the middle,I'm in the
middle of a homicide investigation.

315
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,710
Okay.I'll just call
Child Protective Services.

316
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,760
And Joan will have to be placed with
a foster care family for a while.

317
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,360
I just hope that the trauma doesn't
affect her cognitive development.

318
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,960
Cognitive?You don't even
know what that word means.

319
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,740
You're a horrible uncle,you know that?

320
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,380
- This funny to you?
- Yeah!

321
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,330
So when you're through amusing yourself,

322
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,970
I need you to wipe down
her changing pad,please.

323
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,590
Not at all.I'm retired,you see.

324
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,560
And it's gonna be way too entertaining to
see Uncle Steve on diaper duty.So go ahead.

325
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,820
Hey,why is there a baby
attached to your chest?

326
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:31,100
- Mary.- Say no
more.Yeah.Mazel tov.- Thanks.

327
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,440
Anyway,I was able to track down

328
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,150
- the manufacturer of the key we found at Matt's house.
- Oh,good.

329
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,950
It traces back to a set of locks
that they sold to Honolulu Zoo.

330
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,200
Oh,let me see that.

331
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,270
Actually,you know
what?Here,just for a second.

332
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,280
- What?
- Thank you.

333
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,310
- Take care of it.
- Yeah,yeah.

334
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,180
- Okay,Danny,let's go.
- Okay.

335
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,780
- Wait.
- If she gets hungry,bottle in here.You got it?Let's go.

336
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,800
Wait...how am I supposed
to know if she's hungry?

337
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,590
Oh,you'll know.Trust me,you'll know.

338
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,340
Sato?

339
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,070
I don't know any Sato.

340
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,010
You know for somebody who likes to
gamble,you don't have a very good poker face.

341
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,090
Your name is Hideaki
Kuroda.You're Sato's moneyman.

342
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,180
You have a wife.You have
two children.Rosie and Kin.

343
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,710
Now,Rosie,she's very
talented at the piano.

344
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,750
And Kin,well,he aced math,but
he needs a science tutor.Right?

345
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,240
Oh,and you just brought,um,a
brand-new sports car.For your mistress.

346
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,550
So far,so good?

347
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,460
I also know that you
want out of Sato's crew.

348
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,130
But you can't because you've been
gambling with your boss' money.

349
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
And you've been losing.

350
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,330
Trying to cover it up,moving the money
around from place to place.But that hole?

351
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,090
Yeah,that hole just keeps
getting deeper.And deeper.

352
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,870
Now if I know this,Then really it's only a
matter of time before Sato figures it out.

353
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,170
And when he realizes that
he can't get his money back

354
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,490
because you lost it at blackjack
and craps,and roulette and horses,

355
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,360
he is gonna hurt you in
the worst way that he can.

356
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,540
Now,we can help you,Mr.Kuroda,

357
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,070
but you first you got to
tell me where I can find Sato.

358
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,810
What business do you have with Sato?

359
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,690
I don't give a damn about Sato.

360
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,440
I just want to ask him where
I can find Adam Noshimuri.

361
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,580
HO******

362
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,220
There it is.There are the lockers.

363
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,660
B-24.

364
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,610
You still think Matt's not dirty?

365
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
FIVE*****

366
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,960
Okay.We got over a $100,000 cash.

367
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,030
Explain to me how is it that an
undercover cop has this kind of money?

368
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,790
I can't.Okay?I can't.But
that doesn't make him dirty.

369
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,290
Steve,he had the key to that
locker hidden in a shower drain.

370
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,530
He did not want anyone
to see this cash...why?

371
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,300
Maybe he was getting paid for inside information
by the guys that were ripping off Decker.

372
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,040
That's a big maybe for
a guy who put his wife

373
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,930
and his son's lives on the backburner
for three years to take Dekker down.

374
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,670
Don't mind the smell.Yeah,I
know.Strained peas.

375
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,420
Only partially digested.Here,could
you,uh...Thanks.

376
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,900
- Did you,uh,get anything besides throw up?
- Funny.

377
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,090
I ran the credit histories
on Matt and his wife.

378
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,200
Nothing unusual...they
live paycheck to paycheck

379
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,060
just like most honest hard-working
civil servants on the island.

380
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,890
Can we focus over here?

381
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,180
Yeah,you ran the finances,no
surprises.Good,what else we got?

382
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,020
I dumped Matt's phone.

383
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,420
The only thing of note
was a series of phone calls

384
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,850
to a local real estate
agent all in the last week.

385
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,910
Name of Cherie Tranton.

386
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,170
Real estate agent?That
seem strange to you?

387
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,500
Maybe the lease is
up on,uh,on his place.

388
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,520
Ah,yeah,or maybe he was looking to buy
some property and launder some of this cash.

389
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,680
I'll check in with Agent Kennedy.

390
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,850
See if he knows anything about
the money or the real estate agent.

391
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,880
You know what,Chin?Hold
off on that for now.

392
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,770
Let's take a look at
Matt's field reports first.

393
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,420
I want to keep ATF out
of the loop for now.

394
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,740
Well,Kennedy had all the
same intel Matt did.You know?

395
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,160
Oh,I see.So I'm crazy,my-my theory
is nuts thinking that Matt went bad,

396
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:39,000
but your new amazing idea is Matt's
handler was the one giving information

397
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,250
to the guys that ripped off Dekker.

398
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,820
Well,I'm just saying it's possible,okay?

399
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,820
We all heard what
Kennedy's transcriber said.

400
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,560
Kennedy could've pulled Matt out
and taken the case down weeks ago.

401
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,080
That would explain why Kennedy
kept Matt out in the field so long.

402
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,570
Right.So let's just take a
closer look at the transcripts.

403
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,420
See if we're missing anything.All right?

404
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,370
- What are we doing?
- It's your turn.

405
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,180
- My turn for what?
- We're a team.

406
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,400
Danny,everybody's got to put in 110%.

407
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,500
Look at this...that's 110% right there.

408
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,480
Chin and I,we're gonna go talk to Dekker
see if he can shed some light on this cash.

409
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,540
In the meantime,while
you're on babysitting duty,

410
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,590
run background on
this real estate agent.

411
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,680
See if there's any connection between
Dekker's crew and Cherie Tranton.

412
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,340
And try not to let her drool on
the evidence.We're gonna need it.

413
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,350
Smart kid.Uh,I got an idea.

414
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,970
Uh,why don't I step up for the
team and,uh,Chin and I will go out.

415
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,920
You stay here,make those calls,and
deal with,your soiled niece here?

416
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,200
Change her soon.You
understand?Or she gets a rash.

417
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,930
Oh,does she?

418
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,630
Diaper bag's in Steve's office.

419
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,970
Bottles are in the fridge.

420
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,760
You're gonna need that.

421
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,770
Why was this in a storage locker
belonging to your dead friend?

422
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,340
Let me guess.There's a
hundred grand in there.

423
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,480
How did you know that?

424
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,820
'Cause I gave it to him.

425
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,100
Bryan asked me for a loan.Said he'd
get it back to me by the weekend.

426
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,650
Wait a minute...a guy asks you
for a hundred thousand dollars

427
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,690
and you just give it to him?

428
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,390
Yeah,I trust my friends.

429
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,480
What he want the money for?

430
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,200
I don't ask for details,man.

431
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,360
What I don't know won't put me in a box.

432
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,910
Now if you're done harassing me,I'm gonna
get some fish tacos with my police escort.

433
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,610
If Matt didn't steal that money...

434
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,940
Yeah,it throws some cold water on the
theory that he was dirty.Hey,Dekker?

435
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,530
I'm done talking until
I get my money back.

436
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,500
Oh,you mean this donation to the Widows and
Orphans Fund?That's very generous of you.

437
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,790
Now,listen,why don't you tell me about
this crew that's been ripping you off...

438
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,770
who are they?

439
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,610
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

440
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,870
Those guys that have been hitting you are
probably the guys that killed your friend.

441
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,950
Well,then I sincerely
hope you catch them.

442
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
Okay,listen to me.

443
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,290
I know you've been taking
some big financial hits lately.

444
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,900
Okay?So I want to do you a favor.

445
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,640
I'm going to extend our police presence.

446
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,670
You and everybody in your life is
gonna be protected by HPD 24-seven.

447
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,350
Just to make sure you feel safe.

448
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,810
We're gonna have eyes
on you day and night.

449
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,950
Yeah,good luck in the import/export biz.

450
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,700
Enjoy your tacos.

451
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Wait.

452
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,170
I got something that might help.

453
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,570
This is an in-house surveillance video from a
local gang getting ripped off by another crew.

454
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,120
What's in the crates?

455
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,020
Guns,drugs and other party favors.

456
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm more interested in
the guys behind the masks.

457
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,430
Is there any way we can
ID these guys,Charlie?

458
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,950
There's always a way.

459
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,130
I'll call you when I got something.

460
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,230
All right,thanks,buddy.

461
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,900
Hey,Charlie?It's good to have you back.

462
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,950
Once upon a time there
was a very handsome prince.

463
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,990
And this,uh,handsome prince had
a very beautiful black stallion.

464
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,680
And this black stallion was,uh,was
admired by everybody in the kingdom.

465
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,210
He was the fastest and
fairest stallion in the land,

466
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,260
about 528 horsepower,very
nice stallion,anyway.

467
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,430
Uh,one day,uh,this
incredibly handsome prince...

468
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,280
Yeah,he was,he was out
of sight,let me tell you.

469
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,310
He was partnered up with a mean ogre.

470
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,660
A disgusting,hairy ogre.

471
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,320
It was not a match made in heaven.

472
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,090
They would slay dragons
together from time to time.

473
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,150
And they'd argue all
the time and,of course,

474
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,730
the brilliant charming prince would-would win
those arguments because the ogre was a dope.

475
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,550
Despite their,uh,victories,there
was a dark cloud that loomed.

476
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,830
Because...the dopey ogre coveted
the handsome prince's stallion,okay?

477
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,540
And he was a very greedy,selfish
ogre with-with major control issues.

478
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,160
And he would never let the handsome
prince ride his own stallion.

479
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,150
Hold on,we're gonna
pick this up in a second.

480
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,000
Great,it's the real estate agent.

481
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,910
Hello.Yes,yes it is.

482
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,010
Uh,that's perfect.I can,uh,I can meet
you there.What's,uh,what's the address?

483
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,180
That was fast.

484
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,160
Making up for lost time.Check it out.

485
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,580
I got a clean screen
capture on one of your guys.

486
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,920
We can estimate height,weight,shoe size.

487
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,430
If we run those traits through
the HPD arrest database?

488
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,200
We're gonna get dozens of matches
and then lots of possible suspects.

489
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,150
But...if we measure Pupillary distance,which
in this case is 63.2 millimeters,

490
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,610
and we combine it with
all of the other traits,

491
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,970
it narrows the field considerably.

492
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,580
Aloha,Joey Tillman.

493
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,900
Okay,what do we
got?Robbery,guns,assault,more robbery.

494
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,200
This has to be our guy.

495
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,740
You know,SWAT's on its way.Maybe I don't
need to ask this,but should we wait?

496
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,350
That's what I thought.

497
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,750
Cover!

498
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,910
Looks like we got three shooters.

499
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,910
These guy move weapons for a
living.They're gonna be armed to the teeth.

500
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,560
We're gonna need more guns.

501
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,220
You should've waited for SWAT.

502
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,820
You really want to do this now?

503
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,340
Hold fire!

504
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,640
This is HPD SWAT!

505
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,910
Drop your weapons and come
out.You are outnumbered.

506
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,850
This is your one warning.

507
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,240
That's Tillman.

508
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,910
Clear!

509
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,690
Clear!

510
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,220
Hey,yo.You'll want to
come take a look at this.

511
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,440
Same crates we saw in
the surveillance videos.

512
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,610
These have got to be the guys
that've been ripping off Dekker.

513
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,930
All right,let's get an
alert out right away.

514
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,350
I thought you said there
were three shooters.

515
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,670
There were.Third guy
must've slipped out the back.

516
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,890
Oh,he slipped out the back.

517
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,290
Well,that's exemplary work,Commander.

518
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,560
Steve.Take a look at this.

519
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,850
Entry wound's in the back of the head.

520
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,220
We didn't kill these guys.

521
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,980
The third shooter did.

522
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,930
Oh,you mean the guy that
escaped on your watch?

523
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,770
On my watch?You were standing right
next to me when this went down.

524
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,450
See,it wouldn't have gone down if you just
waited a little bit and let SWAT do its job.

525
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,680
But,hey,like I
said,exemplary work,Commander.

526
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,650
- All right,listen up.We got a shooter on the run.
- So why does he shoot his own guys?

527
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,400
Well,maybe he's tying up loose ends.

528
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,200
Which could be the same
motive for killing Matt.

529
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,910
Maybe this third shooter knew that
Matt was getting close to the crew.

530
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,430
We need to work out what
Matt wanted that money for.

531
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,540
All new construction,brand-new
carpeting,engineered quartz countertops.

532
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,740
And there's a great school district
for your little girl,when she's ready.

533
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,580
Oh,no,that's,uh...that's very nice.

534
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,810
She's,uh...she's actually a friend
of mine's.I'm just babysitting.

535
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm,uh...I'm single.

536
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,740
Oh,my.Well...

537
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,030
So refreshing to meet
somebody who's so...giving.

538
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,660
You must be a very warm person.

539
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,510
And you're so fit.

540
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,760
Oh,thank you very much.

541
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,940
I just appreciate a man who
can wear a pair of pants.

542
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,260
- Okay.
- Well...

543
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,570
Now,this condo's got a great layout.

544
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,560
Although...there's
only one bedroom.Wink.

545
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,130
Look at that.She said
"wink,wink," and then she winked.

546
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,210
So tell me...

547
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,260
what winds of fortune have blown
your little ship into my harbor?

548
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,560
Matt Hutchins,actually recommended you.

549
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
- Mr. Hutchins!
- Yeah.

550
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,840
- Oh,did he rent the apartment for you?
- Yes,he did.

551
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,110
I have to say,this was a first for me.

552
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,040
I mean,I have people who
come and want to window shop,

553
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,310
but I've never had someone want
to rent a condo for just one day.

554
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,490
Well,uh,yeah,one day.That's
all we need it for.

555
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,540
- Today's that day,so...here we are.
- Tomorrow,silly.

556
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,600
Tomorrow,yes,of course.Tomorrow's
that day,that's what I meant.

557
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,720
You know,for $1,000,you boys must
have something scintillating planned,

558
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,740
so you better keep Cherie's
number in your phone.

559
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,670
Homeowner's association doesn't
like little side deals like this,

560
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,180
so it's our little secret,okay?

561
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,870
All right.Cherie,you're very naughty.

562
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,680
Honey...you have no idea.

563
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,160
You are gonna love this view.

564
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
Wow,very nice.

565
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,880
I know.

566
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,480
Hey,Steve.Something you
gotta see.Come down here.

567
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,000
It seems like Matt was running surveillance
on the lockers where we found the money.

568
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,950
You know what,if you're gonna
hold the baby in the sun,okay,

569
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,550
just ask me and I'll
put a sunhat on her.

570
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,690
You know what,though?The question is,why
would he be doing surveillance on the lockers?

571
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,860
Okay,Matt recorded all the times and
dates of Dekker's weapons transactions.

572
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,170
- Right?
- Yeah.

573
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,100
The crew that was ripping Dekker
off had all that information.

574
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,650
Are you thinking that Matt thought
that someone in the ATF leaked it?

575
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,150
I think he was building a case.

576
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,010
I mean,he could have borrowed
the money off of Dekker,

577
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,590
planted it in the lockers to set up
whoever was leaking that information.

578
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,030
If that were the case,he would have planted
the misinformation in one of his reports.

579
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,400
Now look at this...Here's an entry
about the money drop at Honolulu Zoo.

580
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,040
Set to be dropped off at 9:00
a.m.,picked up at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

581
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,470
All right,that's a two hour
window for the money to be stolen.

582
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,090
Yep,we were right.Matt was
setting someone up at the ATF.

583
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,230
Kennedy.

584
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,150
He could have been selling information
to Tillman about Dekker's operation.

585
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,180
That's why he kept the case open
and Matt undercover for so long.

586
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,590
He was onto a good thing,he
didn't want it to end.

587
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,480
Well,he keeps his hands clean,and
he gets a cut of the profits.

588
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,280
And then when he found out
that Matt was on to him,

589
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,760
Kennedy got one of
Tillman's guys to kill him.

590
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,690
Where are you going?

591
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,430
I'm going to finish what Matt started.

592
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,120
You want to come?Let's do it.

593
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,040
All right,so listen up.

594
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Grab whoever picks up this money
the second they open the locker.

595
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,750
I want this entire place locked down.

596
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,460
I want men on every exit,and I want two men
every 30 yards around the perimeter.Let's go.

597
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,140
I wouldn't have done it this way.

598
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,460
Yeah,you don't say?

599
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,710
McGarrett,we should wait.

600
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,180
Let your suspect exit the
zoo,then you take him down.

601
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,880
That way,we don't get into a firefight
in the middle of all these civilians.

602
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,730
I want to secure the perimeter.Okay?

603
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,200
He's not going to escape this time.

604
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,980
He wouldn't have escaped last time
if you'd have just waited for SWAT.

605
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,700
I could've been dead
if I waited for SWAT.

606
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,570
Maybe.But there's a right way
and a wrong way to do things.

607
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,930
You don't like me.All right?I get that.

608
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,750
But I'm in command and control of this
operation I'm also the team leader,okay?

609
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,800
So you and your team,you can come
aboard with us or you can stand down.

610
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,910
Whatever you say,uh...Commander.

611
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,630
Nothing.Did you remember
to give Joan her bottle?

612
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
Of course I did.

613
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,470
You're texting Max right now,aren't you?

614
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,940
{\a6}MAX *****

615
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,440
No,I'm not.

616
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,770
You're a terrible liar.

617
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,030
I got something.

618
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,630
Black hoodie,straight ahead.Moving
fast,heading straight for the lockers.

619
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,070
Hold it right there.

620
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,720
- Took you long enough.
- Traffic.

621
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,970
Don't move a muscle.

622
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,180
Why?

623
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,810
Take a look around,Linda.

624
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,470
Look at where you are.

625
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,490
You see this room?You don't get
to this room by accident.It's over.

626
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,180
We know you were feeding Matt's
intel to your boyfriend here.

627
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,920
And we know that with that information,

628
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,500
he and two of his associates were able
to systematically rip off Dekker's crew.

629
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,370
Yesterday,this guy right here,

630
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,760
he put two bullets in the back of their
heads to make sure they kept quiet.

631
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,240
Now,who's to say he wouldn't have done the same
thing to you after you collected that money?

632
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,740
Matt trusted us.

633
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,670
No,we were his lifeline.

634
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,980
And y-you betrayed him.For what?Money?

635
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,880
- No.We just didn't want to go to jail.
- Shut up,Linda!

636
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,140
You make me understand.

637
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,330
Why'd you have to kill him?

638
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
Matt called a few weeks ago.

639
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,360
He wanted to know who had
access to his transcripts.

640
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,860
He suspected that his
reports had been compromised.

641
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,900
It was only a matter of time
until he traced that back to us.

642
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:48,780
I'm... sorry. I'm... so sorry.

643
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,550
You done here?

644
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,280
Now I am.

645
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,790
Maybe I should've...pulled Matt out.

646
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,160
You know,if I-I'd just
pushed the button sooner...

647
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,330
What say we go push it now?

648
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,920
What the hell is this?

649
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,730
There was nothing incriminating
on that tape I gave you.

650
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,630
- Where's my money?
- Where's your money?

651
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,180
Good news is,we got
your money and your guns.

652
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,300
Bad news is,we got your
money and your guns.

653
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,940
Allison,there's
something you need to see.

654
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,600
Hey,Matty.

655
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,640
You know,I often dream about
the kind of man you'll become...

656
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,340
your strength and courage,your
sense of right and wrong.

657
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,090
There are so many things a
father wants to teach his son,

658
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,240
and sometimes you
gotta teach by example.

659
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,210
In accepting this assignment,

660
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,250
I hope I've helped make this world the
kind of place you deserve to grow up in.

661
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,080
Son,there's always hard choices in
life,sacrifices that need to be made.

662
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,520
I just want you to know Daddy made this one
out of the love I have for you and your mother.

663
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,310
You take care of her,kid.

664
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,380
You're the man of the house now.

665
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,090
There we go.Come on.

666
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,230
Aw,no dings or scratches.

667
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,290
Looks like Uncle Steve did a good job.

668
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,740
I had a job to do,I did it.That's all.

669
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,540
Oh,admit it.You had a little
bit of fun.I just saw you.

670
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,880
I-I definitely had a lot of fun.

671
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah,she's a great kid,Mary.

672
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,980
Aw,thank you.Well,next time I
need a sitter I'll call on you two.

673
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,080
Excuse me for a minute here,please.

674
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,980
Yes,we all contributed,but I was
primary on this one,I'd like to say.

675
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,240
Okay,tough guy.

676
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,450
Say goodbye to your uncles!

677
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,290
Where-where you going?

678
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,600
You don't...what?You don't
need to rush off,do you?

679
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,600
Just stick around for a bit.

680
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,460
Yeah,we just,uh,wrapped up this case.

681
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,690
We got nothing on the
board,so we could...

682
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,260
- go out and get a bite to eat?
- Right.

683
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,400
Got plenty of strained peas.

684
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,910
Sorry,but we have Bouncy Baby Story
Time at the library in ten minutes.

685
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,280
- So say,bye,Uncle Steve!
- Bye...

686
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,150
Bye,Uncle Danny!Bye,Uncle Chin!

687
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,560
All right.Thank you.Bye,guys.

688
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,900
- Okay.- See
you.- Bye.

689
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,580
- What?- You're such
a softy.- Nothing.

690
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,010
- You okay?
- Never better.

691
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,870
Got a location on Sato.

692
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,000
Full surveillance package...address,structural
blueprints,security system,

693
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,640
activity logs for his
staff...Everything's there.It's all good.

694
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,530
You,uh...do all that by yourself?

695
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,590
What,you trying to put us out of a job?

696
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,690
No,just helping out a friend.

697
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,690
- Okay.
- Oh,and,uh...Here.

698
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,100
Thanks for the loaner.

699
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,740
You know what?

700
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,530
- Why don't you keep it?
- What?

701
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,160
Go ahead.

702
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,670
You need a job.We need some help.

703
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,130
Yeah.Trust me,this,uh,animal,he
needs all the help that he can get.

704
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,310
Don't think about it.Just say yes.
