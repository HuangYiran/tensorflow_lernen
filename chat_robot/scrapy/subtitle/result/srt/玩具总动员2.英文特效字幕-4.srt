107
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woody? - Woody? Honey, are you OK?

108
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:55,395
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ride 'em, cowboy!

109
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:59,993
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back! He's back early from cowboy camp!

110
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,935
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Places, everybody! Andy's coming!

111
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,038
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?

112
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:14,879
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap. Ride 'em, cowboy!

113
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:18,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I forgot. You're broken.

114
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:23,425
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna play with you anymore.

115
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,277
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!

116
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy. Andy.

117
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:51,077
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Woody.

118
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! Andy!

119
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:10,137
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wheezy, is that you?

120
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Woody. - What are you doing up here?

121
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:16,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought Mom took you to get your squeaker fix. Ed months ago.

122
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Andy was so upset. - Nah.

123
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,545
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just told him that to calm him down

124
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,607
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then put me on the shelf.

125
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:26,143
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why didn't you yell for help? - Well, I tried squeakin'.

126
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:28,986
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm still broken. No one could hear me.

127
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,726
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, the dust aggravates my condition.

128
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,804
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the point in prolonging the inevitable?

129
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:47,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all just one stitch away from here to there.

130
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:51,142
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yard sale? Yard sale!

131
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:54,910

132
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,418
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yard sale? - Sarge, emergency roll call!

133
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,545
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!

134
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,819

138
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:10,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate yard sales!

139
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,095
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone's coming!

140
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:18,099
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Let's see what's up here.

141
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:38,491
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Woody.

142
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,157
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wheezy! Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think.

143
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!

144

146
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's goin' on? He's nuts.

147
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:02,944
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His arm ain't that bad.

148
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,044
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do it, Woody! We love you!

149
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:07,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful on the steps, now.

150
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,604
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, boy. Let's go. And keep it casual.

151
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:36,083
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that casual.

152
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,785
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piggy bank coming through, coming through.

153
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:44,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is he out there? - There he is.

154
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:55,094
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in the box!

155
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:57,401
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's sellin' himself for 25 cents!

156
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,997
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're worth more than that.

157
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,339
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.

158
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,469
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's Wheezy! - Wheezy?

159
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:06,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.

160
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:13,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good boy, Buster. Hold still. There. There you go, pal.

161
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,755
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bless you, Woody. - All right, now.

162
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,452
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back to Andy's room.

163
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:20,687
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to go, cowboy.

164
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:24,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Golly bob howdy! - Woody, I'm slipping!

165

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!

166
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,043
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly! - Hey, that's not her toy!

167
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:39,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that little gal think she's doin'?

168
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:42,076
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy, Mommy, can we get it? Please? Mommy, please?

169
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,278
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want that toy. It's broken.

170
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,719
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a snake in my boot.

171
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:55,086
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Original hand-painted face. Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!

172
00:15:55,197 --> 00:16:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little rip. Fix. Able. If only you had your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...

173
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:04,434
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A hat! I found him! I found him! I found him!

174
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buster! Quiet down!

175
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:09,973
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ex. Cuse me. Can I help you? - Yes.

176
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can help take his paws off my pal.

177
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:14,949
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk.

178
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,747
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now, how did this get down here? - Hand her the sheriff.

179
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice and easy.

180
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:23,023
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Five dollars. - I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.

181
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,418
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now just walk away.

182
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:26,484
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait. - The other way.

183
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:29,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll give you 50 bucks for him. - Fifty bucks ain't bad.

184
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,959
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's not for sale. - Everything's for sale.

185
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,128
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Or trade. You like my watch? - Sorry.

186
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's safe. Way to go! - She showed him!

187
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,542
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Molly, don't touch that, sweetie. - Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.

188
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hold on. - What's up?

189
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:48,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, Buzz?

190
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:50,807
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

191
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he doing?

192
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:54,956
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't watch! Can someone cover my eyes?

193
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's stealin' Woody! - What? He can't take Woody.

194
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's illegal.

195
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's he going? - Do something.

196
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,594
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz!

197
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:04,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him, Buzz.

198
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the red jacket?

199
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:46,232
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would someone steal Woody?

200
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:27,573
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's review this one more time.

201
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,116
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At precisely 8:32-ish,

202
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:33,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ex. Hibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.

203
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:36,816
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ex. Hibit B, a composite sketch of the kidnapper.

204
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:41,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He didn't have a beard like that. - Fine. Etch, give him a shave.

205
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:43,931
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kidnapper was bigger than that.

206
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,899
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Picky, picky, picky. - Let's just go straight to Ex. Hibit F.

207
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:48,265
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kidnapper's vehicle.

208
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,668

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I reckon the new schoolhouse is finally done.

312
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

313
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jessie and Prospector are trapped in the old abandoned mine

314

00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:39,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now they're about to be blown to smithereens?

316
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,239
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ride like the wind Bullseye!

317
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:50,781
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fannin' the flames Jessie! It takes brains to put out that fire.

318
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,945
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My biscuits are burnin'!

319
00:26:58,225 --> 00:27:00,659
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety?

320
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:03,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can they reach Jessie and Stinky Pete in time?

321
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tune in net week for the eciting conclusion: "Woody's Finest Hour."

322
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,136
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! All right! Next tape!

323
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:13,065
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait. What happened? What happens next?

324
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,506
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on! Let's see the next episode! - That's it.

325
00:27:15,576 --> 00:27:16,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

326
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The show was canceled after that.

327
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,073
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait. What about the gold mine

328
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,674
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the cute little critters and the dynamite?

329
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it?

330
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:30,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two words: Sput-nik.

331
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,027
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys.

332
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how that feels. But still, my own show.

333
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I mean, look at all this stuff! - Didn't you know?

334
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,103
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, you're valuable property!

335
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:47,106
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish the guys could see this. Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.

336
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,266
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on a yo-yo.

337
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:54,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice teeth. And yet, still a good-lookin' guy.

338
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,142
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a bank! Cool.

339
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do? You push the hat, and out co...

340
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,887
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out come bubbles. Clever.

341
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,759
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. What's this thing do?

342
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it.

343
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"There's a snake in my boot."

344
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:19,498
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bullseye. Go long! Go long!

345
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:22,942
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A record player!

346
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,242
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen one of these in ages.

347
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,908
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, now. Slow.

348
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny, Bullseye.

349
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,512
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!

350
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:41,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not bad. - It's time for Woody's Roundup

351
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,628
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the very best

352
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,825
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the rootin'-est tootin'-est cowboy...

353
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at us! We're a complete set!

354
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,266
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now it's on to the museum. - Museum?

355
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What museum? - The museum.

356
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:02,072
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.

357
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,344
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's in japan! - Japan?

358
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:07,012
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to japan.

359
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:09,455
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

360
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got to get back home to my owner, Andy.

361
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,192
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look, look. See?

362
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,354
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He still has an owner. - My goodness.

363
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:19,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Can't go.

364
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,669
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't do storage again. I just can't!

365
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:24,795
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jessie. - I won't go back in the dark!

366
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:26,737
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter? What's wrong with her?

367
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,367
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we've been in storage for a long time

368
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}waiting for you.

369
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,376
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why me? - The museum's

370
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,541
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody.

371
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:39,916
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without you, we go back into storage.

372
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,649
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's that simple. - It's not fair!

373
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:44,452
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you do this to us?

374
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:47,517
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look. I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake.

375
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:50,654
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You see, I was in this yard sale... - Yard sale?

376
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:52,926
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner?

377
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,901
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to save another toy when...

378
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,633
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was it because you're damaged? Did this Andy break you?

379
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:03,609
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no! It was... It was an accident.

380
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I mean... - Sounds like he really loves you.

381
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not like that, OK? And I'm not going to any museum!

382
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:12,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not going back into storage!

383
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,282
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Al's coming!

384
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,915
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go! Go on, jessie.

385
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:19,357
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jessie, look at me.

386
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:23,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you'll come out of the box... Now go! Go!

387
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,105
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's show time!

388
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Money, baby. Money, money, money.

389
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:41,546
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, the main attraction.

390
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,071
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! His arm! Where's his arm?

391
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,849
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I gonna do? I know. I know.

392
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:05,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Come on! Come on! Pick up the phone!

393
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:07,256
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - It's me. It's Al.

394
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got an emergency.

395
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:10,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm busy. - Yes, we're all busy.

396
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,994
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. It has to be tonight.

397
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,694
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right. But first thing in the morning.

398
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:18,363
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gone! I can't believe it!

399
00:31:18,438 --> 00:31:21,066
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My arm is completely gone! - All right. Come here. Let me see that.

400
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a popped seam, easily repaired.

401
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You should consider yourself lucky. - Lucky?

402
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,939
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you shrink-wrapped? I am missing my arm!

403
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:32,178
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big deal.

404
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:36,986
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy

405

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is dying to play with a one-armed cowboy doll.

406
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:44,425
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, jessie, you know he wouldn't last an hour on the streets in his condition.

407
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:48,594
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a dangerous world out there for a toy.

408
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:13,526
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Nobody look till I get my cork back in.

409
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:16,757
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good work, men. Two blocks down and only 19 more to go.

410
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Nineteen?

411
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:20,928
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.

412
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, fellas.

413
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:25,364
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?

414
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:30,237
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van?

415
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You had to bring that up. - No, he didn't!

416
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:37,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!

417
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,848
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now let's move out!

418
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,694
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that concludes our broadcast day.

419
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go.

420
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:38,906
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy.

421
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:42,675
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna go back in storage because of me, remember? Just go.

422
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:45,649
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullseye... All right. All right.

423
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:50,951
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you have got to keep quiet. Come on.

424
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here. Attaboy.

425
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:01,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy.

426
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:17,947
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullseye. Cut it out.

427
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it.

428
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,252
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it.

429
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:54,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody's Roundup Come on it's time to play

430
00:34:56,422 --> 00:35:01,018
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Officer! I swear. What?

431
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,361
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in there. There you go. Cheap case.

432
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:16,033
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is the remote? Where is the remote?

433
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:20,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't I put it in the same place every... Here it is.

434
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is your problem?

435
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,293
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out.

436
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,057
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that.

437
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You think I did that?

438
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,859
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. The TV just happened to turn on,

439
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,267
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the remote magically ended up in front of you!

440
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You calling me a liar? - Well, if the boot fits...

441
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,434
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say that again.

442
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:53,842
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the boot fits.

443
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,473
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, cowboy.

444
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:06,052
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you like that? Take it back! Take it back!

445
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:08,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't think just 'cause you're a girl, I'm gonna take it easy on you.

446
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,423
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.

447
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:16,899
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how that television turned on,

448
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,233
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but fighting about it isn't helping anything.

449
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:22,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If I had both my arms... - The fact is, you don't, Woody,

450
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:25,041
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I suggest you just wait until morning.

451
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,307
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The cleaner will come, fix. Your arm... - And then I'm outta here!

452
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:34,246
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no. Bullseye, don't take it that way.

453
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's just that Andy... - Andy, Andy, Andy.

454
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:39,288
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all he ever talks about.

455
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,692
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?

456
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:54,637
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I remind you that some of us are carrying over six. Dollars in change?

457
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:57,801
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Losing health units. Must rest.

458
00:36:57,877 --> 00:37:01,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is everyone present and accounted for? - Not quite everyone.

459
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:03,707
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who's behind? - Mine.

460
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:11,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys. Why do the toys cross the road?

461
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,259
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not now, Hamm. - I love riddles. Why?

462
00:37:14,326 --> 00:37:17,124
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To get to the chicken on the other side!

463
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:21,293
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The chicken!

464
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,363
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, well. We tried. - We'll have to cross.

465
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,702
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

466
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:31,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not turning me into a mashed potato.

467
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:36,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is.

468
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,342
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must be a safe way.

469
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:45,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.

470
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop!

471
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,032
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

472
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:08,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop! I said "drop"!

473
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

474
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,418
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop.

475
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

476
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That went well.

477
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:06,599
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody.

478
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:13,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank goodness you're here.

479
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:16,238
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the specimen ready for cleaning?

480
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:49,674
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how long is this gonna take?

481
00:39:49,748 --> 00:39:53,047
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't rush art.

482
00:40:07,465 --> 00:40:09,956
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. It's closed.

483
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not preschool toys, Slinky. We can read.

484
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:20,008
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, joe, you're late.

485
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:21,601
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a ton of toys to unload.

486
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,943
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

487
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:25,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's go.

488
00:40:25,783 --> 00:40:29,048
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the sign says it's closed.

489
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:34,823
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no. All together. Now!

490
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:58,676
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, Nelly! How are we going to find Woody in this place?

491
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:02,708
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look for Al. We find Al, we find Woody. Now move out!

492
00:41:02,787 --> 00:41:06,416
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woody? - Woody.

493
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:17,194
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go.

494
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:20,657
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's for display only.

495
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:23,222
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You handle him too much, he's not gonna last.

496
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:26,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's amazing. You're a genius. He's just like new.

497
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,855
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

498
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:04,408
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could use one of those.

499
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:06,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could use one of those.

500
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, they make it so you can't defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.

501
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,792
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's extortion. That's what it is.

502
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,954
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I always thought the golden sector was the only...

503
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:30,528
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we could search in style.

504
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,696
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going there, Hamm. So how about letting a toy with fingers drive?

505
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I really that fat?

506
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:56,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - You're in direct violation

507
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,189
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of Code 6404.5,

00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

511
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're breakin' ranks, ranger.

512
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,098
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

513

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've got an AWOL space ranger. - Tell me I wasn't this deluded.

514
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:16,675
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No back talk! I have a laser, and I will use it.

515
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:19,237
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean the laser that's a light bulb?

516
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:23,979
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, space ranger.

559
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue.

560
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:08,583
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like printing my own money.

561

562
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,453

564
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:22,864
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Now you can go.

569
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what a good idea.

570
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,786
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, don't be mad at jessie.

571
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been through more than you know.

572
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:57,656
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not make amends before you leave, huh?

573
00:47:57,734 --> 00:48:00,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the least you can do.

574
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:11,771
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. But I don't know what good it'll do.

575
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?

576
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:25,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I get packed away again.

577
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,062
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, jessie. I know you hate me for leaving,

578
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,623
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I have to go back.

579
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still Andy's toy.

580
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:37,472
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. Andy's a real...

581
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid.

582
00:48:41,244 --> 00:48:43,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to him, you're his buddy, his best friend.

583
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:49,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when Andy plays with you, it's like even though you're not moving,

584
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:53,412
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you feel like you're alive, because that's how he sees you.

585
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know that?

586
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:59,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because Emily was just the same.

587
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,995
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was my whole world.

588
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When somebody loved me

589
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:11,068
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything was beautiful

590
00:49:11,174 --> 00:49:14,974
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every hour we spent together

591

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lives within my heart

592
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when she was sad

593
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:25,946
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was there to dry her tears

594
00:49:26,022 --> 00:49:31,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when she was happy so was I

595
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:36,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she loved me

596
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:43,102
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Through the summer and the fall

597
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:47,337
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had each other That was all

598
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,469
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just she and I together

599
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:55,041
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like it was meant to be

600
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:58,451
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when she was lonely

601
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:02,048
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was there to comfort her

602
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,561
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I knew that

603
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:11,624
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She loved me

604
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,175
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the years went by

605
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:23,872
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stayed the same

606
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:27,815
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she began to drift away

607
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:31,945
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was left alone

608
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:35,388
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still I waited for the day

609
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she'd say

610
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:41,557
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will always

612
00:50:46,236 --> 00:50:50,229
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lonely and forgotten

613
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:53,742
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never thought she'd look my way

614
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:57,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She smiled at me and held me

615
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:01,574
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like she used to do

616

622
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:28,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she loved me

623
00:51:45,794 --> 00:51:51,357
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never forget kids like Emily or Andy.

624
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:55,997
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they forget you.

625
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jessie, I... I didn't know. - Just go.

626
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:23,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long will it last, Woody?

627
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:26,759
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really think Andy is gonna take you to college

628
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or on his honeymoon?

629
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy's growing up,

630
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:35,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there's nothing you can do about it.

631
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:39,071
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your choice, Woody.

632
00:52:39,147 --> 00:52:43,277
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever.

633
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:48,346
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be adored by children for generations.

634
00:53:04,373 --> 00:53:08,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I to break up the Roundup gang?

635
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:27,493
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Woody, are you in here? - Nah. This one's empty too.

636
00:53:27,562 --> 00:53:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woody! Woody! - Woody!

637
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:33,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?

638
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:36,366
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why, no, I haven't. - Hey! He was talkin' to me!

639
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:38,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! He was talkin' to me! - Why, you...

640
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, all along,

641
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:44,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate,

642
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:49,246
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but in fact, the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in the shadows.

643
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the left in the shadows. Got it.

644
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:55,922
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Someone's coming. - Everyone, take cover.

645
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a big pile-up, but I don't want to bore you with the details.

646
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax. Number.

647
00:54:00,895 --> 00:54:02,157

648
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,891
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.

649
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:06,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's him. - The chicken man.

650
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:07,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny, he doesn't look like poultry.

651
00:54:07,568 --> 00:54:10,332
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the kidnapper, all right.

652
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:13,999
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.

653
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:24,916
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the piece de resistance!

654
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:27,783

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}imagine we added another zero to the price, huh?

657
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll pay anything you want. - Yes! Yes!

658
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:41,062
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a deal! I'll be on the next flight to japan!

659

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick. Into the poultry man's cargo unit.

660
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:46,638
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move!

661
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch my moustache!

662

666
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:39,146
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's ascending in the vertical transporter.

667
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,485
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everyone. Hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof.

668
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:46,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Buzz? - To infinity and beyond!

669
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:53,024
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you? Insane? We're wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.

670
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:56,129
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

671
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:58,933
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry.

672
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,517
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blast. He's on level 23.

673
00:57:18,592 --> 00:57:20,924
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we gonna get up there?

674
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:23,429
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe if we find some balloons, we could float to the top.

675
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:26,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up,

676
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:28,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}push the intercom and pretend we're delivering a pizza.

677
00:57:28,803 --> 00:57:32,102
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a ham sandwich... with fries and a hot dog?

678
00:57:32,173 --> 00:57:33,162
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about me?

679
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,969
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can be the toy that comes with the meal.

00:57:51,726 --> 00:57:54,422
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress.

685
00:57:54,528 --> 00:57:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head.

686
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:00,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Which way do we go?

779
01:03:43,197 --> 01:03:44,664
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, what is going on?

780
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:48,326

786
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:59,535
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been trained by Zurg himself to mimic my every move.

787
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,409
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz!

788
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,954
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a feelin' it was you.

789
01:04:09,022 --> 01:04:12,958
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My front end just had to catch up with my back end.

790
01:04:13,026 --> 01:04:15,324
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will somebody please ex. Plain what's going on?

791
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:18,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right, space ranger. It's a code 546.

792
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You mean it's a... - Yes.

793
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:23,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And he's a... - Oh, yeah.

794
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:27,571
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty.

795
01:04:27,641 --> 01:04:29,768
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, you're in danger here. We need to leave now.

796
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:32,368
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Al's selling you to a museum in japan!

797
01:04:32,446 --> 01:04:36,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. It's OK, Buzz. I actually wanna go.

798
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:38,344
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Are you crazy?

799
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:41,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, the thing is, I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,

800
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:44,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and these guys are my Roundup gang.

801
01:04:44,324 --> 01:04:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you talking about? - Woody's Roundup!

802
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:51,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's this great old TV show, and I was the star. See? Now look.

803
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:53,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! Look at me! See? That's me!

804
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is weirdin' me out. - Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.

805
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,403
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was all this merchandise that got packed up. You should have seen it.

806
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:03,408
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a record player and a yo-yo. Buzz, I was a yo-yo!

807
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:06,571
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "Was"? - Stop this nonsense and let's go.

808
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:07,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz.

809
01:05:09,983 --> 01:05:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't go. I can't abandon these guys.

810
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,718
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They need me to get into this museum.

811
01:05:15,822 --> 01:05:19,485
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without me, they'll go back into storage. Maybe forever!

812
01:05:19,593 --> 01:05:23,552
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, you're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything.

813
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,155
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a toy!

814
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:29,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done with me.

815
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:32,269
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what do I do then, Buzz? Huh? You tell me.

816
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:35,706
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me

817
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:38,836
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that life's only worth living if you're bein' loved by a kid.

818
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:42,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I traveled all this way to rescue that toy

819
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I believed him.

820
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,045
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you wasted your time.

821
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:56,021
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go, everyone. - What about Woody?

822
01:05:57,197 --> 01:05:59,427
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not coming with us.

823
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:03,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... But Andy's coming home tonight.

824
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,671
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting for him.

825
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:20,218
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only chance.

826
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:25,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again?

827
01:06:25,192 --> 01:06:27,126
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some life.

828
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:34,256
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is everybody OK? - Sheriff Woody!

842
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:18,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bigger and stronger too

861
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:12,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wouldn't you give anything just to have one more day with Emily?

862
01:08:12,232 --> 01:08:16,601
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, jessie. This is what it's all about: To make a child happy.

863
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,798
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know it. Bullseye, are you with me?

01:08:35,188 --> 01:08:38,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you keep forcing me to take extreme measures.

869
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,818
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last night, not jessie.

870
01:08:43,897 --> 01:08:47,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we have an eternity to spend together in the museum.

871
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:50,264
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not start off by pointing fingers, shall we?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prospector, this isn't fair.

874
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.

875
01:08:57,644 --> 01:09:03,139

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, finally my waiting has paid off,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!

879
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:19,057

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name is Buzz Lightyear.

881
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. I've always hated those upstart space toys.

882
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:28,172
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's stuck! What do we do?

883
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,607
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should I use my head?

884
01:09:32,012 --> 01:09:33,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Al!

885
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:37,842
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!

886

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}passport, beef jerky, very ex. Pensive over there.

889
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:48,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shower! I can skip the shower.

890
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:52,096
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just gotta get outta here now!

891
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:54,757
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! To the elevator!

892

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the last time.

895
01:10:11,484 --> 01:10:15,318
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Zurg! Watch out! He's got an ion blaster!

896

900
01:11:14,014 --> 01:11:17,882
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.

901
01:11:17,951 --> 01:11:20,852
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never give in. You killed my father!

902
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,016
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Buzz. I am your father.

903

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, you could have defeated Zurg all along!

905
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:42,741
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just need to believe in yourself!

906
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:46,336
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Prepare to die! - I can't look!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did it. I finally defeated Zurg!

908
01:11:58,425 --> 01:11:59,983
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father.

909
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally!

910

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go, go, go! - I got it!

913

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, are you coming?

914
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:47,361
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad.

915
01:12:48,372 --> 01:12:52,399
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good throw, son. That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!

916
01:12:52,477 --> 01:12:56,345
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a great dad. - Farewell.

917
01:12:56,447 --> 01:12:58,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone know how to drive?

918
01:12:58,282 --> 01:13:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slink, take the pedals. Rex., you navigate.

919
01:13:00,685 --> 01:13:03,586
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hamm and Potato, operate the levers and knobs.

920
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,055
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Strangers. - From the outside.

921
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, no. - He's at a red light! We can catch him!

922
01:13:13,364 --> 01:13:14,695
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Max. Imum power, Slink!

923
01:13:16,868 --> 01:13:19,234
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It turned green! Hurry!

924
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:21,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why won't it go? - Use the Wand of Power.

925
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Rex., which way? - Left! No, no! I mean right!

926
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:35,509
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right! No, I mean left! Left is right!

927
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:40,614

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy!

929
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,554
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I seriously doubt he's gettin' this kind of mileage.

930
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,396
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go right! To the right! Right-right-right-right!
