1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,733
混乱之子 前情提要
Previously on Sons Of Anarchy...

2
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,080
我来处理
I've got this.

3
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,337
Juice.把工具包拿来
Juice. Get the kit.

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,342
我得知道.....那是你下的命令？
I've gotta know...that was your call?

5
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:14,784
不是
No.

6
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:18,346
我来这和你谈笔交易
I'm here to make you an offer.

7
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:22,934
我会把Gaalan O'Shay交给你 附赠一船的枪支 绝不拖泥带水
Gaalan O'Shay. I will deliver him with
a shipment of guns open and shut.

8
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,195
你想得到什么好处
What's in it for you?

9
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:27,318
豁免俱乐部一切关于枪支的指控 包括过去和现在的
Immunity, for the MC for all gun charges.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,820
你必须重新审理一下Tara的案子
And you need to look at Tara's case again.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,970
我需要那笔交易
I want your deal.

12
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,676
哦，我很遗憾，那个交易已经不存在了
Oh, I'm sorry, that deal's no longer on the table.

13
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,294
还有其他的事待定
There are other things pending.

14
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:38,046
既然你们退出了枪支生意 就应该我们接手
You're getting out of the
guns-- we should have that business.

15
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:39,224
这是我们的地盘
This is our territory.

16
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,224
这是我们应得的
We own it. We deserve it.

17
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:43,974
嗯 感觉真不错
Yeah. That feels good.

18
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:46,480
打在人身上效果更好
They work even better on flesh.

19
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,570
把枪放下 放下
Put it down! Down!

20
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:50,824
可没办法让林相信 这不是我们设计好的
There is no way Lin's gonna believe we didn't plan this.

21
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:54,154
我们把中国佬惹火了 奥克兰州那边就会有麻烦了
We burn the Chinese, things are gonna jump off in Oakland.

22
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:55,755
那么我们将失去江湖平衡
Then we lose the balance.

23
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:57,505
Clay的庭审时间被提前了
Clay's trial has been moved up.

24
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:00,799
他们明天就会把他转送出去，我们需要帮手
They'll transport him tomorrow. Gonna need some help.

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,553
该死，这是Sierra-4-0
Shit! This is Sierra-4-0.

26
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:03,887
我们遭到袭击
We are under attack.

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,520
Bobby被击中了 情况不妙
Bobby's been shot.It's bad.

28
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,771
干得好 Jackson
Good job, Jackson.

29
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,813
我猜 呃 你们已经投过票了
I guess you, uh, had another vote I wasn't privy to.

30
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,670
是的，确实如此
Yeah, we did.

31
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,900
这次是全体通过的
This time it was unanimous.

32
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,000
天杀的你们到底干了什么？
What the hell did you do?

33
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,113
我们干掉了杀害你们的人的家伙
We killed the man that killed your men.

34
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,780
这就是你要告诉爱尔兰之王们的故事
That's what you're gonna tell the Kings.

35
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,125
是你把他们都干掉了？
Did you murder them all?

36
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:29,592
我告诉你 你所需要的真实情况 只有这样的说法 才能让我们脱身
I am giving you the truth you need--
the only story that protects both of us.

37
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:31,467
那些待定的方案 现在已经取消了
Those other complications I had pending are

38
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,616
这就是说 我决定接受与你的交易
now off the table, which means I've
decided to take you up on your offer.

39
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:38,934
你与我们合作对付帮会 作为交换
In exchange for your cooperation against the MC, you'll get

40
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,120
你将会在Pamela Toric的谋杀案中得到豁免
immunity from Pamela Toric's murder.

41
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:44,935
如果我从一个帮会成员体内 取出一颗今天劫持事件中的子弹
If I pulled a bullet out of a
club member from today's shooting...

42
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,492
那算是证据吗？
Would that be proof?

43
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:49,287
加上你的证词 那就是了
With your testimony, yes.

44
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:50,144
你只有这一次机会了 医生
You only have one chance at this, Doctor.

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,179
损失了一个你的人 我很遗憾
I'm sorry you lost a man.

46
00:01:56,268 --> 00:02:00,401
任何意外 都是在对付IRA时的连带损失
Anything that gets in the way of the cause
is just collateral damage to the IRA.

47
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,199
别侮辱我的智商 你要对付的可不仅是IRA
Don't insult me.That wasn't just the IRA.

48
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:05,292
你对Clay转运的事情一清二楚
You knew all about Clay Morrow's transport.

49
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,566
那就是为什么会发生野蛮的袭击事件--都是为了分散我的人力
That's what that wild gun chase was
all about-- to divert my manpower.

50
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,921
要是不这么做 死的人会更多
And without that diversion, you'd
have had a lot more dead sheriffs.

51
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,758
你指望我相信你的鬼话:
You expect me to believe that your lies and

52
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,396
你的这些诡计 都是为了保护我的人？
bullshit maneuvering was to protect my people?

53
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:20,925
随便你怎么想吧
Believe what you want.

54
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:24,319
我已经竭尽全力办成这件事
I did everything I could to make this work.

55
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,071
嗯 很明显 不是每个人都有好处
Well, clearly, it didn't work for everyone.

56
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,201
Morrow 和 O'Shay怎么回事？
What happened to Morrow and O'Shay?

57
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:32,963
冒了这么大的风险 就是为了自相残杀？
Why take such a huge risk just to kill each other?

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,241
Morrow 和 O'Shay打过20年的交道
Clay and Gaalan got 20 years of history together.

59
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:40,345
他们之间有很多交易 明里的或暗里背着IRA的
A lot of deals, both on and off the IRA table.

60
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:44,726
现在 我猜 不管他们之间什么交易 总之是谈崩了
Now, my guess is, whatever
deal they had set up went bad.

61
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:47,140
肯定会有妥协的办法
There's a lot of that going around.

62
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:52,914
我明白 这不是你理想的结果 但我从新闻看到的是
I know it's not the way you wanted it,
but from what I've seen on the news,

63
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,462
我已经履行了我所有的承诺
I delivered everything I promised.

64
00:02:56,668 --> 00:03:00,645
KG-9，IRA的军火供应商 本地军火贩子
KG-9's, IRA supplier, local gun dealer.

65
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,623
我已经完成我这一方的交易
I held up my half of the deal.

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,851
你确实是个聪明人 Teller先生
You're a very smart man, Mr. Teller.

67
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,112
我明白了 你是怎样爬到你现在的位置
I can see how you've risen to your rank.

68
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:16,499
不好意思 我是继位的
Unfortunately, I inherited it.

69
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,973
嗯 我们都有各自命数
Mm, we all have a destiny.

70
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,222
也许吧
Maybe.

71
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,735
我必须先做调查
We have to finish our investigation.

72
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:28,000
然后才能确定 你是否履行了你这一方的交易
Then I'll decide if you kept your end of the deal.

73
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:29,904
好吧
Yeah.

74
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:48,877
进展怎样？
How'd that go?

75
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,502
她知道她被耍了
She knows she got played.

76
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,073
她也知道 她达成所愿
She also knows she got what she needed.

77
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,855
我们得等着 看看结果如何
We got to wait and see how it lands.

78
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:57,923
是啊
Yeah.

79
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:02,150
我去把Connor找来 叫他把枪带到Wahawa保护区
Well, I got hold of Connor,
told him to take the guns to Wahewa.

80
00:04:02,153 --> 00:04:04,469
行 你们准备好了吗？
Okay. You good?

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,337
是的
- Yeah.
一切就绪 头儿
- Ready, boss.

82
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,375
我们随时待命 活跃得如同 在他老妈身上遗留的精华
I'm all over it, like jizz on his mama.

83
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,969
嗨 我妈早死了
Hey, my mama's dead, man.

84
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,681
那也不能阻止他
That won't stop him.

85
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,165
走吧 纹身佬
Let's go, Tattoo.

86
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,557
去你的 老大
Blow me, boss.

87
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,945
哦 谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

88
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,120
还需要点别的吗？
- Need anything else?
不用 没事
- No, I'm fine.

89
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,665
好吧 有什么需要尽管告诉我
- All right, let me know.
好的
- Okay.

90
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:42,846
喂
Hello?

91
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,198
早上好 医生
Good morning, Doctor.

92
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,191
呃 早上好
Uh, good morning.

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,752
我已经安排了跟ATF开会
I've been able to arrange a meeting with the ATF.

94
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:53,013
他们会安排证人保护计划
They'll be able to facilitate federal witness security.

95
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,680
我们将通过RICO法案来办这个案
We'll process through RICO.

96
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:58,400
我们将提供你和你家人的一切所需
We can give you everything you and your family need.

97
00:04:58,422 --> 00:04:59,818
好的
Okay.

98
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,903
我该怎样做？
How?

99
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,192
你必须来我的办公室 带上那个证据
You'll need to come to my office, with the evidence.

100
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,612
我去不了
- I can't do that.
为什么？
- Why?

101
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,349
我被人跟着
I have escorts.

102
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,282
到你的医院办公室怎样？
Your hospital office,can you make that work?

103
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,425
我想可以
I think so.

104
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,438
你现在在哪？
Where are you now?

105
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:20,205
呃 大概一个小时的路程 我...
Um, I'm about an hour away.I...

106
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,390
快到了我给你电话
I'll call you when I'm close.

107
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:24,722
那颗弹头还在吗？
Do you have the bullet?

108
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,417
在 呃 我得挂了
Yes. Um, I have to go.

109
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,740
嗨
- Hey.
嗨 感觉怎样？
- Hi. How are you feeling?

110
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,630
我看上去怎样？
How do I look?

111
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,393
看上去被干倒了
Like you been shot.

112
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,794


113
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,347
多谢 大夫
Thanks, Doc.

114
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,222
请进
Come on in.

115
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,176
早上好
- Morning.
你帮我弄一下
- Would you get those?

116
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,083
哦 好的
Oh, yeah, sure.

117
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:23,928
很烫哦
It's hot.

118
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:26,030
多谢你提醒
Thanks.

119
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,076
好了 宝贝
Here you go, baby.

120
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:35,000
你的那位 拉丁情人上哪了？
Where's your Latin lover?

121
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,315
和婊子们在一起
With the whores.

122
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:39,484
真的？
- Really?
哦 老天
- Oh, Christ.

123
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,843
别紧张
Relax.

124
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,589
嗨 宝贝 吃点炒蛋吧
Hey, babe, ready for some scrambled eggs?

125
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,348
Abel?

126
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,896
嗨 你还好吧 小家伙
Hey, you okay, buddy?

127
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,269
妈咪哪去了？
Where's Mommy?

128
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:03,900
你和他们谈过了吗？
Who'd you talk to?

129
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,524
我给Roarke说了 他没说什么
I spoke to Roarke. He didn't say much.

130
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,600
BBC的新闻报道这个新闻
The BBC have picked up on the story.

131
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,760
我把细节告诉了他
I gave him the details on how it went down.

132
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,140
August那边进展怎样？
And what about August?

133
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,000
我们还没工夫处理这事
We didn't have time to get into it.

134
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:19,740
他们还有些烂摊子要收拾
They had some duck-and-cover work to do.

135
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:22,370
好吧 等你们要谈的时候告诉我
Okay, well, let me know when you talk.

136
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,767
嗯 希望尽快
Aye. Hopefully soon.

137
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,700
我想 你这里已经加强了保护？
Think you got enough protection around here?

138
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,979
呃 我们有Hugh 和 Malloy 看着
Uh, got Hugh and Malloy.

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,170
怎么了？你们真的认为华人帮会来搞事？
Why? You really think the Chinese
will try and hit us here?

140
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:44,000
Lin要是知道Gaalan被干掉了 他可能会有所行动
Lin finds out Gaalan was
killed, he might make a move.

141
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,586
你把那批枪放在Wahawa保护区会很安全
Your guns will be safe at Wahewa.

142
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,286
我们能在附近的谷仓里 监视附近的所有情况
We can see everything coming and going at the barn.

143
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,548
好的
All right.

144
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:54,856
回见 Conn
Later, Conn.

145
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,429

146
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,246

- Hey, man.
嗨 兄弟

147
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,197
Jax要我们过来看看 枪支是否安全到达 
Jax wanted us to come by to make
sure the guns got here safe, right?

148
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:11,690
嗯 一切都万无一失
Aye. Everything....safe and sound.

149
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,645
嗯
- Yeah.
所有都在这吗？
- That all of them?

150
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,390
除了KG-9 其他都在这了
- Everything but the KG-9's.
很好

151
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:16,543
谢谢 先生们
Thank you, gentlemen.

152
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,005
不是吧
Really?

153
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:27,267
抱歉了
- Sorry about that.
不
- No.

154
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:35,150
别沾到头发上 
Not the hair, man.

155
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,230
别沾到头发上
Not the hair.

156
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:38,769
千万别
Come on.

157
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:40,938
千万别
Come on.

158
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,651
孤独地骑行在这尘世
Riding through this world all alone 

159
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,756
上帝将灵魂带走
God takes your soul

160
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,876
徒剩躯壳
You're on your own 

161
00:08:57,907 --> 00:08:59,721
如乌鸦掠过天际
The crow flies straight 

162
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,267
直飞远方
a perfect line 

163
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,297
缠绵在恶魔之床
on the devil's bed 

164
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,501
直至死亡
until you die 

165
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:12,999
才将这一世轨迹
Gotta look this life 

166
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:15,926
看个端详
in the eye 

167
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,999
混乱之子 第六季 第十二集

英文字幕：n17t01 翻译：Dena 校对：Wilsonyy


168
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,885
估计你看过了关于Gaalan的新闻
I'm assuming you saw the news
about what happened to Gaalan?

169
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:43,722
我看过了
I did.

170
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,429
你干的？
Was that you?

171
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,999
我也爱莫能助
Couldn't be helped.

172
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,727
很不幸
Unfortunate.

173
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,549
我的人在车里吗？
Is my guy in the van?

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,200
打开

175
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,523
那批枪 还有Gaalan的手下在哪？
Where are the guns, and Gaalan's men?

176
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,145
这也爱莫能助
This couldn't be helped, either.

177
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,000
你明白“复仇”是怎么回事吗？
Do you understand how vengeance works?

178
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,242
亲自动手才能解恨
The satisfaction comes from the doing.

179
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:31,875
他们杀了我的人
They killed one of my men.

180
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,605
差点杀了我的侄子
Almost killed my nephew.

181
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,951
这些必须由我来解决
I need to do something to make it right!

182
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,850
我们为你拿到了枪
We got you the guns.

183
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,392
Gaalan也死了 爱尔兰人元气大伤
With Gaalan dead, the Irish are hurt.

184
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
他妈的      我不需要他们伤元气
I don't want them hurt.

185
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,888
我要灭了他们
I want them gone!

186
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,693
Gaalan的副手是谁？
Gaalan's number two-- who is he?

187
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:53,862
Connor.

188
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:55,371
问他干嘛？
What about him?

189
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:59,765
把他交给我...然后 我再把你们的人放了
Deliver him... and then I'll let your man go free.

190
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,454
这可办不到
I can't do that.

191
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,386
这样的话...我也不能让你的人活着
Then... I cannot let your man live.

192
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:12,144
开战对我们都没好处
Starting a war drains both sides.

193
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:16,222
战争不是我挑起的 我是被迫参与
I am not starting it, I am joining it.

194
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,000
我们走    快点

195
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,721
去联络Marks
Let's reach out to Marks.

196
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:42,721


197
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,224
老天
Jesus.

198
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,079
我们还没开门
We're not open yet.

199
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,517
Lyla.

200
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,371
没事
He's all right.

201
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,226
可以谈谈吗？
Can we talk?

202
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:07,684
进来吧
In here.

203
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,113
把那些杂物拿掉 坐吧
Move some of that shit, have a seat.

204
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:15,717
怎么回事？
What's going on?

205
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:20,200
我得给你吐吐槽 老哥
I got to lay it out for you, hermano.

206
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,933
我忍了好久了
It's been coming for a while.

207
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,611
好吧 我听着
All right, I'm listening.

208
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:27,900
我们Byzlats帮会---恐怕要完蛋了
The Byzlats-- I'm afraid we're about done.

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,984
完蛋？
Done?

210
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,512
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,535
我是说 发生校园枪击案以后 
Look, when that shit

212
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:36,834
你把Renaldo的头轰掉了...那太让人抓狂了
went down with you and Renaldo, you
blowing him away... that was crazy.

213
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:41,564
但是 也没问题 好吧 我们的老大重出江湖了
But I was, like, okay, it's all
right, our OG is back in charge.

214
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:42,934
没错
Firme.

215
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:45,109
或许我们可以展示一些实力 开始招兵买马
Maybe we could show some weight, start recruiting.

216
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,456
嗨 我可没承诺要发展势力
Hey, nobody made no promises about growing.

217
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:49,784
这不是发展势力的问题
It ain't about growing anymore.

218
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,736
这是生存问题
It's about staying alive.

219
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:55,300
你把我们抛弃了 大哥
You bailed on us, jefe.

220
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:58,799
瞧 我知道你和摩托党合作经营Diosa
Look, I know you got Diosa with
the MC and you're all hooked up

221
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,474
还和Teller的老妈搞在了一起
with Teller's mom and shit, but

222
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,886
但是 我们还有自己的生意 老哥
we got business, too, ese,

223
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,353
你却不见影子....
- and you ain't been anywhere around...
嗨   嗨  
- Hey, hey!

224
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,481
我才从莫须有的谋杀案中脱身
I just got rung out for a murder that I didn't do!

225
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:11,649
关于Arcadio那些破事
All that bullshit with Arcadio...esas pendejadas!

226
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,760
我还被地方检察官盯得紧紧的
I got heat from the DA.

227
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:16,530
好好瞧瞧 Fiasco 我感觉快窒息了 你看不出来？
Check it, Fiasco, 'cause I feel like
I'm drowning here, you see that?

228
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:18,655
我们都快窒息了
We're all drowning here!

229
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,300
就是从你和混乱之子打上交道开始
Ever since you met the Sons!

230
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,100
我明白我们需要同盟
Look, I know we need alliances,

231
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:30,784
但是这个飞车党...除了招惹麻烦 狗屁不是
but this club... they ain't been nothin' but problems.

232
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:32,343
大伙都是这样认为的
Crew feels the same way.

233
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,242
那要怎样？你要我一走了之？这就是你来这儿的目的？
So what, you want me to move off?
That's why you're here?

234
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,568
不   不   不   不
- No, no, no, no, no.


235
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:37,920
不是那么回事 
It ain't like that, all right?

236
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,856
我们尊敬你 热爱你
Look, we got nada but respect and love for you.

237
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:46,524
真的 要是你离开我们 我们肯定会完蛋
Truth is, you step off, homes,
we are most definitely dead.

238
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:54,504
玛雅帮的Marcus Alvarez....他说要和你谈谈
Marcus Alvarez... he reached out, wants to talk to you.

239
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,700
他应该可以帮我们
Thinks he can help us.

240
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,994
兄弟 他怎么帮？
Dale!Help us how?

241
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:58,391
别这样
Come on.

242
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,215
我的意思是 我跟玛雅帮的人相处还好 但那只是....
I mean, I'm all good with the Mayans, but that's...

243
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,579
在奥克兰老家的交情
that's Oakland, homes.

244
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,687
就和他谈谈 听听他怎么说
Just talk to him, hear him out.

245
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:09,330
老乡帮老乡 这说得过去
The guys like the idea of brown helping brown.

246
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:13,834
要是你连坐下来谈谈都不愿意 大伙以为你根本不在乎了
You don't at least sit down with him, crew
reads that like you don't give a shit.

247
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,472
那我们就全完了
Then it's over, eh?

248
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,888
我也留不住他们了
I can't hold them together.

249
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:30,980
兄弟 好吧 你去安排吧
Orale.All right. Set it up.

250
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,141
兄弟
Orale.

251
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,479
嗨 宝贝

你在干嘛？
Whatcha making?

253
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:57,888
知道吗？Wayne在饭厅玩你的积木
You know, Wayne's out in the dining
room playing with your Legos.

254
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:01,999
我敢肯定 要是你去帮帮他 他可以建一个新房子
I'll bet he could use some help
building that new clubhouse.

255
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,428
他会和你聊天吗？
Does he talk to you at all?

256
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:13,952
不太聊
Not really.

257
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,708
他想他妈妈
He misses his mom.

258
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:20,652
来点绿茶
Green tea.

259
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:23,974
你饿了吗？
You hungry?

260
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,000
呃  不 谢谢
Uh-uh. No, thanks.

261
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,108
我什么也吃不下
I can't even keep anything down.

262
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:30,377
恶心比头痛更厉害
This nausea's worse than my headache.

263
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:34,856
好吧 明天中午再来看你
Well, we got to check you in by noon tomorrow.

264
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:39,000
要我给你的女朋友打个电话 让她给你带点什么？
You want me to call your girl, have her bring your stuff?

265
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,210
不再有什么女朋友了
There is no girl.

266
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:45,140
她 呃   回Frisco去了
She, uh... went back to 'Frisco.

267
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,110
回她前夫那儿
Back to her ex.

268
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,840
抱歉
Sorry.

269
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,967
要不我叫Wyne到你那拿点你用的东西？
Well, you want me to... send Wayne over
to your place, pick up whatever you need?

270
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,671
嗯 好的
Yeah. Sure.

271
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,370
好吧
Okay.

272
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,700
Gemma 我不太明白

我确实很感激你的帮助
I appreciate all this help.

274
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,999
我只是想知道
I just need to understand...

275
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:14,138
这是一种攻心战术吗？为了帮助你对付Tara？
is this all some kind of power
play-- helping me to hurt Tara?

276
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:26,185
Tara就要进监狱了
There's a pretty good chance...
that Tara's going to jail,

277
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:29,341
所以 她不需要我去对付她
so she don't need any more hurt.

278
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,474
但是 我确实需要一些帮助
But I'm gonna need some help.

279
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:39,333
我已经感觉到 我不再像以前那样 精力充沛了
It's been brought to my attention
I'm not as spry as I used to be.

280
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,312
所以 你需要我的帮助？
And you want me to help you?

281
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:44,788
嗯 我没精力再做一个保姆了..
Well, I can't afford a nanny...

282
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,862
所以 我没什么好选择
so my options are limited.

283
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,429
要不 是那位癌症叔叔Wayne
I got Uncle Cancer out there.

284
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,710
要不 是那些弱智的 身上满是精液味和Tig须后水味道的帮会女郎
I got some half-bright
croweaters reeking of cum and

285
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:02,468
还有 就是毒鬼老妈
Tig's aftershave... and I got the junkie mom.

286
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:05,459
喔
Wow.

287
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,169
我感觉我很特别
I feel special.

288
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,119
你背叛过我
You betrayed me.

289
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,586
但是 你又迷途知返了
But you bought it back.

290
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,830
并且付出了代价
And you paid the price.

291
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:28,273
我知道你很爱孩子
And I know how much you love that boy.

292
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,965
Jax永远不会让我接近Abel
Jax is never gonna let me near Abel.

293
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,530
我会说服Jax
I'll work on Jax.

294
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,220
你必须戒毒
You just get clean.

295
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:41,333
让自己回到正常轨道
Get yourself back on track.

296
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:43,774
还有 还是男人的那玩意好用
And go back to dick.

297
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,677
玩同性恋没意思
Girls are shit.

298
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,285
嗨 我还需要一些设备
Hey. I need some more supplies.

299
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:01,048
我得回圣托马斯医院去取
I have to head back to St. Thomas.

300
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,756
Rat陪你去
Rat will go with.

301
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:06,234
是啊 没他我可能就迷路了
I'd be lost without him.

302
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,809
需要我为Bobby做点什么？
Anything we need to do for Bobby?

303
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,416
让他别死就行
Don't let him die.

304
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:11,924
他没事的 走吧
He'll be okay. Let's go.

305
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:14,507
嗯        遵命 夫人
Mm. Yes, ma'am.

306
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:25,909
不是吧
Really?

307
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,563
这是医生的命令
Doctor's orders.

308
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:32,400
坐吧
Sit down.

309
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,977
我猜 一切都照计划实行了吧
So I guess it played out the way it was planned.

310
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,999
我指Clay的事情
Clay.

311
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,846
是的
Yeah.

312
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,999
除了Gemma和Tara意外出现
Other than Gemma and Tara being there.

313
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,463
注定会发生的 兄弟
Had to happen, brother.

314
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:08,716
为什么你改了主意 这次投了赞成票？
Why'd you change your mind, vote yes this time?

315
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:15,983
Clay罪有应得
Clay deserved the mayhem for what he did.

316
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,168
这一点我从没疑意
I never had any doubt about that.

317
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:27,000
但是第一次的时候...对于帮会来说 那不是最好的选择
But the first time... just wasn't best for the club.

318
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,693
对Jax也不利
It was no good for Jax.

319
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:37,074
但是这一次....就有道理了
But this time... it made sense.

320
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:42,503
是啊
Yeah.

321
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,649
真讨厌 得起来尿尿了
Hate when I gotta do this...

322
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,320
上一次你干那事是什么时候？
When was the last time you had your dick sucked?

323
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,333
我认为你现在干不了 兄弟
I don't think you're up to it, brother.

324
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:08,200
呃...去Diasa找找乐子吧 笨蛋
Uh... just... go to Diosa, shithead.

325
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,982
按个摩 找个妞 做做俯卧撑运动 
Get a massage, drop a few oxy, get some head.

326
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,848
你需要放松放松 兄弟
You need to unwind, man.

327
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:23,816
你让大家都很紧张....特别是我
You're making everybody nervous...especially me.

328
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,593
我没事
I'll be fine.

329
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,000
这可不仅仅是建议
It ain't a suggestion.

330
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,398
去吧
Just go.

331
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,072
West!

332
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:46,149
我尿的时候 帮我扶着我那玩意
You're gonna need to hold my dick while I piss.

333
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,329
最好用两个手
You're gonna need two hands.

334
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:52,236
他是认真的吗？
Is he serious?

335
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,411
是啊
Yeah.

336
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,488
他那玩意很大 你得用双手
He's huge.You're gonna need both hands.

337
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,776
快来啊
Come on!

338
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,184
别磨蹭了
Ain't got all day.

339
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:14,690
把那凳子拿过来
Get the seat.

340
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:27,622


341
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:37,000
兄弟 见到你很高兴 Marcus
Orale.Good to see you, Marcus.

342
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,800
我也一样 Nero
You, too, Nero.

343
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:40,986
谢谢你抽出时间来见面
Thanks for making the time, huh.

344
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:42,999
嗨 不用客气
Hey, it's all good.

345
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:46,596
恕我直言 我很好奇
I gotta say, though, I'm a
little more than curious about

346
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:51,204
你说你们玛雅帮能帮我们yzlats帮
your offer to my boy Fiasco--
Mayans helping Byzlats.

347
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,236
那要怎样操作？
How's that work?

348
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:57,028
外地人在Oaktown搞的事
Shit that happens in Oaktown don't stay in Oaktown.

349
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,587
对大家都有影响
It affects everyone.

350
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,039
搞什么事？
What shit is that?

351
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,442
我们有微妙的江湖平衡---我们 九指帮 华人帮
We got a delicate balance-- us, Niners, Chinese,

352
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:08,652
还有意大利帮之间---我们都有各自的地盘
Italians-- we all got our piece
and we all got our boundaries...

353
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,092
我们都从飞车党那里拿货（枪支）
and we all get our guns from SAMCRO.

354
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:13,244
一样价格 一样品质
Same price, same quality.

355
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:14,158
从生意的角度来说
But the nature of the business,

356
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:17,780
飞车党掌控了一切 Jax在做主
MC became the de facto referee,and Jax embraced that.

357
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,697
但以后不再是了
- But not anymore.
那确实
- That's right.

358
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:25,370
你知道 他们退出产生的真空--不仅是枪支生意的真空 还有权利的真空
You see, Sons pulling out creates a
void-- not just in guns but in power.

359
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:30,248
据说Jax打算把爱尔兰人的枪支生意转交给August Marks
Word is Jax is handing over the
Irish guns to August Marks...

360
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,706
那给黑鬼们增加了很多实力 兄弟
and that move gives black a lot of weight, ese.

361
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:35,300
从而破坏了江湖平衡
Upsets the balance.

362
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,486
给我们每个人带来了大麻烦
Makes a real problem for all of us.

363
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,904
有道理
Cea mon

364
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,000
你们找找飞车党 把这事摆平
Have a meet with the MC, work it out.

365
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,000
Jax大开杀戒之前 应该考虑到这些
Jax should've thought about
that before he started killing people.

366
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:47,942
不是我要召集碰头会
Not my meeting to call.

367
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:51,547
如今 我不得不和华人帮坐下来谈谈 看看有什么对策
Now I gotta sit down with the Chinese
and see what my options are.

368
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,300
你为什么告诉我这些
Why you telling me all this?

369
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:54,800
你们有交情 兄弟
You got a relationship, ese.

370
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,352
生意伙伴 我和Teller只是生意上的伙伴而已
Business partner. I'm just Teller's business partner.

371
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,963
我们在一起经营一家小妓院 你知道吧？
We're moving a little pussy, you know?

372
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:02,999
他们飞车党的事 我可说不上话
I got no say in what he does with his club.

373
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:07,021
玛雅帮正在 Stockton建立分部
Mayans are starting up a charter up in Stockton.

374
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:10,403
我们有20个人 来自Vegas 和 Oakland 发展会很快
I've got 20 members from Vegas and Oakland gonna make the jump.

375
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,464
就如同在Oaktown一样
Things play out in Oaktown the
way I think, it's gonna be brown

376
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:16,271
拉丁人和亚裔联合对付黑鬼和白鬼
and yellow against black and white.

377
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:21,000
眼下 我知道Teller和你自己的事情有了龌龊
Now, I know that puts you at odds with
Teller and your own streets, ese.

378
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,577
老天  有必要走到那步田地吗？
Jesus Christ, that's the way this is gonna go down?

379
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,333
只是提醒一下你 兄弟 仅此而已
Just giving you a heads up, mano, that's all.

380
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,372
那我最好保持中立
Best we stay neutral.

381
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:39,000
得了吧 兄弟 江湖上可没有中立可讲
Come on, ese, there ain't no Switzerland in the hood.

382
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:45,983
我们走吧
Let's roll.

383
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:57,890
我们接到一个电话 一个为我们生产子弹的家伙打来的
We got a call from one of the guys who press our bullets.

384
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,741
他们在3英里外找到那辆卡车
Wahewa found the truck about three miles from the barn.

385
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,769
你的那批枪支不见了 你的人也挂了
Your guns were gone.Your guys were dead.

386
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,969
老天
Jesus Christ!

387
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:08,945
谁干的？
Who did it?

388
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,611
Lin 肯定是他
Lin. Had to be.

389
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,900
也许是从这里就开始跟踪卡车 
Probably followed your truck from here, took 'em

390
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:17,539
等车离开大路 他们就下手了
out once they left the county road, man.

391
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,616
是啊
Yeah.

392
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,999
这一切都变得糟糕透顶
This is all going to shit!

393
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:23,366
这种事情是爱尔兰之王们最不愿听到的消息
This is the last thing the Kings will want to hear.

394
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:26,198
这就是为什么我们需要August Marks
This is why you need August Marks.

395
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:33,000
要是没有当地人的保护 你们的人就如同羊入虎口
Without local protection, you guys are
just drunk lambs at a wolf party.

396
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:35,830
Marks可以派3个团伙来这
Marks dictates to three crews out here.

397
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,998
其中一个九指帮 他们对华人帮可没好印象
One of which is the Niners, who
got no love for the Chinese.

398
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,003
和Marks谈谈
Talk to Marks.

399
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,666
至少你还有一个选择 可以呈报给Roarke
At least then you got an option to present to Roarke.

400
00:24:58,203 --> 00:25:01,048
好吧
- Okay.
就是
- Yeah.

401
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,465
很好 我来安排
Good. I'll set it up.

402
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,688
你在这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

403
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:20,666
West告诉我 说你要过来取点东西
West told me that you were
coming by to pick up supplies.

404
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:23,394
估计我应该能这在“犯罪现场”碰到你
Figured I'd meet you at the scene of the crime.

405
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,025
哇哦
Wow.

406
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:30,046
你说 要死多少个“孩子”才能把这地毯弄这么脏
How many dead babies does it take to ruin a carpet?

407
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,213
你到底想干嘛 Gemma？
What do you want, Gemma?

408
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,808
Wendy需要一些抗呕吐的药
Wendy needs some antinausea scrips.

409
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:40,521
嗯...对于Wendy的遭遇我很遗憾 但是我没药房的钥匙
Mm... I'm sorry for Wendy, but I
don't have the keys to the pharmacy.

410
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,555
我可以去看看医生休息室找点样品药
I can check the doctors' lounge for samples.

411
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:47,530
要不然 只有到停尸间找点抗呕吐的药
Otherwise, just pick up some Emetrol from Mort's.

412
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,344
好吧 Bobby怎样了？
Okay. How's Bobby?

413
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,800
哦 他会好起来的

414
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,350
但是我必须回来一趟
But I need to get back up there.

415
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:55,630
给我的律师取点资料
Need some files for my lawyer.

416
00:25:55,775 --> 00:26:00,487
然后 顺便从医院偷点需要的东西
Then I need to casually steal from
the hospital I no longer work for.

417
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:04,170
20分钟后 我们大门口见
I'll meet you out front in 20 minutes.

418
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:06,595

419
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:25,775

地方检察官大人

421
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,872

我叫Thyne Patterson
- Thyne Patterson.

422
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,404
哦 对了 
Oh, yeah, right.

423
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:36,012
有急事？
Pressing business?

424
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,179
是的
Yes.

425
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:40,318
我们有3个警员在昨天的枪战中受伤了
We had three sheriffs injured
yesterday in a shoot-out.

426
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:41,845
死了一个
One killed.

427
00:26:42,172 --> 00:26:43,602
也许你听说了
Maybe you heard about it.

428
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:45,988
是的 这种事情我经历太多了
Yeah, I'm familiar with some of that wreckage.

429
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,321
是吗
That's right.

430
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:48,801
对此深表同情
Sorry for your loss.

431
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,302
不 你才不会
No, you're not.

432
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,067
我对你也深表同情 这样我们就扯平了
But I'm not sorry for yours,
either, so I guess we're even.

433
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,485
一会我们在候诊室见
I'll meet you in the waiting area.

434
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:58,831
好的
All right.

435
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,999
你们的人为什么不去Stockon医疗中心？
Why aren't your guys
going to Stockton Med Center?

436
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:06,066
这里的眼科医生是全州最好的
The ocular trauma specialist
here is the best in the state.

437
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:11,463

Oh, right. Got to have
them eyes to see the bad guys.

438
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,522
你说的对
Yes, you do.

439
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,928
Padilla先生还好吗
How is Mr. Padilla?

440
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:20,422
还是那样 利用他的关系网到处拉皮条吗？
Still spreading sunshine with
the power of human connection?

441

嗯 是的
Oh, yeah.

442
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,521
他脑子里只有爱

祝你顺利
You have a good visit.

446
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:36,012
我要躲进小教堂里 去点上一根蜡烛
I'm going to just duck into
the chapel, light a candle.

447
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:39,304
也许你应该点上两根
Maybe you should light two.

448
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,693
Raymond Bowman 来自烟酒火器管理局

哦 我们应该等等她的律师
Oh, we should wait for her lawyer.

451
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:58,064
我...我没空给他电话
I... I-I didn't have time to call him.

452
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:00,160
呃 我们得快点

Gemma在楼下等我

454
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,982
她刚才来过
She's already been up here.

455
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:11,034
我们已经准备好了证人保护计划
We've prepared the WITSEC agreement.

456
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,471
包括了你的儿子
Included your sons.

457
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,195
由联邦法警负责实施保护
US Marshals will execute it.

458
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:17,106
免罪书将会由我的办公室签署

459
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,682
把它交给我的律师
Send it to my lawyer.

460
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,897
你把证据带来了吗？
Do you have the evidence?

461
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,180
能看看吗？
- May I?
不行
- No.

462
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:36,000
一旦免罪书和保护协议弄好了 我就会给你
You get it once I know both the
immunity and protection are set.

463
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:38,000
这可不是玩过家家的游戏 Tara
This isn't a game, Tara.

464
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,470
我知道这不是什么该死的游戏
I know it's not a goddamn game.

465
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:41,412
这是我的人生 把文件交给我的律师 Glender
This is my life. Send the documents to Glender.

466
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:46,405
只要他说我受到了保护...今晚我就带孩子去找你
He says I'm protected... I'll pick
up my boys and meet you tonight.

467
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,607
这种作法不妥当 知道吗？
Well, that's not how this is done, okay?

468
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,843
我们会派人和你一起去接孩子...
We'll send an agent with you
to collect your boys...

469
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:53,000
不许别人去接我孩子
No one is collecting my sons.

470
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:54,859
我不希望 他们对父亲最后的印象
The last memory of their father
will not be of them being ripped

471
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,700
是被手绑着 枪指着
from his arms at gunpoint.

472
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:57,983
我会自己应付
I'll handle it.

473
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:03,888
要我合作 只能这样办
That's the only way you get my cooperation.

474
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,036
我们会把文件交给你的律师
We'll send the papers to your lawyer.

475
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:12,258
等他签字确认了 你把孩子和证据带上 来我办公室
When he signs off, you come to my
office with the boys and bullet.

476
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,904
这样行吗？
Can we make that work?

477
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,838
我们也没什么选择了
Not much of a choice.

478
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,190
什么时候？
What time?

479
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,250
一旦他说没问题 我会在6点之前到你那
He says I should take
it, I'll be there by 6:00.

480
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,333
我们到时候见
We'll see you then.

481
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,000
她还没有完全拿定主意
She hasn't made up her mind yet.

482
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,386
是啊 这是个重大的决定
Yeah, it's a big decision.

483
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:38,965
她爱Teller 她从小父亲就不在身边
She loves Teller, and she grew up without a father.

484
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,167
憎恨往往会恶性循环
Hates having to repeat that pattern.

485
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,114
要是她耍花样怎么办？
And what if she bails?

486
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,247
如果她不出庭作证 我会在法庭上让她完蛋
If she doesn't testify, I'll bury her in court.

487
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:53,262
如果她带着孩子跑了 帮会将追杀她
If she tries to run with those boys, the
MC will hunt her down and kill her.

488
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,630
是的 都安排妥了 他们都会在那 
Yeah. It's all set up. They'll be there.

489
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,474
...我打发他去了Diosa
...so I sent him to Diosa.

490
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:11,105
他确实太压抑了
He's seriously twisted.

491
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:12,837
那小子需要放松放松
That boy needs to relax.

492
00:30:12,957 --> 00:30:14,360
没事吧 医生？
- What's up, Doc?
嗨 医生
- Hey, Doc.

493
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,187
哦 真不错啊
Oh, that's good.

494
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,892
又是酒精又是大烟
Alcohol and opiates?

495
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:22,747
下次 我得带个心脏起搏器了
Next time, I'll bring the defibrillator.

496
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,840

497
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,274

Oh, yeah, right, like you've
never had electrodes on your sack.

498
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,726
用直流电源？
- Direct current? 
是的 你懂的
- Yeah, you know.

499
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,237
那是做什么用的？
What does it do?

500
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:37,162
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

501
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,278
Bobby看起来好多了
Bobby looks better.

502
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:06,755
他不应该喝酒
He shouldn't be drinking.

503
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,027
他知道
He knows.

504
00:31:14,363 --> 00:31:16,361
这里完事了你会回家吗？
You headed home after this?

505
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:20,169
不
No.

506
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:24,278
我们跟爱尔兰人还有些事情要处理
We got some stuff to clean up with the Irish.

507
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,718
对我来说很重要
It's going to be a late one for me.

508
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:31,954
孩子们和Gemma在一起？
The boys staying with Gemma?

509
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,968

00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,952
去道声晚安吧 如果你想的话
Go say good night if you want.

511
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:45,741

512
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:47,374
会更好些
It's easier.

513
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:51,196
好吧
Okay.

514
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,921
你的案子完了以后 我们得想想怎么办
After your trial, we're going to figure all this out.

515
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:22,669
对不起
I'm sorry.

516
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,441

00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,133
有正事还是找乐子？
Business or pleasure?

找乐子 我想

535
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:07,559
你没事吧
You okay?

536
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,194

嗯
Mm.

540
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:26,140
这一切本来不该发生的
It's not like it didn't have to happen.

541
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,189
或者不应该这样对他
Or he didn't have it coming to him.

542
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:35,195
一切都会好起来的
It'll be good again.

543

抱歉
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:47,643
我有点失态了
I'm kind of high.

545
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:55,678

把衣服脱了
Get undressed.

547

换上睡袍
Put on a robe.

548
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:11,877
我会叫个姑娘上来
I'll send someone back.

549
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:15,415
喜欢哪种类型的？
Preference?

550
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,621
温柔一点的
Someone nice.

551
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,088
好的
Okay.

552

哦 嗨 亲爱的
Oh, hey, darling.

553
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:34,972
他还没回来
He's not back yet.

554
00:35:35,545 --> 00:35:36,813
还在Stockton
Still in Stockton?

555
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,026
估计是
Think so.

556
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,571
Clay的事情很遗憾
Look, sorry about Clay.

557
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,776
嗯
Yeah.

558
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:47,788
来一杯吧
Grab a drink.

559
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,228
我在帮Juice找个女伴
I'm getting Juice a date.

560
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,330
Juice来了？
Juice is here?

561
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,506
是啊
Yeah.

562
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:57,311
他有点...不对劲
He's a little... undone.

563
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,536
是的 确实
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

564
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:03,174
嗨 来了位伙计...
Hi. So, I got this guy...

565

太谢谢你了 亲爱的
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

566
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:05,494
别客气
You're welcome.

567
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,981
你必须躺在床上 好好休息
You need to stay in bed and get some rest.

568
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:14,227
没问题
Not a problem.

569
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:27,035
大伙都很爱你 医生
We love you, Doc.

570
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:40,033
他怎样？
How's he doing?

571
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:43,111
他睡了 我也要洗漱上床睡了
He's resting. I'm just
gonna wash up and do the same.

572
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:44,656
我快累坏了
I'm exhausted.

573
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,435
听上去不错
Sounds like a plan.

574
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:09,721
你和Roarke谈过吗？
Did you talk to Roarke?

575
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:10,946
嗯
Aye.

576
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:13,092
他的反应可不太爽
It wasn't a cheerful response.

577
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:15,380
但是他也清楚 我们没有太多选择
But he knows we have limited options.

578
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:19,686
他会和其他几个长老谈谈 会谈结束后给他电话
He's gonna talk to the other Kings,
wait for my call after the meeting.

579
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:22,877
好的
Okay.

580
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:27,801
这是Marks
This Marks?

581
00:38:28,147 --> 00:38:29,858
这是大老板
That's the boss.

582
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,442
不 不 不
No, no, no. No!

583
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:42,174
你这混蛋 Teller
You piece of shit, Teller.

584
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:44,806
别担心 不会有事
Don't worry. It ends well.

585
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,328
爱尔兰之王们会把你钉在十字架上 小子
The Kings will crucify you, boy.

586
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:49,132
把你们所有的人都屠杀干净
Fierce slaughter on every one of you.

587
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:52,963
Connor先生 谢谢你的参与

588
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:56,333
你把我的人放了 我才把他交给你
You don't get him, until I get my guy.

589
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:08,096
Happy

590
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,389
你没事吧？

枪还在车里
Guns are still in the truck.

593

00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,922
Knowles 医生 我是Thyne Patterson
Dr. Knowles.Thyne Patterson.

599
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:48,002
你和你的律师谈过了吗？
Have you spoken to your lawyer?

600
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:49,872
没有 怎么了？
No. Why?

601
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:52,950
他做了一些细微的修改 但是他同意我们给你的交易
He made a few tweaks, but
he likes the deal we made for you.

602
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,833
希望我们继续进行下去

We'll expect to see you by 6:00.

605

好的
Okay.

606
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,672
我告诉过你没事的
- I told you it ends well.


607
00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:14,214
要是那个老家伙一开始就给我脑袋来一枪?
What if the old man put a
bullet in my head at first sight?

608
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:17,346
那会怎么样？
- Then what?
那是你们的风格 不是他的
- That's your style, not his.

609
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,657
是的 因为他会把你带回他的仓库
Yeah, 'cause he would
take you back to his warehouse,

610
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:23,381
把你折磨一番 然后再割断你的喉咙
torture you for a while,
then he'd slit your throat.

611
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,248
这种行为太野蛮了
This is some real cowboy shit here.

612
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,614
这是必须的 要把华人帮打跑
It was necessary. Sets the Chinese back.

613
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:32,529
让你瞧瞧Marks展现的诚意
Lets you see what Marks can provide.

614
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,381
你听命于他？
And you answer to him?

615
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:38,839
Marks先生和Pope先生一样 都是我们的恩主
Mr. Marks, like Mr. Pope, is our benefactor.

616
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,534
他保护我们的利益
He protects our interests.

617
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,145
我们也为他提供保护
We protect his.

618
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,768
我们要等到天黑
We gonna wait till after dark.

619
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:48,559
把这个面包车停在Lin的餐馆门前
We gonna park the van in front of Lin's restaurant.

620
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,295
这就是发表一个声明
That'll make a statement.

621
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:58,229
幸会
- It was good meeting you.
是啊
- Aye.

622
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,732
再见
See you soon.

623
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,490
不 别再见
No, you won't.

624
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,052
得了吧 Teller
Come on, Teller.

625
00:42:04,174 --> 00:42:05,346
别开玩笑
Who you kidding?

626
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:12,683
那么 奥克兰那边怎么办？
So, what does it do to Oakland?

627
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:16,315
不太清楚
It unravels a little.

628
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:19,780
我让Marks给你详细解释
I'll let Marks break it down for you.

629
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,482
他马上到
He's on his way.

630
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,261
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

631
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:32,377
我不管这些小东西有多可爱 现在不是1896年那时候
Look, I don't care how
cute they are, this isn't 1896.

632
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:33,624
我们不做易货生意
We don't barter.

633
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:36,010
它们的毛皮很值钱
Their fur is very valuable.

634
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:40,062
我们可以把它们养大 然后做成毛皮大衣或者帽子
I figured we'd breed them, and make coats. Or hats!

635
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:41,870
软软的 毛茸茸的帽子
Little soft, furry hats.

636
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:43,919
我们只收现金和信用卡
We take cash or credit.

637
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,428
我们会失去这个好机会
We're missing an opportunity.

638
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:48,901
我会被毛球呛到的
I'm gonna choke one of little
fur balls out right in front of you.

639
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:51,019
真是无可奈何
I barely accept that.

640
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,670
抱歉
Sorry.

641
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:02,870
我这蹩脚的办公室主任 尽然想用维修费用和别人换几只金毛鼠
My crack office manager, wanting to trade repairs for chinchillas.

642
00:43:03,402 --> 00:43:05,586
我觉得不太奇怪
Somehow that doesn't surprise me.

643
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:12,590
今天不太顺？
- Bad day?
一言难尽
- Complicating.

644
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,191
我帮会的破事
Shit with my crew.

645
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:17,337
想聊聊吗？
Want to talk about it?

646
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,507
请帮帮忙 Juice出事了
Help! Please! There's something wrong with Juice!

647
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,954
哦 老天
Oh, my God.

648
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:24,761
怎么回事？
What happened?

649
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,194
我在给他按摩 让他翻过身来
I was rubbing him down, asked him to flip over.

650
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,496
然后他就摊到地上了
Next thing I know he was on the floor.

651
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:29,487
老天 Juice Juice
Jesus! Juice! Juice?

652
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:30,233
嗨
Hey.

653
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:31,561

654
00:43:31,664 --> 00:43:34,566
Juice Juice 他的眼神呆滞
Juice, Juice.His eyes are pinned.

655
00:43:34,665 --> 00:43:35,716
好吧 醒醒

让我们把他扶起来
- Let's get him up.

656
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:38,628
醒醒 宝贝 
- Come on, baby, let's go.
他吃了什么？
- What did he take?!

657
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:39,748
和我在一起的时候 什么也没吃
Nothing with me.

658
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,353
他刚进来的时候 就已经很不正常了
He was pretty high when he came in.

659
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:43,231
好吧 查查看 垃圾桶
All right, check the trash.

660
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:46,188
来吧 Juice
Here. Juice?

661
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:48,496

Hey, man, come on.Come on, man.

662

- Shit.

663
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:52,643
止痛片
Oxy.

664
00:43:52,886 --> 00:43:55,064
哦 兄弟 你真是个笨蛋 那里有多少？
Aw, man, you idiot.How many?

665
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:56,728
如果是装满的话 应该有6片
If they were full, six.

666
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:59,917
让我看看 80多克 太糟了
Let me see.80s. That's bad.

667
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:01,193
醒醒
- Come on.
嗨 兄弟
- Hey, man.

668
00:44:01,295 --> 00:44:03,389
要打急救电话吗？
- Should I call 911?
不
- No!

669
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,580
呃 是的 把那个给我
Uh, yeah, all right.Give me that.

670
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,161
我扶住他
- I'll hold them.
把那桶子递给我
- Give me the can.

671
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,560

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,544
醒醒 宝贝
Come on, doll.

673
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:14,210
听着 宝贝 要是你咬我 我就把你的舌头挖出来
Okay, baby, you bite me,
I'll rip your tongue out.

674
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:15,378
来吧 
Come on, here we go!

675
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:25,212
真是多姿多彩的生活啊 老妈
Glamorous life, mama.

676
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:27,207
对了 宝贝 继续 继续
That's right, baby.Come on, come on.

677
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:29,759
很好 很好
There we go, there we go!

678
00:44:45,468 --> 00:44:47,034
很抱歉 这一天的血腥味 先生们
Sorry for the bloody day, gentlemen.

679
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,028
发生这种事情让人惭愧
It's a shame this had to happen.

680
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:54,411
要干大事 从来就不容易
That kind of call, never easy.

681
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,979
但是 我要是被逼无奈 我很乐意再干一次
But one I'm willing to make if I got to.

682
00:44:57,406 --> 00:45:01,071
我们都清楚了 你乐意和不乐意干的事情
We're well aware of what
you're willing and not willing to do.

683
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,174
是啊 其中一件他们愿意做的事 就是扩大你们的营销渠道
Yeah, well, one of the things they're
