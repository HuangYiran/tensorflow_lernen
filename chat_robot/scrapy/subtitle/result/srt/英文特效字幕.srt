00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see how it's done?

3
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,757
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

4
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:25,597
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better. The boss will chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.

5
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,432
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

6
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're at 26 feet.

7
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,519
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You let Jason operate the drill?

8
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he can handle it.

9
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,604
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do anything.

10
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,184
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

11
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,594
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it, Jack! It's too late!

12
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,108
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna make it!

13
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,486
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

14
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,801
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack! Give me your hand!

15
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,035
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got you!

16
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,181
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What were you thinking?

17
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:56,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's happening?
-The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

18
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,883
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what's happening!

19
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,743
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate
shift, which occurred 1 0,000 years ago.

20
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:28,086
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores...

21
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an ice age...

22
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,056
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which lasted two centuries.

23
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm confused.

24
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:41,424
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

25
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:48,007
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can
trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain.

26
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:53,209
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate
to the North Atlantic Current.

27
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

28
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:03,381
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

29
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:07,118
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...

30
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,194
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there goes our warm climate.

31
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:15,131
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

32
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:19,261
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Maybe in 1 00 years,
maybe in 1 000. But what I do know is...

33
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,776
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that if we do not act soon, our children
and grandchildren will have to pay the price.

34
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,474
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

35
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:33,519
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

36
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the
cost of doing nothing could be even higher.

37
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,658
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our climate is fragile.

38
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,027
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment...

39
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the ice caps will soon disappear.

40
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:50,935
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor Hall...

41
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:54,166
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.

42
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:58,369
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.

43
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,079
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off...

44
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was about the size of Rhode lsland.

45
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:07,384
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

46
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!

47
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,323
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi...

48
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,023
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.

49
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:22,796
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos...

50
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.

51
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,397
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taxi!

52
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:31,239
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

53
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:34,905
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

54
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:40,988
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.

55
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:43,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.

56
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:46,654
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
-That's me.

57
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:49,524
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've read your work on ocean currents.

58
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:54,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you say to a spot of tea?
-Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

59
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,035
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here.

60
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:20,753
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United...

61
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,558
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Ieads 3- 1 over hometown Celtic.

62
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:29,632
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We return 63 minutes into
the second half as Manchester United...

63
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:33,707
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Iooks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator...

64
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,707
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Donald MacFarland.

65
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,278
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Yeah.

66
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,246
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
-Yeah.

67
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:44,852
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The baby kept us awake all night.

68
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,819
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And still.
-Yeah!

69
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:04,673
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dennis? NOMAD buoy 431 1 is showing
a temperature drop of 1 3 degrees.

70
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah? Where is 431 1?
-Well, it's....

71
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:15,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Georges Bank.
-It's rough seas out there.

72
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must have knocked it about.

73
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

74
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:34,503
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, kick it now. Kick it!

75
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Kick it!
-Are the lads winning?

76
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:40,504
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, professor. How was lndia?

77
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:43,237
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

78
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,382
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All dancing girls, wine and parties.

79
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:32,584
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday...

80
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:37,785
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...slamming into the island chain with a
cataclysmic force never before witnessed.

81
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:42,331
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meteorologists already believe this to be
the strongest hurricane ever recorded....

82
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,901
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna get that?

83
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will surely leave a wake of death....

84
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:51,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello?
-I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.

85
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:55,342
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

86
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,573
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

87
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have time to talk about this now.

88
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe you ought to make time.

89
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:08,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.

90
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:09,922
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don 't understand.

91
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

92
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:17,765
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam's getting on a plane?
-He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team.

93
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:22,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They're competing in New York.
-Sam joined a team?

94
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
-Oh.

95
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

96
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,807
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go because I'm on call tonight.

97
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:32,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be late. I don't want
him taking a taxi again.

98
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,981
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

99
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,495
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four, room B.

100
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,191
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack?

101
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,801
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're good at rubbing people
the wrong way...

102
00:13:56,975 --> 00:14:00,172
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but why would you aggravate
the vice president?

103
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:03,314
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because my 1 7-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

104
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:06,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your 1 7-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

105
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,912
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who cares if he hates you.
-My son doesn't hate me.

106
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,021
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If Raymond Becker pulls our budget--

107
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,524
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, shit!
-Wait-- Will you--? Jack.

108
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,427
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

109
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,104
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Dad, the cab's already here.

110
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,246
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay. I'll take care of it.

111
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,745
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are--?
-Here you go.

112
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:41,483
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

113
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:44,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do you want to hear my side of it?
-How can there be two sides?

114
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:48,755
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me...

115
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:51,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...because I didn't write the solutions.
-Why not?

116
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do them in my head.

117
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:57,165
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you tell him that?
-I did. He didn't believe me.

118
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said if he can't do them in his head,
I'm cheating.

119
00:15:00,573 --> 00:15:03,667
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

120
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:06,375
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I said.

121
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,279
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did?

122
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How'd he take it?
-He flunked me, remember?

123
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,787
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

124
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:22,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

125
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:27,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

126
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,631
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll straighten this out.

127
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:30,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you can't park there.

128
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Don't worry about it.
-Sam?

129
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,101
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam.

130
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,588
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Parker, this is Houston.

131
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.

132
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn 't look like you're coming back
this week.

133
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,523
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wife's gonna give me an earful.

134
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger that.

135
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,666
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It' s enormous.

136
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

137
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:45,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's afraid of flying.

138
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine.

139
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:59,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence...

140
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:03,854
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

141
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,232
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I can't remember if it's a--
-Shut up, Brian.

142
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Sam...

143
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,904
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

144
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're still serving drinks.

145
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:32,486
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Folks, it appears we're gonna have a bit
of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.

146
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,686
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables...

147
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:40,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and seat backs in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.

148
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,466
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

149
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,628
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab it. Watch out!

150
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:16,968
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

151
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,966
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam.

152
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,938
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have my hand back?

153
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe I'll be alone
with my mom.

154
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday.

155
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

156
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:51,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

157
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you too.

158
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:56,711
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

159
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

160
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:03,814
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cause of this extreme weather remains
a mystery, although some meteorologists...

161
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,921
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing....

162
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:12,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is very odd. There' s a buoy registering
a 1 3-degree drop in ocean temperature.

163
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:16,524
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

164
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

165
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:22,896
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

166
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,437
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

167
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,872
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are the odds of two buoys failing?
-Remote.

168
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that three.

169
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:54,394
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 1 0 blocks long.

170
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,837
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust...

171
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they're polluting the atmosphere.

172
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,841
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

173
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,209
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're almost there.

174
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,549
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're only two blocks away.
-Let's walk.

175
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:40,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's gotten into them?

176
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:45,511
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

177
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:51,888
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In 1 532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro...

178
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:57,659
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...defeated this lncan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

179
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is his name? Time.

180
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,295
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Montezuma.

181
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:06,203
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

182
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:09,311
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's, like, Anta-something.

183
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,148
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Atahualpa?
-That's it!

184
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,147
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time's up. Correct answers, please.

185
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:23,921
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

186
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:26,463
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next question.

187
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:34,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

188
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:44,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.

189
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,248
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, look at all these nerds.

190
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,046
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

191
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,479
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

192
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,184
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look beautiful.

193
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:59,055
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks. This place is incredible.

194
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,221
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you believe this is their cafeteria?

195
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,162
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You played a great first round.

196
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:05,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So did you.

197
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:08,233
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

198
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm Laura.
-Oh, I'm J.D.

199
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:13,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Your school's amazing.
-Would you like a tour?

200
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,676
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. That'd be great.

201
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,818
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you hold this for a sec?

202
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,747
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure.

203
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,388
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

204
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:34,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, you got some serious competition.

205
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:37,366
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

206
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:41,232
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And I'll bet he's really rich too.
-Shut up.

207
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:56,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who is it?
-Terry Rapson here.

208
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:58,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry to call you so early.

209
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,784
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

210
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:06,653
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

211
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:10,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting...

212
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:14,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
-Yes.

213
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:16,173
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

214
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:18,733
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I think it's happening.

215
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:23,476
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

216
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,675
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 13-degree drop...

217
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:30,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.

218
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,787
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on.

219
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A t first we thought it was a malfunction.

220
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:40,789
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there are four more across
the North A tlantic showing the same thing.

221
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is unbelievable.

222
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:45,597
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You predicted it would happen.

223
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:49,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

224
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,077
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no forecast models
remotely capable...

225
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,578
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of plotting this scenario, except yours.

226
00:23:56,748 --> 00:23:59,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

227
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,178
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a forecast model.

228
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,584
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the closest thing we have.

229
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:08,421
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

230
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least not in the last 1 0,000 years.

231
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:43,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.

232
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,233
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.

233
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:54,469
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?
-This is L.A. What weather?

234
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:59,138
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What's that noise?

235
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,177
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What noise?

236
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,488
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I'll be right back.

237
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:21,596
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for....

238
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,598
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-L.A. Weather Center.
-It's Tommy.

239
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,567
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?

240
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:31,033
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

241
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A low-pressure system along
the California coast...

242
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:36,677
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.

243
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:46,385
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah?
-Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.

244
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,557
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
-What are you talking about?

245
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:54,492
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess....

246
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:57,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hold on a second.
-Conditions highly unusual for California.

247
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We' re building a forecast model,
we need-- What?

248
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

249
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:27,031
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, is that it? Anything else?
-We need it immediately.

250
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,225
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would say that
you've lost your mind...

251
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:32,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

252
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,866
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tom, this is important.
-What's this forecast model you're building?

253
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:41,674
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.

254
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:46,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.

255
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,582
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Booker. What's going on here?

256
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,623
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

257
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:55,853
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breaking news as we prepare to go live
to Los Angeles.

258
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:59,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mixed reports are coming in about some
extreme weather occurring in the area.

259
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:03,763
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.

260
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:11,742
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have live coverage now from our Fox 1 1
chopper. Are you there, Bart?

261
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:15,212
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast--

262
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,443
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bart!
-What? Oh! Oh, my God.

263
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

264
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,714
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.

265
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:27,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.

266
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,066
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?

267
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,143
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.

268
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,075
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there are people down there
taking pictures.

269
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!

270
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't stay here! Get out of here!

271
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,484
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you're seeing are two actual tornados
striking Los Angeles lnternational Airport.

272
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:03,927
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

273
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:05,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tommy!
-Oh, my God!

274
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,902
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit!

275
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:12,331
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away....

276
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:15,943
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Jeff, where are you?
-I'm on Yucca and Vine.

277
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm on my way.
-You're on TV. You're in the middle of it.

278
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,941
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! Oh, my God!

279
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:31,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta get out of there, man.

280
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:38,056
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!

281
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,497
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.

282
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For our national audience
just joining us now...

283
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:46,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?

284
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.

285
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,579
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

286
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:56,878
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's one of many tornados
that are destroying our city.

287
00:28:57,052 --> 00:29:00,317
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

288
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.

289
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

290
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like some sort of...

291
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.

292
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:37,448
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

293
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,748
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes, it is.
-What's happening?

294
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,356
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call you back.

295
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:46,522
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

296
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:52,229
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

297
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:55,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you think we should do?
-Until we can figure it out...

298
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:57,899
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

299
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,669
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.

300
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:04,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man, I just got off the phone
with my mom.

301
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:08,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

302
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:13,389
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.

303
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:16,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes...

304
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,619
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.

305
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The first flight....
-So much for " one in a billion. "

306
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:29,534
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.

307
00:31:29,707 --> 00:31:32,767
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time...

308
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:36,538
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so let's get started, please. Vorsteen?

309
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:38,843
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All our grid models are worthless.

310
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:41,951
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

311
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,584
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.

312
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:48,953
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.

313
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:52,095
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.

314
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:55,858
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-These things are interconnected?
-We have to consider the possibility.

315
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:59,969
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.

316
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:02,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's NASA have to say?
-We've already checked.

317
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,803
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Solar output is normal.

318
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:09,139
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What about the North Atlantic Current?
-What about it?

319
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

320
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:16,883
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks the current has changed.

321
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:20,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

322
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,783
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

323
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:26,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We all know that.
-Yes...

324
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:30,531
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but no one knows how much freshwater
has been dumped into the ocean...

325
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,192
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because of melting polar ice.

326
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:37,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

327
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,073
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

328
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:45,045
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

329
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:49,346
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've asked me to feed it into my
paleoclimate model to track the next events.

330
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,888
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

331
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,986
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not just continue. Get worse.

332
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:04,033
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

333
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

334
00:33:11,576 --> 00:33:15,535
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you expect me to tell them?
-The government has to make preparations.

335
00:33:15,714 --> 00:33:18,683
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You have a theory.
-Give me the mainframe. I'll prove it.

336
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

337
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:25,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have 48 hours.

338
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Professor Hall.
-Yes.

339
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I think your theory may be correct.
-Walk with me.

340
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,787
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

341
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:37,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

342
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:40,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?

343
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:43,869
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We haven't had the time.
-Well, maybe I can help.

344
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,703
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Welcome aboard.
-Thanks.

345
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:47,902
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm Jason.

346
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi.
-Hi.

347
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,215
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have Peter's CT scan results?

348
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

349
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,953
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-ls his eyesight better today?
-No. No change.

350
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:13,733
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
-A little better.

351
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:15,533
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

352
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,301
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me listen here.

353
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:20,874
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you read that?

354
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:25,447
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

355
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:27,115
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do?

356
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,411
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother used to read it to me.

357
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,916
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

358
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:37,628
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

359
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:41,164
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Here you go.
-Thank you.

360
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:49,074
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

361
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:51,971
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

362
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:55,907
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.

363
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:58,241
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call me when you get the results.

364
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:04,647
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank, is he always so obsessive?

365
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,792
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah.
-Yes.

366
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he ever lighten up?

367
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:12,157
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Not really.
-No.

368
00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:20,105
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How long have you been working together?
-Well, Frank's been working with him...

369
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:25,676
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...since the Stone Age, but I've only
had to endure two years of servitude.

370
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,877
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack.

371
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:37,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, we got the results.

372
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,831
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six to eight months? That can't be.

373
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:51,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

374
00:35:55,675 --> 00:36:01,079
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flooding has caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.

375
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:06,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.

376
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:07,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you staying?

377
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:10,413
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're finding a place for us
with kids here.

378
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,058
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?

379
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,191
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, look, Dad, I would if I could,
you know. It's just....

380
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,265
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This smell is unbearable, Dad.

381
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop kidding around! I want you home.

382
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,265
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, I'll be on the train.

383
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:28,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do me a favor. Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.

384
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:32,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow.

385
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,881
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Sam, guess what?

386
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a place to stay.

387
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:42,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

388
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:48,126
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far, the terrible weather hasn 't hit D.C.,
but local residents aren 't taking chances...

389
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:51,891
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...as people stock up for what is already
being billed as...

390
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,557
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-... the worst storm season on record.
-Better be sure.

391
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:56,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My ass is on the line.
-You saw the model.

392
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:59,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I hope to God it's wrong.

393
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,535
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr. Vice President.
-Tom.

394
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:04,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You know Professor Hall.
-Yes, we've met.

395
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:07,776
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor Hall has some information
I think you should look at.

396
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:10,782
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just got these results
from our simulation model.

397
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:14,115
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They explain what's causing this weather.
-I'll read it later.

398
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:17,587
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I have to meet with the director of FEMA--
-This is very urgent.

399
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:22,127
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our climate is changing violently. It will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.

400
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said this wouldn't happen
for another 1 00 years.

401
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,728
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I was wrong.
-Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

402
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:31,065
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I were, but you're aware
of what's happening everywhere.

403
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,608
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're making all the necessary preparations
for this storm. What more do you expect?

404
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:39,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

405
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:41,543
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially in the Northern states.

406
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:43,274
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Evacuations?
-Yes.

407
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:46,909
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

408
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:52,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Vice President! If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

409
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:58,131
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Jack.

410
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,126
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for bringing us here.

411
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:04,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't let you leave New York without
seeing the Natural History Museum.

412
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:07,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not. It's a fine collection
of stuffed animals.

413
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,706
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, guys, check this out.

414
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,877
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The body of this mammoth was found
perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra...

415
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:18,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with food still in its mouth
and stomach...

416
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:23,848
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing."

417
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:33,061
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles...

418
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:36,295
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.

419
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,269
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.
You ' ve got to stop worrying. No, no.

420
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:43,207
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It' s fine. We' ve got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.

421
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,012
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right.

422
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,206
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

423
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:51,281
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye.

424
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,557
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey. How's Jeanette?
-Oh, fine.

425
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,693
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ferry just landed.

426
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

427
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:04,556
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter...

428
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,395
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to airlift the royal family to safety.

429
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:11,433
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
-Not likely.

430
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:16,611
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.

431
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:18,712
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, we'll be fine.

432
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

433
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.

434
00:39:44,907 --> 00:39:47,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's our heading?
-035, sir.

435
00:39:47,377 --> 00:39:50,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmoral Castle.

436
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,074
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've lost visual contact with you.

437
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:19,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This gauge can't be right.
-Wind speed has dropped to zero.

438
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:23,112
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.

439
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:28,416
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What the hell is going on?
-The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.

440
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:41,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

441
00:40:42,165 --> 00:40:45,328
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

442
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:50,898
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare for crash landing.

443
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:54,933
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Select emergency fuel.

444
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you bastard!

445
00:40:58,182 --> 00:41:00,013
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

446
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,138
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.

447
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,041
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

448
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

449
00:41:34,518 --> 00:41:38,716
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-At what temperature does--?
-Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

450
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:40,186
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had to look it up.

451
00:41:40,357 --> 00:41:42,882
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

452
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,757
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

453
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

454
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,194
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got mountains of data...

455
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:56,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?

456
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,531
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

457
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:01,701
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.

458
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

459
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thing looks just like a hurricane.

460
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:14,057
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only hurricanes don't form over land.

461
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:23,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good evening, sir.
-Hey, Harold.

462
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:26,865
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
-Right, sir.

463
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:28,972
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Terrible weather.
-Tell me about it.

464
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:35,103
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

465
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You live here?

466
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,347
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just on the weekends.

467
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so....

468
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:44,753
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he?

469
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:48,086
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

470
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,624
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this you and your brother?

471
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,925
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

472
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:03,436
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been raining like this
for three days now.

473
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:16,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, hurry up.

474
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:31,666
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just standing here.

475
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't stay here.

476
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:36,096
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

477
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:38,834
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.

478
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:44,209
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.

479
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:47,477
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service...

480
00:43:47,653 --> 00:43:49,382
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... that's bad news for the....

481
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:53,651
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor' s coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?

482
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:55,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not anymore.

483
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,664
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.

484
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:04,462
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.

485
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:06,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cold front moving from the Arctic...

486
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:09,567
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has created an enormous
storm system in Canada...

487
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:13,576
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane....

488
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:17,079
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?

489
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where is he?
-He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.

490
00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:22,143
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this system moves south...

491
00:44:22,321 --> 00:44:26,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we could see a wind-driven storm surge
threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.

492
00:44:28,861 --> 00:44:30,123
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, bye.

493
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor' s stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

494
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:36,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.

495
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:39,168
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You mean walk?
-No, not in this.

496
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:44,805
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should take the stairs.

497
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,605
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on the top floor.

498
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:52,209
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we're walking.

499
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:07,264
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should just stay here.

500
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,025
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think the young lady is right.

501
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:11,927
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We need to get home.

502
00:45:36,563 --> 00:45:38,531
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Cesar, come here.

503
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:40,759
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

504
00:45:45,872 --> 00:45:48,568
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The wolves, they're gone.

505
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:50,937
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just to give you an idea
of the situation...

506
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:54,239
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:

507
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:57,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A t the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.

508
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,518
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out...

509
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:05,215
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.

510
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:07,723
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Car accidents, at least two hundred.

511
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:12,297
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.

512
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

513
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

514
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:39,892
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That dog can't come in here.

515
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,551
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man. It's pouring out there.

516
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,925
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care. Read the sign.

517
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:49,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's supposed to be a public library.

518
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:57,968
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, guys, this way.

519
00:46:58,546 --> 00:47:00,275
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Your bad.

520
00:47:00,447 --> 00:47:03,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn 1 500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

521
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:06,719
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Please, shut up, man.
-There must be rats everywhere.

522
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,377
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because it's New York.

523
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:11,218
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Hey!

524
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,186
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Open up, big papa.
-It's out of service.

525
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's out of service.

526
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:19,531
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll give you a 1 00 dollars.
-You don't have to do that.

527
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it.

528
00:47:22,536 --> 00:47:25,869
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, I love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.

529
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:28,104
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

530
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:30,937
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I can't reach my driver. No signal.
-This is insane.

531
00:47:31,111 --> 00:47:33,773
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.

532
00:47:33,948 --> 00:47:37,349
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, I vote for that.
-Are you kidding? We have to get higher!

533
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:39,184
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

534
00:47:39,353 --> 00:47:41,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up to the library.

535
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down.

536
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:46,459
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't understand what you're saying.

537
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:51,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

538
00:47:56,705 --> 00:47:59,037
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The door is jammed!

539
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:01,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't speak French!

540
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:38,275
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, where's Laura?

541
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:44,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She was just right there.
-She's right there! Right there, see?

542
00:48:44,653 --> 00:48:46,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is she doing?

543
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:49,018
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell them to cover their eyes.

544
00:49:12,314 --> 00:49:16,842
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody--

545
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,862
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?
-Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.

546
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget about it.

547
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:08,429
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll get it for her.
-Come on.

548
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my....

549
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,511
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laura!

550
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laura!

551
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:33,861
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam.
-No! Brian, no!

552
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,225
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laura! Laura, look!

553
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come!

554
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

555
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam!

556
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor.

557
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,113
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

558
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-ls that Neville's handiwork?
-Neville's way beyond stick figures.

559
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:34,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's 6 already.
-Oh.

560
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,958
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

561
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:41,288
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.

562
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:47,066
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't believe how fast they grow.

563
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:51,234
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

564
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've run the data we've sent them.

565
00:51:55,343 --> 00:51:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here he is.

566
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:03,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

567
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:05,249
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. The storm's rotation...

568
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,583
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.

569
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:15,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

570
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:20,063
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It should. But it doesn 't.
The air's descending too rapidly.

571
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:23,593
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this an isolated incident?

572
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid not.

573
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,576
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've located two supercells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

574
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:33,372
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One over Northern Canada...

575
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:36,539
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and another one over Siberia.

576
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:39,345
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And do we know their projected paths?

577
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:40,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

578
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:44,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren 't even close.

579
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:47,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.

580
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,997
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's a projection of 24 hours out.

581
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:59,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is 48 hours out.

582
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:03,642
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in seven to 1 0 days....

583
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:09,011
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When this storm is over...

584
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:11,981
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... we 'll be in a new ice age.

585
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,888
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God.

586
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:38,042
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor...

587
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:40,202
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it' s time you got out of there.

588
00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:45,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

589
00:53:50,424 --> 00:53:52,721
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can we do?

590
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,454
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Save as many as you can.

591
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,074
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack...

592
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:17,478
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...something's happened in New York.

593
00:54:28,062 --> 00:54:30,894
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

594
00:54:31,065 --> 00:54:34,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who needs help?
-Here. Over here.

595
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:42,568
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

596
00:54:43,444 --> 00:54:46,708
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the last one. Enjoy it.

597
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,403
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greedy.

598
00:54:49,617 --> 00:54:51,982
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All circuits are busy at this time.

599
00:54:52,152 --> 00:54:54,142
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

600
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was really brave.

601
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:12,135
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I better return her bag.

602
00:55:29,422 --> 00:55:30,786
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

603
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,349
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell her how you feel.

604
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:38,886
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

605
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:47,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you reach your little brother yet?
-No, there's still no service.

606
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,864
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn cell phones.

607
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,378
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?

608
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,141
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

609
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:01,343
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There are some on the mezzanine.
-Great.

610
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:04,546
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But I think it's underwater.
-Where you going? Power's out.

611
00:56:04,724 --> 00:56:07,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.

612
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:10,919
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads....

613
00:56:11,698 --> 00:56:14,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.

614
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:16,462
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So have l.

615
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:19,069
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to call
and couldn't get you.

616
00:56:19,238 --> 00:56:21,262
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been a madhouse here. Come on.

617
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:29,142
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure about this?

618
00:56:39,225 --> 00:56:40,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It works.

619
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:47,421
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love that picture.

620
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, so do l.

621
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,134
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where was that taken?

622
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:53,601
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miami.

623
00:56:54,073 --> 00:56:56,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, where was l?
I don't remember that trip.

624
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:59,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska...

625
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:02,479
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...doing research on your doctorate.

626
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:09,252
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

627
00:57:09,755 --> 00:57:11,949
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything was "one more."

628
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders. "One more, Daddy."

629
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:23,128
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.

630
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:25,165
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam?
-Dad!

631
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:29,432
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where are you? Are you all right?
-I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.

632
00:57:29,608 --> 00:57:32,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam, it's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay.
-Mom.

633
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:36,802
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?

634
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:38,471
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, of course.

635
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:41,913
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam, what's that noise?
-Sam?

636
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:44,116
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

637
00:57:46,324 --> 00:57:48,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is going on out there, Dad?

638
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam. Sam, listen to me.

639
00:57:51,396 --> 00:57:52,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen very carefully.

640
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget what I said about heading south.

641
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:57,461
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too late.
The storm is gonna get worse.

642
00:57:58,236 --> 00:58:03,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with
an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.

643
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:06,856
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the air will be so cold,
you could freeze to death in seconds.

644
00:58:10,703 --> 00:58:11,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

645
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:14,731
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, what should we do?
-Listen to me, son.

646
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,901
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not go outside.

647
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.

648
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:24,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will come for you. Do you understand me?
I will come for you.

649
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,547
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

650
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:31,746
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam, come back!
-Sam?

651
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:34,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, did you hear me?

652
00:58:34,527 --> 00:58:35,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear me?

653
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:39,863
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

654
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:44,991
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tell me he's gonna be okay--
-He's gonna be all right.

655
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:47,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna be all right,
you understand?

656
00:59:14,165 --> 00:59:16,928
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you'd drowned.

657
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:25,508
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.

658
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:33,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you store the arctic gear?

659
00:59:34,386 --> 00:59:36,216
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't make it to New York, Jack.

660
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:38,719
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've walked that far before in the snow.

661
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:41,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not the same.

662
00:59:41,493 --> 00:59:45,724
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

663
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:50,259
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to do this.

664
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,427
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

665
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:03,203
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My hands are shak--

666
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:06,816
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shaking.
-That's okay. Here.

667
01:00:06,985 --> 01:00:08,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Come here.

668
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:14,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

669
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm using my body heat to warm you.

670
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:22,559
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we let the blood from your arms and legs
rush back to your heart too quickly...

671
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:25,258
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...your heart could fail.

672
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:32,765
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you learn that?

673
01:00:34,913 --> 01:00:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of us were actually
paying attention in health class.

674
01:00:41,186 --> 01:00:43,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you feeling?

675
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:47,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Much better.

676
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:56,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank told me about Sam.

677
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,063
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going,
but there's something I need first.

678
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,001
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

679
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:07,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I already tried that, Tom.
-I know. It'll be different.

680
01:01:07,745 --> 01:01:09,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna brief the president directly.

681
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:14,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-ls that the last of it?
-Pretty much.

682
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:16,409
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

683
01:01:16,587 --> 01:01:19,612
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

684
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:21,752
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see it.

685
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:30,028
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha, keep quiet.

686
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,895
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

687
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:29,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, guys.

688
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:38,762
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

689
01:03:01,557 --> 01:03:03,751
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The basic rule of storms
is they continue...

690
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:07,258
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

691
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,193
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

692
01:03:11,334 --> 01:03:14,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This superstorm will last
seven to 1 0 days.

693
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:19,533
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

694
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:22,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.

695
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:24,571
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize...

696
01:03:24,747 --> 01:03:28,045
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with an average temperature
close to that of the last lce Age.

697
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:32,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what can we do about this?

698
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:35,789
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Head as far south as possible.

699
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:38,117
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is not amusing, professor.

700
01:03:38,494 --> 01:03:40,552
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you suggest they go?

701
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,163
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

702
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:47,995
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.

703
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:51,765
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

704
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:53,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we tried that approach.

705
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:57,669
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't want to hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.

706
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:01,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What exactly are you proposing, professor?

707
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:13,254
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evacuate everyone south of that line.

708
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:21,258
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the people in the North?

709
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:25,971
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid it's too late for them.

710
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:28,302
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they go outside...

711
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the storm will kill them.

712
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:35,511
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this point...

713
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:39,348
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...their best chance is to stay inside.

714
01:04:40,455 --> 01:04:42,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to ride it out.

715
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:44,824
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pray.

716
01:04:49,898 --> 01:04:51,421
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think he'll do?

717
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

718
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:54,931
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack...

719
01:04:55,837 --> 01:04:57,235
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...thanks...

720
01:04:57,405 --> 01:04:58,769
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and good luck.

721
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You too.

722
01:05:02,744 --> 01:05:04,836
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna need it.

723
01:05:07,415 --> 01:05:12,477
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't evacuate half the country because
one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.

724
01:05:12,654 --> 01:05:16,589
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Every minute we delay costs lives.
-What about the other half of the country?

725
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:19,055
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If Professor Hall is right
about this storm...

726
01:05:19,227 --> 01:05:21,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...sending troops north will
create more victims.

727
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,229
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to save the people
we can right now.

728
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:27,458
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.

729
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:30,661
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices--

730
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,739
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't accept abandoning
half the country as necessary.

731
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe if you listened sooner,
it wouldn't be.

732
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:38,844
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

733
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:42,346
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's safely here in Washington.
-His son is in Manhattan.

734
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:49,254
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you should know before
you start questioning his motives.

735
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,488
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to follow Hall's plan.

736
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:57,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-General.
-Sir?

737
01:05:57,465 --> 01:06:00,797
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate Southern states.

738
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:02,595
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

739
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:18,709
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vivian...

740
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,717
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...get me my wife.

741
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:43,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.

742
01:06:46,413 --> 01:06:47,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

743
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:49,973
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there any chance...

744
01:06:50,584 --> 01:06:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that it'll run...

745
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,219
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on this?

746
01:06:55,389 --> 01:06:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you mad?

747
01:06:57,157 --> 01:06:59,522
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a 1 2-year-old Scotch.

748
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:22,576
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen.

749
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,677
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To England.

750
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:28,417
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To mankind.

751
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:32,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To Manchester United.

752
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just....

753
01:07:41,668 --> 01:07:45,603
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

754
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:52,108
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The important thing is he will grow up.

755
01:07:57,117 --> 01:07:58,913
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amen.

756
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:18,232
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.

757
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:21,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, I am president of the Electronics Club...

758
01:08:21,841 --> 01:08:24,104
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Math Club and the Chess Club.

759
01:08:24,277 --> 01:08:27,336
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

760
01:08:29,715 --> 01:08:32,649
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

761
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,945
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

762
01:08:37,123 --> 01:08:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, there's nobody around.

763
01:08:40,093 --> 01:08:42,959
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

764
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

765
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:57,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man, there's people out there.

766
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,106
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was walking my dog.

767
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:03,304
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

768
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:12,813
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where they all going?

769
01:09:12,992 --> 01:09:15,858
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

770
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,999
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everybody. Quiet down.

771
01:09:22,168 --> 01:09:25,136
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

772
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:27,897
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

773
01:09:28,074 --> 01:09:29,938
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're being evacuated to the South.

774
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:31,632
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should get moving too.

775
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:34,438
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

776
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:37,844
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

777
01:09:38,017 --> 01:09:41,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

778
01:09:41,821 --> 01:09:43,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shouldn't go.

779
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:45,286
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

780
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,153
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

781
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:50,055
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The storm will kill anybody in it.

782
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:52,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Then you have to say something.
-I know.

783
01:09:57,103 --> 01:09:59,627
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

784
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:02,739
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Listen, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

785
01:10:02,909 --> 01:10:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's not it.
-Get ready to go.

786
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:08,134
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

787
01:10:09,014 --> 01:10:10,776
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what is this nonsense?

788
01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:14,611
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

789
01:10:14,786 --> 01:10:17,219
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people caught outside
will freeze to death.

790
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:20,152
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where are you getting this?
-My dad's a climatologist.

791
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:22,952
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He works for the government.
-So what do we do?

792
01:10:23,128 --> 01:10:25,789
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

793
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:28,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

794
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,825
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies....

795
01:10:31,002 --> 01:10:33,094
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's a risk, yeah--
-An unnecessary risk.

796
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. It's not.

797
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:37,105
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've wasted enough time talking.
Come on.

798
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,605
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

799
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:42,143
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Look, look. Just look for a second.
-Come on, everybody--

800
01:10:42,314 --> 01:10:45,749
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

801
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:48,043
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna be able to survive it.

802
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:50,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me.

803
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:55,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, please just stay. Just stay.

804
01:10:55,927 --> 01:10:58,087
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't....

805
01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:30,319
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She's set to go.
-Come on, straight to the back, guys.

806
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,553
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be impossible to reach each other.

807
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:35,392
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.

808
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:36,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I will.

809
01:11:38,436 --> 01:11:39,925
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

810
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:45,707
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Jack.

811
01:11:46,544 --> 01:11:49,444
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell Sam I love him so much.

812
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:52,882
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God be with you.

813
01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:02,082
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Doctor Hall?
-Yeah.

814
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:04,624
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't been able
to reach Peter's parents.

815
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:08,389
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm gonna try later, okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

816
01:12:15,773 --> 01:12:17,603
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it.

817
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:21,202
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

818
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:25,871
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?

819
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all these years I thought
I was watching your back.

820
01:12:29,453 --> 01:12:31,215
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are the keys?

821
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the truck.

822
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,123
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you think you're going?

823
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:38,726
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.

824
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,886
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.

825
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

826
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,803
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, Jack.

827
01:13:02,553 --> 01:13:05,248
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

828
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:08,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border...

829
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:12,621
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south...

830
01:13:12,796 --> 01:13:15,025
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in the wake of the approaching storm.

831
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.

832
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:20,563
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

833
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:24,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration...

834
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,768
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

835
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.

836
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:35,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings...

837
01:13:35,486 --> 01:13:40,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.

838
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:44,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is.

839
01:13:45,596 --> 01:13:48,962
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 1 00 years.

840
01:13:51,702 --> 01:13:53,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

841
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,672
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you doing?
-What did you think we would burn?

842
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:06,172
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You can't burn books.
-No, absolutely not.

843
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:08,111
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to freeze to death?

844
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,278
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go get some more.

845
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:14,922
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll help you.

846
01:14:15,391 --> 01:14:17,483
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with them.

847
01:14:18,795 --> 01:14:21,262
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

848
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:24,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

849
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:34,768
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.

850
01:14:34,944 --> 01:14:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the garbage cans?

851
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:39,805
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

852
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can't burn Nietzsche.

853
01:14:46,756 --> 01:14:49,747
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the most important thinker
of the 1 9th century.

854
01:14:49,926 --> 01:14:52,894
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.

855
01:14:53,129 --> 01:14:54,686
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was not a chauvinist pig.

856
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:57,188
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he was in love with his sister.

857
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:59,026
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me? You guys?

858
01:14:59,202 --> 01:15:03,365
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law
down here that we can burn.

859
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:06,939
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly...

860
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:09,303
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...from the United States into Mexico.

861
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:13,346
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is only possible because the president
was able to negotiate a deal...

862
01:15:13,516 --> 01:15:17,918
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.

863
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, multitudes of American families
are feeling a rush of relief....

864
01:15:25,928 --> 01:15:27,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucy?

865
01:15:33,536 --> 01:15:35,025
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Peter' s ambulance here?

866
01:15:35,204 --> 01:15:36,864
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

867
01:15:42,078 --> 01:15:44,545
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why?
-They' ve all gone.

868
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:46,271
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?
-ln the confusion...

869
01:15:46,448 --> 01:15:50,144
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... I don ' t know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left....

870
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:52,581
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-God.
-There's a policeman with a snowplow.

871
01:15:52,754 --> 01:15:55,187
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's waiting outside.
-God.

872
01:15:55,357 --> 01:15:57,847
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

873
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:02,892
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

874
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:12,095
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

875
01:16:14,409 --> 01:16:16,774
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

876
01:16:17,345 --> 01:16:18,606
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucy, no.

877
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No.
-No, you should go.

878
01:16:20,782 --> 01:16:22,715
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not gonna wait forever.

879
01:16:22,884 --> 01:16:24,783
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

880
01:16:27,322 --> 01:16:29,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

881
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:33,025
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's okay.
-All right.

882
01:17:01,356 --> 01:17:02,947
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

883
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:06,115
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm fine. I just--
I cut my leg the other day.

884
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:11,561
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you get a signal?

885
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:13,825
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, for a minute.

886
01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:15,298
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

887
01:17:19,274 --> 01:17:21,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, this storm is everywhere.

888
01:17:21,643 --> 01:17:24,042
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

889
01:17:24,746 --> 01:17:27,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Europe is buried under
1 5 feet of snow...

890
01:17:27,482 --> 01:17:30,211
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

891
01:17:30,785 --> 01:17:33,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

892
01:17:37,392 --> 01:17:38,983
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he'll make it.

893
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,595
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll make it.

894
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:53,002
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert...

895
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:54,571
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for all Northern states.

896
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:57,471
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.

897
01:17:57,645 --> 01:18:01,637
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remain indoors and take all measures to
stay warm, burning any fuel sources...

898
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:05,511
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...until the storm is over. Roads are
impassable across New York State...

899
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:07,983
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...as far south as Pennsylvania....

900
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:10,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we?

901
01:18:12,126 --> 01:18:14,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like we' re just north
of Philadelphia.

902
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:19,891
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

903
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys okay?

904
01:18:26,173 --> 01:18:27,537
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah.
-Yeah.

905
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:36,605
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Once again, roads across the....
-Sorry, boss.

906
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unpack the snowshoes.

907
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,053
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're walking from here.

908
01:18:43,624 --> 01:18:46,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

909
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:51,324
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

910
01:18:51,498 --> 01:18:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.

911
01:18:55,269 --> 01:18:56,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to get up and keep moving.

912
01:18:57,004 --> 01:18:59,836
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

913
01:19:01,442 --> 01:19:04,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, guys, let's get moving.

914
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:15,688
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up.

915
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:34,738
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

916
01:19:34,907 --> 01:19:36,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Insulating.

917
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:39,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

918
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:43,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.

919
01:19:44,517 --> 01:19:46,347
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

920
01:19:51,624 --> 01:19:53,386
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

921
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,097
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got one.

922
01:19:59,265 --> 01:20:01,323
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your favorite vacation.

923
01:20:03,035 --> 01:20:05,002
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides this one?

924
01:20:05,972 --> 01:20:07,268
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

925
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,671
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago...

926
01:20:14,046 --> 01:20:18,573
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

927
01:20:19,652 --> 01:20:22,211
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it rained constantly.

928
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds really boring.

929
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But actually really nice, you know?

930
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:33,629
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just me and my dad
hanging out for 1 0 days.

931
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:47,965
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank!

932
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,966
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

933
01:21:50,141 --> 01:21:51,368
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine.

934
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:55,806
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just dropped in to do a little shopping.

935
01:21:57,148 --> 01:21:58,705
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta lose this sled.

936
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:17,798
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on! We'll pull you up.

937
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,229
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jason! You've got to support
Frank's weight.

938
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:26,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'll try.

939
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:35,177
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I think I have his weight now.

940
01:22:35,353 --> 01:22:37,081
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming to you.

941
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:52,394
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The glass is breaking!

942
01:22:54,572 --> 01:22:56,038
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much weight.

943
01:22:59,945 --> 01:23:01,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not gonna hold.

944
01:23:11,289 --> 01:23:12,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No.

945
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:15,858
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank. I can get you out.

946
01:23:18,228 --> 01:23:19,717
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do it!

947
01:23:19,897 --> 01:23:22,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, Frank, no!
-Frank, no!

948
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:25,832
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frank!

949
01:24:09,346 --> 01:24:11,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got there?

950
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:14,548
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Gutenberg Bible.

951
01:24:14,752 --> 01:24:17,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was in the rare books room.

952
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:20,049
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think God's gonna save you?

953
01:24:20,824 --> 01:24:23,587
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I don't believe in God.

954
01:24:24,261 --> 01:24:26,922
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

955
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:29,087
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm protecting it.

956
01:24:32,603 --> 01:24:36,094
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This Bible is the first book ever printed.

957
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:41,899
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

958
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:46,305
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as I'm concerned, the written word
is mankind's greatest achievement.

959
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,207
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can laugh.

960
01:24:49,186 --> 01:24:52,313
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if Western civilization is finished...

961
01:24:52,956 --> 01:24:56,948
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

962
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:35,822
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We heard somebody was left behind.

963
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:40,462
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We brought an ambulance.
-Thank God.

964
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:45,668
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much for coming.

965
01:26:06,596 --> 01:26:08,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

966
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:11,225
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, are you all right?

967
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:14,662
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look like you have a fever
or something.

968
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:17,964
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

969
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:26,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

970
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:30,314
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's pretty stupid, huh?
-No, it's all right.

971
01:26:30,486 --> 01:26:33,977
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you just haven't had time
to adjust yet.

972
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:38,351
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

973
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:42,863
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for...

974
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:47,027
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.

975
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:54,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

976
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:57,675
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right.

977
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:01,249
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-lt was all for nothing.
-No, no. I--

978
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:06,449
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just-- I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

979
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Truth about what?

980
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:16,928
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About why I joined the team.

981
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I joined it because of you.

982
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,785
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

983
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,307
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

984
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:07,875
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

985
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:10,141
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr. President.
-All right.

986
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,251
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.

987
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:15,812
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're the last ones.

988
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:18,282
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

989
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.

990
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,645
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got an urgent message
for high command.

991
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,007
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Request priority for landing zone one.

992
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:45,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.

993
01:28:50,225 --> 01:28:51,589
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sir.
-Thank you, corporal.

994
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,954
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sorry for the delay, sir.
-Carry on.

995
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,604
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Madam Secretary.

996
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:19,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond.

997
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:23,211
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

998
01:29:28,295 --> 01:29:29,886
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't make it.

999
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,794
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I--

1000
01:29:38,972 --> 01:29:41,405
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She only had a fever.
I don't understand.

1001
01:29:41,575 --> 01:29:43,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's awfully pale.

1002
01:29:43,977 --> 01:29:46,444
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

1003
01:29:46,613 --> 01:29:49,604
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's hypothermia.
-But how can it be hypothermia?

1004
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:51,841
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We've all been in--
-Maybe it's the flu.

1005
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,316
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, it's not the flu.

1006
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:56,749
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how do you know?

1007
01:29:57,257 --> 01:30:00,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?

1008
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:04,758
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you that she has a fever and her--
She's got a really cold sweat.

1009
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,694
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's her pulse?

1010
01:30:07,134 --> 01:30:09,533
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's really fast.
-Does she have any injuries?

1011
01:30:09,703 --> 01:30:12,227
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a cut that might have
gotten infected?

1012
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:15,897
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1013
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:19,275
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't think anything of it.

1014
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,445
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh.

1015
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:29,814
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's blood poisoning. Septicemia.

1016
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,116
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She could go into septic shock.

1017
01:30:32,292 --> 01:30:34,384
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

1018
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:36,585
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She needs a massive dose
of penicillin...

1019
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:40,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or....

1020
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:47,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

1021
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,857
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen anything like it.

1022
01:31:10,062 --> 01:31:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.

1023
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:15,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1024
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:17,866
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taking infrared image of thermal currents.

1025
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:22,769
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send to Houston, Korolev,
your weather service.

1026
01:31:22,942 --> 01:31:24,533
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll help you.

1027
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:28,044
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom? Tom, wake up.

1028
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:32,582
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just received some satellite images from
the space station. You better take a look.

1029
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,653
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How big is this thing?

1030
01:31:45,832 --> 01:31:47,856
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

1031
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:51,696
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.

1032
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:53,167
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good God.

1033
01:31:53,339 --> 01:31:56,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

1034
01:32:12,758 --> 01:32:14,247
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jason!

1035
01:32:14,427 --> 01:32:16,053
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

1036
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:18,325
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jason!

1037
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:37,578
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you doing?
-There's gotta be medicine on that ship.

1038
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:41,279
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said it was too dangerous
to go outside.

1039
01:32:41,453 --> 01:32:42,783
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I did.

1040
01:32:49,094 --> 01:32:51,493
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you find those chairs?

1041
01:32:52,831 --> 01:32:54,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1042
01:32:55,066 --> 01:32:56,589
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with you.

1043
01:32:58,103 --> 01:32:59,569
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me too.

1044
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:04,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, damn it!

1045
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:56,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's all in Russian. I--
-I know.

1046
01:34:56,487 --> 01:34:59,717
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
-What? How do you know?

1047
01:35:00,224 --> 01:35:02,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it says "penicillin"
on the bottle.

1048
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:09,592
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.

1049
01:35:09,767 --> 01:35:12,132
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We should find some food.
-We don't have time.

1050
01:35:12,302 --> 01:35:16,294
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, none of us are gonna survive much
longer without food. Including Laura.

1051
01:35:17,574 --> 01:35:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1052
01:35:23,747 --> 01:35:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam, over here.
-What?

1053
01:35:26,884 --> 01:35:28,578
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bingo.

1054
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:41,256
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian?

1055
01:35:41,965 --> 01:35:44,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm okay.
-What happened?

1056
01:35:45,669 --> 01:35:47,727
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I did was open up the cupboard.

1057
01:35:48,605 --> 01:35:51,072
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, we can use it.
-Put food in it.

1058
01:36:03,987 --> 01:36:05,954
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull him in, Brian!

1059
01:36:08,525 --> 01:36:11,857
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You all right?
-Oh, my God, there's more.

1060
01:36:14,064 --> 01:36:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My leg.

1061
01:36:19,703 --> 01:36:21,636
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, use this.

1062
01:36:29,278 --> 01:36:31,245
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It should be over New York by now.

1063
01:36:32,115 --> 01:36:36,608
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Satellite readings are showing a temperature
drop of 1 0 degrees per second.

1064
01:36:52,201 --> 01:36:53,599
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys...

1065
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I think we're in the eye of it.

1066
01:36:56,939 --> 01:36:58,803
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get back right now.

1067
01:37:00,209 --> 01:37:04,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna
lure the wolves out of the room.

1068
01:37:04,514 --> 01:37:06,845
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they leave, you lock the door.

1069
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:08,643
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck.

1070
01:38:14,617 --> 01:38:17,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Brian, hurry.
-I need something.

1071
01:38:17,953 --> 01:38:19,886
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, hurry!

1072
01:38:29,664 --> 01:38:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian! Brian, open the door!

1073
01:38:36,605 --> 01:38:38,469
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to get out of here now.

1074
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian, get the supplies.

1075
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,926
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. Let's go!

1076
01:39:40,769 --> 01:39:41,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull, Brian!

1077
01:40:18,072 --> 01:40:20,164
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the medicine to Laura.

1078
01:40:51,672 --> 01:40:54,606
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're almost there. Come on!

1079
01:40:55,709 --> 01:40:58,575
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian! Close the door!

1080
01:41:09,757 --> 01:41:12,088
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let the fire go out!

1081
01:41:12,259 --> 01:41:13,987
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

1082
01:41:21,735 --> 01:41:23,429
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddha, come away from the door.

1083
01:41:23,604 --> 01:41:25,093
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Buddha, come!

1084
01:41:25,973 --> 01:41:28,566
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More books! More books!

1085
01:42:22,195 --> 01:42:24,355
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have I been out of it?

1086
01:42:25,498 --> 01:42:27,192
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple hours.

1087
01:42:27,366 --> 01:42:28,889
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you feel?

1088
01:42:29,068 --> 01:42:31,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. What happened?

1089
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:36,769
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we had to get inside in kind of
a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.

1090
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:40,002
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should be used to you
pushing me around.

1091
01:42:41,514 --> 01:42:43,481
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to have you back.

1092
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,482
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1093
01:42:51,657 --> 01:42:55,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The eye of the storm has passed,
and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.

1094
01:42:55,995 --> 01:42:57,689
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shouldn't we wait one more day?

1095
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,059
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam may not have one more day.

1096
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

1097
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:19,873
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

1098
01:44:21,112 --> 01:44:25,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.

1099
01:44:27,819 --> 01:44:30,912
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mankind survived the last lce Age.

1100
01:44:31,089 --> 01:44:34,353
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1101
01:44:35,694 --> 01:44:39,151
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

1102
01:44:41,766 --> 01:44:45,064
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sure as hell would like a chance
to learn from mine.

1103
01:44:46,171 --> 01:44:48,468
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did everything you could.

1104
01:44:51,543 --> 01:44:53,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was thinking about Sam.

1105
01:44:59,618 --> 01:45:02,552
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack, you know the chances of Sam....

1106
01:45:14,132 --> 01:45:16,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made my son a promise.

1107
01:45:17,836 --> 01:45:19,735
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to keep it.

1108
01:45:43,361 --> 01:45:46,329
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?

1109
01:45:46,497 --> 01:45:48,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger, mission control. Go ahead.

1110
01:45:48,632 --> 01:45:52,499
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got scattered reports that
the storm is dissipating over North America.

1111
01:45:52,936 --> 01:45:54,869
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you confirm?

1112
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:59,766
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

1113
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:01,968
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're over Europe right now.

1114
01:46:02,146 --> 01:46:05,308
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

1115
01:47:55,525 --> 01:47:57,992
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much further is it to the library?

1116
01:47:58,161 --> 01:47:59,991
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It should be...

1117
01:48:02,799 --> 01:48:04,629
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...right here.

1118
01:48:08,871 --> 01:48:10,929
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Jack.

1119
01:48:48,678 --> 01:48:50,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

1120
01:49:59,714 --> 01:50:01,271
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that?

1121
01:50:07,188 --> 01:50:09,087
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father.

1122
01:50:13,929 --> 01:50:15,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made it.

1123
01:50:19,734 --> 01:50:21,633
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I did.

1124
01:50:48,997 --> 01:50:53,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}EMBASSY OF THE UNlTED STATES

01:51:16,558 --> 01:51:19,924
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

1127
01:51:20,095 --> 01:51:22,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made it to New York.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says there are survivors.

1129
01:51:26,467 --> 01:51:28,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Tom.

1130
01:51:29,236 --> 01:51:30,793
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's....

1131
01:51:31,805 --> 01:51:33,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good news.

1132
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:48,112
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility...

1133
01:51:48,288 --> 01:51:51,552
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in the face of nature's
destructive power.

1134
01:51:51,725 --> 01:51:55,421
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For years, we operated under the belief
that we could continue...

1135
01:51:55,596 --> 01:52:01,227
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...consuming our planet's natural resources
without consequence.

1136
01:52:02,169 --> 01:52:03,897
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were wrong.

1137
01:52:05,339 --> 01:52:07,169
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was wrong.

1138
01:52:08,108 --> 01:52:12,237
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil...

1139
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:16,046
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is a testament to our changed reality.

1140
01:52:16,350 --> 01:52:18,112
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not only Americans...

1141
01:52:18,419 --> 01:52:21,819
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations...

1142
01:52:21,989 --> 01:52:24,786
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... we once called The Third World.

1143
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:29,291
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In our time of need,
they have taken us in and sheltered us.

1144
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:33,524
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.

1145
01:52:55,055 --> 01:52:59,218
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate....

1146
01:52:59,393 --> 01:53:04,125
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?

1147
01:53:04,298 --> 01:53:07,164
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For days, we 've despaired
about the fate of the people...

1148
01:53:07,334 --> 01:53:09,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who are trapped in the North.

1149
01:53:09,837 --> 01:53:13,328
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, there is cause for hope.

1150
01:53:14,408 --> 01:53:17,968
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only a few hours ago, I received word
that a small group of people...

1151
01:53:18,144 --> 01:53:21,442
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...survived in New York City
against all odds...

1152
01:53:21,614 --> 01:53:24,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and in the face
of tremendous adversity.

1153
01:53:24,617 --> 01:53:27,312
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission...

1154
01:53:27,487 --> 01:53:31,354
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... to bring them home
and to look for more survivors.

1155
01:54:02,188 --> 01:54:03,677
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack!

1156
01:54:04,157 --> 01:54:07,648

Come on, let' s go get on board.

1157
01:55:02,982 --> 01:55:04,949
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that.

1158
01:55:05,284 --> 01:55:06,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1159
01:55:07,887 --> 01:55:10,878
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you ever seen the air so clear?
