有些爱尔兰人说"去你的"比"他妈的"好多了

237
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,713
but I think that's bullshit or bellshit.
但我觉得这都是放屁

238
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:54,092
- The bottom line is, he swears too much.  - This is all very interesting...
- 而且他的脏话太多了  - 这很有趣

我给你带了点蛋糕 虽然你不值得有

I should just crush it in my hand. Oh, I already have.
我应该把它捏碎 我已经捏碎了

511
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,296
Oh, er... the police told me to bring you this.
警察让我带来这个

512
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,127
It's just a standard field phone,
是个标准电话

513
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,509
should you feel the inclination to communicate with the authorities.
当你想和当局交流时可以用

514
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,138
Good thing about these things, they're immune to the problems and glitches.
他们对这些问题和小毛病有免疫力

515
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,390
You get with satellite phones.
你可以用卫星电话

516
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,427
But, like I say, it's just an option, really.
但那只是种选择

I just realised, when you asked me now how I was feeling, you meant...

Yes, I did.

Someone's been in the wars.

Of course. It's just like wearing a mask.
当然可以 那只是个面具

524
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,163
At least when someone puts you in a mask, you've got a safe word,
当有人给你戴这样一个面具时 你还能说这只

525
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,373
like "airbag", or "crayfish".

What's the er... That thing?

527
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,550
Oh, we made that. It's a head holster.
哦 我们自制的 是个脑袋枪托

528
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,430
- Never heard of one of those.  - Yeah, I'll show you. Simon?
- 以前没见过这玩意儿  - 我示范一下 赛门?

529
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,848
You insert the shotgun.
把枪插进去

530
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,350
- Place on stand. And...  - Walk out.
- 放在支架上 然后...  - 就可以走开

531
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,978
Hands free. I can move around the studio, do anything I want.
就能把手空出来 我就可以为所欲为了

532
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,266
And if something happens... I don't even have to look.
要是情况不妙... 我可以直接爆他的头

533
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,814
Boom. Hit the target.

534
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,195
Yeah... well, you don't need an accomplice.

538
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,328
So you're with the police now?
你跟警察是一伙的?

539
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
Oh, this... no, this is just...
哦 不是这样的...

540
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,879
I think it's Velcro. There you go.

Feck the police.

I think they thought that if they did take a pot shot at you
你现在持枪 还劫持了人质

543
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,174
it's a siege, you've got a gun
他们可能是觉得像你开枪的话

544
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,510
that the bullet might pass through you and hit me.
子弹可能会伤到我

545
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,925
Unless they use dum-dums, which explode inside the body.
除非他们用达姆弹 能在体内爆炸成碎片

546
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,262
I said, do not use dum-dums on Pat Ferrell, Farrell, Ferrell.
我对他们说 不要对派特・法莱尔用达姆弹

547
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,227
Just use a high-velocity round that passes through his body
就用高速子弹 会直接穿透身体的那种

548
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,933
because he's a friend of mine.
因为他是我的朋友

如果我想开枪的话 我肯定能打爆你的头

552
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,363

00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,697
Go on, then.
那就脱掉

- 你要是希望我脱掉 那我就脱掉  - 赶快脱掉!

可我都55岁了 本应该舒服地窝在家里看搞笑视频

看"熊猫打喷嚏"或者是"查理咬手指"之类的

I've seen it before, but, yeah.

Oh, my God!
天啊!

569
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,869
That's like some son of zoo from Planet Of The Apes.
看起来好像电影"决战猩球"里的动物园

570
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,539
Danny looks a bit... bruised.
丹尼看起来... 挂彩了

583
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,907
This is ridiculous.

584
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,701

- 不过大家不会有事的  - 不会有事? 他打我!

别在纠结谁打了谁 或者谁欠打了

You need to keep him away from me. Understand?

What I need to do, Danny,

in conjunction with Jason, is crisis management.

00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,927
realised he'd left his goggles at reception but carried on anyway?
却依然淡定玩彩弹游戏的人问这种问题吗?

- Why?  - You're looking at him.

The point is, Pat has not gone mad.
