00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,890
彼岸是天堂 第二季 第五集

2
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,890
"美食厅"

3
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,890
说实话 达德利先生 我什么时候迟到过?
Be honest, Mr Dudley, when have you ever known me to be late?

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,338
我不是在查你的岗 山姆 是我的表
It's not you I'm checking on, Sam. It's me watch.

5
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:50,890
好像停了
 Seems to have stopped.

6
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:51,890
那就买个新的 先生
Get yourself a new one, sir.

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,890
这块表跟了我很多年了 我要拿去修修
I've had this watch many years. I'll have it mended.

8
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,890
我要是你 先生 我会配备一块璀璨的怀表
If I were you, sir, I'd want to be standing there

9
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,890
每一秒都走得如你一般稳当
with a shiny new timepiece, every little tick as reliable as you are.

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,890
也许我们该让你去推销怀表
Perhaps we should let you loose on a promotion for pocket watches.

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
无上光荣 先生
That would be an honour and a privilege, sir.

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
噢 有奖金么?
Oh, would there be a bonus in it?

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,308
你怎么看? 梅尔托
What do you make of it, Myrtle?

14
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,890
我怎么看? 先生?
What do I make of it, sir?

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,286
这是个值得纪念的时刻 
A moment to cherish.

16
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,890
我们华丽的美食厅的第一天
 The first day of our splendid new Food Hall.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,890
走过托尔盖特街的顾客们将与这些
Customers who come along Tollgate Street will be met

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,890
珍馐佳肴见面
by all manner of culinary delights.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,890
你是指食物么 先生?
Do you mean food, sir?

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,890
这栋楼荒弃了一年多
This building has stood derelict for a year and more,

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
它象征着犹豫和失败
a mark of hesitation and failure.

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,890
现在它象征着一种决心
Now it stands as a declaration of intent,

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,536
宣告汤姆・威斯顿将一手把天堂百货
an assertion that Tom Weston means to raise The Paradise

24
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,900
捧上新的高度
to new heights.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,890
真好 你满意我也开心 威斯顿先生
Well, I'm pleased that you're so pleased, Mr Weston, sir.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
你怎么没去工作 梅尔托?
Why aren't you at work, Myrtle?

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,890
我做了
I was.

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,890
我 我是说 我就做
I-I mean, I will be.

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,090
我在工作 
I am. 

30
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,900
我就是被你的慷慨陈词震住了 先生
I just got caught up in all your declarations, sir.

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,890
分享佣金?
Share our commission?

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,890
是的 每周结束我们大家将把佣金平分
At the end of every week we will divide the total amongst all of the girls, yes.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,890
为什么我们得这样? 这对那些勤勤恳恳
Why would we do that? Those of us who work hardest,

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,890
战战兢兢伺候老主顾的人不公平
who take a care to pamper our regular customers,

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,890
你这是把我们应得的给夺走了
you'd be taking the earnings out of our purses.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,308
但要是我们把佣金集中在一起 
But if we pool the money, 

37
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,890
当我们中一人得病或者遭了祸事
if one of us is sick or has a run of bad luck,

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,890
就相当有了保障
then there's a safety net.

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,155
要是我们有为彼此工作的概念
If we feel that we're working for each other,

40
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,890
相信我们会挣得更多
 then I believe we'll earn more.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,070
非得这样么? 
Do we have to? 

42
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,890
可是苏西 你挣得最少
But Susy, you earn the least commission of all.

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,890
即使是一星半点也是我挣的
It might be nothing but it is my nothing.

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,890
难道不是竞争 戒备和恐惧
Isn't the competition, the jealousy and fear,

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,890
鞭策着我们努力工作的么?
isn't that what spurs us on?

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,900
我觉得不是非要竞争不可 我们都爱这份工作
I don't believe we have to compete. We all love our work.

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,890
- 我建议投票表决 - 投票?
- I suggest we have a vote. - A vote?

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,890
要是你输了呢? 那你不就威严扫地了?
What if you lose? Won't that undermine your authority?

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,890
我不这么看 克莱拉
I don't see it that way, Clara.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,081
如果是妙计 总会赢得支持的
If it's a good idea, it will win.

51
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:56,900
如果不是 就不会
 If it's not, then it won't.

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,900
同意分享佣金的人 请举手
Raise your hand, please, if you think we should share the commission.

53
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
谢谢
Thank you.

54
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,039
这是达德利的想法
It was Dudley's suggestion.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,890
我们把柜台安置在醒目位置
 We've placed the counter prominently

56
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,890
陈列着精美时钟吸引眼球
and stationed decorative clocks to draw the eye.

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,890
剩下的就靠山姆的三寸不烂之舌了
The rest is in Sam's capable hands.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,890
关键是 让绅士们感觉没有一块怀表揣着
The point is, is to make the gentlemen feel behind the times

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,890
就落伍了
without a little ticker in their pocket.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,890
这不在于他们能否买的起怀表
It's not whether they can afford it,

61
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,890
而是他们能否经得住过时的恐惧感
it's whether they can afford to live of being in fear of being late.

62
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,890
珠光宝气 就和我看到美食厅的感觉一样
Jewellery. Just as I have opened the Food Hall,

63
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,890
你的特色明显是珠宝展
you feature a prominent display of jewellery.

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,890
这不是装饰品 威斯顿先生
These are not ornaments, Mr Weston.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,890
它们是实用的东西 功能性的工具
They are practical pieces, functional instruments.

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
以金银包裹 珠宝点缀的功能性工具
Functional instruments of gold and silver, decorated with jewels.

67
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,040
请允许我说一句 
If I may, 

68
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,890
先生 我们需要的是能让顾客神魂颠倒的东西
what we need, gentlemen, is something to fascinate the customers.

69
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,890
也许是一块让人叹为观止的怀表
Perhaps, one watch for them to marvel at,

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,890
一种奢华夺目的美 使人为之驻足  
something truly extravagant, so they will dwell long enough

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
久到足够我施展浑身解数
for me to work my magic on them.

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,890
- 克莱拉? - 嗯?
- Clara? - Mmm?

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,900
我一直在想你为何会投票赞成分享佣金
I can't help wondering why you voted to share the commission.

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,890
我不傻
I'm no fool.

75
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,890
举手反对你 我就会输
Put me hand up against you, I'd have lost

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,890
然后独我一个像是挑衅生事
and be left looking like a trouble-maker.

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,890
- 我相信这不是你的理由 - 那你说呢?
- I don't believe that was your reason. - Then what was it?

78
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,400
其他人都不喜欢这个提议
The other girls didn't like the notion 

79
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,900
你又不想我孤立无援的
and you didn't want to leave me stranded.

80
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,890
你觉得我是和事佬? 你还是不懂我 德妮丝
Think I have a heart of soap? You still don't know me, Denise.

81
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,890
那就是你明白这是个妙计
Then you know it's a good idea.

82
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,890
想听真话么?
Do you want the truth?

83
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,900
你让我们来投票 我感激不尽
You asked us to vote. I was grateful for that.

84
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,890
很好 因为我们将有下一次投票了
Good. Because we're going to have another vote.

85
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,890
- 苍天啊 这次又是什么? - 不知道
- Oh, Lord! What about this time? - I don't know.

86
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,608
我想让每个人轮流提个建议
I'd like each of the girls in turn to make a proposal

87
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:38,890
然后我们投票表决
 and we'll vote on it.

88
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
如果你第一个提出 我将不胜感激 克莱拉
I would appreciate if you would go first, Clara.

89
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,110
如果你看见一个男人戴着一块精美的表
If you watch a man with a fine watch,

90
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:48,890
你怎么看?
 what do you see?

91
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,890
他是个与时间同行的人
He is a man with time on his side.

92
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,890
一个不用依靠时钟的人
A man who won't be watching the clock.

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,890
时间不等人
Time waits for no man.

94
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,890
我们每周一起去游一次泳 算是女孩出游节
Once a week we go swimming together. A girl's day out.

95
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
我们可以看着苏西沉底然后哈哈大笑
We can all watch Susy sinking and have a laugh.

96
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,890
如果新开的美食厅反响不错 先生
If the new Food Hall is a success, sir,

97
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
威斯顿扩张的胃口会增大
Mr Weston will have a taste for more expansion.

98
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,890
他已经和我说了很多
He's already said as much to me.

99
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,890
难不成要眼睁睁地等到难...难以企及?
Are we to wait until he is b...beyond reach?

100
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,890
我们得给他们施压了
We must put more pressure on them.

101
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,890
我们需要做的是让威斯顿先生
What we need, sir, is for Mr Weston to feel

102
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,890
感到在这儿就是丢人现眼
that being here is a humiliation to him.

103
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,900
如果他察觉出自己的妻子还喜欢你...
If he senses that his wife still favours you...

104
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,890
要我做这个 鸡皮疙瘩掉一地了
It makes my skin crawl to do this.

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,890
威斯顿太太享受特权带来的好处 不是么?
Mrs Weston enjoys all the benefits of privilege, does she not?

106
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,890
你我点点滴滴日积月累到到今日
You and I have carved our lives from nothing.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,890
先生 这个女人夺走了你苦心经营的天堂百货
Sir. The same woman stripped you of everything you had worked for.

108
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,471
同样是这个女人寸步不让
The same woman did not flinch,

109
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,900
把你从这个城镇赶走
 driving you from this town.

110
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,890
请你思考一下 她为何召你回来?
I ask you to consider - why does she summon you back here?

111
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
你以为她会对你心存善意?
Do you think she is brimming with good intentions towards you?

112
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,890
- 不 - 我们时间紧迫了
- No. - We have a limited time to act.

113
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,890
你的思想必须集中在必须得到的东西上
You must focus your mind only on what must be achieved.

114
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,890
我们需要别的什么 我们需要更多
We need something else. Something more.

115
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,900
某种能够干扰汤姆・威斯顿的力量
Something to cut into Tom Weston.

116
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,900
你有主意了 先生?
You have an idea in mind, sir?

117
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,890
也许
Perhaps.

118
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
是什么?
What is it?

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,890
我还是不说的好
I'd rather not say.

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
没有犹豫的功夫了
There is no room for hesitation.

121
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,890
你必须去追求她 莫里
You must go after her, Moray,

122
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
施展你的美男计
with all those charms you're famous for.

123
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,890
我觉得这事我需要询问你的丈夫
I realise that this is something I need to ask your husband about,

124
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,890
但是我认为需要先征求你的允许
but I felt obliged to seek your permission first

125
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,890
因为这是很私人的事情 寄托着你的感情
since it's such a personal matter, such a tender issue to you.

126
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,890
什么这么敏感?
What could be so sensitive?

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,890
你父亲的怀表
Your father's watch.

128
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,127
我没法控制地想 
I can't shake off the idea that

129
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:17,890
这块怀表会成为一场展览最神奇的重头戏
 it would make the most magical centrepiece for a display...

130
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,890
我父亲的怀表?
My father's watch?

131
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,890
对 对 它那么的精美绝伦 会吸引...
Yes, yes, it's such a thing of beauty that it would draw...

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,890
它对我的意义无法估量
It is precious to me beyond reckoning.

133
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,890
你认为 为了吸引贩夫走卒进你的商场
Do you suppose I would dangle it before any passing drayman

134
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,890
我会由它悬挂在他们面前摇摆?
in the hope that he will come into your store?

135
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,890
我无意冒犯 凯瑟琳
I had no wish to cause offence, Katherine.

136
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,890
可是你却口不择言
And you made no effort to exercise consideration.

137
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,207
我庆幸没有去问你的丈夫... 
I'm glad that I did not ask your husband... 

138
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:37,900
表不在汤姆手上
Tom does not have it.

139
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
不好意思 我还以为 呃...
I'm sorry. I simply thought that, erm...

140
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,890
我记得你父亲说 由于他膝下无子
I remember your father saying since he had no sons,

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
他会把怀表传给你的丈夫
he would leave it to the man you married.

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,890
是的 这个
Yes. Well.

143
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
那是他曾经考虑过的事情
That may have been something he considered at one time.

144
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,890
呃 希望你能原谅我的不善言辞 凯瑟琳
Erm... I hope you can forgive my clumsiness, Katherine,

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,890
但是 我想要用这场展览来表示尊重...
but I intended for the display to show respect...

146
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,890
如果你称呼我为威斯顿夫人 我将不胜感激
I would appreciate it if you would address me as Mrs Weston.

147
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
当然 威斯顿夫人
Of course. Mrs Weston.

148
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
当然
Of course.

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
德妮丝 请进
Denise. Come in.

150
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,890
你想要和我谈谈是么 威斯顿先生?
You wanted to speak with me, Mr Weston, sir?

151
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,890
从你成为女装部主管开始 
Since you've become Head of Ladieswear there is a matter

152
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,608
我越来越关心一个问题
that is of growing concern to me. 

153
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,890
很抱歉 先生
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

154
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,011
似乎你引进了更多现代化
It seems you're introducing more modern, 

155
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,890
或者可以称之为民主的管理方法
one might even call them democratic methods.

156
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
- 先生 我只是... - 大开眼界
- Sir, I only want... - Most impressive.

157
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,890
我关心的是为何其他的部门还不跟上
My concern is why the other departments so patently lag behind.

158
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,900
我想把所有部门的主管召集起来 听你演讲
I intend to gather all the heads of department together so that you might address them.

159
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,900
也许你可以用你的魔力去鼓舞他们
Perhaps you can infuse them with a touch of your magic.

160
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,890
先生 我不确定我能...
Sir, I am not sure that it is my...

161
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,890
怎么 你不喜欢这主意? 哪还能有更好的?
What, you don't like the idea? What could be better?

162
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,890
我将得益于你的青春奔放
I will gain the benefit of your youthful ebullience

163
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,890
你也将享受你应得的赞誉
and you will enjoy the recognition you deserve.

164
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,890
真的 德妮丝 你可以让自己稍稍享受一下
Surely, Denise, you can let yourself bask just a little

165
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
同事们的钦羡
in the admiration of your peers?

166
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,890
- 那 我... - 很好 
- Well, I... - Good.

167
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
我来安排
I will make the arrangements.

168
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,890
我受邀向各部门主管介绍
I have been asked to make a presentation to the heads of department

169
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,890
我们经营女装部的经验
about how we do things in Ladieswear.

170
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,890
莫里先生为什么让你做这种事?
Why would Mr Moray want you to do a thing like that?

171
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,890
不是莫里叫的 是威斯顿先生
It was not Moray who asked, it was Mr Weston.

172
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,890
我觉得我们可以一起完成 给他们看
What I thought was, we could do it together - show them.

173
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,890
我们需要投票吗? 我要投票 我要投赞成票
Do we have to vote on it? I'll vote. I'll vote yes.

174
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,610
我从没出过风头
I never get to show off. 

175
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,890
这可不是出风头 苏西
It's not about showing off, Susy.

176
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
而是陈述
It's a presentment.

177
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,723
克莱拉? 
Clara? 

178
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:53,890
威斯顿先生为什么让你做这个?
Why would Mr Weston ask you to do such a thing?

179
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,890
他说他想引进现代的工作方法
He said he wants to introduce modern ways of working.

180
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,890
那就是了 莫里先生怎么看?
Oh, that must be it, then. What does Mr Moray think about this?

181
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
我还没告诉他
I haven't told him yet.

182
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
看来要招人议论了
Cat. Pigeons.

183
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,890
年轻姑娘们都一样
All young girls are the same.

184
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,890
十岁的时候 想变成十一岁
When we are ten, we want to be eleven,

185
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,890
十一岁的时候 想变成十二岁
when we are eleven, we want to be twelve.

186
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
我坚持认为 应该享受当下的年龄 芙罗拉
I insist you delight in the age that you are, Flora.

187
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
我今天对德妮丝说了完全一样的话
I was saying quite the same thing to Denise today.

188
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,890
德妮丝?
Denise? 

189
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,890
年轻是她能胜任商场的工作的决定性优势
Her youth is her defining asset in her role in the store.

190
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
充满热情
All that enthusiasm.

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,890
别人几乎无法限制她
One can hardly put a cap on it.

192
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,890
我已经决定了 要激发她全部的热情
I've determined to make the most of it.

193
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,890
你准备怎么做呢 亲爱的?
And how will you do that, darling?

194
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
我要让她成为榜样
I will let her serve as an example

195
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,900
让别人知道该如何处理自己的工作
 to others of how to do their jobs.

196
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
她真是个人物
She's quite something.

197
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,890
你一定会迷倒并教育我们每一个人 德妮丝
I'm sure you will no doubt charm and educate every one of us, Denise.

198
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,890
我只是来分享一些
All I will do is share a few things I have tried

199
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,890
似乎能使我们的工作更容易的经验
which seem to make our work easier.

200
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,890
我只希望资深的员工不会觉得
I only hope the more senior members of staff don't see you

201
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,890
你自认为比他们高明
as placing yourself above them.

202
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,890
但今天对你而言 一定特别美好 当然了
But it will be a wonderful day for you, of course.

203
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,890
同事们不会讨厌德妮丝 我们非常了解她
Her colleagues won't think badly of Denise. We know her enough.

204
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,890
我们都知道 她只是希望百货公司能更好
We all realise that she only wishes to be of benefit to the store.

205
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,890
我相信 她会持友谊精神完成
I'm sure it will be done in the spirit of companionship.

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,890
我也会对她介绍的方法感兴趣
I for one will be interested in what methods she has introduced.

207
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,355
威斯顿先生不持任何怀疑 
Mr Weston would not countenance any doubts.

208
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:00,890
他已经认可了吗?
You've already accepted?

209
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,890
没错 我... 他问过我...
Yes. I... He asked me and...

210
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,900
那你一定得充分利用这次机会了
Then you must make the most of the occasion.

211
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
威斯顿夫人
Mrs Weston.

212
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,890
我改变主意了 这是我父亲的手表
I have had a change of heart. My father's watch.

213
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,355
我现在相信了 
I appreciate now that 

214
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:24,890
你把它放在橱窗展示 是表示对我父亲的尊重
your intention is to honour my father by putting it on display.

215
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,890
我没有理由拒绝你的请求
I see no good reason not to concede to your wishes.

216
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
我非常感激
Then I am most grateful.

217
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
山姆?
Sam?

218
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,890
山姆 看来你的重头展品出现了
Sam, it seems we have your centrepiece for you.

219
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,900
它有上百年的年头了 是我父亲的继承财产
It is over a hundred years old. My father inherited it.

220
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,890
老实说 虽然我经常对顾客编故事
To be honest, as much as I cook up a tale for the customers,

221
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
但我一直认为手表不过就是手表
I always thought a watch was just a watch.

222
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,890
我知道我要的是神奇的东西 先生
I know I asked for something magical, sir,

223
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,890
但这宝贝 我必须得让他们排队看看
but that'll have them queuing up just to take a look at it.

224
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,890
我父亲用这个教我看时间
My father taught me to read the time with this.

225
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,900
那是每天最精彩的时刻
It was the high point of every day.

226
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,890
它让我着了魔了
It has me bewitched.

227
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,890
你让我想起了自己小时候 山姆
You remind me of when I was a child, Sam.

228
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,890
我也曾用过完全相同的词 它让我着了魔了
I used the self-same words about it. It had me bewitched.

229
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,900
我父亲过去常常用它催眠我
My father used to hypnotise me with it.

230
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,890
他在我眼前轻轻地摇晃这只手表
He would swing it gently before my eyes

231
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,900
轻声说话 让我相信他把我带入了幻境
and speak softly and convince me he had induced a trance over me.

232
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,890
它是个奇迹 我应该珍惜它
It is little wonder that I should treasure it so.

233
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
我们会像你一样珍惜它的 夫人
We will treasure it just as much, ma'am.

234
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,890
有件事 我希望你能考虑考虑 莫里
There is one aspect of this matter for which I would ask your consideration, Moray.

235
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,890
我父亲希望把那只手表传给我的丈夫
My father's wishes - that the watch be passed on to the man I marry.

236
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,475
汤姆不知道 
Tom does not know. 

237
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,890
如果你能保密 我将感激不尽
I would appreciate it if you made no mention.

238
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,890
是 是 当然了 还轮不到我来告诉他
Why, yes, yes, of course. It's not my place to tell him.

239
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,890
我意识到您对它的依恋 威斯顿夫人
I realise how deeply attached you are to it, Mrs Weston.

240
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
请叫我凯瑟琳
Please, call me Katherine.

241
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,890
我从没见过这么惊人的东西
I never laid my eyes on anything quite so marvellous.

242
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,890
你觉得它值多少钱 达德利先生?
How much do you suppose it's worth, Mr Dudley?

243
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,890
值我们俩下半辈子的工资 山姆
It would keep the two of us in wages for the rest of our lives, Sam.

244
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,890
但是 你能感觉到
Aye, but you get the feeling that this is worth more

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
它比钱更值钱
than pounds, shillings and pence.

246
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
我希望你没有再次干预莫里的事 乔纳斯
I hope you are not meddling in Moray's affairs again, Jonas.

247
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,895
就如你所见 达德利先生
As you can see, Mr Dudley, 

248
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,890
我只是在处理自己的事
I'm simply going about my duties.

249
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
就是我看不到的才让我担心
It is what I cannot see that concerns me.

250
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,890
我看见莫里和威斯顿夫人在一起
I have watched Moray with Mrs Weston.

251
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,980
他为什么对她这么热忱 这么亲密?
Why is he so cordial, so intimate with her? 

252
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,890
发生什么事了?
What is going on?

253
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:58,890
先生 我不能代表莫里先生
I cannot speak on Mr Moray's behalf, sir.

254
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,890
你说得越礼貌 就越是在狡猾地逃避我的问题
The more polite your tongue, the more slippery you are at avoiding my questions.

255
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,890
我无意冒犯
I mean no offence.

256
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,890
你也无意开诚布公 跟我说实话
Yet you have no wish to be open and honest with me, either.

257
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,890
我知道是你在操纵他
I know that it is you leading him down this path

258
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,100
因为你们俩一个字也不说 
and since I can prise no information from either of you, 

259
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:19,900
我得说 你以为你最清楚吗?
 I will say this. Do you suppose you know best?

260
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,890
我希望你考虑一下现状 先生
I ask you to consider the circumstances, sir.

261
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,890
谁拥有天堂百货 你看到了正义存在吗?
Who owns The Paradise? Is there justice in what you see?

262
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,066
如果汤姆・威斯顿掌握权力 
Do you believe life will get easier

263
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,900
你觉得我们任何人的生活能更好过吗?
 for any of us while Tom Weston holds the whip?

264
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
尤其是莫里先生
Especially for Mr Moray.

265
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,757
你能感觉到自己在看它吗? 
Can you feel your eyes drawn to it?

266
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,900
好似你的视线无法从它身上移开?
 Like you can't stop looking at it?

267
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,890
当然 这还不是它的美妙之处
That's not the beauty of it, of course.

268
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,890
虽然它的确是个漂亮的家伙!
Well, it is a handsome thing!

269
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,890
但这里面的东西 是无法解释的力量
But what we have here is a power beyond explanation.

270
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,890
让我宁愿为它万死不辞
May I fall down and die.

271
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
难道没觉得仿佛时间都静止了吗?
Does it not feel as though time itself has stopped?

272
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,890
你有手表吗 先生?
Do you own a watch, sir?

273
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,890
你看起来很了解时间的重要性
You look like a man who knows the importance of time,

274
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,890
谁不希望自己的口袋里有一块古老的锡铁表呢
who wouldn't have any old piece of tin in your pocket.

275
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
我是说对了 还是说对了?
Am I right or am I right?

276
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,900
这个手表 不在于是否有人买得起它
This watch here, it's not a matter of whether a fella can afford it.

277
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
而在于是否有人买得起 而不想拥有它
It's whether a fella can afford not to own it.

278
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,890
如果我们需要决定一件事情 我们就投票
If there's an issue we need to decide upon, we vote on it.

279
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,420
我本来不想分红 
I didn't want to share my bonus 

280
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,890
但要投票决定时 我就同意了
but when it was voted in, then I did.

281
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,155
我觉得我现在工作更努力了 
I think I work harder now 

282
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:36,890
因为如果姑娘们在为我工作
because if the girls are earning commission for me,

283
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,890
我也应该为她们工作
I ought to make commission for them, too.

284
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,890
我们甚至投票决定今天是否来这里做这个介绍
We even had a vote about whether we would talk to you all today.

285
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,890
作为销售员 我感觉自己是团队一员时
As a shop girl, I did my best work when I felt involved,

286
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,890
工作效率最高
part of a team.

287
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,890
我觉得 如果我们都很享受
I think if we all enjoy ourselves,

288
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,890
顾客也会愿意来这里
then customers will enjoy coming here.

289
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,890
以上就是全部 谢谢大家
I think that's everything. Thank you for coming today.

290
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,890
也许我们应该投票决定是否应该结束
Perhaps we should have a vote to see if our little presentation's over.

291
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,261
非常好! 
Splendid! 

292
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:11,890
今天 德妮丝小姐和她的姑娘们的展示
What Miss Denise and her girls have illustrated for us today

293
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,890
说明我们绝不能固步自封
is that we must not rest on our laurels.

294
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,890
过去的成功秘诀不一定适用于今天
What has brought success in the past will not do today.

295
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,181
很清楚 我们最好意识到
Clearly, we would do well to see 

296
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:24,890
今天介绍的方法是前进的方向
that today's presentation leads the way.

297
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,958
她不令人敬畏吗 莫里? 
Is she not formidable, Moray? 

298
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,900
她们都令人敬畏 先生 她们都令人敬畏
They all were, sir. They all were.

299
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,890
大家都对我非常好
Everybody was so kind to me.

300
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
他们都来问我问题 来祝贺我
They were full of questions and congratulations.

301
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,900
你觉得如何 亲爱的?
What did you think, sweetheart?

302
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,890
告诉我 老实说
Tell me. Tell me honestly.

303
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
我只在乎你的看法
Your opinion's the only one that matters.

304
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
我...
I...

305
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,890
我很高兴你为这里带来了活力 德妮丝
I delight in seeing you light up this place, Denise,

306
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,890
但是我们不能忘记 事情不该是这样
but we must not forget, it is not meant to be this way.

307
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
我们不应该在他们的怜悯或者帮助下生活
We are not meant to be under their mercy or favour.

308
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,900
这里应该属于我们 你知道吗?
This place should be ours. Do you see?

309
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,890
当然了
Of course.

310
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,890
有时候我会激动得忘乎所以
Sometimes I get carried away.

311
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,890
我必须尽全力
I must do my best.

312
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,295
这就是我们必须竭尽全力 
That is why we must go to any lengths 

313
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:34,890
让我重新拥有天堂百货的原因
to make The Paradise mine again.

314
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
而你就是我的女主角
And then you will be my leading lady.

315
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,890
我今天简直就是台推销机器 艾德蒙
I was a selling machine today, Edmund.

316
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,890
我真希望你能看到我们今天的表现
I wish you could have seen us.

317
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,890
你一直都表现得像是一台推销机器 山姆
You're always a selling machine, Sam.

318
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,890
所有人都有一技之长
Every man has to be good at one thing.

319
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,890
我拼命兜售 就好像今天是世界末日一样!
I was peddling like it was the end of the world!

320
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,900
你想知道为什么吗?
And you want to know why?

321
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,890
我的幸运物
My lucky charm.

322
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,890
它怎么在你的口袋里? 这东西可值一大笔钱
What are you doing with that in your pocket? It's worth a fortune.

323
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,096
我就想揣上几个小时 
I thought, for a few hours, 

324
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,890
商店已经关门了 没有人会注意到
while the shop's closed, no-one will notice.

325
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,890
想感受一下怀揣宝物的感觉
See what it feels like to have something precious in my pocket.

326
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,890
实话告诉你 感觉棒极了
And to be honest, it feels marvellous.

327
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,890
这可不像你 山姆 招惹是非
It's not like you, Sam, to flirt with trouble.

328
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,890
我知道 我在陈列室的原位上铺了一块黑布
I know. I put a black cloth over the spot in the cabinet.

329
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,890
没人会注意到它不见了的
No-one will even notice it's missing.

330
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,890
但如果你不小心摔了它或者弄丢了怎么办?
But what if you drop it or you lose it?

331
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,890
我看到它躺在那里 光彩夺目
I saw it there, spellbinding,

332
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,890
我难以自持
I couldn't resist it.

333
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,900
它的质感 它的设计理念
The feel of it. The idea of it.

334
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,181
你得承认 艾德蒙 
You have to admit, Edmund, 

335
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,890
这是个尤物 有生命的瑰宝
it's a thing of beauty, a living wonder.

336
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,890
这确实很美
It's certainly splendid

337
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,890
即时这样我也不认为你应该把它拿出来
but I wouldn't thank you for having that in my pocket.

338
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,039
只是这样握着它 
Just by having it here, 

339
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,890
我就觉得我似乎又高大了一点
I feel an inch taller,

340
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,890
更英俊潇洒 更无所畏惧了
more handsome, more fearless.

341
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,890
世界之王
King of the world.

342
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,154
这种感觉有一个名字 那就是诱惑
There's a name for that. It's called temptation. 

343
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:54,890
你应该抵制诱惑
The thing is to resist it.

344
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,900
啊 你已经老了 就是这样 畏手畏脚的了!
Ah, you're old, that's all. Lost your daring, man!

345
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,890
快点 问我几点了
Ask me what time it is.

346
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,900
- 几点了? - 山姆的时间 没错
- What time is it? - Sam's time, that's what.

347
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
是山姆扬眉吐气的时间
Sam's time to be on top.

348
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,890
他在耍我
He is toying with me.

349
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,792
他知道如果他把那些赞美和成就
He knows that if he can heap praise and advancement 

350
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,341
加于德妮丝身上
onto Denise that

351
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:22,890
我会感到煎熬
 it will torment me.

352
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,890
那么您要做出选择 先生
Then you have a choice, sir.

353
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,715
要么让他占上风
You can let him win the day,

354
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,540
要么你可以表现出同样的老道和勇敢 
or you can meet him with as much 

355
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,890
与他正面交锋
cunning and daring.

356
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,196
如果您能成功地让威斯顿先生清楚地意识到
If you manage to plant into Mr Weston's mind 

357
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:36,855
他的妻子在对您献殷勤的话 
the clear idea that his wife is pursuing you,

358
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:38,900
他会想找个人聊一聊的
 he will want someone to talk to.

359
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
我已经和他建立起了些许的信任
I have already established some trust between he and I.

360
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,890
要是我让他发现我对您抱有怨言的话
If I let him see that I hold a festering resentment towards you,

361
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,900
他会对我更加信赖
he might begin to confide in me.

362
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,890
怎么了 乔纳斯?
What is it, Jonas?

363
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,900
哦 请原谅我 先生
Oh, forgive me, sir.

364
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,890
我不应该表现出这样沮丧的状态
I should not let my frustration show in such a manner.

365
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,890
恕我冒昧 让我回去工作吧
If I may, I will return to my duties.

366
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,890
你因为什么事情不开心吗?
Something has upset you?

367
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,890
感谢您的关心 先生
I appreciate your concern, sir,

368
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,890
但是我不能用我的对上司不满的情绪来麻烦您
but I cannot trouble you with my grievances against my employer.

369
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,890
我这样的行为真是太可悲了 恕我冒昧...
It was petty of me to behave in this way. If I may...

370
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,900
莫里? 他做了什么让你这样不安?
Moray? What has he done to disturb you?

371
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,890
这些年来 我尽职尽责的服侍这个男人
I have served that man for some years with loyalty and dedication

372
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,890
十分恪尽职守
beyond the call of duty.

373
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,900
难道我不值得得到雇主的信任吗?
Do I not deserve the reward of my employer's trust?

374
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,890
不知为什么我觉得信任感对我非常重要 先生
I don't know why it matters so much to me to be trusted, sir,

375
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,890
但是确实非常重要
but it does.

376
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,900
在我看来 你想错了方向 乔纳斯
It seems to me you have the equation the wrong way around, Jonas.

377
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,900
你应该扪心自问 莫里是否真的值得你的忠诚
You should ask yourself if Moray is worthy of your loyalty.

378
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,052
她亲自告诉我的... 凯瑟琳・威斯顿 
She told me herself... Katherine Weston. 

379
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:26,890
那块表具有魔力
That watch has powers.

380
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,890
催眠的魔力
Hypnotic powers.

381
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,890
她的家族里 过去的时候
Her family, in her family, going back,

382
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,890
他们会用表来催眠对方
they used to mesmerise each other with it.

383
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,890
她的父亲精通于此
Her father was the master of it.

384
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,890
要不然你想他是如何得到财富的
How else do you suppose he got his riches?

385
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,890
魔力 不可思议的魔力
Powers. Incredible powers.

386
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,052
把你那套说辞留给顾客们吧 山姆 
Save your patter for the customers, Sam. 

387
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:42,890
我站在这儿
As I stand here.

388
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,890
好吧 坐在这儿 我自己可以感觉到
Well, sit here. I felt it myself.

389
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,890
我相信他 什么是催眠的 山姆?
I believe him. What is hypnotic, Sam?

390
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,890
是催眠 苏西 就是一种睡眠
Hypnosis, Susy, well, it's a kind of sleep.

391
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,890
好吧 也不完全是睡觉 就好像...
Well, not sleep exactly. It's like...

392
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,655
啊 和入睡的状态不同 
Ah, it's not like being asleep. 

393
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,890
就好像你在这儿但其实不在这儿
It's like being here but not being here.

394
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,890
苏西即使是在最佳状态的时候也是这种感觉
That's what Susy feels like at the best of times.

395
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,890
就好像是眩晕 那种感觉
It's like being dazzled, kind of thing.

396
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,295
什么 像喝醉了一样吗? 
What, like being drunk? 

397
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,890
你怎么知道喝醉了是什么感觉?
What do you know about being drunk?

398
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,900
不是 催眠 就是...
No. Hypnosis, it's...

399
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,890
被催眠了就好像是处在一个无所不能的世界里
Being hypnotised is like being in a world where everything is possible.

400
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,890
如果你想跳舞 就可以像芭蕾舞者翩然起舞
If you want to dance you'll be like a ballerina.

401
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,890
要是你想唱歌 你的歌喉会像鸣鸟一样悦耳
If you want to sing, you'll warble like a songbird.

402
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,890
你好像是活在你的愿望里
It's like being in a kind of wish.

403
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,890
那我们所有人都应该一直被催眠啊
We should all do it all the time.

404
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,768
哦 我想被催眠的
Oh, I want to be hypnotic.

405
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,890
是被催眠
 Hypnotised.

406
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,890
你会催眠吗? 能不能把我催眠 山姆?
Can you? Can you hypnotise me, Sam?

407
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,890
小心点 苏西 他会把你弄昏之后
Careful, Susy, he'll put you under

408
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,890
告诉你把你每周的薪水交给他
then tell you to give him your wages every week.

409
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,890
要是你想体验一把灵魂出窍的感觉
If you are looking for an out of body experience,

410
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,890
那你可找对人啦 苏西
you have come to the right fella, Susy.

411
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,890
今夜 商店打烊后
Tonight. After we close.

412
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,890
- 我们都能来吗? - 为什么不呢?
- Can we all come? - Why not?

413
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,900
来吧 在大堂 我们打烊之后
Go on, then. In the Great Hall. After we close.

414
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,257
我想说做的好 梅尔托 
I wanted to say well done, Myrtle. 

415
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,890
对我说 先生?
To me, sir?

416
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,101
那些你为了新的美食厅制作的面包 
The breads, pies, pastries you've cooked for 

417
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:54,890
馅饼 糕点 让人口水直流啊
the new Food Hall are mouth-watering.

418
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,890
- 销售额非常不错 - 真的吗 先生?
- The sales are extraordinary. - Are they, sir?

419
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,890
- 我是说 谢谢您 先生 - 是的
I mean, thank you, sir. Oh, yes.

420
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,890
现在我们必须更进一步
Now we must step up the splendour.

421
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,890
你的厨房做出点特别的东西
Perhaps something special from your kitchen

422
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,890
让美食厅成为天堂百货的谈资
to make the Food Hall the talk of The Paradise.

423
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,890
听上去真不错啊 先生
That sounds marvellous, sir.

424
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
那么你会给我来点什么?
So what will you provide me with?

425
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,890
您心中想的是什么? 威斯顿先生
What did you have in mind, Mr Weston?

426
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,890
我想的是你会给我来点让人难以抗拒的东西
I had in mind that you would offer me something truly irresistible.

427
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,900
那种能放在橱窗展示的东西 梅尔托
Something to put in the front window, Myrtle.

428
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,900
它的美甚至让珠宝相形见绌
Something that might outshine even a jewel.

429
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,890
我尽力 先生
I will, sir.

430
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,890
让我好好地想一想 看看我能想出点什么来
Let me just scratch my head for a while, see what I can come up with.

431
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
当然了 我会很快再和你聊的
Of course. We'll speak again soon.

432
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,890
- 凯瑟琳 - 哦!
- Katherine. - Oh!

433
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
事实证明 你父亲的表确实是一块珍宝
Your father's watch has proven to be quite a success.

434
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,890
你说的对 当然了
You were right, of course.

435
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,890
我就知道你是对的
I should have known you would be.

436
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,890
它是一件那么华丽的珍宝
Well, it's such a magnificent treasure,

437
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,890
我现在知道了你独自珍藏的原因了
I can understand why you might want to keep it to yourself.

438
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,900
哦 但是我并不想永远留在手里
Oh, but I did not always wish to keep it.

439
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,900
有些话我难以启齿 你听了也会觉得不可思议
I know it is difficult to say, and to hear, such a thing.

440
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,900
但是似乎于我而言 最好还是将事实告诉你
But it seems to me now it is better to tell the truth.

441
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,890
我们一起经历的了这么多的事情 你和我
We have been through so much together, you and I.

442
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
我们之间当然不需要任何的隐藏了
Surely we have no room for pretences any more.

443
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,890
我必须要坦白
I have a confession to make.

444
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,900
我没有把这块怀表给汤姆的原因
Why I have never passed the watch on to Tom.

445
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,900
因为我的父亲想要把它给你
My father wanted you to have it.

446
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,890
真的吗 凯瑟琳?
Is that true, Katherine?

447
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,890
你父亲从来没有对我表现出如此的喜爱
Your father did not exhibit such a fondness for me.

448
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,890
是真的
It is true.

449
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
差不多吧
Almost true.

450
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
我想让他把表给你 在我们的...
I wanted him to give it to you at our...

451
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
我似乎无法让这种念头消散
I can't seem to let that idea go.

452
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
也许这就是我无法把表给汤姆的原因吧
Perhaps that is why I can't face giving it to Tom.

453
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,890
过往发生的一切事情 我知道你无法原谅我 
I know you can never forgive me for what happened,

454
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,890
因为我那样对你 对你的...
for what I did to you, and to your...

455
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
请别糟蹋了我的好意
Don't spoil it, please.

456
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
这么想对汤姆不公平
It feels unfair to Tom to feel this way.

457
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,890
这就是为什么我这样下定决心
Which is why I have decided it is best

458
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,073
汤姆永远也不会知道
he never knows that 

459
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,900
这块表本是应该传给我的丈夫的
my father intended his watch to go to my husband.

460
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
我明白
I understand.

461
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
你注意到了吗?
Have you noticed?

462
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,900
我们又像以前一样沿街漫步了
We have fallen into promenading along the street, as we used to.

463
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
有些东西永远不会消失
Some things are never lost.

464
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
- 威斯顿夫人 - 请坐过来 克莱拉 
- Mrs Weston. - Sit with me, Clara.

465
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,890
我正想和你私下里聊一聊
I was hoping to speak with you privately.

466
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,890
你为什么想要和我聊天呢 夫人?
Why would you wish to speak to me, ma'am?

467
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,890
你大概是德妮丝最亲近的朋友了吧
You are perhaps closest to Denise.

468
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,890
我在担忧她会怎么想那块表的事情
I have been concerned how she might be feeling about the watch.

469
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,850
那块表? 
The watch? 

470
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,890
她对那块表很在意吗? 威斯顿夫人
I don't know that she's greatly aware of it, Mrs Weston.

471
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,097
我想说的是 
What I mean is, 

472
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,890
我竟然把我家族里这样贵重的物品交付于他
that I should entrust Moray with such a precious thing from my family.

473
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,890
我的理解是 那块表是为了促销 夫人
My understanding is that it was here for a promotion, ma'am.

474
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,890
是的 是的 是这样
Yes. Yes, that is so.

475
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,890
但是这种事很容易被误解
But these things can easily be misinterpreted,

476
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,890
考虑到是莫里这样的人
given the kind of man Moray is,

477
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,900
你我心里都清楚
as both you and I know.

478
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,890
那他是怎样的人?
And what kind of man is that?

479
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
一个受情绪所控的人
A man ruled by his passions.

480
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,890
我不想让任何人觉得我给了他鼓励
I would not like anyone to think I had encouraged him.

481
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
任何人 你的意思是说德妮丝?
By anyone, you mean Denise?

482
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
你为什么不考虑一下德妮丝的感受?
Why would you be concerned for Denise's feelings?

483
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,890
现在 我们对另一个女人的同情
There comes a point when our fellow-feeling for another woman

484
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
最能触动我们的心
is what touches us most.

485
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,890
坦率的讲 自从莫里伤害了我们 克莱拉
Frankly, since Moray has hurt both you and me, Clara,

486
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,566
我们的同情心已经没有了 不是吗 
our sympathies go, do they not, 

487
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,900
对那些现在还爱着他
to the woman who loves him now...

488
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
...还信任他的女人的同情心?
..who trusts him now?

489
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,890
夫人 你是在告诉我他...
Ma'am, are you telling me that he has...

490
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,900
你和我一样了解他 克莱拉
You know the kind of man he is as well as I do, Clara.

491
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
现在 我要你放松 苏西
Now, I want you to relax, Susy.

492
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,890
放松
Relax.

493
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
放松
Relax.

494
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,900
- 放松 - 或许你只要放慢呼吸
- Relax. - Perhaps if you just breathe gently.

495
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
现在...
Now...

496
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,890
我要你看着这块表
I want you to look at the watch.

497
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
我要你相信这块表的力量
I want you to believe in the power that is in this watch.

498
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,890
它是你眼中唯一能看到的
It is the only thing that your eyes can see,

499
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
它是世上仅有的东西
the only thing in the world.

500
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
让你的眼睛跟随着它
Let your eyes follow the watch.

501
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,900
你能感觉到你的眼睛变得很重 很累
You can feel your eyes growing heavy, tired.

502
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,890
你感觉到你想要闭上双眼
You can feel you want to close your eyes.

503
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,900
让你的眼皮放下来 闭上
Let your eyelids fall, closed.

504
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
闭上眼睛
Closed.

505
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,989
你依然能看到这块表 苏西 
You can still see the watch, Susy, 

506
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,890
因为它在你脑海里
because the watch is in your mind.

507
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,900
这感觉很奇妙 是你从未体会过的美妙
It feels wonderful. It is the best you have ever felt.

508
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,900
现在我要你伸出你的双手 苏西
Now I want you to hold out your hands for me, Susy.

509
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,900
我要在你的两手间放一只铅笔
I'm going to put a pencil in between your fingers.

510
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
你能感觉到吗?
Can you feel that?

511
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,890
现在这只铅笔夹在你的指尖上
Now the pencil is becoming stuck to your fingertips.

512
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,890
这只表想要你感受铅笔在你的指尖有多么牢固
The watch wants you to feel how stuck the pencil is.

513
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,890
你想让它掉下去但是你做不到
You want to let go of it but you can't

514
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,900
因为它已经粘在你的指尖上 它不会掉的
because it's stuck to your fingertips. It won't drop.

515
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,890
现在我要从你的指尖上拿走铅笔 苏西
Now I'm going to take the pencil from your fingertips, Susy,

516
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
因为这只表想要你放开铅笔
because the watch wants you to let it go...

517
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
现在!
now!

518
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,890
当我一吹口哨 苏西 你就睁开眼睛 慢慢地
When I whistle a tune, Susy, you will open your eyes, slowly 

519
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,890
慢慢地 当你睁开眼睛 
slowly, and when you open your eyes

520
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
你的脑海中只有一件事
you will have only one thought in your mind.

521
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,900
我一定要请山姆喝杯啤酒
I must buy Sam a beer.

522
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,890
我要请山姆喝杯啤酒
I will buy Sam a beer.

523
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,890
山姆是个好小伙 山姆是个英俊的野兽
Sam is a fine lad. Sam is a handsome beast.

524
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,900
一个女孩会为山姆这样的小伙倾心
A girl could fall for a lad like Sam.

525
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
请山姆喝一杯
Buy Sam a beer.

526
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,890
我们今晚要去三冠酒店吗?
Are we going over to the Three Crowns tonight?

527
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
我要请山姆喝一杯
I want to buy Sam a beer.

528
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,890
乔纳斯 非常感谢你今晚能来
Jonas, thank you for coming out here at night.

529
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
我们喝一杯怎么样?
Shall we have a drink?

530
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,471
我以前从未发现山姆是这么英俊 
I never realised how handsome Sam is before. 

531
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:23,900
我真为他着迷
I've quite fallen for him.

532
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,890
我能看出来 乔纳斯 你是一个
I see in you, Jonas, a man

533
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,890
只想为你的雇主专心服务的人
who wishes only to be of service to his employer.

534
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,890
遗憾的是 我们已经有了共识
Sadly, we have established, have we not,

535
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,900
莫里不值得你对他这么忠诚 不是吗?
that Moray is undeserving of your loyalty?

536
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel.

537
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,890
我和我的妻子诚心诚意地让莫里回到这
My wife and I have in good faith brought Moray back here,

538
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,890
给他一个值得信任并负责任的职位
given him a position of responsibility and trust,

539
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,467
但我仍感觉他在密谋
yet I have the feeling he's plotting 

540
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:02,890
想从我们身边夺走天堂百货
to take The Paradise away from us.

541
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,890
如果他真是这样 先生 他隐藏的可够好的
Well, if he is, sir, he's keeping it well hidden.

542
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
关键是 乔纳斯 
The point is, Jonas, 

543
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,900
我看重并且信任你对商场所付出一切
I value and trust your dedication to the store.

544
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,890
我必须要承认 先生 天堂百货所缺少的
I do have to admit, sir, that what The Paradise sorely needs is

545
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,890
正是像您这样的人
a man, like you,

546
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,890
让这个地方的荣誉能得以恢复
to restore some honour to the place.

547
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,900
一个与众不同的战士 我们怎能不跟随您呢?
A soldier of distinction - how can we not follow you?

548
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,890
想想看我能在一个您这样
To think that I am working for a man

549
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,900
勇于为国家奉献的人手下工作
who served his country so heroically.

550
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,900
你怎么知道我在军队服过役?
How do you know about my time in the army?

551
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,168
请原谅 威斯顿先生 
Forgive me, Mr Weston. 

552
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:48,890
军旅生涯一直是我所向往的
Military history is a passion of mine.

553
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,890
印度兵变真是个野蛮的行动
The Indian Mutiny was a barbaric business

554
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,395
对我来说 能坐在一个经历了那战役的人 
and for me to find myself sitting next to a man 

555
00:33:57,396 --> 00:34:01,890
指挥战斗 因为英勇而授勋的人身边...
who was there, an officer who led the fight, was decorated for his courage...

556
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,900
能为您这样的人服务是我莫大的荣幸 先生
it would be a great honour to serve you in any way you consider, sir.

557
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,890
密切监视莫里
Keep a watch on Moray.

558
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,900
弄清楚他在密谋什么
Find out what he is contriving.

559
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,890
您选的这只真是太棒了 真惹人注目
Ah, it's a wonderful piece you've chosen. Spectacular.

560
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
那么 慢走 谢谢
Well, enjoy and thank you.

561
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,890
我们今晚一起出去吗?
Shall we walk out tonight?

562
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,890
或许我们都会去三冠酒店
Aye, we'll probably all go over to The Three Crowns, I suppose.

563
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,900
不 我没说所有人 我是说就你和我
Well, no, I don't mean all. I mean just you and me.

564
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,938
苏西 关于那只表的所有小把戏 
Susy, all that carry on with the watch,

565
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:40,890
都只是开玩笑的
 it was just a lark.

566
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,890
你真是个英俊的野兽
You're such a handsome beast.

567
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,890
苏西 催眠术只不过是个笑话
Susy. Hypnosis - it's nothing more than a joke.

568
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,890
那只表也没有任何力量 它只是一只表
That watch has no power. It's just a watch.

569
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,890
- 你用它来看时间而已 - 我爱上你了 
- You tell the time with it. - I could fall for a lad like you.

570
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,890
我能说 慢点 你没有爱上我 什么都没发生
Can I just say, slow down? You're not in love with me. Nothing happened.

571
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,890
也许你觉得发生了什么
You might think that something happened

572
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,890
但那只是因为 你就是这样的人
but that's just because, well, it's the kind of person you are.

573
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,895
所以如果你能仔细想想 
So if you could just get it into your mind 

574
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,890
那只表并没有让你爱上我
that that watch did not make you fall in love with me.

575
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,900
达德利先生来了 你最好赶快回你的部门
Oh, there's Mr Dudley, you'd better get back to your department.

576
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
- 晚上见 - 好的
- See you tonight. - Sure.

577
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
能否给我来杯茶 梅尔托?
Any chance of a cup of tea, Myrtle?

578
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,890
我今晚真不敢去酒吧了
I daren't go to the pub tonight.

579
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,890
苏西好像把那个该死的催眠当真了
Susy seems to think that that damned hypnotism was real.

580
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,259
她一直对我暗送秋波 
She keeps making eyes at me 

581
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,890
像个忠实的小狗一样缠着我
and pestering me like a devoted puppy.

582
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,890
山姆 你正是我要的人
Oh, Sam, you're just the lad I need.

583
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,890
威斯顿先生让我为美食厅做点特别的
Mr Weston has asked me to do something special for the Food Hall

584
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,890
但我的脑子里一点概念都没有
and there's not a notion in my head.

585
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,038
我不是厨子 梅尔托 
I'm no cook, Myrtle. 

586
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,890
不 但你可以用你的表给我催眠
No, but you could mesmerise me with the watch

587
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,890
那么也许我会突发灵感
so that something might appear.

588
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,608
我不是说了吗? 那是胡说八道的 
Didn't I just say? It's nonsense.

589
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,943
我都是装的 那只是个笑话 哈哈! 
 I was pretending. It was a joke. Ha-ha!

590
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:53,900
是的 我知道 但你能不能试试?
Yes, I know that. But will you try?

591
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
你好 山姆
Hello, Sam.

592
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,890
德妮丝 你的演讲真让人大受鼓舞
Denise, your presentation was quite an inspiration.

593
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,890
- 每个人都在谈论你 - 谢谢 先生
- Everyone is talking about it. - Thank you, sir.

594
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,890
我突然想到或许你应该在每个部门都呆一天
Yes. It occurs to me that you might spend a day in each department,

595
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,890
给他们注入从你身上散发出来的那种生活乐趣
infuse them with that joie de vivre that seems to spill out of you.

596
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,890
呃 先生 我们实施政策之前
Er, isn't this something we ought to discuss

597
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,890
不应该先讨论一下吗?
before implementing policy on the hoof, sir?

598
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,890
以我的经验来说 经营一家商场
In my experience of running a store,

599
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,890
这种决策应该先在管理层中讨论过
one must consider such things amongst management

600
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,890
再通知员工
before speaking to the staff. 

601
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,475
你怎么想的 德妮丝? 
What do you think, Denise? 

602
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:46,900
- 先生 能否... - 不能 德妮丝?
- Sir, if I may... - You may not. Denise?

603
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,890
这不是我能决定的 先生
It is not for me to decide, sir.

604
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,900
我不是在让你决定 我是在问你的意见
I'm not asking you to decide. I'm asking for your opinion.

605
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,890
我可以的 先生 当然要其他部门都同意
It could only work, sir, with the consent of the other departments.

606
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,890
没问题 你可以从厨房开始
Of course. You can start in the kitchens.

607
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
我看不出来梅尔托会反对 你呢?
I can't see Myrtle objecting, can you?

608
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,287
只要能找到机会 
Every opportunity he can find

609
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:21,890
他就对德妮丝大加赞扬并四处推广
 he is lavishing praise and promotion onto Denise.

610
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,890
莫里 你现在比任何时候都要学会控制
Moray, now more than ever you must show restraint.

611
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,890
他仗势欺人 我们都知道他是个怎样的混蛋
He is a bully. We all know what a bully he is.

612
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,890
一个被宠坏的孩子肯定会自行其事
A spoiled child who must have his own way.

613
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,890
我求你 别把事弄大了 别密谋反对他
I implore you, do not rise to this. Do not scheme against him.

614
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,890
我不会让他弄垮我的
I will not let him crush me.

615
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,728
我知道 你在谋画些什么
You're up to something. I know it. 

616
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,890
为什么你不告诉我...?
Why won't you tell me...?

617
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,890
达德利 相信我 我知道我在做什么
Dudley, just trust that I know what I'm doing.

618
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,890
我不能 忠诚不是条单行道
I cannot. Loyalty is not a one-way track.

619
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,890
我试图鼓励你来告诉我到底发生了什么
I have tried to encourage you to tell me what is going on.

620
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,890
你拒绝了 也就是说你不信任我
You refuse. That means you do not trust me.

621
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,616
达德利... 
Dudley... 

622
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,890
你还把希望都寄托于乔纳斯
Yet you choose to lay your faith in Jonas.

623
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
这是为了我们大家都好
It's for the good of all of us.

624
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
那为什么我从你脸上看到的不是这样?
Then why is that not what I see in your face?

625
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,890
你来主管? 我的厨房?
In charge? You? My kitchen?

626
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,890
不是主管 不是
Not in charge, no.

627
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,900
就一天而已 也许我们在一起会很开心
Simply, for one day, we might have some fun together.

628
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,890
如果你不愿意我不会这样做的 梅尔托
I don't wish to do this if you don't want me here, Myrtle.

629
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,900
如果一天变成了两天呢 然后呢
What if one day becomes two? What then?

630
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,890
威斯顿先生想要一份橱窗展品
Mr Weston wants a display for the window.

631
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,890
我觉得... 梅尔托蛋糕最好
I thought... Myrtle Cake.

632
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,038
梅尔托蛋糕? 
Myrtle Cake? 

633
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,890
你的食谱 十八个鸡蛋
Your recipe. Eighteen eggs.

634
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,890
我可以装饰一边的窗户 还有鸡
We could decorate the window at one end, chickens.

635
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,890
活鸡 用玉米喂它们
Live chickens, feeding on corn.

636
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,890
第二层摆上堆积如山的鸡蛋
And next to that a mountain of eggs.

637
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,900
然后 在漂亮的展台上的就是 梅尔托蛋糕
And then, on a beautiful stand - Myrtle Cake.

638
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,890
梅尔托蛋糕
Myrtle Cake.

639
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,890
你可以用各种糖果和装饰来美化它
You could decorate it with all manner of sweets and ornaments.

640
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,890
我们也许可以
We might sell the recipe.

641
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,890
向买蛋糕的顾客售卖食谱
And for those customers who buy the cake,

642
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,496
他们可以来你的厨房 
they could come into your kitchen 

643
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:03,890
听你是如何学到做这个蛋糕的故事
and hear your tales of how you learned to make the cake.

644
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,466
你告诉威斯顿先生这个主意了吗? 
Did you tell Mr Weston this idea? 

645
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,890
- 还没有 - 我们可以一起告诉他
- Not yet. - We might tell him together.

646
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,802
过来 如果你想在我的厨房工作
Here! If you're going to be working in my kitchen 

647
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:11,890
你需要一条围裙
you'll need an apron.

648
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,890
你知道我们要放什么在梅尔托蛋糕里吗?
You know what we might put in this Myrtle Cake?

649
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,900
柠檬 蜜糖和姜来给蛋糕一点梅尔托的味道
Lemon and treacle and ginger to give it that bit of Myrtle spice!

650
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,890
忙着掌控世界啊 德妮丝
So busy taking over the world, Denise,

651
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,890
你应该认真确定你没有错过真正重要的部分
you ought to be careful you don't miss out what really matters.

652
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,852
你什么意思? 
What do you mean? 

653
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,890
你那么喜欢这个 不是吗?
Well, you love it all so much, don't you?

654
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,850
他们可以把你放在店里的任何角落
They could drop you anywhere in the store, 

655
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:33,890
城市的任何地方
anywhere in the city,

656
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,890
然后你让事情按着你的方式来
and you would make it sing to your tune.

657
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,890
- 那又怎么样呢? - 没什么
- What's wrong with that? - Nothing.

658
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,890
确实那样没什么不对的
There is really nothing wrong with that.

659
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
你想对我说什么 克莱拉?
What are you trying to say to me, Clara?

660
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,890
朋友们尝试警告我
Friends tried to warn me

661
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,890
我生活的方式会赶上我
the way I lived me life would catch up with me

662
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,890
但是我必须自己领会
but I had to learn it for myself.

663
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,900
也许我们都需要自己领会
Perhaps we all have to learn it for ourselves.

664
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,890
山姆 我听说我父亲的手表曾引起轰动
I hear my father's watch has caused something of a stir, Sam.

665
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,890
夫人 我会说 这比轰动更厉害
More of a splash than a stir, I would say, ma'am.

666
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,890
我想请问你 当你告诉我们这个手表...
Might I ask when you told us about the watch,

667
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,890
那个... 催眠术
you know, the hypnotism

668
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,890
还有你父亲在你小时候给你施法的事情
and your father saying that as a child he could put you under his spell,

669
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,890
那都是开玩笑吗?
that was all jest?

670
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,890
当然啦 我父亲很会说笑
Yes, of course. My father was quite the tease.

671
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,890
正如我所想的
That's what I thought.

672
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,890
他只是骗骗我而已
He was fooling with me, that's all.

673
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,890
但是 有一次他说服了我
Except, there was that one time he convinced me

674
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,890
在手表的影响下我说了外语
that under the influence of the watch I had spoken a foreign language.

675
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,762
我想是希腊语 
Greek, I believe. 

676
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:38,900
- 希腊语? - 是啊 但是真的很有趣
- Greek? - Yes, but it was all rather good fun.

677
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,890
确实有一件事让我感到惊讶
There was that one incident that did rather astonish me.

678
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,890
小时候 我不爱吃卷心菜
As a child, I refused to eat cabbage,

679
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,890
但是有一次
yet on one occasion,

680
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,890
我父亲在饭桌上拿手表在我眼前晃
my father dangled the watch in front of me at the dinner table

681
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,890
然后我吃了很多卷心菜 也没有抱怨
and I ate a plateful without complaint.

682
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,890
- 卷心菜? - 我甚至乐在其中
- Cabbage? - I rather enjoyed it, too.

683
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,890
- 我想孩子总是乐于接受建议的 - 是的
- I suppose a child's mind is open to suggestion. - Yes. That's it.

684
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,890
有一个关于做这个手表的人的神秘故事
Oh, and there was such a mystery about the watchmaker who made it.

685
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,890
他左手似乎有六个手指
He had six fingers on his left hand, apparently.

686
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,890
他还能看到未来
And he could see into the future.

687
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,890
我父亲喜欢跟我说这些故事
My father loved to tell me these stories.

688
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,900
那些故事总让我吓坏了
They used to frighten the life out of me.

689
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
六个手指
Six fingers.

690
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,890
失陪了 先生
Excuse me a moment, sir.

691
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,574
你肯定会觉得我一直在关注传家宝 
You will think I am keeping an eye on the family heirloom, 

692
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:32,890
我来得太勤了
I'm in here so often.

693
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
完全没有 很高兴见到你
Not at all. It's a pleasure to see you.

694
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
实际上 我想...
In truth, I wanted to...

695
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,890
我想我那天说了太多了
I think I said rather too much the other day.

696
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,890
不不不 我很高兴我们聊天了 凯瑟琳
No, no, no, no. I'm glad that we spoke, Katherine.

697
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,890
我很高兴知道我们之间的感情没有消失
It has eased my mind to know that the fondness between us is not lost.

698
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,900
我也这么觉得
Yes. I feel the same way.

699
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,125
如果像我们之前那样亲密的两个人之间有敌意
When two people have been as close as we were, - then it hurts too much for

700
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,900
- 那就太伤人了 - 是啊
- there to be any ill will. - Yes.

701
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,900
也许我们可以时常聚聚喝杯咖啡
Perhaps we could meet from time to time, for coffee?

702
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,900
- 我很乐意 - 那我们一定要聚聚
- I would like that. - Well, then, we must.

703
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,890
也许... 汤姆有时候会无理地嫉妒
Perhaps... Tom can be so unreasonably jealous sometimes,

704
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,900
所以不要让他知道
it would be unhelpful for him to know.

705
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,900
如果你希望这样 那我当然会尊重你的意愿
If that is what you prefer, then, of course, I will respect your wishes.

706
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,900
莫里 你愿意和我还有我妻子一起共进晚餐吗
Moray! Would you be so kind as to join my wife and I for dinner?

707
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,890
如果你希望的话
If you wish, sir.

708
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,900
我是说 我很高兴你邀请我 我有一点意外
What I mean is, I am grateful for the invitation, if a little surprised.

709
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,890
我有一些消息
I have some news.

710
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,890
好消息最好是伴着香槟酒到来
Good news is always best delivered with a glass of champagne.

711
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,890
对我来说是好消息吗 你让我好奇了
Good news for me? You have me curious, sir.

712
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,718
这好消息是给德妮丝的 
The news is for Denise. 

713
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,900
是你来邀请她还是我来?
Will you invite her or shall I?

714
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,900
你好 山姆
Hello, Sam.

715
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,900
我得赶回店里
I've just got to run back to the store.

716
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,890
他有消息为什么不直接告诉我们呢?
If he has news, then why doesn't he simply tell us?

717
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,890
为什么邀请我们去他家?
Why invite us to the house?

718
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,890
想到和他们共进晚餐就苦恼
The thought of dinner with them is excruciating.

719
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,890
你自己说的 我们必须和他们保持良好的关系
You said yourself, we must keep good relations with them

720
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,890
这正是我们现在在做的
and that is what we are doing.

721
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,890
- 我不相信他 - 我想他也不相信你
- I don't trust him. - I don't suppose he trusts you either.

722
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,118
你是什么意思呢? 
What do you mean? 

723
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,890
他知道你想要把天堂百货拿回来
He knows you want The Paradise back

724
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,694
你在千方百计达到你的目的  
and that you are looking for ways to do that. 

725
00:44:03,695 --> 00:44:04,890
我们必须谨慎 德妮丝
We must be wary, Denise.

726
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,890
不管是什么消息 其中肯定有陷阱
Whatever this news is, there will be a trap in it.

727
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,890
约翰 也许这个晚上是向他们证明
John, perhaps this evening is an opportunity to prove to them

728
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,890
我们很融洽的机会
how devoted we are to one another

729
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,900
我们一起就不用害怕他们
and that together we're not afraid of them.

730
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,900
是的
Yes.

731
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,890
晚餐? 这里? 他们两个人?
Dinner? Here? The two of them?

732
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,890
- 我想一定会很有趣 - 你应该先问问我
- I thought it might be rather fun. - You might have asked me.

733
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,588
也许你和莫里在众目睽睽之下
And you might have asked me before you took to 

734
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:32,890
沿着托尔盖特街散步之前
promenading along Tollgate Street with Moray,

735
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,890
- 也应该先问问我 - 我明白了
- for all the world to gaze upon and wonder. - I see.

736
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,900
我了解到 在那个职位上 她有很强的欲望
I have learnt by being about that place that she has quite an appetite.

737
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,890
德妮丝很有野心 我很乐意去培养她
Denise is bubbling with ambition. It pleases me to foster that.

738
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,900
她所有的表现都比他更出色
She shows every sign of outshining him.

739
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,900
莫里也许不是适合她的男人
Moray may prove to be not man enough for her.

740
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,900
我喜欢在这里招待她这个主意
I like the idea of entertaining her here.

741
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,900
我猜她会喜欢烛光闪闪的晚餐
I suspect she will have a taste for a little glitter.

742
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,900
正如我说的 威斯顿先生在战斗中受伤了
Mr Weston, as I suggested to you, sir, was injured in battle.

743
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,900
"退役军官因战斗英勇获维多利亚十字勋章"

744
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,890
恐怕伤得很严重
Hurt badly it would seem.

745
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,890
从印度回来 从军队退役
Returned home from India, retired from the army.

746
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,900
那是否就可以解释...?
Then might that not explain...?

747
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,890
汤姆・威斯顿为他的国家效力
Tom Weston was serving his country

748
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,890
我却在这里卖最新的时尚品
while I was here selling the latest fashions.

749
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,900
难怪他对我这样的人有怨恨
Is it any wonder he holds a grudge against men like me?

750
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,890
他已经遭受了远超我想象的痛苦
Is it not shameful of us to inflict further turmoil

751
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,890
我们还对要对付他 不是很可耻吗?
on the soldier who's suffered beyond anything I can imagine?

752
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
如果你可怜他 你就永远不能打败他
If you pity the man you will never defeat him.

753
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,890
先生 恕我直言
Sir, if I may.

754
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,890
威斯顿先生必须知道那只手表的事
Mr Weston must learn about the watch, sir.

755
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,890
我能找到机会告诉他
I can find an opportunity to present him with the knowledge

756
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,890
他的妻子向他隐瞒了她父亲的意愿
that his wife has concealed from him her father's intentions.

757
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,940
不 乔纳斯 别在我读了这个之后这么做 
No, Jonas. Not after reading this. 

758
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:57,900
我不想他知道
I don't want him to know.

759
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,890
我告诉你 艾德蒙 我没有把它放进口袋
I tell you, Edmund. I didn't put it in my pocket.

760
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,890
但是你一定把它放在那儿了 你只是忘记了
But you must have put it there. You've forgotten.

761
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,890
这就更糟糕了
That's worse, isn't it?

762
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,890
我把它放进自己的口袋却都不知道
I put it in my own pocket and I didn't even realise I was doing it?

763
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,890
就好像手表自己走到那里的一样
It's like the watch put itself there.

764
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900
- 山姆 这对话太疯狂了 - 那手表
- Sam, lad, this is wild talk. - That thing.

765
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,890
对了 有个在海湾工作的家伙
Right, there's this fella who works in the bay

766
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,890
李 雷蒙德・李 李跳蚤
Lee, Raymond Lee. Lee the Flea.

767
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,890
我从来都不喜欢那个家伙
I never liked the bloke

768
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,890
他昨天一直对我喋喋不休
and he was rattling on me yesterday, on and on.

769
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,890
我站在我的柜台 我脑子里在想咒语
I'm standing at my counter, I'm cursing in my head.

770
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,890
今天 你猜怎么着 他生病在床上了
Now today, what do you think? He's taken sick to his bed.

771
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,070
怎么会这样? 
How does that happen? 

772
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:36,890
那是因为有时候人们会生病
It happens because sometimes people get ill.

773
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,890
不不
No, no.

774
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,890
是那手表 我知道的
It's the watch. I know it is.

775
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,890
苏西像狗皮膏药一样一直绕着我转
I've got Susy following me around like a sop.

776
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,890
我怎么也甩不掉她
I can't shake her out of it no matter what I do.

777
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,890
如果这让你那么烦恼
Well, if it's bothering you that much,

778
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,900
你为什么不叫达德利先生把你调离手表柜台呢
why don't you ask Mr Dudley to take you off the watch counter?

779
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,890
我会的
I will. I will.

780
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,900
就... 就这么办
That's... That's what I'll do.

781
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,890
太值得称赞了 对吧莫里
It is so laudable, is it not, Moray,

782
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,890
一个女孩从一个小镇来
for a girl to come from a lowly little town like...

783
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,900
- 是哪里 德妮丝 - 先生 是皮布尔斯
- Where is it, Denise? - Peebles, sir.

784
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,900
皮布尔斯 甚至连名字读起来都是一种款待
Peebles. Even the word is a treat on the tongue.

785
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,890
我和凯瑟琳都难以想象 从小城镇到大城市
Katherine and I have no idea what it means to come from such beginnings

786
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,890
并在大城市证明自己 意味着什么
and to prove oneself in the city.

787
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,890
我想这不亚于
I suppose it's no small feat

788
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,890
想在军队里证明自己 威斯顿先生
to prove oneself in the armed forces, Mr Weston.

789
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,890
是啊 很恰当的比喻
Yes. There is that.

790
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,420
但对于一个女人 
But for a woman, 

791
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,890
一个年轻的女人在男人的世界
a young woman in a man's world,

792
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,890
打拼 满怀着...
and to do it all with such...

793
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,890
那叫什么 莫里?
What shall we call it, Moray?

794
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,890
- 渴望? - 哦 不!
- Eagerness? - Oh, come!

795
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,900
这不是我所想的 我想说满怀着这样的热情
That is not what I meant at all. I mean with such effervescence.

796
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,890
我们想知道是什么消息 先生
We were wondering what the news might be, sir.

797
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,371
他庆幸过自己的幸运吗 德妮丝? 
Does he appreciate what a fortunate man he is, Denise? 

798
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:18,890
我希望他庆幸过
I hope he does.

799
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,890
他有过 而且我也很庆幸能跟约翰一起工作
Yes. And I am very fortunate to work with John.

800
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,890
他经常鼓励我
He's always encouraged me.

801
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,723
是吗 莫里? 
Do you, Moray? 

802
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:29,890
知道你身边的女人有多优秀吗?
Do you realise quite what a woman you have on your hands?

803
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
不知道我就是傻瓜了 先生
I'd be a fool not to, sir.

804
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
我是有消息
News indeed.

805
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,890
我们想送你去巴黎 德妮丝
We want to send you to Paris, Denise.

806
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,890
这是一个考察任务
On a reconnaissance mission.

807
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,890
你去探访乐蓬马歇百货
To visit Le Bon Marche

808
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,890
了解最新的法国时尚
and to fill your eyes with the latest French fashions.

809
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,900
是吗! 这真是太...
Well! That is rather...

810
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,890
我不知道该说什么
I don't quite know what to say.

811
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,890
谢谢!
Thank you!

812
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,890
一周的时间 你就尽情享受巴黎的时尚吧
Spend a week there. Immerse yourself in all things Parisienne.

813
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,890
我希望我们女装部的主管能深入了解插画时尚
We want our Head of Ladieswear to be versed in La Mode Illustree.

814
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,890
插画时尚: 法国第一本主要的时尚杂志

815
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,890
你觉得自己可以出行吗?
Do you think you are ready for such a trip?

816
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,900
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

817
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,900
德妮丝在巴黎!
Denise in Paris!

818
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,890
你知道他对我们做了什么吗? 亲爱的
'Don't you see what he is doing to us, darling?'

819
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,890
他在给你奖赏 你却欣然接受了
He's feeding you with prizes so that you feel happy here,

820
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,890
你遵照了他的想法
so that you accept the way things are.

821
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,890
去巴黎我能学到很多
I could learn so much in Paris.

822
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,890
我不是想阻止你
It's not that I want to stop you from going.

823
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,900
只是想让你意识到他干了什么
I want you to see what he's doing.

824
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,890
我会想办法拒绝他
I'll find a reason to say no.

825
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,890
跟他说我生病了 或是这次出行会让我生病
I'll tell him I'm sick or that the travelling will make me ill.

826
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,890
这都是为了我们好 德妮丝
It is for us that I am doing this, Denise,

827
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,900
为了我们能一起在天堂百货
so we can be together in The Paradise.

828
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
我明白
I know.

829
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,890
我一直想做台前的工作
I always wanted it to be me out front

830
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,938
但现在我的点心替我受到关注
but it feels better for it to be my baking 

831
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:22,890
让我更开心
what's in the limelight.

832
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
谢谢你 德妮丝
Thank you, Denise.

833
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,900
"梅尔托蛋糕"

834
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,890
达德利先生 请您批准 先生
Mr Dudley, sir, with your permission, sir,

835
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,890
我想调离怀表柜台
I would like to be taken off the watch counter.

836
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,890
但怀表是我们的畅销品之一
But the watches are our best-selling item.

837
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,752
你在创造奇迹 
You're working wonders. 

838
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:46,890
但是 如果您能批准 先生
But still, if you will, sir.

839
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,890
我会很感激
I'd appreciate the move.

840
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,890
你从没赚过那么多奖金 为什么不做呢
You've never earned so much bonus. Why would you turn your back on that?

841
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,890
卖怀表不适合我 我宁愿回去卖丝绸
Watches aren't for me. I prefer to go back to silks.

842
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,896
我会考虑看看 
I'll give it some thought. 

843
00:50:56,897 --> 00:51:01,890
您能现在就考虑吗? 您就站在这儿
Could you give it some thought now, sir, while you're standing here?

844
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,890
如果职员都随意调来调去 会影响不好
It creates a bad impression if staff are hopping about from counter to counter.

845
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,890
我希望你能继续工作
I want you to see it through with the watches.

846
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,890
- 要是我恳求您呢? 先生 - 为什么?
- If I were to plead with you sir? - But for what reason?

847
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,900
给我个合理的理由 我会考虑看看
Give me a sound reason and I will give it some consideration.

848
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
那好吧 达德利先生
Very well, Mr Dudley, sir.

849
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,900
进来
Come in.

850
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,890
我要你告诉他
I want you to tell him.

851
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,070
告诉汤姆・威斯顿 
Tell Tom Weston that 

852
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:45,890
格伦德宁勋爵打算把自己的怀表
Lord Glendenning intended his watch

853
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,900
传给凯瑟琳的丈夫 但她隐瞒了他
to be left to Katherine's husband but she's kept this from him.

854
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,890
你还在卖那些表吗?
You're still doing the watches then?

855
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,890
我请求达德利先生将我们调走 但他拒绝了
I asked Mr Dudley to move us but he refused.

856
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,890
看那表 挂在那儿像是在嘲笑我们
Look at it. Hangs there like it's mocking us.

857
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,890
山姆 你得冷静 你要失去理智了
Sam, you need to calm down. You're letting your mind run away with you.

858
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,890
那玩意儿还在那儿 你让我怎么冷静?
How can I calm down when the thing's right there?

859
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,075
它要禁锢我们 我恨它 
It wants to possess us. - I hate it. 

860
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:18,890
山姆 别说了!
Sam, stop it!

861
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,890
我有种冲动 想把它扔进河里
I'm getting such urges in my mind, hat I want to throw it in the river,

862
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,890
走上桥 放进包里 外加一颗石头
go down to the bridge, put it in a bag with a stone

863
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,890
然后扔进水里 摆脱它
and toss it into the water, be rid of it.

864
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,890
然后我可能会恢复平静
Then I might be at peace again.

865
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,890
山姆 一旦你这么做 你将在监狱度过余生
Sam, if you do that you'll end up in prison.

866
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,890
这是块贵重的表 凯瑟琳・威斯顿的表
This is a valuable watch. It's Katherine Weston's watch.

867
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,900
我也不想那么做 但我没法不去想
I don't want to do it. But I can't stop thinking it.

868
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,900
好吧 也许它很快会物归原主 嗯?
Well, perhaps it'll go back where it came from soon, eh?

869
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
要跟我喝一杯吗 乔纳斯?
Will you join me in a drink, Jonas?

870
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,890
我... 我得工作了 先生
I... I should be getting on with my duties, sir.

871
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,900
我是你老板 你现在的工作就是和我喝一杯
I'm your employer. Your duty at this moment is to enjoy a drink with me.

872
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,890
你怎么回事?
What's the matter with you?

873
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,890
难道你发现莫里在玩什么鬼把戏了?
Did you find out what Moray is up to?

874
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,900
我没有关于莫里财政的情报 先生
I have no intelligence on Mr Moray's finances, sir.

875
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
谨慎说话 乔纳斯
You chose your words too carefully, Jonas.

876
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,890
你在隐瞒我什么?
What are you concealing from me?

877
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,900
你有事 我能看出来
You have something on your mind. I can see it.

878
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,890
这我不能说 先生
It is not for me to tell a man such things, sir.

879
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,890
什么事?
What things?

880
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,900
这很危险 当一个男人意识到... 
It is dangerous when a husband learns...

881
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,900
我妻子?
My wife?

882
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,890
到底是什么 告诉我你所知道的
What is it? I insist you tell me what you know.

883
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,900
- 先生 请别问 - 告诉我
- Please, sir! - Tell me.

884
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,890
那块怀表 先生
The watch, sir.

885
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,893
我看见您的妻子跟莫里在交谈 
I saw your wife talking to Mr Moray. 

886
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:51,890
怀表怎么了?
What about the watch?

887
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,900
她父亲遗留给她那块表是要传给她的丈夫
Her father bequeathed that the piece was to be passed on to the man she married.

888
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,900
您明白了吧 先生 为什么我不能说
Now you see, sir, why this is impossible for me to tell.

889
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,900
说下去
Carry on.

890
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,890
她决定不告诉你她父亲的遗愿
She has decided not to tell you of her father's wishes.

891
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,890
你听见她跟莫里说这个?
You heard her telling Moray this?

892
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,900
她要求他保密 就他们两人知道
She asked him to keep it a secret, between them.

893
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,900
我明白了
I see.

894
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,030
威斯顿先生 我恐怕不能接受您的好意 
Mr Weston, I'm afraid I can't accept your kind of offer 

895
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:26,900
去巴黎的事
of a trip to Paris.

896
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,890
我发誓 先生 锁柜台的时候还在的
I promise you, gentlemen. When I closed up my counter it was there.

897
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,890
- 但现在不在了 山姆 - 不是 先生
- But it is not there now, Sam. - No, sir.

898
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,890
我检查过口袋也不在
I've checked my pockets and it's not there.

899
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,890
为什么你会想到检查口袋?
Why would you want to check your pockets?

900
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,890
我 我是说 没错... 很奇怪的 先生
What, what I mean is, right the... The thing is strange, sir.

901
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,890
有天晚上 我知道这难以置信
One night - and I know this is going to be difficult to believe -

902
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,185
我把表收好后 回到房间 
I put it away and I went to my room 

903
00:54:52,186 --> 00:54:53,900
结果表在我的...
and it was, it was in my...

904
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,890
先生 我从没想过拥有那块表
Gentlemen, I have no wish to want that watch.

905
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,890
那该死的表真的着魔了
That damned watch is bewitched.

906
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,900
威斯顿先生拿走了那块表 我看见他拿走了 
Mr Weston took the watch. I saw him take it.

907
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,890
所以它走了
Then it's gone.

908
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,900
我又恢复自由了!
I'm a free man again!

909
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,815
我该怎样阻止她老跟着我 
How do I stop her following me all the time 

910
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:19,890
注视我犹如我是爱神丘比特?
and looking at me like I'm the God of Love?

911
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,890
还有一见到我就说 "你好 山姆 "?
And saying, "Hello, Sam," every time I see her?

912
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,525
你再给她催眠一次 
You'll have to hypnotise her again. 

913
00:55:24,526 --> 00:55:26,890
我一开始就没给她催眠过
I didn't hypnotise her in the first place.

914
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,890
而且表也还回去了
And the watch is gone now.

915
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,300
就算你告诉苏西你会用鸡毛掸子给她催眠 
Susy would believe it if you told her you'd hypnotised her 

916
00:55:31,301 --> 00:55:31,900
她也会相信
with a feather duster.

917
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,900
让我来吧
Leave it to me.

918
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,714
在你睁开眼睛后 
When you wake up 

919
00:55:53,715 --> 00:55:56,890
你会觉得山姆只是个普通的小伙子
you will think that Sam is just a lad,

920
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,890
跟其他人一样 常常聊天
like all the other lads, plenty of chat,

921
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,900
但你绝对不会嫁给他
but you could never marry him.

922
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,890
我有种奇怪的感觉
I had the strangest feeling.

923
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,890
我...
I...

924
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,890
感觉自己爱上了山姆
I thought I was in love with Sam.

925
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,890
是不是很愚蠢?
Isn't that silly?

926
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,900
要我们转告他你没有吗?
Do we have to tell him that you're not?

927
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,890
我的表又慢了 山姆
It's gone lazy on me again, Sam.

928
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,890
我建议 先生...
May I suggest, sir...

929
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
- 修理一下 - 你好 山姆
- Get it fixed. - Hello, Sam.

930
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,890
美食厅取得了巨大的成功
The Food Hall has been a great success.

931
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,890
从来没想过我可能会关心
I had not imagined I might be so engaged by

932
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,890
蛋糕和果子面包怎么能卖得好
by how cakes and buns might sell.

933
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,890
你想今天去参观美食厅吗 芙罗拉?
Would you care to visit the Food Hall today, Flora?

934
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,828
好啊 爸爸 
Yes, Papa. 

935
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,693
想哪时候去? 
What time shall we go? 

936
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:57,890
今天上午晚点可以吗?
Perhaps later this morning?

937
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,900
好啊
Yes.

938
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,900
巴黎
时尚之都

939
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,900
我发现她坐在我的椅子上 似乎想掌权
I found her sitting in my chair as though she were trying out the throne.

940
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,890
'我再也忍受不了!'
'I cannot bear one more day!'

941
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,395
汤姆会毁了你 
Tom will destroy you. 

942
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:56,890
德妮丝也会毁了你
Denise will destroy you.

943
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,938
你认为我们应该对抗莫里? 
You think we should defy Moray? 

944
00:57:58,939 --> 00:57:59,890
应该说是帮助
Let's call it helping.

945
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,890
不让他知道的帮助
Without his knowledge or consent.

946
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,900
我认为秘密行动不是最好的方式 德妮丝
'I'm not sure that acting secretly is the best way, Denise.'
