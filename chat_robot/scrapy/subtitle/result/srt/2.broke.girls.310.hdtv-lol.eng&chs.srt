1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,430
Max 我终于安排好了新计划表
Okay, Max, I figured out our new schedule.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,930
我也终于弄明白了
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,160
咱们用的廉价牙膏原来是护臀霜
we've been using is really diaper cream.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,960
不过它的防皮疹成分清洁了我牙缝里的口香糖
On the plus side, that rash cleared up on my gums.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,100
我们从6点到凌晨2点在餐厅上班
We'll do our diner shift from 6:00 till 2:00,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
凌晨2点到4点在这里卖小蛋糕
then sell cupcakes here from 2:00 to 4:00,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,130
然后7点到11点做蛋糕
make the cupcakes in the morning from 7:00 to 11:00,

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,960
接着12点到4点去上糕点制作课程
and then pastry school from 12:00 to 4:00.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,460
- 没漏掉什么吧?  - 你漏掉了我们得拉屎和睡觉
- Forget anything?  - Just poopin' and sleepin'.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,260
好吧 那我去重新制订计划
Now, I have to go rewrite the schedule.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,100
来吧 Max 明天是一个大日子
Let's go, Max, you have a huge, huge day tomorrow.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,630
糕点培训班要开学了
First day of pastry school.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,360
千万别跟我说大日子
Stop saying it's huge.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,630
每次我觉得什么东西"大"
Whenever I think something's gonna be huge

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,900
到头来发现都是蛋蛋
it just turns out to be all balls.

16

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,330
我奢侈了一回 把衬衫干洗了
I splurged and had my blouse cleaned.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,030
干洗店的塑料袋子让我想起了以前有钱的日子
Dry cleaning bags remind me of when I had money.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,500
是吗? 它们只让我想起来
Really? They remind me

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,530
我妈试图憋死我
of when my mother tried to suffocate me.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,800
这是她自己说的 走吧
Allegedly. Let's go.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,260
等一下 Max 先别走
Wait, wait. Max, you can't go yet.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,230
你得留下来帮我个忙
I need you to stay and help with something.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,030
Han 我说过了... 弯腰使劲摩擦
Han, I told you... it's bend and wipe,

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,760
它就会在你的童装裤里挺起来
then up come your big boy pants.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,900
Han说得没错 你先别走
Yeah, Han's right. You can't go.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,460
稍等一会
Stay here a few more minutes.

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,130
为什么? 哦
Why? Oh.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,730
难道是要给Max做入学前辅导?
Are we having an intervention for Max?

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,630
嘿 小伙伴们
Hey, everybody.

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,360
希望我没错过
Oh, I hope I'm not late r Max's

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,730
Max的开学惊喜派对
first day of school surprise party.

34
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,000
Sophie 我们还没给她惊喜呢
Sophie, we hadn't surprised her yet.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,930
但她都站在这里了
Oh, but she's right there.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,430
被6你搞砸了 Han
You just blew it, Han.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,630
噢 惊喜派对
Aw, a surprise party.

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,860
- 多贴心啊 是吧 Max?  - 我才不信这一套
- Isn't this sweet, Max?  - I don't trust it.

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,630
上次Oleg对我大叫"惊喜"的时候
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,

40
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,700
热狗面包里夹着他的鸡鸡
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

41
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,060
肉食者至爱 披萨驾到
One meat lover's pizza.

42
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,700
肉食者也驾到了
And one meat lover.

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,630
Max 来吧 趁热吃
Max, come on. Get it while it's hot.

44
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,030
你来打开盒子
You're opening that box.

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,630
哦 谁有10美元
Hm, who's got a ten

46
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,530
给送披萨的帅哥当小费?
to tip the cute pizza delivery guy?

47
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,930
Sophie 他是Luis 日班服务员
Sophie, this is Luis, the day waiter.

48
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,900
哦 你就是Sophie啊
Oh, you're Sophie,

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,830
Oleg的前女友
Oleg's ex.

50
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,360
姐们儿 久闻你大名啊
Sister, I know all about you.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,860
哦 是吗?
Oh, do you?

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,900
你知道我的一切吗?
Do you know all about me?

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,630
我可是他的好朋友
I'm his good friend.

54
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,930
我有点听不清你的口音
You know, I'm having trouble hearing your accent.

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,030
你说的是"好朋友" 还是"女朋友"?
Did you say "good friend" or "girlfriend?"

56
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,430
拜托 妈妈 我倒是想
Please, mami. I wish.

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,200
我喜欢这段表演
I like the entertainment.

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,630
甚至比我朋友Stephanie
It's better than the magician

59
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,100
在她的16岁生日派对上
at my friend Stephanie's 16th birthday

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,830
破了处更有意思
that made her virginity disappear.

61
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,730
Max 我们为你骄傲
Max, we're all so proud of you.

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,160
明天是你余下生命里崭新的一天
Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,560
不妙 又来这一套?
Aw, crap. I gotta do this again?

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,730
好吧 但这次我可不要看
All right, but this time, I'm not seeing

65
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,500
"曲线难题"这种励志片
trouble with the curve.

66
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,700
你会成就一番大事的
You are about to do something very big.

67
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
没错 人生的一大步
Yes, she is. Such a big step.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
对我们俩来说都是
Big step for both of us,

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,130
因为我也要用我惊人的商业头脑
'cause I'll be using my business acumen

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,130
去办公室打工赚学费
working in the office to help pay the tuition.

71
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,230
嘘 Max才是主角
Shh. I'm talking about Max.

72
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,100
所以大家集资为你
So we all chipped in to get you something

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,200
开学的第一天买了份礼物
for your first day of school.

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,500
明天也是我的第一天啊
It's my first day too.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,030
Caroline 小点声 我都听不到Han
Caroline, please, I can't hear Han

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,200
怎么夸Max了 好吗?
talking about Max, okay?

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,130
亲爱的 送给你
Here you go, darling,

78
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,360
一个新书包
a book bag for school.

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,100
那么 等这结束之后
So what, then? Is my surprise party

80
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,430
是我的惊喜派对吗?
after this one?

81
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,430
怎么回事?
What is happening?

82
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,130
大家和蔼可亲 而且笑容可掬?
People doing nice things for me and smiling?

83
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,130
难道要把我送给另一个家庭收养?
Am I transferring foster homes again?

84
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,730
里面还有东西
And there's more stuff inside.

85
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,660
这也应该是个惊喜
That was supposed to be a surprise too.

86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,630
哦 惊喜哟!
Oh. Surprise!

87
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,400
Max 打开看看
Max, open it. Look inside.

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,930
对啊 Max 快打开看看里面的开学礼物
Yeah, Max, see what's inside for your big day.

89
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,260
Max要开学了 我也要开学了
Big day for Max. Big day for me as well.

90
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,900
地铁卡? 不是吧
A metrocard? No way.

91
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,260
我送的 任坐哦
From me. Unlimited rides.

92
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,430
哟 任骑吗?
Oh. Unlimited rides?

93
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,300
你的相好是这么说的?
Is that what your tramp stamp says?

94
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,860
我应该生气 不过这段子挺逗
I was gonna get mad, but that was a damn good one.

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,900
这是啥? Han的小屋?
What's this? Han's house?

96
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,160
说声"谢谢"就行了
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,500
谢谢你的小屋 Han
Thank you for your house, Han.

98
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,460
是个铅笔盒 我好喜欢
It's a pencil case, and I love it.

99
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,960
本来我坐在这里 以为你们
And I was sitting here, thinking how you were

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,660
忘了明天也是我的大日子
all ignoring my part of the big day.

101
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,530
但是你们送给我一个铅笔盒
And then, you give me this pencil case

102
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,600
证明是我想错了
to use in the office and prove me wrong.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
那是给Max的
That's for Max.

104
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,700
你们是不是搞错了?
What the hell is wrong with you people?

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,200
Max用不着铅笔盒的
Max doesn't even need pencils.

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,260
她是去做烘焙的
She'll be baking.

107
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,960
同时她也会被烘
Well, she'll be baked.

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,860
快看看
Take a look.

109
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,160
大麻卷
Joints.

110
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,660
Earl 你真好
Earl, that's so sweet.

111
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,160
这些能让我坚持到课间休息
These should last me till recess.

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
等等 Sophie的印花厨师服在哪?
Wait, where's the chef's coat Sophie had monogrammed?

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,900
Han 这本来是一个惊喜的
Han, that was supposed to be a surprise.

114
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,360
我知道 我是在报复你呢
Oh, I know. Karma's a bitch.

115
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,900
好吧
Oh, well.

116
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
给你
Look.

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,330
上面有我的名字
My name's on this.

118
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,630
以前唯一写着我名字的
The only thing my name's

119
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,830
就是尿液样本了
ever been on before is a urine sample.

120
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,400
谢谢大家
Thank you, everyone.

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
那个包里没有一样是给我的?
So there is nothing in that bag for me?

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,260
一样都没有? 哇
Nothing? Wow.

123
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,060
我连夹着Oleg鸡鸡的热狗面包都没有
I'd even take Oleg's penis in a hot dog bun right now.

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,100
我立马呈上
I'll be right back.

125
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,860
- 我要上去  - 请让让
- Getting on.  - Please move.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,030
- 我要上去  - 请让让
- Getting on.  - Please move.

127
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,430
- 我要上去!  - 请让让!

128
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
- 上去!  - 让开!
- On!  - Move!

129
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,160
- 上去! 上去!  - 让开! 让开!
- On! On!  - Move! Move!

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,260
我爱地铁
I love the subway.

131
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,760
这里是个发泄的好地方
It's the perfect place to get out aggression.

132
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,260
我刚往别人的肾揍了一拳
I just punched someone in the kidney.

133
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,630
就是我
It was me.

134
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,030
我知道
I know.

135
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,230
噢 臭死了
Oh, oh, bad smell,

136
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,130
像是有人和油炸鹰嘴豆饼鬼混了一晚
Like someone hooked up with a falafel.

137
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,030
- 就是我  - 我知道
- It was me.  - I know.

138
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,560
- Max  - 抱歉
- Max.  - Sorry.

139
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,030
地铁 飞机 狂舞区 我的最爱
Subways, planes, and mosh pits, I let it ride.

140
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,300
我爱死了衬衫上
I love the smell

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,860
这股清新的干洗味
of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

142
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,430
真是太兴奋了
I am so excited

143
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,760
不必穿那件服务员的制服
to be out of that waitress uniform,

144
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,630
重新穿回我这精致的商务服装
and back in my chic business clothes,

145
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,460
还有 去到自己的办公室
And, you know, going to my office,

146
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,800
利用自己的沃顿商学院智慧
where I'll probably save the day

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,730
有可能会拯救烂摊子
using some of my Wharton magic.

148
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,360
我更喜欢绝望的你
You know, I think I like you better without hope.

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,660
Max 你知道这学费很贵的 对吧?
Max, you know this school is expensive, right?

150
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,160
所以你要端正态度 好吗?
You're going in with a good attitude, right?

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
不要 Earl送的铅笔就是这用途
No, that's what Earl's pencils are for.

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
别担心 我会努力的
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,060
瞧 我还有个书包呢
I mean, look, I have a book bag.

154
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,760
我妈唯一让我带到学校去的
The only thing my mother ever sent me to school with

155
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,260
是一张便条 写着"帮我检查虱子"
was a note that said "check me for lice."

156
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
大家都送你礼物 真的很贴心
It was so sweet of everyone to give you that,

157
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,300
即使这害得我一晚都睡不着
even though I didn't sleep all night about it.

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,730
而且这东西看着不便宜
And it looks kind of expensive.

159
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,130
看看设计师的标签
Check for a designer label.

160
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,430
为啥? 值钱的是这份心意啊
Why? It's the thought that counts.

161
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,800
啥时心意值钱了?
Since when?

162
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,060
让我瞧瞧
Let me see it.

163
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,230
已经抵达第二大街站
Second avenue station.

164
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,300
这里是第二大街站
This is second avenue.

165
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,560
不 不要 Max!
No, no, no, Max!

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,530
天啊 他抢了书包 很好 Max
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

167
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,030
不要放手
Don't let go.

168
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,130
那要是列车开动了
What if the train starts to leave

169
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,360
然后我的手臂被扯断了呢?
and my arms pop off?

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,200
那我还怎么去上糕点学校啊?
How will I go to pastry school?

171
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,660
我就会像那种人 用嘴叼着
I'll be one of those people decorating cookies

172
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,330
奶油袋 去装饰曲奇饼
with a bag in their mouth.

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,760
你是恶魔
You are the devil.

174
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,860
恶魔
The devil.

175
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,660
你一无所有
You have nothing.

176
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,600
Max 使劲拉! 从恶魔那里拉出来!
Pull, max, pull! Pull it from the devil!

177
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,430
拉不动 恶魔力气大
Can't. The devil works out.

178
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,430
噢!
Ooh!

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
我的包
My bag.

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,700
我的衬衫
My blouse.

181
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,900
我的大麻
My weed.

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,460
很好 瞧 都开始上课了
Oh, great, look. Class has started.

183
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,460
我的新生活已经被毁了
My new life already blows.

184
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,960
看啊 帅哥厨师长在那里
Oh, look. There's chef gorgeous.

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
我不想让他看到我的狼狈样
I don't want him to see me like this.

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,700
我去洗手间看看
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see

187
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,730
能否用冷水把污渍洗掉
If cold water can get out any of the stain.

188
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,900
- 上课吧 Max  - 可是我没有厨师服和书包
- Go, Max.  - But I don't have my chef coat or book bag.

189
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
我只知道自己只拥有了几个小时
I know I only had them for a couple of hours,

190
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,830
但这可是我最棒的东西啊
But it was the best part of me.

191
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,500
你没问题的
You'll do great.

192
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,930
首先 帮我个忙 帮我检查一下虱子
First, do me a favor. Check me for lice.

193
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,230

Max厨师 你迟到了

199
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,730
等等 不是10点17分才开始上课吗?
Wait, are sure class doesn't start at 10:17?

200

抱歉 我在地铁里
Sorry, I got robbed on the subway

201
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,430
{\an8}(Jerk除了有混蛋的意思 还是人名)

202
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,430
被一个混蛋抢劫了

203
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,360
嘿 这是在叫我吗
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here.

204
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,100
我没得选了 我可不想因为这名字
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna

205
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,460
而被剥夺了上糕点学校的权力
strip my way through pastry school.

206
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,830
这还有得选啊?
That's an option?

207
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,760
{\an8}(因主厨是法国人 口音比较重 发音不标准)

208
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,760
好了 厨师们 注意力集中
All right, chefs. Let's focus.

209
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,530
他刚才是说他想"中我们"吗?
Did he say he wants to "foke us"?

210
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,530
(污渍更脏了)

211
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,530
Bebe 早上好
Morning, Bebe.

212
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,760
嗨 天啊
Hi. Oh, my god.

213
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,100
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

214
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,800
我该告诉你 我的医生说
And I should tell you my doctor says

215
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,130
我不能从别人口中听到坏消息
I'm not allowed to hear bad news for another month.

216
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,830
抱歉我如此狼狈
I apologize for my appearance.

217
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,260
我们在地铁上被人抢劫了
We got robbed on the subway,

218
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,100
然后又被别人的咖啡撞到了
And then someone hit me with hot coffee.

219
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,760
然后 我去用冷水冲洗这滩污渍
Then, I went to wash cold water on the stain

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,230
可是没想到把自己的衬衫
And somehow wound up entering myself

221
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,100
弄得这么湿
in a wet t-shirt contest.

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,830
我需要很大的勇气来消化这事
Um, that's a lot of energy for me,

223
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,000
所以我打算在这里
So I'm just gonna need to sit here

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,200
静坐一会儿
for a second and be quiet.

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
我知道我们要安静 我也会这么做的
I know we're being quiet, which I'm all about,

226
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,260
不过这些狗狗很可爱
But cute dogs.

227
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,560
谢谢 这是可卡犬
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.

228
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,900
是我救了它们
I rescue them.

229
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,430
人们会拯救灰犬
You know, people rescue greyhounds

230
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,900
比特犬 但是大家都把
And pit bulls, but everyone ignores

231
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,430
可卡犬给忽略了
The cocker spaniel.

232
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,830
他们通常会这样想 "太恶心了
They're like, "ew, eye goo.

233
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,660
射杀掉"
Shoot it."

234
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,600
我有三只比特犬
I have three cockers.

235
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,430
你有宠物吗?
Do you have any pets?

236
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,860
我有一只马 叫小栗子
I have a horse, Chestnut.

237
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,600
它是一匹纯种马
He's a thoroughbred.

238
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,800
好了 首先我能做什么呢?
Well, what can I do first?

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
这是什么?
What's this?

240
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,760
我拿着的是果汁单吗?
Why am I holding a juice menu?

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,030
我们每一天都会给学生和员工
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice

242
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,360
提供鲜榨的果汁
For the students and the staff.

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,500
真是太好了
What a treat.

244
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,930
鲜榨果汁绝对是坑钱的
Fresh juice is such a scam

245
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,430
除非是别人买单
Unless someone else is payin'.

246
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,860
我就要三号绿色果汁吧
I'll take the greens number three.

247
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,060
你可以把这写在单子上
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list

248
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,030
顺道把其他果汁一起拿了
When you get the other ones.

249
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,130
什么 你要我去端果汁?
Wait, I'm supposed to get the juice?

250
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,360
天啊 我简直就是坏消息制造器
Oh, boy, it's like I'm a bad news machine.

251
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,400
好的
Oh. Okay.

252
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,830
我很乐意去做 虽然我很意外 不过乐意
Happy to do it. Surprised, but happy.

253
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,860
我能否换上一件
Uh, maybe I could change

254
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,560
这种可爱的厨师服呢
Into one of those cute chef jackets.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,400
Nicholas厨师长只允许糕点厨师
Oh, Chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs

256
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,930
穿这个服装
To wear these.

257
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,230
但是我不能在头一天上班就让别人
But I can't meet everyone on my first day

258
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,660
看到我这幅模样
Looking like this.

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,760
本来就够惨的了
I mean, it's already bad enough

260
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,830
要我去端果汁
I'm the juice girl.

261
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,760
你可以穿我的运动衣
I have some workout clothes you can wear.

262
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,660
别担心 衣服我还没穿过的
Don't worry. I haven't worn them yet.

263
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,730
但我以后还会穿
But I will someday.

264
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,760
嗨 嗨 大家好
Hi. Hi, everyone.

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,260
有谁要鲜榨果汁
I'm here to take the fresh juice orders

266
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,560
还有 我原本不是穿这衣服来上班的
And also to say this is not what I came to work in.

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
我一开始穿的衣服没这么多眼睛
What I came to work in had less eyes.

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Caroline 欢迎你
Caroline, welcome.

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,700
在办公室工作得顺利吗?
How is it going in the office so far?

270
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,760
很好 而且我绝不是穿这件衣服来上班的
So great, and so not what I came to work in.

271
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,630
我一般穿香奈儿 不是狗狗衣
I'm usually wearing chanel, not le chien.

272
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,500
法语中"狗"的意思
That's "dog" in french.

273
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,000
哦 这在英文里是"鸡巴"的意思
Oh, 'cause it's "dork" in english.

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,930
嗯 很开心看到你们俩
Well, it is lovely to see both of your faces.

275
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,230
上课 我们从基础的开始
Class, we start with the basics.

276
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,400
不 不 不 你从后面...
No, no, no, you in the back...

277
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,060
要果汁吗 小姐? 你要从一个
Juice, Miss? Care for a juice

278
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,630
SAT考到1560的人那里点杯果汁吗?
From someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

279
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,760
你竟然超过了500分?
You can score more than 500?

280
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,600
你到底为啥要穿那个?
Why the hell are you wearing that?

281
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,360
没想到你的胸还可以变得更加悲剧啊
I didn't think your chest could get any sadder.

282
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,260
这是Bebe的
It's Bebe's.

283
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,530
Max 点果汁
Max, taking juice orders

284
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,930
不是我来这里的工作
Is not what I came here to do.

285
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,100
我知道 我要宝石红果汁
I hear you. I'll have the ruby red.

286
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,430
我总是保持边缘部分干净
I always keep the edge clean,

287
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,660
所以当我挤压的时候
So when I'm squeezing it,

288
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,730
不会把奶油
It's not gonna have cream

289
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,060
喷得到处都是
Popping all over the place.

290
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,060
人生箴言
Words to live by.

291
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,900
我就是一塌糊涂
I have the opposite problem.

292
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,760
唷 我的奶油现在正要喷了
Yo, my cream's poppin' right now.

293
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,100
你在干嘛? 你说过
What are you doing? You told me

294
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
你会认真上课的
You were gonna take school seriously.

295
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,760
不是我的错 是这家伙带坏我
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.

296
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,060
看看他
Look at him.

297
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,560
他就像是在欢乐的芝麻街
He looks like someone who sells drugs

298
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,460
卖大麻的
On sesame street.

299
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,630
你会惹麻烦的
You're gonna get in trouble,

300
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,130
而且我才不会穿这个可卡犬的衣服
And I am not wearing a cocker spaniel

301
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,560
你会被撵出课堂的
So you can get kicked out of class.

302
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,730
好吧 听到你说的了
Right. I hear you.

303
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,260
现在 我的果汁在哪儿?
Now, where's my juice?

304
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,930
嘿 Max大厨 看我的本事
Hey, chef Max. Check out my technique.

305
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
还附带了恶心声音做奖励
Awesome gross sound bonus.

306
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,230
大厨 如果你觉得很有趣
Chef, if you find this so funny,

307
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,430
{\an8}(他原意是说抽个烟休息 但是发错音了)

308
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,430
要不你去拿个钱?
why don't you take a fiver?

309
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,200
你们是这样说的吧?
Isn't this how your saying goes?

310
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
我可没这么说
I don't have a saying,

311
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,260
如果我说了 更可能会是
But if I did, it'd be more like

312
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,100
"吃喝不算骗"
"eatin' ain't cheatin'."

313
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,930
还有谁发现搞笑的事
Anyone else who finds something hilarious

314
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,700
可以一起去走廊呆着

315
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
- Max大厨?  - 不 没啥滑稽的事
- Chef Max? Nope,  - nothing 'ilarious.

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
继续上课
Teach on.

317
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,000
黄段子讲够了
Enough with the dirty jokes.

318
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,030
{\an8}(master baker有"烘焙师"和"自慰的面包师"之意)

319
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,030
我们来这儿是要成为"自撸大师"
We are all here to become master bakers.

320
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,560
我在很努力地让自己成为"自撸大师"
Master-baking is something I work really hard at it.

321
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,100
- 成为一个自撸大师  - 我还是去走廊吧
- To be a master baker...  - I'll be in the hall.

322
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
- 嗨 我是Deke  - 你是说"怪人"?
- Hi, I'm Deke.  - Did you say "freak?"

323
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,530
- Deke  - 你是说"怪咖"?
- Deke.  - Did you say "geek?"

324
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,060
Deke 就像"大鸡巴"
Deke, as in "big deke."

325
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,200
姐的更大
Mine's bigger.

326
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,660
咱俩应该做黄金拍档
We should be lab partners.

327
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,500
来吧 会很拉风的

328
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,600
Max和Deke 一起做蛋糕

331
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
好的 打住 打住 打住
Okay, now stop, stop, stop.

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
姐要当个好学生
I am trying to be a good student,

333
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,030
所以你离我远点
So you just stay away from me.

334
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,930
你是个坏榜样
You are a bad influence.

335
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,530
我讲话一针见血 因为在学校时
And I know I nailed that speech 'cause kids at school

336
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,200
那些小孩总是这么说我的
Used to say it to me all the time.

337
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,100
到点该换卫生巾了吧?
Time to change your tampon?

338
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,330

Killer fanny pack. Where's your tribal poncho?

341
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,160
嗯 我把针放在这儿
Ah, keep my needles in this.

342
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
你也是瘾君子?
You're a drug addict too?

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
天啊 你太吸引人了
God. You are irresistible.

344
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,030
这是... 胰岛素 我有糖尿病

345
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,600
有糖尿病的糕点师
A diabetic pastry chef.

346
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,100
哇 你比姐还心急找死呢
Wow, you're even more self-destructive than me.

347
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,760
所以糖尿病 是怎么样的?
So diabetes, how is that?

348
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,260
令人绝望 我宁愿要梅毒
Disappointing. I put in for syphilis.

349
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,030
别笑了 我穿着这玩意儿拿着27杯橙汁
Stop laughing. I have to carry 27 juices

350
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,430
走了两条街
2 blocks wearing this.

351
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,630
为啥你要让那个狗娘这么和你说话?
Why'd you let the dog lady talk to you like that?

352
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,160
她是我朋友 即使穿着那种衣服
She's my friend, even in that shirt.

353
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,400
嗯 又花了12刀
Well, there goes another $12.

354
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
我在这衣服上花的钱比我在
I have spent more money dry cleaning this blouse

355
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,660
医疗保健上花的更多
Than I have on health care.

356
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,800
医疗保健? 你是说我们在99分店买的
Health care? You mean that box of band-aids

357
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,100
创可贴盒?
We got at the 99 cent store?

358
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,160
明天我得打扮好点
I just have to look good tomorrow.

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,830
今天真是惨不忍睹
Today was mortifying.

360
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,130
卖果汁地方的人叫我"倒霉犬"
They called me "sad dog" at the juice place.

361
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,400
"倒霉犬 你的果汁好了"
"Sad dog, your juices are ready."

362
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,060
倒霉犬 上菜
Sad dog, pick up.

363
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,460
你能把这些端到10号桌吗? 我在这儿支援你
Can you take these to table ten? I'm backed up on the booths.

364

你能吗? 我只在这里坐了一分钟
Can you? I'm kind of just sitting here a minute,

365
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,800
享受着不必被人指手划脚
Enjoying not being told what to do.

366
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,200
我在学校受够了
I get enough of it at that school.

367
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
看
Look.

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,330
如果你想要做出丰功伟绩 就好好做
If you're gonna do the martyr thing, do it right.

369
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,700
把你的手放进滚烫的油里
Stick your hand in boiling oil

370
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,460
要么更痛苦的事 放任自己收看
or even more painful, binge-watch

371
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,930
Bravo台的炫富真人秀"国王的日落"

咱们去厨房 我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you in the kitchen now.

373
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,100
赶紧走 有人要因学校的事而挨训了
Leave, someone's about to get schooled about school.

374
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,160
听起来下流又肮脏
This looks like it's going to get dirty and ugly.

375
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,830
我能拍下来吗?
May I film it?

376
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,860
如果可以的话 我可以放到网上卖吗?
And if so, may I then sell it on the internet?

377
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,700
听着 你不用这样为我的
Look. You can't just do this for me.

378
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,530
没错 所以我们退出?
You're right. So we're out?

379
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,230
不 我们不能退出 你说过你会为了我而去做
No, we're not out, you said you were gonna do this for me.

380
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,730
我知道 但你刚刚说了
I know, but you just said

381
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,960
我不用这样为你
I can't just do it for you,

382
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,230
而我同意
And I agree.

383
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
我这是在逗谁啊?
I mean, who was I kidding?

384
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,000
我 你在逗我
Me. You were kidding me.

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,130
我去那里工作 想着利用我的
I went in there thinking I was gonna use

386
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,560
生意必杀技 还揣着希望
My business skills, and whatever hope

387
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,330
要和那位法国帅哥调情

388
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,460
结果他一看到窗外
Went out the window when he saw me

389
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,960
就发现我穿着那件T裇 暗示着
Wearing that t-shirt that said,

390
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,400
"别忘了帮我阉割手术"
"don't forget to spay and neuter me."

391
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,830
好吧 我退出 没问题
Fine, I can quit. It's fine.

392
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,200
- 是吗? 真的吗?  - 不 不好
- It is? Really?  - No, it's not fine.

393
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,730
- 我在逗谁呢?  - 我 你在逗我
- Who am I kidding?  - Me. You were kidding me.

394
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,160
好吧 你得想办法
Well, you've gotta figure out something there

395
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,200
保持兴趣 你不能只为了我
To keep you interested, because you can't go

396
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
才去糕点学校
To pastry school just for me,

397
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,760
而我也不会因为你 而不去学校

Yeah, cause we're not buying another chef's jacket.

410
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,200
Max 你懂这是意味着什么吗
Max, you know what this means?

411
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,960
是我得了两个惊喜 而你一无所获?
That I got two surprises, and you got nothing?

412
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,130
不 这说明学校的事情都能解决
No, that everything's gonna work out at that school.

413
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,460
我是说 一眨眼的功夫
I mean, in the blink of an eye,

414
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,930
就像这样 万事都能
just like this, things can change

415
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,460
否极泰来
from bad to good.

416
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,360
当然也没那么好 他们还是
Well, not totally good. They still haven't

417
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
没给我什么东西
gotten me anything.

418
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,600
Caroline 你不是什么都没有
Caroline, you didn't not get anything.

419
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,530
瞧 你的独家铅笔盒
Here, your very own pencil case.

420
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,630
不过这次没笔了 那老板被抓了
But no pencils. My pencil dealer got busted.

421
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,160
啊 谢谢大家
Aw. Thank you, guys.

422
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
我好感动 我真没想到
I'm touched. I was not expecting it.

423
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,960
是吗? 因为我们可是被你逼着送礼物的
Really?  Cause you kinda bullied us all into it.

424
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,260
我口语得了780分
So that's a 780 on verbal,

425
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,460
数学780分
and a 780 on math.

426
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,300
还有我的金融课也一样
And with my degree in Finance,

427
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,300
现在却要我挤在城里去买果汁
jackass-ing around the city getting juice

428
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,060
真是浪费我的才华
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

429
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,760
当时我在毕业典礼上说过...
And as the valedictorian at my graduation said...

430
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,160
抛开现在的我
And I'm stealing from myself here,

431
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,200
"我预见了金融的未来
"I've seen the future of Finance,

432
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,430
我们就是未来 "
and it's us."

433
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,930
所以你要我去端果汁吗?
So you want me to get the juices?

434
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,400
就今天 拜托?
Just for today. Please?

435
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,730
制作蛋白酥皮饼是一种简单的
Meringue cookies are a simple way

436
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,960
训练我们的糕点技术的方法
to practice our pastry bag technique.

437
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,830
主厨 你掌握了一种有趣的技术
Hm, interesting technique you got going there, chef.

438
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,360
哥们 我们把抛弃自己无聊的搭档
Dude, we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners.

439
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,860
我被困着要和一大妈同组
I'm stuck over there with grandma.

440
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,260
不要 我现在跟旁边这大家伙一组
No, I'm staying with the big guy next to me.

441
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,330
他不会给我惹麻烦
He's not gonna get me in trouble.

442
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,000
他从不说话 你快走开
He never talks. Get outta here.

443
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
{\an8}"胖子阿伯特"主角是一名肥胖的黑人

444
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
回你的位置上 胖子阿伯特
Go back to your own table, fat Albert.

445
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
好
Okay.

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,660
我回去
I'm going back.

447
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,300
你叫我胖子阿伯特 是因为我是黑人
And the fat Albert thing was cause I'm black,

448
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,060
而不是指我胖 对吧?
Not fat, right?

449
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,800
因为我一年会去健身两三次
Cause I go to the gym two, three times a year.

450
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,130
我只听见你俩讲话 而不是烘焙
I hear talking, but no baking up front.

451
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,300
不 不 你只听见烘焙声
No, no, no, you only hear baking.

452
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,760
我们只是在疯狂的学习烘焙
Just furiously master-baking up here.

453
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,860
蛋白酥皮需要做出漂亮的峰
The meringue needs to have nice peaks.

454
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,860
你要尽量做出柔软潮湿 尖挺的峰
You are looking to make moist, pointy peaks.

455
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,900
我喜欢捏它们
I like to pinch them.

456
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,800
老师 说真的 咱们男人间说话
Chef, seriously, man-to-man,

457
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,860
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

458
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,800
我觉得Max不应该跟那个大家伙一组
I don't think Max should be stuck with that big guy.

459
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,160
他人可不行
He's not cool.

460
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,730
我刚才在那边 而那男的
I was just over there, and the only

461
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,230
唯一感兴趣的高峰 是她的那对
pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

462
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,400
老师 我指的是胸
Talkin' boobies here, chef.

463
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
John 厨师Deke觉得
Chef John, chef Deke here

464
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,030
你似乎是在性骚扰Max
seems to think you are sexually harassing Max.

465
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,830
哦 拜托
Oh, please.

466
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,030
如果我想骚扰谁 老师 那一定是你哦
If I was harassing anyone, it would be you, chef.

467
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,030
别逗了
I mean, come on.

468
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,300
我一会儿回来 男同志
Be right back, big Mary.

469
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,330
你懂的
You know it.

470
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,000
我的果汁呢? 都一个小时了
Where's my juice? It's been an hour.

471
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,230
那个情绪波动的姑娘去拿了
The mood swing elf's getting them.

472
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,900
听着 我一会要进去
Look, I'm coming in there

473
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,700
跟Nicholas厨师长调情 当我进去时
to flirt with chef Nicholas, and when I enter,

474
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,560
我要你说 "Caroline 你好靓啊 "
i need you to say, "Caroline, you look amazing."

475
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,400
不要
No.

476
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,430
我真说不出来
I actually physically can't say that.

477
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,000
我宁愿走进去大叫
I would rather walk in there and yell,

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,160
"我有大螃蟹 其中有三个逃了"
"i have crabs, and three of them just escaped."

479
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,460
快报警 快报警
Call 9...1...1. Call 9...1...1.

480
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,330
那个可爱的混血儿出事了
Something's happened to the adorable mixed-race one.

481
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,700
Deke吗?
Deke?

482
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
他有糖尿病 需要注射胰岛素
He's Diabetic. He needs insulin.

483
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,530
这儿谁会注射?
Has anyone here ever administered a needle?

484
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,630
注射跟"打进去"是同一回事 对吧?
Uh, administer means the same thing as "shove it in," right?

485
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,530
好 好 Max 来 快来
Good, good, good, Max. Come, come, come.

486
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,960
好 他的针管在腰包里
Okay, uh, his syringes are in his fanny pack.

487
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,260
我还从未试过 在没有
I've actually never done this

488
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,930
铁娘子乐队的背景音乐下玩注射
without Iron maiden playing in the background,

489
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,360
我要打针了
but I'll give it a shot.

490
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,560
随便打在我的魔鬼身材上
Just put it anywhere in my hot bod.

491
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,600
老天保佑
God help us.

492
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,260
噢 我怕针头 我不看了
Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.

493
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,030
噢
Oh.

494
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,660
赶紧收拾去啊 女人们
Get it together, ladies.

495
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,300
这也是别人不给我抱孩子的原因
This is why I'm not allowed to hold babies.

496
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,600
Max 从现在起
Max, I think you and Deke

497
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
你和Deke做搭档
should be Lab partners from now on

498
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,900
以防万一有类似事情发生
in case something like this happens again.

499
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,560
- 好吗?  - 这必须的
- Is that okay?  - I guess if I have to.

500
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
Max呢?
Max?

501
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,330
那必须的
I guess if I have to.

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,830
你是故意不打胰岛素的吗?
What, did you not take your insulin on purpose?

503
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,330
我超想成你搭档
I really wanted to be your partner.

504
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,730
Bebe 在这里我找不到厨师袍
Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket anywhere in here.

505
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,600
还有抱歉 我知道我不能穿这种袍子
And I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to wear one,

506
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,560
但我好冷 我无法一整天
but I'm really cold, and I can't walk around

507
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,900
带着这一身脏
like this all day.

508
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,660
也许我能帮上忙
Maybe I can help.

509
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,000
你不能又湿又冷地站在这里
You can't stand there wet and cold.

510
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,100
- 把我的外套拿去  - 哦 不 不行
- Take my jacket.  - Oh, no, no, no.

511
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
你不必... 哦 这件也行
You don't have... oh, that'll work.

512
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,700
抱歉我里面没穿衣服
I'm sorry about the no shirt under,

513
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
但我刚上课上得挺热的
but I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

514
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,530
嗯 是热 太热辣了
Yeah, hot. So hot.

515
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,600
哦 我的妈妈咪啊
Oh mon dieu.

516
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,260
我刚把衣服给Caroline
I was just giving it to Caroline.

517
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,500
我是说 她要换件衣服
I mean, she needs something to wear,

518
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,030
还... 还有现在她有衣服了
and... and now, she has it.

519
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,930
同学 一会见
Chef, I will see you later.

520
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,760
还有Caroline哦
Caroline.

521
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Max 我想我找到让我感兴趣的了
Max, I think I found something to keep me interested.

522
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,260
真是奇怪 我现在成了好学生吗
This is weird. So I'm the good student now?

523
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,260
而你成了跟老师上床的坏学生?
And you're the one sleeping with the teacher?

524
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,730
我们不会上床的
We're not sleeping together.

525
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,130
那啥? 你觉得他想吗?
Why? Do you think he wants to?

526
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,530
这我不知道 不过你得
I don't know, but you better hurry it up

527
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,930
赶在那个男同之前下手
before big Mary gets him.
