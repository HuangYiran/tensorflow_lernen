1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,700
3 percent rise in domestic violence calls.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,600
So the Thanksgiving week always brings an uptick.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,700
Families starting to gather. In-laws in town.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,200
If the pilgrims and indians could find a way.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,600
Maybe the first Thanksgiving was cause they were just to worn out to fight anymore.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,900
- Where's the file I asked you for?
- It's on your desk, sir.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,700
Thank you Baker.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,200
What about this Raymond thing?

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,500
Corporation counsel was served today with a lawsuit., alleging police brutality.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,000
It claims, that two days ago, Raymond assaulted an eight-year-old boy

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
living on the same block as his partner, Officer Donohue.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,400
- Is the boy ok?
- After two hour in ER, and multiple stitches.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,300
His father, an attorney, named Preston Morris, says his son is

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,200
"totally traumatized by the attack,"

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,100
and went straight to the media after filing the suit.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,600
- And we have no idea why it happened.
- Not even from his partner.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,900
Far as anyone can tell, Raymond just snapped.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Goes without saying, the optics are bad on this.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,600
Sterling record, decorated twice for heroism.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,100
This is not that.

21
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,200
He is entitled to the same presumption of innocence afforded any other member of my department.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,800
- You'll let Legal handle it?
- Yes, Mrs. Reagan.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,200
Moving on.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,300
Vic was a hell of a cop.

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,500
But he would be the first to say he wasn't the best in the family.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
That would belong to Colleen over there.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, we partnered for a while.

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,300
And then she was assigned to Vic,

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,400
who said that that was the happiest day of his life.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Until, of course, Brendan and Meara

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,600
came along.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,800
May the Lord bless Vic McGuire

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
and keep his family in His heart.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
- You did good, Reagan.
- Thanks, Roy.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,100
- Fly was open the entire time though.
- Up yours, Roy.

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,600
Thank you, Henry.

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,300
- How you doing?
- I'm hanging in there.

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,600
This place already seems so empty without him.

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,100
You'll see him again one day.

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,700
Don't be a stranger.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,600
Okay.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,500
- This doesn't make sense.
- Brendan, I am not imagining things.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
- What you're saying is crazy.
- I'm...

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,600
Hi, kids.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, Mr. Reagan.

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Look...

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,700
I've been through this a little bit.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
You got to go day by day.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
But it will get better.

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
Go on. Say it.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Say what?

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,500
Unless Dad didn't just die.

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,300
What do you mean?

54
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,600
I think Mom might've had something to do with his death.

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
Meara, your father died of cancer.

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,900
- He's been sick for the last eight months.
- No, but he was better last week.

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
- Mr. Reagan, she is just upset.
- And you're not?

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Listen to what you're saying, Meara. It's your mother.

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,400
I know how it sounds, and maybe she didn't do anything to Dad.

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
But I think she did.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
How the hell can you not love Thanksgiving?

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
Six hours of cooking, ten minutes of eating and then a food coma?

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,700
- What's wrong with a food coma?
- Give me any other holiday, please.

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
- Detectives.
- What do you got, Sarge?

65
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,500
Hispanic male, stabbed to death, found by the owner of this bar over there.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,600
Yeah, I came out to take out some empties, and I almost stepped on him.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,900
- You ever seen him before?
- Just inside, watching the football.

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm missing a football game tonight?

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,600
- I think he means soccer.
- Yeah, Venezuela versus Chile!

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,700
Right! Soccer's not football.

71
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,000
And it looks like the game is officially over for this guy.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
Wallet...

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,100
appears to be intact.

74
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
Wasn't a robbery.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Single stab wound to the chest.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,100
Judging by the angle, the killer is left-handed.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
Gabriel Vega, 26 years old.

78
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,600
He lives about three blocks from here.

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,800
I'd say Mr. Vega came out for a smoke, killer approached to bum one,

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
stabbed him before he lit up.

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
- You psychic?
- 'Cause I only see the one.

82
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,000
Uh, no. There's another one right there.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
Saw it on the way in.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
You got security cameras here?

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,900
No, I don't but other businesses in the area do.

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,100
All right. Uh, Sarge, can you have your guys round 'em all up, everything within

87
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,300
- a five-block radius?
- Of course.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,400
Well, if this isn't a robbery, you got a motive for why somebody wanted him dead?

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Maybe he was cheering for the wrong soccer team.

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Step aside. Kill those TVs.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Please, sir, this is one of my biggest nights of the year.

92
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,100
- <i>Not anymore it isn't.
- Por favor...</i>

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Terry Giondo here for Master Blend 3000.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
Hey! A minute left in the half!

95
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,000
- Shut up!
- And we're kicking their asses!

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Shut up! Now, here's how it's gonna go down.

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,800
I want Chile fans over there on the bench, Venezuela fans over here on the bar.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Move your asses. Let's go. Let's go!

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,600

102
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,100
20 possibles in that bar and not a suspect among 'em.

103
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
- Remember when staying up all night was fun?
- Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,800
Reagan, Baez. How's your Spanish Harlem slaying?

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,900
- Ask me after my nap, Sarge.
- Not till you go through those.

106
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
- Security tapes?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
- Maybe we'll get a look at our killer.
- TARU just dropped 'em off so get crackin'.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,900
I'll divvy 'em up, you make the coffee?

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,700
- Okay.
- Oh, and, uh... good morning!

110
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
- Mr. Reagan.
- Hi, Meara.

111
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,900
- I'm so glad you called.
- Your mom isn't here?

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,200
No, she's at the store.

113
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Are you, uh... you feeling any better?

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
I tried. Brendan says I'm wrong.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,300
But he didn't see what I saw.

117
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,400
- Which was?
- The way Mom's been recently.

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,600
I saw her reading Dad's life insurance policy over and over.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,100
And a week ago Saturday, I swear to God,

120
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,500
she was on this computer doing a search on euthanasia.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, people look up all kinds of things online.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
Even when your husband is dying?

123
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Meara, what you're describing

124
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,600
- is a crime and a mortal sin.
- I know that.

125
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,600
I'm neither a cop nor a priest.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,900
Well, you better show me.

127
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,700
She searched "euthanasia"

128
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,900
and clicked on this link.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,500
"Last Exit Collective, helping you face the end with dignity. "

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,300
"Doctor consultation. How to order pentobarbital and methaqualone. "

131
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,800
Oh, my God.

132
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Did your dad ever talk about ending it all?

133
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,300
Never. You saw him last week.

134
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,700
He was sitting up, he was making jokes.

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Has she received any parcels recently?

136
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,600
She got a box last week. It had a U.S. Customs stamp on it.

137
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,100
Then she was shredding something.

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
Oh, Meara.

139
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm not sure what you want from me here.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,000
Please prove to me my mom didn't do this.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Meara?

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- You home?
- In here, Mom.

143
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Honey, I wanted you to help me with this...

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Henry. What are you doing here?

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,500
Well, I got all the way home last night and realized

146
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,200
that I left my glasses right here on your kitchen counter.

147
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
Henry,

148
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,100
I sweated enough perps in my life to know when I'm getting fed a line.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
You told me not to be a stranger.

150
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,400
Did I tell you he was the flirtiest partner I ever had?

151
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,500
- And that includes your father.
- Doesn't surprise me.

152
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,100
Come on. Help me unload the car, Romeo.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,300
- That's not Raymond.
- Commissioner Reagan.

154
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,600
- Officer Donohue.
- Raymond's kenneled, per protocol.

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm just helping out with Kurtis here and... trying to stay busy.

156
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,800
Pretty serious lawsuit we got on our hands.

157
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
It's a load of crap, respectfully.

158
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,000
Raymond's the best partner I've ever had.

159
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,900
He's never gone after anyone other than perps and, then, only on my orders. And he loves kids.

160
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,700
Plays with my niece Annie all the time. Maybe that boy provoked him.

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
- We're not gonna blame the victim here.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
How did Raymond get out of your yard?

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Sir, I have no idea. He's getting up there.

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,800
His days of jumping the fence to get laid are over.

165
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
And I keep that gate padlocked, always.

166
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
Yet he got out.

167
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
Well, there's no evidence of that. But the padlock had disappeared.

168
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,200
He also had points deducted last year

169
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
at the National Field Trials after making

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
a secondary bite on the simulated attacker.

171
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,500
Raymond got kicked in the takedown.

172
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
But he's never had a negative incident with the public.

173
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,800
He's given his life to service. He deserves a happy retirement,

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
not some shyster says he's a killer. It's not right.

175
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,900
I want to see your partner.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
This way.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,800
<i>Fuss!</i>

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
(QUARANTINED ANIMAL)

179
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,700
Five more days like this.

180
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
If the rabies and behavior evaluations come back on time.

181
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,500
May I?

182
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,300
Sir, he's confined to kennel. I...

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm the police commissioner.

184
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
You use "Ray" for command purposes?

185
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
- Yes, sir.
- Ray.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Come.

187
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,700
You know something about this.

188
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
I do.

189
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,400
Down.

190
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,000
Stay.

191
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,100
Come!

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,700
Heel.

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Good boy.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,400
Good boy.

195
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
He didn't do it.

196
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,600
- Anything?
- Nothing.

197
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,700
All I got are a bunch of dark, empty streets.

198
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, I'll trade you for the cross-dresser that looks just like Sergeant Gormley.

199
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,300
Come on, killer, killer,

200
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,000
where is our killer?

201
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,600
Hold on.

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,900
I found a guy running out of that alley.

203
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Time code matches Vega's T.O.D.

204
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,700
- Hello, dirtbag.
- You mean, hello, Tic-Tac.

205
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,000
- What, you know the guy?
- Wish I didn't.

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,800
- Why do they call him Tic-Tac?
- Because if it looks like a pill, he'll swallow it, along with any other drug.

207
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Uh-huh. So he's a junkie.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,800
- Is he capable of murder?
- Tic-Tac's capable of anything.

209
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Nice neighborhood.

210
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,000
Tic-Tac lives in one of these dumps when he's not nodding off in some shooting gallery.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,900
Yeah. You seem to know a lot about this guy.

212
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,800
- What's your history with him?
- There he is.

213
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,000
All right, I'll go around.

214
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
- Flush him out to me.
- Actually, can you do the flushing?

215
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Tic-Tac!

216
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,400
Where you going?

217
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Look what the cat coughed up, huh?

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,700
What do you want with me?

219
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,100
Put it down.

220
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
- I'm clean!
- Put it down!

221
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,100
- I didn't do anything!
- I don't give a damn! I said drop it!

222
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
What is this, Baez? Something I'm missing here?

223
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
I guess I should've said- his real name is Javi.

224
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
He's my brother.

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,800
Really?

226
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,300
Come on.

227
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,300
- In a cell; lock it twice.
- Yeah, I gotcha.

228
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,100
All right, this way. To the back.

229
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,100
When were you gonna tell me he was your brother?

230
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,200
- You do realize I almost shot him, right?
- You would've done me a favor.

231
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,300
Whoa, whoa. What's the story with you?

232
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,200
What do you want to know? How me and Javi were best friends growing up?

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,700
How he wanted to stay back a grade so we could be in all the same classes?

234
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,500
Or how that all ended when he met <i>a new best friend in a bag of dope?</i>

235
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,500
- You know, maybe you ought to sit this one out.
- Excuse me?

236
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
- You're his sister.
- Not as far as I'm concerned.

237
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,000
No, you are, and you proved it by pushing him through a glass door.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,900
You're busting me on how I took down a hump? You?

239
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,200
- Oh, come on...
- Everything okay out here?

240
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,800
No, Sarge... the guy we like for Vega's murder happens to be Baez's older brother.

241
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Which is irrelevant,

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,600
unless family is now outlawed around here- which means Danny's gonna get pretty lonely

243
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,900
without somebody from his dropping by every other day.

244
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,100
My family members aren't murder suspects who I pushed through a door.

245
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,200
It doesn't matter who Javi is. It only matters that he killed Vega.

246
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,700
- No, it matters how you handle the situation...
- All right, listen up, listen up.

247
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Both of you talk to him. But I'll be nearby.

248
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
I figured since you used to work in the lab...

249
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,800
that you might help me piece this thing together.

250
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
Does Colleen know you went digging in her shredder?

251
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,300
Nah, I had to grab it when she wasn't looking.

252
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Okay.

253
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,000
- Let's start sorting this mess.
- By hand?

254
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,700
Whatever it takes to prove to Meara that her mother didn't do this.

255
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,900
What I mean is, they got computer programs now

256
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,500
that use algorithms to put these together.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,800
- Match shred marks, predict word patterns.
- I didn't know you kept up.

258
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Some of us stay young, Reagan.

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Says the guy who's taken three leaks since he got here.

260
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,700
Now I just send this scan to the laptop,

261
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,600
and let the program do its thing.

262
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,700
(PROCESSING)

263
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
I'll be damned.

264
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,000
So, you don't think she offed Vic.

265
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,000
<i>No. Not the Colleen I know.</i>

266
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
I always wanted to ask you about that.

267
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah. I know.

268
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
There was talk.

269
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,800
Can't say I'm surprised.

270
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,700
Colleen and I... Not that we ever acted on it...

271
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,600
<i>So what are you telling me for?</i>

272
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I don't know. I never told anyone.

273
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,500
Family, friends.

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,700
- No one.
- She feel the same way?

275
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,200
Not that she ever came out and said.

276
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
But I had the boss reassign her.

277
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,900
That's how she and Vic got partnered?

278
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,600
That's how Betty and I stayed together for 46 years.

279
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,800
It's a drug receipt.

280
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
She bought a bottle of pentobarbital.

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,800
You hang back.

282
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Your homework assignment in 1,000 words or less is to write down why you killed Gabriel Vega.

283
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,600
- Who is Gabriel Vega?
- The guy you stabbed in an alley in Spanish Harlem last night.

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
You're out of your mind.

285
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,800
And you're high as a kite. Just go ahead and confess, Javi.

286
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,900
We got you coming out of the alley on video moments after Vega was stabbed and killed.

287
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,300
I already told you, I didn't kill anyone.

288
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,200
- And why should I believe a junkie like you?
- Because I'm clean.

289
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,000
Three months. Look. I don't have any fresh marks.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
So, where are you shooting up now, between your toes?

291
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
- People change.
- Not you.

292
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,300
- What were you doing in the alley?
- I was coming home from work.

293
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
- Where do you work?
- Who the hell would hire you?

294
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,100
You want to know? Huh?

295
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,500
CZE Tech. You always knew I was good with computers.

296
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
- Oh, so what now, you're hacking people's credit card numbers and buying drugs?
- I don't...

297
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,800
I don't do drugs.

298
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,300
That's enough, all right?

299
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,000
What were you doing in the alley?

300
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,100
The gu..

301
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,000
um, Vega, he's smoking,
and I-I bummed a smoke from him.

302
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,300
- Some other guy comes out of nowhere, and he just starts stabbing him.
- This other guy, what'd he look like? 

303
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't know. I was... I was running.

304
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,000
- Just like you ran from us.
- You think I want to talk to a bitch like you?

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,700
What did you call me?

306
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,900
You cut me off two years ago.

307
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
- Yeah, it was 20 years too late,
- All right, all right...

308
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,700
- you stupid piece of crap!
- Officer! Step outside.

309
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
You. Hey.

310
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
Start writing. Everything you remember, put it down.

311
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,500
You know, you two are worse than my kids.

312
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,300
- You didn't buy any of that.
- Actually, I did buy it.

313
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,100
Look, your brother's no angel, but he looks clean and his work I.D. seems legit.

314
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
- You kidding me?
- Did you see him catch the pen with his right hand?

315
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
- The stab wounds on the victim were consistent with a left-handed killer.
- Hey, boss,

316
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,000
- you were listening- you can't agree with him.
- Actually, I do.

317
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And I just called Javi's boss at CZE Tech, and he's confirmed

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
he's been employed for three months and passed every blood test.

319
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
He's not our guy.

320
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,200
- Innocent people don't run from the cops.
- Your brother might be guilty of something; he's not guilty of murder.

321
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,500
Get his statement; cut him loose.

322
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,900
I'll but him loose.

323
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,400
You see if you can come up with some reason why someone would want to kill Gabriel Vega.

324
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,700
- You talked to the dog's handler.
- Yes, I did.

325
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
- After you said you'd stay away.
- Cut it out.

326
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,300
<i>You cut it out. I can't do my job</i> if you're gonna undermine me.

327
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,900
How is getting a firsthand field report undermining you?

328
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,200
- You talk to the kid who got bit?
- No.

329
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,300
<i>Dog bites boy, Reagan checks in on dog?</i>

330
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,000
What's wrong with this picture?

331
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,400
"Oh"? That's all you got?

332
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,900
- It's a shakedown, Garrett.
- Well, score one for their side.

333
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,000
Well... we got the truth on our side.

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
They've got the optics on theirs!

335
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Does the name Greta mean anything?

336
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,100
Yes, it does.

337
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,400
It's also my job to know things, Frank. Like, motivation?

338
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,800
You ran a dog named Greta in K-9 back in the '80s.

339
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
But only that one. Why?

340
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,900
I couldn't cut it.

341
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,500
And that has nothing to do with Greta being shot and killed by the burglar

342
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,000
you sent her in after?

343
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,800
Let's just leave it at that- I couldn't cut it.

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
I know you're not gonna let this go, but...

345
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
let me do my job.

346
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I know how these things are supposed to go.

347
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,000
It is cheaper and quieter to settle out of court.

348
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,700
But any settlement would include an order to put that dog down.

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,800
And that can't happen.

350
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,600
Gabriel worked at my tire shop.

351
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,000
He was a good boy.
He loved soccer.

352
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,500
So no enemies you know of?

353
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,300
Who wouldn't want to be his friend?

354
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,200
The only bad thing he did was smoke.

355
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Vega.

356
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,100
This officer is gonna take you to identify your son.

357
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,600
And if there's anything else, here's my card.

358
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
No enemies, no debts. Why is this not making any sense?

359
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
Hmm. Maybe we're looking at it wrong.

360
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,800
- How so?
- What if Vega wasn't the target?

361
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,700
But then who? Javi?

362
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,900
The killer was going after your brother,

363
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,000
and somehow Vega got himself in the way.

364
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,900
- Who would want to kill my brother?
- He's a nobody.

365
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, all your brother's cases are connected to one man- Benny Russo.

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
- Who is...?
- Mid-level heroin dealer.

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Narcotics has never been able to pin a case on him.

368
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Launders everything through a legit business- this lumberyard.

369
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
And my brother was in bed with him.

370
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Your brother was a cross-town mule in exchange for drugs.

371
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,300
Seems this Russo's a bit of a hothead, and is a little paranoid

372
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,500
when it comes to his ex-employees. He thinks they're all gonna rat on him.

373
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,100
Like... his former accountant here, who was shot point blank in the forehead a year ago.

374
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
- Well, that's a different M.O. than stabbing.
- No.

375
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,300
Both crimes are up-close and personal, which would indicate rage or revenge.

376
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,900
So, maybe your brother gets clean, walks out on Russo, he gets paranoid, thinking,

377
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
Javi might run to his sister, the cop.

378
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,900
Russo decides to go after him.

379
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,100
And Gabriel Vega was just a good Samaritan who tried to stop it?

380
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,200
- Sounds right.
- I'm gonna kick his ass for not telling us any of this.

381
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah, well, now you're gonna have to wait in line.

382
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,500
Coming in, Javi!

383
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,400
Javi?

384
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,800
Son of a bitch.

385
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,700
- Call a bus!
- Oh, my God.

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
Call a bus!

387
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,800
Is... Is he alive?

388
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Barely.

389
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
This is Detective Reagan.

390
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,600
We need a bus forthwith, re apparent overdose.

391
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
I knew he wouldn't be able to stay clean.

392
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,000
- Yeah, and I knew this was gonna be too personal for you.
- What?

393
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,900
Partner, you've been screwing up since we got started,

394
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,700
and I'm not letting either one of us get killed 'cause you're too close to this.

395
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,600
Not everyone has a family where the worst thing that happens is someone's late to Sunday dinner.

396
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,500
Just try to understand.

397
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,600
Javi tore our family apart.

398
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,400
The lies, the stealing, the money my parents spent trying to keep him clean.

399
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,700
They split up because of what he put us all through.

400
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,300
That's why you don't like Thanksgiving.

401
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,200
After everything Javi did, there was nothing to celebrate or anyone who wanted to.

402
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,400
'Least I saw a lot of cops growing up.

403
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,800
- Made me want to become one.
- Yeah, well, something good came of it, I guess.

404
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,500
Can we just go nail Benny Russo?

405
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't know, partner? Can we?

406
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,500
I'm fine, Reagan.

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,800
All right.

408
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,500
Go sit with your brother till he wakes up.

409
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,700
I'll see if I can't make some traction with Benny Russo.

410
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,600
Go ahead.

411
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,400
Mr. Irving to Volunteer Services.

412
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,800
<i>So, who's Benny Russo?</i>

413
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,600
Benny Russo is a drug dealer who laughs in our face every time he skates,

414
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,100
- which is every time he gets pinched.
- Okay, so, what do you need from me?

415
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,000
- -I need a warrant from your bosses.
- Off of what evidence?

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,900
He tried to have my partner's brother killed. He's a customer.

417
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
And this guy killed an innocent bystander instead.

418
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,600
For the record, I do love this song you always sing.

419
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't sing any song. What song are you talking about?

420
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
It's called "I'm Danny Reagan and I Know Someone's Guilty

421
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,900
Even if I Don't Have Any Evidence to Back It Up. "

422
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,300
- I do have evidence to back it up!
- So, you have a murder weapon?

423
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I don't have a murder weapon, no!

424
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,400
Legitimate threats against the brother?

425
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,800
Baez's brother said that Russo tried to kill him.

426
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,600
Any witnesses that are not junkies?

427
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,700
Listen, Russo is a murderer. He killed his accountant!

428
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,100
And he skated because there was no evidence.

429
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,500
- He's a nut!
- And you are halfway there, if you think I'm gonna bring charges on a he said/he said

430
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,800
between one guy who's never spent a day in jail,

431
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800
and another who's been in and out his whole life, when he's not too busy OD'ing.

432
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,200
You know, I need to find a new sister.

433
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,900
You need to find me... when you have more.

434
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,700
So I didn't die.

435
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,300
Not for lack of trying.

436
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,800
Did you get Benny Russo?

437
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,400
My partner went to talk to his sister.

438
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,800
She's an ADA.

439
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,400
So...

440
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,300
<i>siblings can get along, huh?</i>

441
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Weird, huh?

442
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm sorry...

443
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,800
I didn't...

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I didn't tell you that it was Russo who was after me.

445
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
I just thought that...

446
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,100
it would be one more thing for you to hate me for.

447
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Stranger,

448
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,100
you know, he does a, uh...

449
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
good thing...

450
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
and I ran like a coward.

451
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Maybe we can go talk to Vega's family

452
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,500
and tell them how he tried to help you, after we get Russo.

453
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,200
Which may not happen any time soon.

454
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,100
You're not the only one with a difficult sibling.

455
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,900
My sister says we got no case, unless, of course, we catch Russo in the act

456
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,800
- with about 50 witnesses and 12 video cameras.
- So we're screwed?

457
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,100
Unless we give him another chance to finish the job.

458
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,600
What?

459
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
We use your brother to flush him out.

460
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Like, dangle him like bait? No!

461
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,800
- Russo's gonna come after him again anyway.
- Unless he's cooled off.

462
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,700
- Do you think that guy's gonna cool off?
- He's right, Maria.

463
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
No, you shut up. You're still groggy.

464
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,500
No. I... I still know people.

465
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,500
So I get the word out to Russo that I'm gonna be where I used to score, tonight-

466
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,200
Tenth and Butler. It's secluded.

467
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,800
And he'll think he has the drop on me.

468
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,800
- It's a good plan, partner.
- It's crazy.

469
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,000
It's the only way we can make sure your brother's protected.

470
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,000
He's got to go down, Maria.

471
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,800
And I... and I could help. And I want to help.

472
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,300
Least I can do, right?

473
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,400
- Mr. Morris, Frank Reagan.
- I know who you are.

474
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,900
But I can't imagine what you're doing here.

475
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,000
I just like to get out of the office once in a while.

476
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,700
So, the department is settling our suit?

477
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Depends on what you mean by "settle. "

478
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,900
Well, by settle, I mean monetary compensation for physical injury and emotional stress.

479
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Then, no.

480
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,300
But we are prepared to forego a countersuit.

481
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,600
- Then this conversation's over.
- Not quite.

482
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
We looked you up.

483
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,400
Good for you.

484
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,600
You go after deep pockets, but always settle for less.

485
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,200
But a lot of less adds up nicely.

486
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,000
Your dog bit my boy.

487
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,200
<i>A dog bit your boy.</i>

488
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,700
I saw Raymond do it.

489
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,100
Well, you told the investigating sergeant that you were inside at the time.

490
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,400
What I mean is...

491
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,900
I heard my son scream, and by the time I got outside,

492
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,600
I saw your police dog running off down the street.

493
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,400
There were no witnesses that saw Raymond get out of Officer Donohue's yard.

494
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,900
So, you're saying, I framed Raymond?

495
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,300
No. You just said that.

496
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,400
And if it wasn't him, what dog bit my kid? I don't even have a dog.

497
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,800
I don't know.

498
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
The dog at your mother's house in Queens?

499
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,300
The rescue dog that you've tried repeatedly to get them to take back?

500
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't know.

501
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay.

502
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,300
We're done here.

503
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,300
I've got a big megaphone, Mr. Morris, and I know how to use it.

504
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,500
Know one thing.

505
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
We will not settle.

506
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,700
I know you love your son.

507
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,900
Do you really want to put him on the stand to tell your lies?

508
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
You're a real piece of work, Reagan.

509
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,300
Oh, please call me by my first name- Commissioner.

510
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,500
What's going on?

511
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,200
Tell me Vic was in on this.

512
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,300
I knew you didn't come here to find your glasses.

513
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,500
Was he?

514
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,900
It was a decision we made together.

515
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,500
Check the seal.

516
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Unbroken.

517
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,500
Last Tuesday...

518
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,300
he was in so much pain.

519
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,000
Oh, Henry,

520
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,300
I, I came so close.

521
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,600
But you didn't need to.

522
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,900
I was going to say, I,

523
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't know if I could have had the courage.

524
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Not sure that's the word for it.

525
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh, believe me, Henry, I've been there,

526
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,300
and that is the word.

527
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,000
We still friends?

528
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,000
From the first day we met.

529
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,500
Henry, I want to thank you... for caring,

530
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,300
and I mean for all of us.

531
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,200
When the time is right and you want to have a meal,

532
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,800
- go see a movie...
- I'll know who to call.

533
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,100
You okay up there, Javi?

534
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,900
It's cold here, man.

535
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,500
I still don't see Russo.

536
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Same here. Just sit tight.

537
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Ghosts 1 and 2, when Russo shows up, do not make a move until he makes a move first.

538
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,500
- You copy?
- Copy that.

539
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
Reagan, I don't know about this.

540
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,500
Javi's got a stab vest on under his jacket. He'll be fine.

541
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,300
In fact, here he comes now.

542
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
Hey, Javi.

543
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,400
How you doing, my man?

544
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,500
Okay, Javi, stay calm, stay in the light.

545
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,800
Now act surprised to see him.

546
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Hey, Benny. What you doing out here?

547
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Well, a little bird told me you might be out and about tonight.

548
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Don't worry, I just want to talk. Won't take long.

549
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,100
- All right, wait for my command.
- Copy that.

550
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,000
Tell 'em to move in. He's going to stab him.

551
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,400
Give it a second.

552
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Hey, you tried to kill me, man.

553
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,600
Oh... yeah,

554
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,700
you- but you know I get nuts sometimes.

555
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,200
Little bird told me that you also fell off the wagon

556
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,300
last night.

557
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,600
Sucks being clean, huh?

558
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,000
Look, I just want to know everything's good between me and you.

559
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,800
- Come on.
- Sure.

560
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,500
I don't want to kill you, Javi.

561
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,600
- But I am going to make you disappear.
- What the hell is this?

562
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
????

563
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,700
- No!
- Get in the van!

564
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Move in, move in!

565
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Move your car! Where the hell did they come from?

566
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,200
Are they giving you anything?

567
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,500
We don't even know if they're still going in this direction. 

568
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,300
Sarge, you locate the GPS signal on my brother's cell phone yet?

569
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,700
Hold on, still trying.

570
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,300
Got it- the cell phone's signal is pinging off a cell tower in Queens.

571
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,400
East on 73rd Avenue.

572
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,600
East on 73rd Ave. Must be headed out of the city.

573
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,300
Hollis Hills- Russo's lumberyard is in Hollis Hills.

574
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,000
That's where they're taking your brother. Tell the sarge to send backup.

575
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,700
- Come on, let's go.
- I didn't rat on you!

576
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,200
- Let's go.
- Hey!

577
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,000
What are you doing?

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
You're a junkie and your sister's a cop.

579
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,000
Turn that thing on.

580
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,100
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

581
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,800
No... no, no, what are you doing? Listen to me.

582
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,400
- Chop you up...
- No!

583
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
... hose off the back of that truck...

584
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,400
- No!
- ... and it'll be like you never existed.

585
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,200
- Let go of me!
- Police! Let him go!

586
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Let him go!

587
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,600
He's my brother, I'm the only one that gets to kill him.

588
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,100
Hey, look at me.

589
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,400
Don't waste a bullet on that scumbag, all right? Me maybe but not you.

590
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
It's not you.

591
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,400
Then there's that.

592
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
You okay, Javi?

593
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,600
You saved me, Maria.

594
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Sit.

595
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,700
He's coming along.

596
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,800
Commissioner.

597
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,400
About Raymond...

598
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,600
Yes, sir.

599
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,600
The lawsuit is dropped.

600
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,100
I want the two of you back on the job forthwith.

601
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,200
For those who are about to die, we salute you.

602
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,800
He's already dead, Pop.

603
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,400
It's the thought that counts.

604
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,400
- How's Colleen holding up?
- About how you would expect.

605
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,500
You know, I don't think we ever really talked about it.

606
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,200
I was only 11 or 12 when you two were partners.

607
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,800
Yeah, so?

608
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,700
And I certainly wasn't going to bring it up in front of Mom.

609
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,000
What's to bring up?

610
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,300
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, what?

611
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,400
I had the biggest crush on her. She was a babe.

612
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,100
Yes, she, uh, she did have her admirers.

613
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,300
I'll bet.

614
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,200
There we go.

615
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Everything looks so good.

616
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,400
Smells even better.

617
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,200
Wait, do we give thanks before or after grace?

618
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,700
Always before, Sean.

619
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,600
- Linda, go ahead.
- Oh, okay.

620
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,900
this Thanksgiving I am thankful for...

621
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
Why do I have to go first?

622
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
- You always go first.
- I'll go.

623
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,200
No, no, it's okay.

624
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
- Okay, um...
- Time's up.

625
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Uh, my boys.

626
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Eh, you said that last year.

627
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,600
- I did?
- Yeah.

628
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,900
Well, let me do another.

629
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,000
No, no, that was lovely, and the food's getting cold.

630
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
- Okay.
- Next.

631
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,300
I'm thankful to have Drew Brees on my fantasy football team this year.

632
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm thankful I have the 2013

633
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,700
- New York Jets as my real football team this year. Go, Gang Green!
- Go, Gang Green!

634
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,900
And I'm thankful that I have a beautiful wife and two sons who put up with me

635
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,500
'cause, believe me, it's not that way in every family, and

636
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,800
I'm also thankful for that drumstick on the right, which has my name on it.

637
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Me- I'm just thankful for what I'm always thankful for:

638
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,300
to be happy to be kicking around this place with all of you.

639
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm thankful for all the ordinary citizens who have come up to me

640
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,400
on the beat over the past year and thanked me for my service-

641
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,100
all two of 'em. Also, bulletproof vests.

642
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm thankful I only have a year and a half left before I go to college.

643
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,100
I'm thankful that she still has a year and a half left

644
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,800
before she goes to college.

645
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,300
And I'm thankful for four generations of this family at this table,

646
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,700
safe and sound and starving.

647
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,000
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty.

648
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,700
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.

649
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,800
Amen.

650
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,900
Who wants sweet potatoes?

651
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,700
- I'll take some.
- The turkey looks amazing.

652
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,200
I????

653
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,300
Yeah, keep your hands off the drumstick- that one's mine.

654
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,900
Yes????

655
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:34,600
