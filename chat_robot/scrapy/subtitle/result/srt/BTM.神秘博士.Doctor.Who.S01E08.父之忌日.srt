5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,952
这是谁  是你爸爸
Who's that? It's your daddy.

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,689
他去世时你还太小 不记事
You weren't old enough to remember when he died.

7
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:33,330
1987年 11月7号
1987, 7th of November.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,368
还记得我怎么给你说的吗
Do you remember what I told you?

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,513
就是Stuart Hoskins
The day that Stuart Hoskins 

10
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:38,836
和Sarah Clark结婚的那天
and Sarah Clark got married.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,265
他总是爱冒险

12
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,476
啊 他看到现在的你会很高兴的

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,508
妈妈总是对我这么说
That's what Mum always says.

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,312
所以我就想 我们能不能...
So I was thinking, could we...

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,082
我们能不能在我爸还活着的时候 去看看他
could we go and see my dad when he was still alive?

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,056
你怎么突然冒出这个念头了
Where's this come from all of a sudden?

17
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,134
好吧 如果不行的话
All right, if we can't,

18
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,287
如果违反了什么时间条例或者别的什么
if it goes against the laws of time or something,

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,726
别在意 忘了就是了
then never mind, just leave it.

20
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:03,970
没有啊 我能做任何事  
No, I can do anything. 

21
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,924
我只是更担心你罢了
I'm just more worried about you.

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,125
我想看看他
I want to see him.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,661
你的心愿 即是我的使命  
Your wish is my command. 

24
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,499
不过可要小心许愿哦
But be careful what you wish for.

噢 就继续吧  
Oh, just carry on. 

40
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:15,102
{\a6}戴安娜在结婚典礼时 将查理斯王子五个名字的顺序说颠倒了

41
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,595
这对戴安娜王妃来说够好的了
It's good enough for Lady Di.

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,626
我以为他会再高点儿的
I thought he'd be taller.

43
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,666
作为我的合法妻子
To be my lawful wedded wife.

44
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,539
相敬相爱 至死不渝
To love and behold till death us do part.

45
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,636
他死的时候离家很近
He died so close to home.

46
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,074
但我却不在场  没人在那儿
I wasn't there. Nobody was.

47
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,747
那司机肇事逃逸
It was a hit-and-run driver.

48
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,180
最后也没有查出来是谁
Never found out who.

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,687
当救护车赶到的时候他已经死了
He was dead when the ambulance got there.

50
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,423
我只希望 当时能有个人在那陪着他
I only wish there'd been someone there for him.

51
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,482
我希望成为他身边的那个人  
I want to be that someone.  

52
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:49,497
那样他就不会孤单死去了
So he doesn't die alone.

53
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,403
- 11月7日么   - 1987年
- November 7th? - 1987.

54
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,322
真不可思议
It's so weird.

55
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,026
我父亲去世的日子
The day my father died.

56
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,785
我还以为会有狂风暴雨什么的
I thought it'd be all sort of grim and stormy.

57
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,133
竟只是平常的一天
It's just an ordinary day.

58
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,731
过去就像是另一个国度
The past is another country.

59
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,002
1987年就像是怀特岛
1987 is just the Isle of Wight.

60
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,876
{\a6}怀特岛 英格兰南部岛屿 历史悠久

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,744
- 你确定要去吗   - 确定
- You sure about this? - Yeah.

62
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
恶狼

63
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,190
就是这儿了  乔丹路
This is it. Jordan Road.

64
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,528
他迟到了
He was late.

65
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,566
他是去取结婚礼物 一个花瓶
He'd been to get a wedding present, a vase.

66
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,631
妈妈总是说 "那愚蠢的花瓶"
Mum always said, "That stupid vase."

67
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,137
他从车上下来
He got out of his car...

68
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,975
然后穿过马路
and crossed the road.

69
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,116
噢 天啊 就是现在了
Oh, God, this is it.

70
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,338
去他身旁  快点
Go to him. Quick.

71
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,148
现在太迟了
It's too late now.

72
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,683
救护车到的时候 他已经死了
By the time the ambulance got there, he was dead.

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,521
他不能一个人死去
He can't die on his own.

74
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,427
我能再试一次吗
Can I try again?

75
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,574
好了 那是第一次来的我和你
Right, that's the first you and me.

76
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,546
两对我们同时出现 
It's a very bad idea, 

77
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,648
这主意糟透了
two sets of us being here at the same time.

78
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,842
要小心 不能让他们看见我们
Just be careful they don't see us.

79
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,998
等她跑开 然后他跟过去了后 
Wait till she runs off 

80
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:21,114
你就去你爸爸身边
and he follows then go to your dad.

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,897
噢 天啊 就是现在了
Oh, God, this is it.

82
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,666
我做不到
I can't do this.

83
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,731
不必强迫自己做你不愿意的事情
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

84
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,277
但这是我们最后一次能来这儿了
But this is the last time we can be here.

85
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,341
Rose 不行
Rose, no!

86
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,553
我成功了  我救了你的命
I did it. I saved your life.

87
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,786
我的乖乖 瞧见它那速度了么  
Blimey, did you see the speed of it? 

88
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:08,327
你记下他车牌号没
Did you get his number?

89
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,298
我真的成功了  
I really did it. 

90
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,996
噢 我的天 瞧你 你还活着
Oh, my God, look at you, you're alive.

91
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,538
那辆车本来能要你命的
That car was gonna kill you.

92
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,556
对我有点信心行吗 我已经看见那车过来了
Give me some credit, I did see it coming.

93
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:17,269
我总不会自己跑到轮子底下吧
I wasn't gonna walk under it, was I?

94
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,038
我叫Rose
I'm Rose.

95
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,940
真是巧了  我女儿也叫这个名字
That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name.

96
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,910
那是个很棒的名字  选的不错  真好
That's a great name. Good choice. Well done.

97
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,856
好了  我得走了  我得去参加一场婚礼
Right. I better shift. I've got a wedding to go to.

98
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,174
是Sarah Clark的婚礼吗   
Is that Sarah Clark's wedding? 

99
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,452
对啊  你也是去参加的吗
Yeah. Are you going?

100
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,554
当然
Yeah.

101
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,996
你和你男朋友要搭便车么
Do you and your boyfriend need a lift?

102
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,103
好 我们到了 真抱歉啊 这里一团糟
Right, there we go, sorry about the mess.

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,430
如果想喝茶
If you want a cup of tea,

104
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,581
一直走过去就是厨房 牛奶在冰箱里
kitchen's down there, milk's in the fridge.

105
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,744
肯定在冰箱了 是吧  不然你还能放哪儿
It would be, wouldn't it? Where else would you put the milk?

106
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,220
说起来 还有外面的窗台
Mind you, there's always the windowsill outside.

107
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,570
我总是想如果有人发明了
I always thought if someone

108
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:06,850
带特殊隔间的窗台
invented a windowsill with special compartments,

109
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,723
你想啊 一格放牛奶 一格放酸奶
you know, one for milk, one for yoghurt,

110
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,142
就能赚大钱了  
make a lot of money out of that. 

111
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,322
能卖给学生 或者其他什么人
Sell it to students and things.

112
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,295
我该把这主意记下来
I should write that down.

113
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,303
总之 不管了  借过一下 我得去换件衣服
Anyway, never mind that. Excuse me, I got to go and change.

114
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,834
所有的东西妈妈都还留着  他的东西
All the stuff Mum kept. His stuff.

115
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,043
她把这些都装箱收藏在橱柜里
She kept it all packed away in boxes in the cupboard.

116
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,946
以前 她喝了酒之后就会给我看
She used to show me when she'd had a bit of drink.

117
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,979
都在这儿了 陈列在外
Here it is, on display.

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,111
这才是它们本该摆放的地方
Where it should be.

119
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,254
保龄球三等奖  前两名去了迪考镇玩
Third prize at the bowling. First two got to go to Didcot.

120
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,629
{\a6}Didcot 迪考镇 隶属英国牛津郡

121
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,026
健康饮品
Health drinks.

122
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,397
妈妈以前管它们叫"滋补水"
Tonics.  Mum used to call them.

123
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,528
他就是靠买这些叫"急速X"的东西赚钱
He made his money selling this Vitex stuff.

124
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,595
他什么工作都做 非常聪明
He had all sorts of jobs, he was so clever.

125
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,909
太阳能供电  妈妈说他本来正要干这个的
Solar power. Mum said he was going to do this.

126
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,276
现在他可以继续了
Now he can.

127
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,108
好吧 我会告诉他你不是我男朋友的
Okay, I'll tell him you're not my boyfriend.

128
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,432
当我们相遇的时候 我说 
When we met I said, 

129
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:09,279
"和我一起在太空中旅行吧"
"Travel with me in space."

130
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,413
你说 "不"
You said, "No."

131
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,151
然后我说了"时间机器"
Then I said, "Time machine."

132
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,658
这并不是什么大阴谋
It wasn't some big plan.

133
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,755
我只是看着它发生了 然后我想  
I just saw it happening, and I thought, 

134
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,992
"我能够阻止它"
"I can stop it."

135
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:20,718
我又犯了一样的错  
I did it again. 

136
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,196
我又选了一只愚蠢的猿类
I picked another stupid ape.

137
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,605
我本应该知道的 
I should have known.

138
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,635
这不是带你见识宇宙万物  从来都不是
It's not about showing you the universe. It never is.

139
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,935
而是宇宙万物为你做些什么
It's about the universe doing something for you.

140
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,157
那么说 你去其他时间里
So it's okay when you go

141
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:31,170
救别人的命时 就没问题
to other times and you save people's lives

142
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,836
而我救我爸爸 就不行了么
but not when it's me saving my dad?

143
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,470
我知道自己在做什么 而你不知道
I know what I'm doing, you don't.

144
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,072
两对我们同时出现 造成了时空上的脆弱点
Two sets of us being there made that a vulnerable point.

145
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,275
可是他还活着
But he's alive.

146
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,444
我的母星整个毁掉了 我所有的家人都不在了
My entire planet died, my whole family.

147
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,148
你以为我从没想过回到过去 拯救他们吗
Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them?

148
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,349
可是我又没有改变历史
But it's not like I've changed history.

149
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,686
起码改得不多  我是说  
Not much. I mean,

150
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,693
他永远不会成为一个世界领袖
he's never gonna be a world leader,

151
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,627
他也不会发起第三次世界大战或别的什么
he's not gonna start World War III or anything.

152
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,211
Rose 现在世界上
Rose, there's a man alive in the world 

153
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,824
活着一个从前不再活着的人
who wasn't alive before.

154
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,892
一个普通人  那就是茫茫世间最重要的存在
An ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation.

155
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,199
整个世界都因他的存活而截然不同
The whole world's different because he's alive.

156
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,422
那你宁愿他死掉咯   
So, would you rather him dead? 

157
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:01,570
我没那么说...
I'm not saying that...

158
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,699
不 我明白了  就这一次  
No, I get it. For once,

159
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,769
你不是我生命中最重要的那个人
you're not the most important man in my life.

160
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,608
那就看看没了我你怎么过吧  钥匙给我
Let's see how you get on without me. Give me the key.

161
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,774
Tardis的钥匙  
The Tardis key. 

162
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,308
如果我那么不重要 那就把钥匙还给我啊
If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.

163
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,941
行啊 我这就还你
All right then, I will.

164
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,885
你得到你想要的了 那么再见吧
You've got what you wanted so that's goodbye, then.

165
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,521
你才吓不着我
You don't scare me.

166
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,424
我知道你有多难过  你马上就会回来的
I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a minute.

167
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,655
或是在Tardis外徘徊着等我
Or you'll hang around outside the Tardis waiting for me.

168
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,227
我会让你等很久很久的
And I'll make you wait a long time.

169
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,138
和男朋友吵架了
Boyfriend trouble?

170
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,196
不好意思 介意我问一句么  
Excuse me, would you mind? 

171
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,519
你收拾这些干嘛
What are you tidying up for?

172
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,614
抱歉 成习惯了
Sorry, force of habit.

173
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,555
别担心他了  小两口吵架是常有的事
Don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time.

174
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,499
我们不是一对儿  
We're not a couple. 

175
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,893
为什么所有人都认为我们是一对儿啊
Why does everyone think we're a couple?

176
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,900
我觉得他离开我了   
I think he left me. 

177
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,764
怎么会  像你这么漂亮的姑娘
What? A pretty girl like you?

178
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,422
如果我在和你约会的话...   
If I was going out with you... 

179
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,134
快别说了
Stop right there.

180
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,194
我只是说说而已
I'm just saying

181
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,604
我知道你说什么 我们不会往那方向发展
I know what you're saying and we're not going there.

182
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,343
任何情况下
At no point are we going 

183
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,906
我们都不会往任何那附近的方向发展
anywhere near there.

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,072
你都不知道那方向究竟是哪个方向
You don't even know where that there exists...

185
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,824
我可不愿去想那方向
I don't want to think about there and,

186
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,015
相信我 你也不愿的
believe me, neither do you.

187
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,611
那方向 对你来说 就像...
There, for you, is like...

188
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,450
就像百慕大三角区
like the Bermuda Triangle.

189
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,331
老天 你可真会恭维人   
Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke. 

190
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:01,255
好了  我们出发吧
Right. Are we off?

191
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,699
那么 这不是什么模糊的暗示信号咯   
So, that wouldn't be a mixed signal at all? 

192
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,694
绝对不是
Absolutely not.

193
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,228
我真该把你送回你该住的疯人院去
I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong.

194
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,928
但我肯定之前在哪儿见过你
Except I'm sure I've met you somewhere before.

195
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,507
- 真奇怪   - 咋了
- It's weird. - What?

196
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,046
这么多人都缺席了
There's so many people missing.

197
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,070
Steven叔叔 Lynn阿姨 
Uncle Steven, Auntie Lynn, 

198
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,605
还有Baxter全家
all the Baxters.

199
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,682
他们都去哪儿了
Where are they?

200
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,447
你不觉得出什么事了吗
You don't think something's gone wrong?

201
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,513
可能这是个天赐良机 让你有时间再考虑考虑
Maybe it's a godsend, gives you time to think.

202
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,251
你不用非得结婚 至少如今不用了
You don't have to go through with it, not these days.

203
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,226
- 先未婚同居一段儿试试   - 爸啊
- Live in sin for a bit. - Dad.

204
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,731
10年后 你会后悔 你会说
In 10 years' time, you'll turn round and say,

205
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,789
真希望我能让时间倒流啊
"If only I could turn the clock back."

206
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,931
是我自己的感觉吗 还是真的变冷了
Is it me or did it just get cold?

207
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,837
Rose
Rose.

*I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling*

211
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,112
他在版权上分我一点油水
and he's cutting me in on copyright.

212
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,312
我还以为你是个正经商人

213
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:38,362
{\a6}*Gotta make you understand*

I wish. I do a bit of this, bit of that. 

215
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:38,379
维持生计嘛
I scrape by.

216
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:42,175
{\a6}*Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*
*永远不会弃你而去*

217
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,654
好吧  那一定是我听错了
Right. I must've heard wrong.

218
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,696
所以 实际上 你是个油嘴滑舌的家伙

221
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,287
你就使劲批判我吧
Shoot me down in flames.

222

{\a6}*Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye*
*永不用谎言伤害你*

223
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,334
你和我老婆不会有点血缘关系吧
You're not related to my wife by any chance, are you?

224
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,263
噢 天啊  她也会在婚礼上
Oh, my God. She's gonna be at the wedding.

Sort of.

229

她说她挑到了世界上最棒的男人

00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,785
她那没用的老爹去哪里了
Where's her useless article of a dad got to?

273
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,221
爸
Dad!

274
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,400
是那辆车 和之前是同一辆
It's that car. Same one as before.

275
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,400
就在我们面前 他去哪了
It was right in front of us, where's he gone?

276
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,937
你刚才叫我"爸"了  为什么
You called me "Dad"? What did you say that for?

277
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,711
奥 太棒了 老出事故的家伙
Oh, wonderful! Here he is, the accident waiting to happen.

278
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,162
估计你连自己的葬礼都会迟到 
You'd be late for your own funeral 

279
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,344
刚刚差不多就是了
and it nearly was.

280
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,752
- 我没受伤   - 这又是谁
- No damage done.   - And who's this?

281
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,953
嘴张这么大 看什么呢
What are you looking at with your mouth open?

282
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,891
- 你的头发   - 什么
- Your hair.   - What?

283
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,791
我还从来没有见过这样的
I've never seen it like...

284
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,929
我是说
I mean...

285
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,627
很好看 你的头发很好看
it's lovely, your hair's lovely.

286
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,539
你抱着的那个孩子
And that baby you're holding.

287
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,873
一定就是你的孩子吧
That would be your baby.

288
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,542
又是你在哪勾搭到的姑娘吧   
Another one of yours, is she?   

289
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,809
她救了我的命
She saved my life.

290
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,282
这回挺新鲜  上次是什么来着
That's a new one. What was it last time?

291
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,842
我甚至都不认识她  那是个衣帽间服务员
I didn't even know her. She was a cloakroom attendant.

292
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,649
我当时在帮她找我的票
I was helping her look for my ticket.

293
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,846
有三件一模一样的风帽粗呢大衣
There were three duffle coats all the same.

294
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,180
不知怎的 衣架倒了
Somehow the rack collapsed.

295
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,954
我们就被压在那堆东西下面了
We were under all this stuff.

296
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,153
你是不是总拈花惹草啊
Were you playing around?

297
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,389
他干了什么和你有关系吗
What's it got to do with you what he gets up to?

298
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,227
- 他到底干了什么   - 你心里明白
- What does he get up to?   - You'd know.

299
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,522
我那么傻吗
Because I'm that stupid. 

300
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,735
我风流完了还把她带回来见老婆
I play around and I bring her to meet the missus.

301
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,395
- 你个蠢牛   - 你就有那么蠢
- You silly cow.   - But you are that stupid.

302
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,837
我们能回家再吵吗 先消停一会儿
Can we keep this stuff for back home, just for now?

303
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,431
什么 在那个垃圾堆里吗
What, with the rest of the rubbish?

304
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,875
你把打折的清洁剂 滋补水
You bring home cut-price detergents, tonic water,

305
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,209
大号录像带拿回家 没一样有用的
Betamax tapes and none of it works.

306
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,680
我都快在你的垃圾里淹死了
I'm drowning in your rubbish.

307
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,913
他是怎么跟你说的  说他是个大商人吗
What did he tell you? Did he say he's this big businessman?

308
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,206
他根本不是  他是个失败者  
Cause he's not. He's a failure. 

309
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,185
天生没用种 那个家伙
Born failure, that one.

310
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,747
Rose需要一个称职的父亲
Rose needs a proper father...

311
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,078
Jackie 我在辛苦赚钱  
Jackie, I'm making a living. 

312
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,522
我们能有饭吃 不是吗
It keeps us fed, doesn't it?

313
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,857
够了
Stop it.

314
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,092
你们俩不是这样的  你们彼此相爱啊
You're not like this. You love each other.

315
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,066
Pete 你以前可不喜欢疯疯癫癫的姑娘啊
Pete, you never used to like them mental.

316
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,926
或者我不知道 也许你喜欢呢   
Or I don't know, maybe you did. 

317
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:46,696
Jackie 等等 听我说
Jackie, wait, listen...

318
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,783
你给我小心点
If you're not careful,

319
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:50,173
否则今天结婚离婚一块办
there'll be a wedding and a divorce on the same day.

320
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,868
在这儿等一下  给我几分钟和我老婆谈谈
Wait here. Give us a couple of minutes with the missus.

321
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,064
这样吧 你去把车停好  
Tell you what, straighten the car up. 

322
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:57,211
停在街角附近
Stick it round the corner.

323
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,147
不要再惹麻烦
Don't cause any more trouble.

324
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,070
嘿 Jack
Hey, Jack.

325
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,561
我不想听 又是粗呢大衣什么的 换汤不换药
I'm not listening. It's the duffle coats all over again.

326
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,664
Jackie 有时候粗呢大衣只是粗呢大衣
Jackie, sometimes a duffle coat is just a duffle coat.

327
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,373
很快一切都会好起来的 我保证
Things will get better soon. I promise.

328
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,342
我受够你的愚蠢计划了
I've had enough of all your daft schemes.

329
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,471
吃完上顿没下顿
I never know where the next meal's coming from.

330
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,300
我会解决的 亲爱的
I'll get it right, love.

331
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,949
很快就会有那天 我向你保证 我会解决的
One day soon, I promise you I'll get it right.

332
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,246
乐观点
Come on.

333
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,280
怪物 它们要吃我们
Monsters! Going to eat us!

334
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,122
什么怪物啊 亲爱的 是外星人吗
What sort of monsters, sweetheart? Is it aliens?

335
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
Rose
Rose!

336
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,433
进教堂里去
Get in the church!

337
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,916
进教堂里去
Get in the church!

338
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,759
上帝啊 它们是什么
Oh, my God. What are they?

339
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,351
进去
Inside!

340
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,894
- Sarah   - 待在那别动
- Sarah! - Stay in there!

341
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,075
进去
In.

342
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,362
它们进不来的 这些门窗都有年头了 好了
They can't get in. Old windows and doors. Okay.

343
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,266
越古老 越坚固
The older something is, the stronger it is.

344
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,669
还能做什么
What else?

345
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,711
去检查一下其他的门 快
Go and check the other doors. Move!

346
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,440
怎么回事 那些是什么 到底是什么
What's happening? What are they? What are they?

347
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,778
时间遭遇了事故 出现了裂缝
There's been an accident in time. A wound in time.

348
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,647
就像细菌 乘隙而入
They're like bacteria, taking advantage.

349
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,626
你说的时间是什么意思  
What do you mean? Time? 

350
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,346
你在念叨什么 什么时间
What are you jabbering on about time?

351
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,547
我早知道你会喋喋不休
I might've known you'd argue.

352
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,549
Jackie 你总在抱怨 烦死了   
Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining. 

353
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:53,386
你是怎么知道我的名字的
How do you know my name?

354
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,686
我从来没有见过你
I've never met you in my life.

355
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,523
我不解决这个问题 你就没机会见到我了
You never will unless I sort this out.

356
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,859
如果你不介意的话 我老早就想这么说了
If you don't mind, I've waited a long time to say this,

357
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,997
Jackie Tyler 我说啥你做啥 
Jackie Tyler, do as I say. 

358
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,300
去检查那些门
Go and check the doors.

359
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,929
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

360
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,231
我早该那么做了
I should've done that ages ago.

361
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,398
- 我爸爸在外面   - 待会儿再默哀吧
- My dad was out there. - You can mourn him later.

362
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,839
现在我们要集中注意力保命
Now we've got to concentrate on keeping ourselves alive.

363
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,207
- 我爸爸已经   - 我对此无能为力
- My dad had... - There is nothing I can do for him.

364
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,542
不是 但他有个叫手机的东西
No, but he had this phone thing.

365
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,777
它不管用了 我一直收到这个声音
I can't get it to work. I keep getting this voice.

366
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,748
Watson 过来 我需要你
Watson, come here. I need you.

367
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,515
这是人类史上第一个电话
That's the very first phone call.

368
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,358
{\a6}Watson 过来 我需要你
Watson, come here. I need you.

369
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,079
来自亚历山大 格雷厄姆 贝尔
Alexander Graham Bell.

370
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,284
我觉得这个电话不会派上多大用场
I don't think the telephone's gonna be much use.

371
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,724
一定有人叫了警察了
Someone must have called the police.

372
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,262
警察也帮不了你们 没有人可以
The police can't help you now, no one can.

373
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,987
宇宙中的任何东西都无法伤害那些怪物
Nothing in this universe can harm those things.

374
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,365
时间被损坏了 它们是来修补裂缝的
Time's been damaged and they've come to sterilise the wound.

375
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,731
以消灭所有可见事物的方式
By consuming everything inside.

376
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,610
这是因为
Is this because...

377
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,279
是我的错吗
Is this my fault?

378
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,262
不要啊
No!

379
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,048
城市上空有烟升起 却没听见警报
There's smoke coming up from the city. But no sirens.

380
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,543
我觉得不只是我们这里
I don't think it's just us.

381
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,708
这些东西肯定是到处都是
I think these things are all over the place.

382
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,117
可能是全世界
Maybe the whole world.

383
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,860
那是辆车吧
Was that a car?

384
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,667
那不重要 不用担心
It's not important. Don't worry about it.

385
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,529
你的那个同伴 他说是你的错 是什么意思
This mate of yours. What did he mean, this is your fault?

386
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,525
不知道 所有事吧
Don't know. Just everything.

387
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,498
我把我的车钥匙给了你
I gave you my car keys.

388
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,771
人们不会把车钥匙给一个完全陌生的人
You don't give your keys to a complete stranger.

389
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,707
这就 就像我很信任你
It's like I trusted you.

390
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,646
从我遇见你的时候起 就信任你
The moment I met you, I just did.

391
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,955
时间裂痕
A wound in time.

392
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,959
你叫我爸
You called me Dad.

393
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,457
我看得出来
I can see it.

394
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,059
你有我的眼睛
My eyes.

395
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,624
Jackie的气势
Jackie's attitude.

396
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,396
你大喊时听起来很像她
You sound like her when you shout.

397
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,250
你是 你是 你是我的Rose
You are. You are. You're my Rose.

398
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,114
你是我的Rose 长大的Rose
You're my Rose, grown up.

399
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,949
爸爸  我爸爸  我的爸爸
Dad! My dad. My daddy.

400
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,954
打扰一下
Excuse me.

401
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,793
- 先生   - 博士
- Mister?   - Doctor.

402
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,452
你好像了解状况
You seem to know what's going on.

403
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:23,858
我总是给人那种印象 没错
I give that impression, yeah.

404
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,426
- 我只是想问问   - 你能救我们吗
- I just wanted to ask...   - Can you save us?

405
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,011
你们是谁呢
Who are you two, then?

406
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,075
Stuart Hoskins   
Stuart Hoskins.  

407
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:37,071
Sarah Clark
Sarah Clark.

408
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,373
还有一个呢  男孩还是女孩
And one extra? Boy or girl?

409
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,915
我不知道  其实 我也不想知道
I don't know. I don't want to know, really.

410
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,888
你们两个是怎么开始的
How did all this get started?

411
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,987
在Beatbox俱乐部的外面 凌晨两点
Outside the Beatbox Club, 2:00 in the morning.

412
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,790
街角处 我钱包丢了 没有打出租车的钱
Street corner, I'd lost my purse, didn't have money for a taxi.

413
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,688
- 我送她回的家   - 然后呢
- I took her home. - Then what?

414
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,991
约她了?
Asked her for a date?

415
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,991
他把他的电话号码写在我手背上   
Wrote his number on the back of my hand.   

416
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,636
从此就再也甩不掉她啦
Never got rid of her since.

417
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,297
我爸爸说
My dad said...

418
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,713
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't know what this is

419
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,181
我也知道我们无足轻重
all about and I know we're not important...

420
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,183
谁说你们无足轻重
Who said you're not important?

421
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,835
我去各种地方游历过
I've travelled to all sorts of places,

422
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,917
做过的事你们根本无法想像
done things you couldn't even imagine.

423
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,718
但是你们两个
But you two.

424
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,597
街角处 凌晨两点 坐出租车回家
Street corner, 2:00 in the morning, getting a taxi home.

425
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,492
我从未经历那样的生活
I've never had a life like that.

426
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,927
是的
Yes.

427
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,630
我会尽力救你们的
I'll try and save you.

428
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,078
我是个爸爸了
I'm a dad.

429
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,579
我是说 我已经是个爸爸了
I mean, I'm already a dad

430
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,208
但是是Rose长大了 长成了你
but Rose grows up and she's you.

431
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,547
太好了
That's wonderful.

432
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,384
我是说 我还以为你会没什么出息呢
I mean, I suppose I thought that you'd be a bit useless

433
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,981
因为遗传了我的无用基因 但是
what with my useless genes and all but...

434
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,422
你是怎么到这来的
Well, how did you get here?

435
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,623
- 你真想知道吗   - 是啊
- Do you really want to know?   - Yeah.

436
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,289
时光机器
A time machine.

437
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,092
- 时光机器吗   - 我发誓是真的
- Time machine? - Cross my heart.

438
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,695
你来的时候 人们都有时光机器了么
Do you all have time machines where you come from?

439
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,296
不是 只有博士有
No, just the Doctor.

440
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,506
你早就知道这些怪物会出现吗
Did you know these things were coming?

441
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,203
不知道
No.

442
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,412
上帝啊 我不知道 我的头好晕啊
God, I don't know, my head's spinning.

443
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,745
未来是什么样子的
What's the future like?

444
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,083
和现在没多大区别
It's not so different.

445
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,385
我是什么样子的 我的头发灰了吗
What am I like? Have I gone grey?

446
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,056
我秃顶了吗 别告诉我我秃顶了
Have I gone bald? Don't tell me I've gone bald.

447
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,784
那么 如果你这朋友不是你男朋友
So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend,

448
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,008
我得说我很高兴
and I have to say I'm glad

449
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,186
因为作为你的爸爸 
cause being your dad and all, 

450
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:47,476
我觉得他对你来说有点老了
I think he's a bit old for you.

451
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,717
你有男朋友了吗   
Have you got a bloke?   

452
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,145
没有 以前有过
No. I did have.

453
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,739
Mickey
Mickey.

454
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,588
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

455
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,579
他穿了西装我没认出来
I just didn't recognise him in a suit.

456
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,420
你得放开我 亲爱的
You have to let go of me, sweetheart.

457
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,721
我老这么对他说
I'm always saying that.

458
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,328
他逮谁抱谁 
He just grabs hold of what's passing 

459
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:05,854
抱住就不松手
and holds on for dear life.

460
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,237
上帝快帮帮他女朋友吧 
God help his poor girlfriend 

461
00:26:07,237 --> 00:26:08,456
如果他能找到一个的话
if he ever gets one.

462
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,698
我和Rose只是在聊天   
Me and Rose were just talking. 

463
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,366
哦 是吗 聊天啊
Oh, yeah? Talking?

464
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,700
世界末日了 你在干嘛呢
While the world comes to an end, what do you do?

465
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,672
和最年轻的金发美女依依相惜
Cling to the youngest blonde.

466
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,839
走吧 Mick
Come on, Mick.

467
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,204
- 你不能告诉她   - 为什么
- You can't tell her. - Why?

468
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,580
我是说 我真的不希望你告诉她
I mean, I really don't want you to tell her.

469
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,949
- 你不想让人知道吗   - 我来的时候
- You don't want people to know? - Where I come from,

470
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,962
Jackie还不知道怎么用
Jackie doesn't know how to work 

471
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,784
录像机的计时器呢
the timer on the video recorder.

472
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,687
我上周还教过她
I showed her that last week.

473
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,084
我懂了
Point taken.

474
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,806
Rose 
Rose, 

475
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:44,163
你不会带来世界末日
you're not going to bring about the end of the world, are you?

476
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,163
是吧
Are you?

477
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,739
Jackie让我照看好她
Jackie gave her to me to look after.

478
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,846
这情况似曾相识啊
How times change.

479
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,810
我最好小心点儿
I'd better be careful.

480
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,705
我想Mickey刚刚认准我了 
I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey 

481
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,223
{\a6}印随行为 一些动物跟随着它所见到的第一个移动的物体并当做母亲的行为

482
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,409
像小鸡找妈妈一样
like a mother chicken.

483
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,221
别  别碰婴儿
No. Don't touch the baby.

484
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,454
你们俩是同一个人 这是悖论
You're both the same person, that's a paradox.

485
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,713
我们可不希望悖论出现 
We don't want a paradox happening, 

486
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,588
外面那些鬼东西还在张牙舞爪呢
not with these things outside.

487
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,915
任何新状况 任何时间上的波动 
Anything new, any disturbance in time, 

488
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,328
都会使它们更强大
makes them stronger.

489
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,600
一个悖论就可能把它们放进来
A paradox might let them in.

490
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,302
我什么事都做不好 是吧
I can't do anything right, can I?

491
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:27,107
既然你都问了 没错  所以 别碰婴儿
Since you asked, no. So, don't touch the baby.

492
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,917
我又不是白痴   
I'm not stupid. 

493
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,280
你都能把我耍的团团转了
You could have fooled me.

494
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,611
好吧
All right...

495
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,815
对不起
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,659
我没真想丢下你
I wasn't really gonna leave you on your own.

497
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,751
我知道
I know.

498
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,514
我也就告诉你 我还没想出计划  
Between you and me, I haven't got a plan. 

499
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:47,423
不知如何是好
No idea.

500
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,998
无路可走
No way out.

501
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,366
你会想出办法的
You'll think of something.

502
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,268
整个地球都已经被清洗了
The entire Earth's been sterilised.

503
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,016
这里 还有在像这里的其他地方里躲着的
This, and other places like it,

504
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:59,071
是仅剩的人类了
are all that's left of the human race.

505
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,590
我们也许能撑一阵子
We might hold out for a while,

506
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,375
但没什么能阻止这些生物
but nothing can stop those creatures.

507
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,561
最终 它们还是能进来  
They'll get through in the end. 

508
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,780
这些建筑还不够古老
The walls aren't that old.

509
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,309
我根本无法阻止它们
And there's nothing I can do to stop them.

510
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,625
曾经有律法
There used to be laws 

511
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,355
阻止这类情况发生
stopping this kind of thing from happening.

512
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,550
我的族人能阻止这一切
My people would have stopped this.

513
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,284
但他们都不在了
But they're all gone.

514
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,656
而现在 我也快随他们而去了
And now I'm going the same way.

515
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,358
如果我意识到
If I'd realised...

516
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,893
只要
Just...

517
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,200
跟我说对不起
tell me you're sorry.

518
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,135
对不起
I am.

519
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,038
真的对不起
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,489
你身上有什么在发烫
Have you got something hot?

521
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,920
是Tardis的钥匙
It's the Tardis key.

522
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,669
这说明它还跟Tardis相连
It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis.

523
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,303
我飞船的内部被抛出时空裂缝了
The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound

524
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,141
但我们可以用这个来把它带回来
but we can use this to bring it back.

525
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,910
只要取回我的飞船 我就可以恢复一切
And once I've got my ship back, then I can mend everything.

526
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,248
现在 我只需要一点能量  哪位有电池
Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a battery?

527
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,344
这个够大吗
This one big enough?

528
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,681
太好了
Fantastic.

529
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,726
感谢老爸  给你
Good old Dad. There you go.

530
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,756
只要充一点电就好
Just need to do a bit of charging up.

531
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,059
然后就能把所有人带回来了
And then we can bring everyone back.

532
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,919
你 呃 你一直没说 为什么要来到这里
You, erm, you never said why you came here in the first place.

533
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,172
如果我有时光机  
If I had a time machine, 

534
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,487
我不会觉得1987年有什么特别的
I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything special.

535
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,827
至少这里没什么特别的
Not round here, anyway.

536
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,565
我们只是刚好到了这里   
We just ended up here. 

537
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,301
那我可真幸运啊 是吧
Lucky for me, eh?

538
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,196
如果你没到这儿救我
If you hadn't been there to save me...

539
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:08,567
那只是个巧合
That was just a coincidence.

540
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,371
那可真的是好运啊  真奇妙
That was just really good luck. It's amazing.

541
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,981
那 在未来 我和我内人还在一起吗
So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together?

542
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,175
嗯
Yeah.

543
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,054
- 你还和我们住在一起吗   - 是的
- You still living with us? - Yep.

544
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,192
我是个好爸爸吗
Am I a good dad?

545
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,199
你...
You...

546
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:44,265
我小时候 你每晚都给我讲睡前故事
You told me a bedtime story every night when I was small.

547
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,276
你一直都在 你一晚上都没错过
You were always there, you never missed one.

548
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,808
还有 嗯...
And, erm...

549
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,756
每个周六你都带我们到乡下野餐
you took us for picnics in the country every Saturday.

550
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,217
你从来没让我们失望
You never let us down.

551
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,126
你始终和我们在一起
You were there for us all the time.

552
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,497
是我真正的依靠
Someone I could really rely on.

553
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,807
那不是我
That's not me.

554
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,535
好了 谁也别碰那钥匙
Right, no one touches that key,

555
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:42,297
都听到了吗  别碰那钥匙
have you got that? Don't touch it.

556
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,410
要是有人碰了那钥匙 
Anyone touches that key, 

557
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,598
链接就会 恩 嘎嘣断了
it'll be, well, zap!

558
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,157
只要顺其自然 一切都会好起来的
Just leave it be and everything will be fine.

559
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,466
我们都能出去  所有人
We'll get out. All of us.

560
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,686
Stuart Sarah 你们俩会结婚的 
Stuart, Sarah, you're gonna get married, 

561
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:52,976
我说会就一定会
just like I said.

562
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,457
当时间理顺了
When time gets sorted out...

563
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,303
每个人都会忘记发生的一切
Everybody here forgets what happened.

564
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:27,367
别担心 你改变的事情不会再变回去
And don't worry, the thing that you changed will stay changed.

565
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,478
你是说我还是会活着
You mean I'll still be alive.

566
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,349
而我本来应该死了
Though I'm meant to be dead.

567
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,718
这就是为什么我此生毫无作为
That's why I haven't done anything with my life.

568
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,224
此生毫无意义
Why it didn't mean anything.

569
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,760
- 不是这样的   - 扯淡
- Doesn't work like that. - Rubbish.

570
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,489
我太没用了 甚至都不能好好去死
I was so useless I couldn't even die properly.

571
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,557
发生的这一切 都是我的错
Now it's my fault all this has happened.

572
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,364
- 这是我的错   - 不 亲爱的
- This is my fault. - No, love.

573
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,961
我是你父亲
I'm your dad.

574
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,233
作为一个父亲 就要负起担当错误的责任
It's my job for it to be my fault.

575
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,868
她父亲  你怎么会是她父亲
Her dad? How are you her dad?

576
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,006
你那时才几岁  12岁
How old were you? 12?

577
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,244
- 噢 真恶心   - Jacks 听着
- Oh, that's disgusting. - Jacks, listen.

578
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,449
- 她是Rose   - Rose?
- This is Rose. - Rose?

579
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,045
你恶不恶心啊
How sick is that?

580
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,091
你给我女儿取了个二手名字吗
Did you give my daughter a second-hand name?

581
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,315
你有多少风流债啊  
How many are there? 

582
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:16,786
你都管她们叫Rose吗
Do you call them all Rose?

583
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,419
啊 天呐 瞧  她们是同一个Rose
Oh, for God's sake, look. It's the same Rose.

584
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,793
Rose 不
Rose, no!

585
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,401
大家到我身后去
Everyone, behind me!

586
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,551
我是这里最古老的
I'm the oldest thing in here.

587
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,680
博士
Doctor!

588
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,316
它凉了
It's cold.

589
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,648
这钥匙是凉了
The key's cold.

590
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,221
噢 我的天啊 他死了
Oh, my God, he's dead.

591
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,455
这全都是我的错
This is all my fault.

592
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,730
你们两个 你们所有人
Both of you, all of you.

593
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,905
整个世界
The whole world.

594
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,882
完了  我们无能为力  都结束了
This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end.

595
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,147
博士真的很在乎你
The Doctor really cared about you.

596
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,617
他不想你再承受一次
He didn't want you to go through it again.

597
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,225
只要还有别的办法
Not if there was another way.

598
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,628
但现在没有了
Now there isn't.

599
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,990
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

600
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,535
那辆本该撞死我的车 亲爱的
The car that should have killed me, love.

601
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,272
它在这儿了
It's here.

602
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,601
博士早就明白了 但他...
The Doctor worked it out way back but he...

603
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,440
他试图保护我
tried to protect me.

604
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,281
但是
Still.

605
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,184
现在他不能负责了
He's not in charge anymore.

606
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,718
我说了算
I am.

607
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,221
- 但你不能   - 我是谁 亲爱的
- But you can't. - Who am I, love?

608
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,656
我爸爸
My daddy.

609
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,466
Jackie 看看她
Jackie, look at her.

610
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,271
她是我们的女儿
She's ours.

611
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,540
当然
Of course.

612
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,183
我本就该去死的 Jackie
I'm meant to be dead, Jackie.

613
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,490
你终究摆脱了我
You're gonna get rid of me at last.

614
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,994
别这么说
Don't say that.

615
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,055
仅此一次 相信我  这是注定的
For once in your life, trust me. It's got to be done.

616
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,556
你要活下去 
You've got to survive 

617
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,062
因为你还要把我们的女儿养大成人
cause you've got to bring up our daughter.

618
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,217
我从没给你读过睡前故事
I never read you those bedtime stories,

619
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:37,077
我从没带你们去野餐过
I never took you on those picnics.

620
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,522
我从来都不在你身旁
I was never there for you.

621
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,523
你本应在的
You would've been.

622
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,622
但我能为你做这个
But I can do this for you.

623
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,755
现在 我能为你做一个称职的父亲了
I can be a proper dad to you now.

624
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,695
但这不公平
But it's not fair.

625
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,791
我已经多活好几个小时了
I've had all these extra hours.

626
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,699
这世界上没人有过这么好的待遇
No one else in the world has ever had that.

627
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,934
最重要的是 我见到了你
And on top of that, I get to see you.

628
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,109
你真漂亮
And you're beautiful.

629
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,542
我是多么幸运啊 是吧
How lucky am I, eh?

630
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,420
所以 来吧  按爸爸说的做
So, come on. Do as your dad says.

631
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,888
你会陪着我吧 亲爱的
You gonna be there for me, love?

632
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,428
谢谢你救了我
Thanks for saving me.

633
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,298
再见 亲爱的
Goodbye, love.

634
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,015
去见他最后一面  快
Go to him. Quick.

635
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,866
那司机还只是个孩子
The driver was just a kid.

636
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,006
他停下了 等着警察到来
He stopped, he waited for the police.

637
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,775
不是他的错
It wasn't his fault.

638
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,014
不知为何 Pete自己跑了出去
For some reason, Pete just ran out.

639
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,780
有人说 有一个女孩
People say there was this girl.

640
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,226
在他垂死之际 她一直陪着他
And she sat with Pete while he was dying.

641
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,852
她握着他的手
She held his hand.

642
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,555
然后就离开了
Then she was gone.

643
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,302
没人知道那女孩是谁
Never found out who she was.

644
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,130
Peter Alan Tyler 
Peter Alan Tyler, 

645
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,826
我的父亲
my dad.

646
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,094
世界上最了不起的男人
The most wonderful man in the world.

647
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,235
死于1897年 11月7日
Died 7th November, 1987.

648
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:33,747
{\a6}神秘博士
下集预告

649
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,846
那我们为什么追它
And why are we chasing it?

650
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,297
这是紫色的 很危险
It's mauve and dangerous,

651
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:36,882
而且是30秒前从伦敦市中心发射的
and about 30 seconds from the centre of London.

652
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,387
Rose
Rose!

653
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,432
请让我进去 妈咪
Please let me in, Mummy.

654
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,058
千万别让他碰你
You mustn't let him touch you.

655
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,694
- 你是个医生吗   - 也算在行
- Are you a doctor? - I have my moments.

656
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,862
他们的伤都是一样的
They've all got the same injuries.

657
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,065
连手背上的伤疤都是一样的
Right down to the scar on the back of the hand.

658
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,769
物理性损伤 如同瘟疫
Physical injuries as plague.

659
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,775
- 你好   - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

660
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,144
在阳台喝一杯怎么样
Shall we have a drink on the balcony?

661
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,565
我喜欢把自己当成罪犯   
I like to think of myself as a criminal. 

662
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:04,214
我猜也是
I bet you do.
