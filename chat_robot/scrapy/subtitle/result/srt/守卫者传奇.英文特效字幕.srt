00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My talons are upon you!

00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:38,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your days of terrorizing the owl kingdoms are over!

5
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not so fast! You're no match for my army of Evil Ones.

6
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:43,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha, ha! Well, perhaps.

7
00:01:44,023 --> 00:01:46,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But I am Lyze of Kiel. - Soren, but...

8
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have assembled my own army, the Guardians of Ga'Hoole!

00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Soren...

10
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we've sworn an oath to make strong the weak,

11
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mend the broken, and vanquish evil!

12
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine, what is it?

13
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:03,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, this time you said I would be Lyze of Kiel.

14
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. Look, next go, all right?

15
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I hope you're not lying...

16
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to Metal Beak! Rawr!

17
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:13,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got you! Ow!

18
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. My beak. Da.

19
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Enough, young owlets. Time for bed.

20
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:22,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, please. Enough stories about the Guardians.

21
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.

22
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We learn from them.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even after the 700th time we hear them?

24
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, even then. Unless, son,

25
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you already know all there is of our history.

26
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know the Guardians win.

27
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Soren, it's just a story. - It is not!

28
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go again.

29
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Da, have you ever seen a Guardian?

30
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, just because you

31
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can't see something doesn't mean it isn't real.

32
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:49,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like feeling something with your gizzard.

33
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, through our gizzards...

34
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the voices of the ages whisper to us

35
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tell us what's right.

36
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's enough for one night, dear.

37
00:02:57,863 --> 00:03:00,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow's a big day. It's first branching.

38
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now, off to bed. - Now, come along, children.

39
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've made the moss and down,

40
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}extra soft for you, Eglantine.

41
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:10,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, do you really think Metal Beak is real?

42
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember, it was the Battle of the Ice Claws.

43
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:19,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Guardians were outnumbered. Things looked dark.

44
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then Lyze of Kiel...

45
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:25,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}struck down the leader of the evil owls.

46
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Guardians were victorious.

47
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The owl kingdoms were free once more.

48
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:37,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then they returned home, to the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole.

49
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

50
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But some say the evil king still lives...

51
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:46,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and wears a metal mask to hide his missing beak.

52
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:49,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! You're gonna give her daymares.

53
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is my favorite part.

54
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. We've heard it a thousand times.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a soft head, Soren.

56
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:59,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Da has filled it with stories and dreams.

57
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing wrong with dreams.

58
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:03,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the difference between us, brother.

59
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:04,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have mine when I'm asleep.

60
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:06,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now would you just go to sleep?

61
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren...

62
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da says our dreams are who we are.

63
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:32,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So as I was... Kludd, wait! - No!

64
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Da!

65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna be the best flier.

66
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because Tytos are best at everything.

67
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Da?

68
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have strength, Kludd.

69
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:45,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But owls make the best hunters for one reason alone.

70
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. Their silent flight.

71
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the time I have my claws out...

72
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mice will have run away.

73
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you and your hatchlings will go hungry.

74
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:53,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da!

75
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ready.

76
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heh-heh-heh. Young Guardian...

77
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:57,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think your first

78
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}branching lesson will be that dangerous.

79
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:02,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, don't worry how much noise you make in the beginning.

80
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just need to stretch your...

81
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:06,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wings.

82
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done.

83
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beginner's luck.

84
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Kludd, it helps when I picture where I'm gonna land.

85
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, I'll race you!

86
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:26,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Go!

87
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ha, ha! Ha! - Yeah, you had a head start.

88
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, I didn't! - Yeah, you did. Da, he cheated.

89
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys. No more fighting.

90
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get the boys inside. It's time to go.

91
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we come with you on the hunt?

92
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:40,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not tonight. But when the time comes,

93
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at least you'll have the helmet for it.

94
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:45,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice helmet. - Get off!

95
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:46,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys.

96
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it again. Say it again.

97
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Noctus, I know Soren's a bit of a dreamer.

98
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you worry for him?

99
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:57,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I worry for both of them.

100
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems like yesterday they were hatchlings...

101
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now, well, you know,

102
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'll soon be grown and leaving the hollow.

103
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want them to be prepared.

104
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm. They'll be fine.

105
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:11,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

106
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine, are you all right?

107
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:33,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's all right, dear.

108
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:36,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it wants to come out, let it.

109
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, dear. That's it. Keep going.

110
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

111
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There you go. - Eg, that is gross!

112
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite an achievement.

113
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is it? - It's your first pellet.

114
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:52,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First? You mean there'll be more?

115
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you recognize it, Eg?

116
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the mouse you ate.

117
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Its fur and bones, anyway.

118
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every owl yarps up pellets.

119
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:05,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.

120
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no. - Maybe you'd like to see them?

121
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:10,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. Oh, Mrs. P, not again. Please. - Oh, come on, dear.

122
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Such a big night for this tree.

123
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:15,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First branching, first pellet.

124
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

125
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:19,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, do you want to go out and try some more branching?

126
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? So you can go out there and show off again?

127
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

128
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:25,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, maybe you're right.

129
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should just...

130
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know,

131
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stay inside and play Battle of the Ice Claws again.

132
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd? Could I just show you how?

133
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without you being so angry?

134
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Show me how.

135
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, before I leap...

136
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I picture myself standing on

137
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a great cliff with the Guardians, ready for battle.

138
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:53,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We leap down, floating silently like Lyze of Kiel.

139
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The air's just carrying us as we... - That's enough!

140
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, are you okay?

141
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:14,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

142
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on the ground.

143
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't be here. It's... It's...

144
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:22,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the worst place for an owl.

145
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. No, no. It's weird down here.

146
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We gotta get back. We can't be here.

147
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:32,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, if we could just make it to that branch.

148
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we could climb our way up.

149
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, here, let's see.

150
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh! Quiet!

151
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:51,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

152
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren!

153
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd!

154
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:16,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd! Kludd!

155
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you taking us?

156
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:40,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But our home's that way.

157
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:44,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do this!

158
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:48,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your mouth shut, or I'll shut it for you.

159
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd you think, Jutt?

160
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The "I'll shut it for you" Part?

161
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not that. My evil stare. Been working on it for weeks.

162
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. I missed it. Let's see.

163
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Impressive.

164
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You like it? - Yeah.

165
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:02,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, your evil stare

166
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}reminds me a little of my "Intimidator. "

167
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:06,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? I raise one eyebrow...

168
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tuck in my chin and...

169
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who are you? - Hey! No questions.

170
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No "Whos," No "Whats," No "Whys. "

171
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see soon enough.

172
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think? Did that evil stare seem forced or natural?

173
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Completely natural. - Oh, thanks.

174
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:22,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go!

175
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd!

176
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Strong beak, that one. - Yeah?

177
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they'll put that to good use.

178
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:41,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Jatt, if I use your evil stare...

179
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:43,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and combine it with my raised-eyebrow look...

180
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:44,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get this.

181
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you call that? - "The Predator. "

182
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The Predator"? It's a bit silly, don't you think?

183
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jatt, look. It's Grimble.

184
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect. Hit him with the new look.

185
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With or without raised eyebrow?

186
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:22,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With raised eyebrow. With raised eyebrow.

187
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greetings, Grimble.

188
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:29,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jutt, Jatt, so nice to see you both.

189
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you only get half an owl tonight, Grimble?

190
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Jatt. It's an elf owl.

191
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're very small, but hard workers.

192
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too old to carry a full-size one?

193
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, hilarious.

194
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there something wrong with your face, Jutt?

195
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? No!

196
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You've upset him now. - It's a new look!

197
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you gotta work on your comebacks.

198
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Soren.

199
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Gylfie.

200
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said you were an elf owl.

201
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From Kuneer. That's in the desert.

202
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:01,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you a Tyto?

203
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:02,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, from Tyto Forest.

204
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:04,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are these owls?

205
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any idea where they're taking us?

206
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Stop talking.

207
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet! Listen to the old man!

208
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd!

209
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Settle down. Silence!

210
00:12:58,797 --> 00:12:59,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd! Silence!

211
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parents and families have abandoned you.

212
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So from now, you'll be classified as orphans.

213
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not an orphan.

214
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Horribly tragic, I know.

215
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:12,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But by the mercy of Glaux...

216
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:16,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've been rescued and brought here to St. Aegolius.

217
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:17,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, in time, you'll come

218
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to be grateful for the kindness shown to you.

219
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll repay that kindness with labor.

220
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of you will be pickers.

221
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't want to be a picker!

222
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Some will be soldiers. - Gylfie, stay with me.

223
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:33,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In your ways, all will serve the High Tyto and the Pure Ones.

224
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let us go! - Silence.

225
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want to serve the Pure Ones.

226
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who are the Pure Ones? - Silence!

227
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am Nyra, Ablah General of St. Aegolius...

228
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and mate to the Lord High Tyto.

229
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know right now you miss your families...

230
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but soon enough you will understand

231
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:14,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Pure Ones are your new family.

232
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:17,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pure Ones are not our family. Let us go!

233
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's right. Let us go!

234
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:24,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

235
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:30,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tyto, don't waste your time. Don't soil your feathers.

236
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:32,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You leave her be.

237
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:36,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, spirited little Tyto. How touching.

238
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:39,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your patch of felt will stay together, then.

239
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As pickers.

240
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:44,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go. Hurry up.

241
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:47,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps when you remember your nobility, Tyto,

242
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we can make a soldier of you.

243
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - What about my brother?

244
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:54,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh? Where's he? - Kludd!

245
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:00,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owlet, that one says you're his brother.

246
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:02,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to join him?

247
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:09,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't think so.

248
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:10,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd?

249
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go. Move along. Move it along.

250
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:15,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kludd! - Now, there's a soldier.

251
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

252
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, you know, you don't have to be here with me.

253
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be with your brother.

254
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Gylfie. I could never be with those Tytos.

255
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why Kludd would even think...

256
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:44,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! What's wrong with him?

257
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He looks like he's been moon...

258
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you owlets, move it in, move it in. Come on!

259
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do exactly as he says or you'll never see the light of dawn.

260
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:54,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice one, Jutt. - Felt a little forced.

261
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:57,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It was awesome. - Thank you, Jatt.

262
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tonight, we want you to...

263
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was it again, Jatt? - To rest.

264
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To rest.

265
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So lean back, put your beaks up...

266
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:18,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon.

267
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And sleep.

268
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, we mustn't fall asleep.

269
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:27,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they're trying to moon blink us.

270
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Moon blink us?

271
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:30,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes in the desert,

272
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}owls would get exhausted and collapse under it.

273
00:16:33,945 --> 00:16:36,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they woke up, they just weren't the same.

274
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As if they'd forgotten who they were.

275
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:46,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gylfie, we are going to get out of here.

276
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know these stars.

277
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could get us away from here...

278
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:56,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the only way out is to fly and we can't.

279
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:57,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet, we can't.

280
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we're gonna learn how.

281
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whenever they're not watching...

282
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:05,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every chance we get, we're gonna stretch out our wings...

283
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:18,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really think that we can make it, Soren?

284
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Together, Gylfie, we'll get away.

285
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm cold.

286
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Together.

287
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:46,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, my lovely little owlets. That's enough beauty rest.

288
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine. It's another glorious day...

289
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Soren.

290
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Here we go. Move it along.

291
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:54,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren.

292
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going now?

293
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gylfie, we need to act moon blinked.

294
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep moving. Lots of pellet picking ahead.

295
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may have noticed that we don't like dawdling.

296
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:07,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything with w's in it, we don't trust.

297
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Shuffle those talons.

298
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:15,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sooner you get there, the sooner we start.

299
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sooner you start, the sooner we finish. Let's go!

300
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep moving, no dawdling.

301
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And welcome to the Pelletorium.

302
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:26,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a great place for the rest of your lives.

303
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:29,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mustn't feel sorry for them down there.

304
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As lower species,

305
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:34,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they are fortunate to serve a higher cause.

306
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:38,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As Tyto owls, they're natural superiors...

307
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you too are part of that plan.

308
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:45,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One that will soon bring order to all the owl kingdoms...

309
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the Pure Ones will rule.

310
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:52,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A new and noble era will dawn.

311
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, prove your greatness...

312
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and rise.

313
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:00,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Higher!

314
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Higher!

315
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get this party started!

316
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:14,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get picking!

317
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start picking up those pellets right now.

318
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Think of the joy. Pellets.

319
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:20,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We love them.

320
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Other owls' pellets.

321
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:23,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, maybe it would

322
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:25,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have been better if we had been moon blinked.

323
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, here we go. Eureka.

324
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great job, number 857... whatever.

325
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:33,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, everyone, gather around.

326
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you with the blank expression.

327
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all of them.

328
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:39,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Pay attention. He's talking.

329
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this is the kind of pellet you're picking for.

330
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mouse fur, mouse bones, that's all standard.

331
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the secret rare ingredient in this one is

332
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what Mr. Mouse ate:

333
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- a metal fleck. - Metal fleck.

334
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'm very perceptive.

335
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He is. - I am.

336
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And I'm detecting you... - Nicely done.

337
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:00,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...want to volunteer to

338
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:03,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}take this fleck to where all the flecks belong.

339
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,448
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're, all watching?

340
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

341
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren.

342
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:57,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha, ha. All right, more baskets to fill.

343
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:59,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back to work.

344
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened?

345
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:06,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Gylfie, those birds are doing something terribly wrong.

346
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to find Kludd and we have to get out of here.

347
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And exactly what do you two think you're doing?

348
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we have amassed enough flecks...

349
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we will set a trap.

350
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:31,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it is up to you to lure our enemy to their rightful place:

351
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into our claws.

352
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:40,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then the western Kingdoms and the Tree, those will be mine.

353
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have my word.

354
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you plan on doing with us?

355
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet!

356
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is this place? - Get inside.

357
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop asking questions.

358
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the Pure Ones won't be too happy

359
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you don't let us get to the Pelletorium.

360
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

361
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:37,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they won't be too happy when they find out

362
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:38,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what I'm gonna do to you either.

363
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna teach you to fly.

364
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly?

365
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can breathe now.

366
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's been getting worse here.

367
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,895
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told myself if any came who were smart,

368
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and brave enough to resist...

369
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'd help them.

370
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you two'll have to do.

371
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But aren't you a?

372
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Pure One? No, I hate them.

373
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:11,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost as much as I hate what they've turned me into.

374
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:16,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My feathers weren't always stained with these colors.

375
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:22,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the Pure Ones invaded our kingdom, I fought back.

376
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:25,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, they thought they could use that...

377
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so they took my family.

378
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they promised me if I followed orders,

379
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no harm would come to them.

380
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've been doing their dirty work ever since.

381
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:49,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, have you flown at all before?

382
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:50,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I have been branching.

383
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:52,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have the luxury of

384
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}gliding down from a nest anymore.

385
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to work on your power skills,

386
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}starting with what you already know.

387
00:23:58,422 --> 00:23:59,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me what you can do.

388
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:02,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

389
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, good, good.

390
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:16,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, try and feel every muscle,

391
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:17,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every feather in each stroke.

392
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And push!

393
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:30,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, you two, that's enough. Come on.

394
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back to practice.

395
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:36,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the best of you...

396
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the fittest and the most brilliant...

397
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I will present to the Lord High Tyto.

398
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:45,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's see how much you've improved...

399
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:48,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...as fliers, as fighters.

400
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:52,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well?

401
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done. You've shown

402
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}exceptional obedience and discipline.

403
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:55,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband will be most pleased by your progress.

404
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me, does your brother

405
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have similar potential as a flier?

406
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who, Soren?

407
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:03,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He fell out of the

408
00:26:03,717 --> 00:26:07,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tree when he was still a hatchling. He's lame.

409
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, soldier, you mustn't confuse praise for license.

410
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:15,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never lie to me.

411
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the Lord High Tyto,

412
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:20,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we need as many strong fliers as we can find.

413
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:24,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, let's tell your brother what rewards there are...

414
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for those who recognize their true family.

415
00:26:28,705 --> 00:26:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, more flap, deeper flap.

416
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The still air has no shape to use.

417
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta compensate with your downstroke.

418
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make your wing tips almost meet,

419
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:40,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you can, without stalling.

420
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't curl my feathers enough,

421
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grimble. My wings are too short.

422
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:48,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they said Lyze of Kiel's wings were short.

423
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:49,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that didn't stop him.

424
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:54,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're gonna need to fly a long way to get to the Guardians.

425
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:57,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Guardians of Ga'Hoole? - Yeah.

426
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how will we know where to go?

427
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:02,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you have to get to the Sea of Hoolemere...

428
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...yeah, where the Tree is shrouded in ancient mists...

429
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Which keep it hidden from all

430
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the strong of purpose and the true of heart. "

431
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, exactly.

432
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:14,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd come with you...

433
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:18,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I still hold out the hope of freeing my family.

434
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

435
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kludd. - Go!

436
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:24,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, come with us!

437
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:26,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, now!

438
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get them!

439
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd!

440
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your little owlets won't get away.

441
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:51,877
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren! What do we do?

442
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, we have to go!

443
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:04,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Kludd! Come on! Now's our chance!

444
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what are you waiting for, son?

445
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your chance to go home!

446
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am.

447
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:14,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am home.

448
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

449
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:24,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you wound your queen, Grimble?

450
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not my queen!

451
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:31,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to jump now, Soren!

452
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:36,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

453
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:42,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Gylfie! Flap!

454
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flap your wings!

455
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Follow the owlets!

456
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow the owlets!

457
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, you fools!

458
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go! Go tell the Guardians!

459
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:44,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! There! I see a way!

460
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where?

461
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:49,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gylfie, come on, follow me!

462
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:16,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster, Gylfie. Come on! Faster!

463
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:20,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't, Soren, I just can't.

464
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to rest.

465
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:24,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Gylfie. Come on, we have to!

466
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait. I think they're gone.

467
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Are you sure?

468
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think so.

469
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you know what?

470
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:50,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

471
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're flying.

472
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it feel the way you thought it would?

473
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:08,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

474
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It feels much better.

475
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we gonna do now, Soren?

476
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

477
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grimble's death was unfortunate.

478
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you...

479
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:36,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had a chance to follow your brother, yet you didn't.

480
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:40,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm starting to think that you might actually deserve to stay.

481
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be one of us.

482
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I want that.

483
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We offer power and purpose.

484
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can you offer us?

485
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can you offer me?

486
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:52,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

487
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have a sister. - Go on.

488
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's young, but she's got spirit...

489
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:03,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and will grow into a strong Tyto.

490
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:05,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you could bring her to me.

491
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:09,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here the young ones are our future.

492
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you hungry?

493
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

494
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch this.

495
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:21,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Oh, nice hunting. You should be really proud of yourself...

496
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:23,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...catching a moth that's already caught.

497
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. You hadn't caught it.

498
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:29,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm! I was very close. One might even say I was this close.

499
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:33,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect.

500
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:36,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An ambush. Well,

501
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you didn't count on this.

502
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:49,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. We didn't mean to take your moth.

503
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It wasn't his moth. - Yes, it was.

504
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:54,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were just looking for a place to hide and rest.

505
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- In which order? - What do you mean?

506
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:58,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you need to hide first or rest first?

507
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What difference does it make?

508
00:33:01,097 --> 00:33:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huge! If you need to hide first,

509
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say you were in big trouble.

510
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if resting was on your mind,

511
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:08,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say your situation wasn't as dire.

512
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:10,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're on our way to the Sea of Hoolemere.

513
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna find the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.

514
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:13,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

515
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two little owlets like you

516
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will never reach the sea.

517
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:21,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are some really scary beasts out that way.

518
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:23,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scary beasts?

519
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the hawks don't make a quick lunch of you,

520
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:26,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then the buzzards will.

521
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if the buzzards don't get you...

522
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:34,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the dingoes wait in the trees and as you fly by they...

523
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our request remains the same, owl.

524
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a place to rest? My friend's hurt.

525
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name's Digger.

526
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:51,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hollow's this way.

527
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:55,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going to the sea, huh?

528
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

529
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what they call owls

530
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who fly towards the sea?

531
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Uh, no. - Lost.

532
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hilarious. I have another one for you.

533
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:08,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you call an owl?

534
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:10,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twilight! We've got company!

535
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put me down this instant! I mean it!

536
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:15,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is highly disrespectful!

537
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:17,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner is served.

538
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:20,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she will not stop talking.

539
00:34:20,677 --> 00:34:21,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. P! It's me, Soren!

540
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren!

541
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it can't be.

542
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:28,579
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day, I've been looking for you and Kludd,

543
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then this.

544
00:34:30,386 --> 00:34:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be snatched up by this monstrosity.

545
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monstro? The audacity!

546
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger, who are these tiny owls

547
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and why are they talking to dinner?

548
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is not "Dinner. "

549
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:45,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, dinner's rather moody, isn't it?

550
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. She is not dinner. She's my nursemaid.

551
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:51,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just hate being driven to hiss.

552
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So unladylike.

553
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Indeed.

554
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. P, these are my new friends.

555
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:57,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Gylfie and Digger.

556
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Twilight, is it?

557
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:01,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charmed to meet you, dinner.

558
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:02,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I mean, Mrs. P.

559
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These two are going to the Sea of Hoolemere...

560
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:06,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to find the Guardians to the great tree.

561
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - What?

562
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:12,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Soren, we need to get you home.

563
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your parents are so worried.

564
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:15,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't understand, Mrs. P.

565
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd and I were kidnapped.

566
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mercy! - He's still held captive.

567
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:20,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to find the Guardians.

568
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're the only ones that can save him.

569
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An adventure afoot!

570
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danger. Intrigue.

571
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:28,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The stuff of songs.

572
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Not the lute.

573
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But such things have no effect on me...

574
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:36,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for I am a poet as much as a warrior.

575
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:39,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you will...

576
00:35:39,255 --> 00:35:42,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though his nursemaid tells him no

577
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boy will not be tamed

578
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:47,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He flies off into danger

579
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:51,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be battered, bruised and maimed

580
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:53,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because it's sung

581
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't make it a song.

582
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That poem just came to me, if you can believe it.

583
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think they can believe it. - It's a gift.

584
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:05,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, well, sounds like we've got a long journey, so...

585
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. P?

586
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you know it's what Da would want.

587
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just why I'm coming with you.

588
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No! Please do not leave us here.

589
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:16,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you're the first new souls

590
00:36:16,756 --> 00:36:17,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we've seen in eight moons.

591
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:21,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I have to hear any more of his ridiculous owl jokes...

592
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? They're a hoot! - They are not.

593
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if I have to hear him play one more quote-unquote "Song"...

594
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm gonna tear my gizzard out!

595
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:29,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you?! If you say so, I mean it...

596
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:30,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get out.

597
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Please don't go!

598
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:37,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you even know the way to the Sea of Hoolemere?

599
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:41,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Twilight knows the way. - Of course I know the way.

600
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:44,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are off to the Sea of Hooladance.

601
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's "Hoolemere. " - Hoolemere.

602
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you know, Mrs. P,

603
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you might be the first snake ever to fly.

604
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think I am.

605
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I quite like it too.

606
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my!

607
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:48,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shove it.

608
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:53,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My lord.

609
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our work at St. Aegolius is very nearly done.

610
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The last of the flecks are on their way.

611
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've brought you an offering with beating hearts.

612
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your new soldiers. Tested and pure.

00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be the judge of that.

615

618
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:24,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is your name?

619
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kludd. - Speak up.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. That's better.

622
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:36,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, weakness is for the lower species...

623
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:39,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never for us.

624
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why, Kludd?

625
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we are Tytos.

626
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I got another one.

627
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Knock, knock. - Please don't respond.

628
00:38:56,886 --> 00:38:58,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who's there? - Don't encourage him.

629
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Owls. - Owls who?

632
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny, because owls whoo.

633
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:06,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Funny. - Absolutely pathetic.

634
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a very complex one, but it's...

635
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:19,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As the night falls, so do we

639
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We fall asleep

640
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:43,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For dreams, they come on high!

641
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are now asleep

642
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:57,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are now asleep

00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think that crow is following us.

644
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I've had my eye on him for a while.

645
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:17,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what an owl says

646
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:17,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he's pecked by a crow?

647
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, Digger, must you?

648
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:21,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ow! - That's right, "Ow"!

651
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twilight! Your lute!

652
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:32,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, let them have it. Good riddance.

653
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, wait. Oh, no! - Oh, yes!

654

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

659
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're too fast.

660
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get you closer. We're going to lock talons!

661
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?  - Trust me! I know what I'm doing!

662
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:04,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but have you done this before?

663
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but I've always wanted to try it!

664
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on!

665
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:15,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. P!

666
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:18,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here! Begone!

667
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Mrs. P. Are you okay?

668
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite a ride.

669
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do that again.

670
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:34,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owl, you surely can fly.

671
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:36,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Twilight.

672
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:39,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, here we are.

673
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Sea of Hoolemere.

674
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just so big.

675
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:57,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it's a right big puddle there.

676
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

677
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:01,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really think the Guardians are out there?

678
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:03,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have to be.

679
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The band!

00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:05,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Finally. - Who's there?

681
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:07,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your arrival 'twas foretold.

682
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:10,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Twas foretold trespassers would land on my shore.

683
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we mean you no harm.

684
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:14,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. 'Twas foretold as well.

685
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We've flown a long way. - Also foretold.

686
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:19,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And we're very tired. - Foretold!

687
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know all.

688
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:23,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, state your desire, owl.

689
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:24,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well... - wait.

690
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you really know all, then how come you don't know that?

691
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! 'Twas foretold there would be one who doubts.

692
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:34,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anyone else having trouble with this?

693
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I kind of am.

694
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:39,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da said, "Guided by the spines of the echidna. "

695
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Wait, you're an echidna!

696
00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:43,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am the echidna.

697
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.

698
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.

699
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He should already know that.

700
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:54,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do, doubter. Go on.

701
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Da said your spines can guide us.

702
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they will.

703
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, to reach the Tree,

704
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:02,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}keep between the whale's Fin and the Eye of Glaux.

705
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never go outside those stars.

706
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, go! All of you.

707

00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:21,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that in time would become a family.

709
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a family needs all of its members to play their parts.

710
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warrior.

711

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The tracker, sturdy and faithful.

714
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:37,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The navigator, who doubts.

715
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The leader, whose gizzard is strong.

716
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And finally, of course, the heart.

717
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:47,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Are you a snake?

718
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I am.

719
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've all come this far, each protecting the other.

720
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So go. Look to the sky, and fly.

721
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:02,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's go.

722
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, when your wings are weak...

723
00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:10,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your spirits done...

724
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you've flown as far as you can...

725
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're halfway there!

726
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:17,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he say?

727
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:20,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're halfway there! - Oh, yeah.

728
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:23,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woo-hoo! This is gonna be a breeze.

729
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:28,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're lost!

730
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:30,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't find my bearings.

731
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:33,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to find the island!

732
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in the mist.

733
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,395
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Tree must be on the other side.

734
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:38,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can feel it in my gizzard!

735
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your gizzard?

736
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone else have any more

737
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:45,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}solid information about how much further it is?

738
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:48,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger, why are you flying like that?

739
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:50,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what? You know how I fly.

740
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:52,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not that!

741
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:54,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger! Your wings!

742
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think...

743
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye.

744
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:01,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Digger. - Digger!

745
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:04,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aah! Digger!

746
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger? Digger.

747
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. No.

748
00:45:44,526 --> 00:45:45,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you fly with me?

749
00:45:46,895 --> 00:45:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are...

750
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are five of us.

751
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. We know.

752
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you see what's happening?

753
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of my way, I can't see.

754
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hear a thing.

755
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:33,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna see!

756
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:37,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm concerned about this fleck material of which they speak.

757
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:38,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could be a weapon.

758
00:47:38,365 --> 00:47:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could be a new shield or armor.

759
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:41,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Having examined them, Your Majesty...

760
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they do show signs of the trials they described.

761
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:46,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It beggars belief to think that

762
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,341
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these brave owlets would fly here by themselves...

763
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to spin a fairy tale.

764
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does my Lord Allomere feel otherwise?

765
00:47:55,824 --> 00:47:58,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boron, Your Majesty, if I understand this correctly...

766
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:01,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Metal Beak is not a myth...

767
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:04,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's building a slave army of moon-blinked owlets...

768
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and is planning to

769
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:09,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}conquer the world with magical pellet debris.

770
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without intending any disrespect...

771
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:14,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and particularly to my little friends,

772
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:16,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who have been through so much...

773
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:21,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}such a story simply stretches plausibility too far.

774
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:27,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that notion strike Ezylryb as amusing?

775
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:28,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What cheek!

776
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:30,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's amusing to me is that you

777
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would cover yourself by besmirching these fliers.

778
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps my good fellow Ezylryb wishes us to race back to war.

779
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no.

780
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:39,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps he'd write a poem

781
00:48:39,482 --> 00:48:41,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about it from his hollow, while the rest of us...

782
00:48:42,104 --> 00:48:45,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, while the rest of us had our talons deformed too.

783
00:48:45,874 --> 00:48:48,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I say caution...

784
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the losses could be so many.

785
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would never counsel rushing blindly into war...

786
00:48:54,316 --> 00:48:56,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but for a cause such as the one the boy described...

787
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:59,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for a violation of peace so blatant, so powerful...

788
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:00,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of course I'd fight!

789
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:02,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What other course to take?

790
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you think I'm a coward,

791
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:06,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I'd simply urge others on,

792
00:49:06,122 --> 00:49:07,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll fight you right now.

793
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:09,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Order. - Boron, you can judge the winner.

794
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mildly, owls. We're trying to seek the truth.

795
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truth?

796
00:49:13,635 --> 00:49:15,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you the truth.

797
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:17,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pure Ones exist.

798
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:18,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've kidnapped me

799
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:21,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and dozens of owlets from our hollows.

800
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to enslave us all and rule our world without pity.

801
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:30,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, the only proof I have are my words.

802
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But words were the only proof

803
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:34,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ever had that you were real.

804
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:36,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And still, I believed.

805
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you would argue with that?

806
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will not argue with it.

807
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:47,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty, my search and rescue chaw is scheduled to leave

808
00:49:47,256 --> 00:49:49,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on a routine survey during the next full moon.

809
00:49:49,638 --> 00:49:51,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - Perhaps we could...

810
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:52,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should leave immediately.

811
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:56,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your best owls with you, Allomere. And be thorough.

812
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, we did it.

813
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

814
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just hope Allomere finds the owlets.

815
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, to be a young owl with a taste for adventure...

816
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}arriving to the Tree for the first time.

817
00:50:24,172 --> 00:50:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done to hold your own in there.

818
00:50:27,142 --> 00:50:29,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some more nice strong gizzards.

819
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:31,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Tree always needs them.

820
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:36,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is one strange owl.

821
00:50:36,818 --> 00:50:39,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he might be missing a few talons.

822
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:41,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a good bath.

823
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gross old owl.

824
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:44,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll want to stay out of his chaw if you ask me.

825
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Chaw? - I'll tell you on the way to dinner.

826
00:50:49,097 --> 00:50:50,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're already late.

827
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

828
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:04,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Matron's instructed me to

829
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:06,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}give you lot a rundown on the way we do things here.

830
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}During your basic training...

831
00:51:08,383 --> 00:51:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wait, wait, wait. Basic training?

832
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:12,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't just become a Guardian overnight.

833
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes years. Years.

834
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:16,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Only our absolute best...

835
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- are chosen to be...  - Wait. Who are you?

836
00:51:18,927 --> 00:51:20,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to keep interrupting me?

837
00:51:22,064 --> 00:51:24,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if, however unlikely, you do have talent...

838
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:26,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll be tapped, or selected,

839
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:28,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for a specialized chaw, or squadron.

840
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:32,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's navigation, healing, search and rescue...

841
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:36,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...blacksmithing, weather interpretation, colliering.

842
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:39,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I expect to be placed in the navigation chaw myself.

843
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:42,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name's Otulissa, by the way.

844
00:51:42,217 --> 00:51:44,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm Soren. Heh.

845
00:51:46,922 --> 00:51:49,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe your friends are in there.

846
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger! Hi!

847
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:04,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the food, Digger?

848
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said "Good," But he

849
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:11,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinks it'll go better with a little music.

850
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - And this looks like a decent crowd.

851
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:18,079
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's actually pretty good, you know.

852
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:21,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I guess. If you like that sort of thing.

853
00:52:24,259 --> 00:52:25,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here at the Great Tree...

854
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:30,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}every owl trains in different skills we call "Chaws. "

855
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll study tracking...

856
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:33,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}navigating, combat.

857
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:35,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe you're a blacksmith.

858
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I come, here I come.

859
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Digger!

860
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:53,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow! Hey! Hold it!

861
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on, hang on. Ow!

862
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire, boy. It's the lifeblood of the Tree.

863
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:46,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing more dangerous. Hm?

864
00:53:48,376 --> 00:53:49,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owls.

865
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:54,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be joking.

866
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Preposterous!

867
00:53:59,588 --> 00:54:01,715
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here! I wasn't ready.

868
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel the air!

869
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me.

870
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My soldiers, my sons...

871
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}many of you have heard of me in late-night whisperings...

872
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:40,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I assure you, I am not a myth.

873
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:42,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am real.

874
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:46,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I stand before you with one simple truth:

875
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:50,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The strong shall rule the weak.

876
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:54,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long ago,

877
00:54:54,065 --> 00:54:58,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was viciously attacked by the coward Lyze of Kiel...

878
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:01,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for defending that truth.

879
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:05,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I wear this mask to conceal my scars.

880
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the metal is strong.

881
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:15,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a symbol of the Pure Ones' strength and resolve.

882
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time to set a fire that will consume the owl kingdoms...

883
00:55:20,268 --> 00:55:23,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and take back what is rightfully ours!

884
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we are Tytos!

885
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are Pure Ones!

886
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:33,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I am Metal Beak!

887
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Metal Beak. Metal Beak.

888
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Metal Beak. Metal Beak.

889
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kludd? - Metal Beak.

890
00:55:39,654 --> 00:55:40,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kludd. - Metal Beak.

891
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:43,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss Ma and Da.

892
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared.

893
00:55:45,226 --> 00:55:47,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be. You're with me now.

894
00:55:47,395 --> 00:55:49,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine, this is our home.

895
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They really appreciate us here.

896
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, please, could we just go find Soren?

897
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey! Forget about Soren.

898
00:55:58,273 --> 00:56:00,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren's weak. We're Tytos.

899
00:56:02,644 --> 00:56:04,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pure Ones.

900
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:08,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, I promise I won't tell anyone what you're doing.

901
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna go home.

902
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:12,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Eg.

903
00:56:12,654 --> 00:56:15,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we could go? When?

904
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:16,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow.

905
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:19,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But first, tonight...

906
00:56:19,694 --> 00:56:21,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just sleep.

907
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:41,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doing some wee-hours reading, eh?

908
00:56:41,182 --> 00:56:43,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's the Battle of the Ice Claws.

909
00:56:43,518 --> 00:56:45,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this is my da's favorite story.

910
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:48,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to tell it to us all the time.

911
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:50,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, your da had good taste in authors.

912
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You enjoying it?

913
00:56:52,894 --> 00:56:56,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, it's not at all like my da told it.

914
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:58,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No? How did he tell it?

915
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Da always made it seem so heroic.

916
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:02,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know? Like a great victory.

917
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:06,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in these chronicles, I mean, the battle just sounds like...

918
00:57:06,274 --> 00:57:07,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like hell?

919
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:12,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, boy. It's almost first light.

920
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:14,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got a big day tomorrow.

921
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:18,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to teach you how to really fly.

922
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:24,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel the gutters! The currents in the rain.

923
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:28,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A scupper!

924
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A swillage!

925
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:31,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baggywrinkles!

926
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Baggywrinkles"?

927
00:57:33,134 --> 00:57:35,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He could have at least given us a vocabulary list.

928
00:57:35,804 --> 00:57:39,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this, this is the way to learn!

929
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes! This is exactly how I want to learn.

930
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:43,369
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a monsoon!

931
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:50,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The air currents warm in different ways, you see...

932
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:53,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from the sky to the ocean.

933
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:54,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't fight them.

934
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to feel them with your gizzards.

935
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:03,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aha! You see that one?

936
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:05,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, see it! It's there.

937
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go for it.

938
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:10,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it! Use your gizzard, boy.

939
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust it!

940
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly inside.

941
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sees it.

942
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:30,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sees it.

943
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:50,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold it. Hold it.

944
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:59,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, careful, look out!

945
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:02,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren!

946
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:13,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Owl, come to my hollow.

947
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:19,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So lean back, put your beaks up...

948
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:23,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and turn your faces to the light of the glorious full moon...

949
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:24,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and sleep.

950
00:59:25,046 --> 00:59:26,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord Allomere, the boy was right.

951
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those owlets, we have to rescue them.

952
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caution. We mustn't rush in blindly.

953
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:33,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know what we're up against.

954
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, see those bats?

955
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:39,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow them. I'll wager

956
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:42,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll discover the full extent of their plan.

957
00:59:53,408 --> 00:59:54,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold!

958
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:07,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take out that one, you get the two down on the platform.

959
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

960
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:40,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know what I did with it.

961
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:41,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what happened.

962
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:48,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what I did. What did I do?

963
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:50,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We flew a great way out here

964
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:52,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was nothing like that.

965
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:54,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got no reason to worry, boy.

966
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:58,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I confess, I guided you into that twister on purpose.

967
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to test your gizzard.

968
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:03,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were exemplary.

969
01:01:04,247 --> 01:01:05,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Exemplary"?

970
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:08,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. I nearly had my wings ripped off.

971
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:10,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, my head said to do one

972
01:01:10,012 --> 01:01:12,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thing while my gizzard was saying to do another.

973
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you trusted your head.

974
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when you failed.

975
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:21,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Is that your mark?

976
01:01:21,464 --> 01:01:23,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, this? Yes.

977
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:27,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you wrote the Chronicle of the Battle of the Ice Claws.

978
01:01:28,037 --> 01:01:29,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think so.

979
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:31,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, actually, yes. I did.

980
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:34,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Were you there? - Yes.

981
01:01:35,912 --> 01:01:37,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, as a scribe?

982
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... well, no. As a soldier.

983
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:44,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As the, I guess you could say, leader of all the soldiers.

984
01:01:45,655 --> 01:01:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're Lyze of Kiel.

985
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:51,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... Yes.

986
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're Lyze of Kiel.

987
01:01:54,364 --> 01:01:55,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Don't wear it out.

988
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:57,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But...

989
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That old thing?

990
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:03,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's only good for gathering coals now.

991
01:02:03,673 --> 01:02:06,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but why go by Ezylryb?

992
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the owls of the Tree know who I am.

993
01:02:08,678 --> 01:02:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're...

994
01:02:09,946 --> 01:02:12,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My days as Lyze are well behind me.

995
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:15,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that battle is a distant memory.

996
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:18,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except, funnily enough, for young owlets like you.

997
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you tell me?

998
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:24,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What difference does it make what I call myself?

999
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:26,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because Lyze of Kiel was my hero.

1000
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:29,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, well, fancy it must be hard meeting your hero...

1001
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:32,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and seeing that he's real and not a myth.

1002
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:34,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just not...

1003
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:35,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you expect?

1004
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:37,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some Tyto alba with gleaming armor

1005
01:02:37,997 --> 01:02:41,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and battle claws, the moon rising behind him?

1006
01:02:42,945 --> 01:02:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is what it looks like

1007
01:02:44,231 --> 01:02:46,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you've actually fought in battle.

1008
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:48,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not glorious, it's not beautiful.

1009
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:49,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's not even heroic.

1010
01:02:50,019 --> 01:02:51,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's merely doing what's right.

1011
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:53,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And doing it again and again,

1012
01:02:53,794 --> 01:02:56,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even if someday, you look like this.

1013
01:02:57,994 --> 01:02:59,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's wrong.

1014
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downed owlets, downed owlets!

1015
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:12,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come fast! Allomere is back!

1016
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:13,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Quickly. - Make way.

1017
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:15,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some help here.

1018
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These owlets need attention.

1019
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fetch it, quick.

1020
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:24,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mommy? - It's okay.

1021
01:03:25,154 --> 01:03:26,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Hey. What happened?

1022
01:03:27,023 --> 01:03:29,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord Allomere rescued two owlets in the Beaks.

1023
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:32,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like he's hurt.

1024
01:03:33,262 --> 01:03:36,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he ran into some of your Pure Ones.

1025
01:03:36,365 --> 01:03:39,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I didn't really believe you before.

1026
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:41,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, that's okay. You know,

1027
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:43,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't have believed me either.

1028
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:48,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren! Soren, come fast, it's Eglantine.

1029
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:50,745
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine?

1030
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me through! Let me pass!

1031
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:54,541
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Been moon blinked.

1032
01:03:58,554 --> 01:03:59,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1033
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:03,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think you can help her?

1034
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will do our best, Soren.

1035
01:04:08,698 --> 01:04:10,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine.

1036
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:14,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine.

1037
01:04:15,705 --> 01:04:18,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The battle was ferocious. We were greatly outnumbered.

1038
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:22,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was only lightly wounded, thank Glaux.

1039
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:22,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the others...

1040
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:27,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you estimate the number of enslaved owlets, Allomere?

1041
01:04:28,384 --> 01:04:32,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scores, that I witnessed. There may well be many more.

1042
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:35,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you believe this is part of a larger plan.

1043
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:37,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is certain.

1044
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:42,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty, this is no time for half measures.

1045
01:04:45,268 --> 01:04:48,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bubo, sharpen the battle claws.

1046
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:52,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To arms.

1047
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:55,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To arms.

1048
01:05:09,158 --> 01:05:10,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a bad fit.

1049
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ezylryb! Lyze.

1050
01:05:13,062 --> 01:05:14,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes to both.

1051
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:15,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I have to go.

1052
01:05:16,065 --> 01:05:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to take me with you.

1053
01:05:17,934 --> 01:05:19,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, absolutely.

1054
01:05:19,302 --> 01:05:21,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An untrained youth like you

1055
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could last a whole minute in a real battle.

1056
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

1057
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come along. We could use the talon fodder.

1058
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:31,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd love to throw some bodies at the enemy.

1059
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:32,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I'm...

1060
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or you could stay here...

1061
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:37,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tend to your sister...

1062
01:05:37,787 --> 01:05:40,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and do some real good.

1063
01:05:41,157 --> 01:05:42,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what do I know?

1064
01:05:42,726 --> 01:05:44,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just a tired old screech.

1065
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:39,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move.

1066
01:06:53,663 --> 01:06:54,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Eglantine.

1067
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:59,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd trade places with you if I could. I really would.

1068
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:02,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I wish it was me lying there instead of you.

1069
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:04,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Soren.

1070
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:05,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because then you could

1071
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:06,936
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}see this place for yourself, Eg.

1072
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:10,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Da's stories, they're true.

1073
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all true.

1074
01:07:12,381 --> 01:07:15,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the Guardians, and the Ga'Hoole Tree, and...

1075
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:16,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all true!

1076
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:19,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even Lyze of Kiel.

1077
01:07:19,154 --> 01:07:20,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, he's real, Eg.

1078
01:07:21,457 --> 01:07:22,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's real.

1079
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,336
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, you promised.

1080
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eg?

1081
01:07:44,013 --> 01:07:47,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised I could be Lyze on the next go.

1082
01:07:49,352 --> 01:07:51,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, Eglantine. - Oh, Eglantine.

1083
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eglantine.

1084
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:58,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren? Mrs. P?

1085
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're... we're not at home, are we?

1086
01:08:01,263 --> 01:08:03,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're at the Guardian's Tree, Eg.

1087
01:08:03,232 --> 01:08:05,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Look, this is Ga'Hoole.

1088
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:09,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it can't be. Kludd, he's still...

1089
01:08:09,672 --> 01:08:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd was wrong. Da was right.

1090
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:13,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was right all along, Eg.

1091
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:17,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I mean Kludd was there. With me.

1092
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did this to me, Soren.

1093
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:21,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's one of them.

1094
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:23,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He what?

1095
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:25,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, Eg.

1096
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:29,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you must be confused. That can't be.

1097
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:33,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank Glaux Allomere rescued you.

1098
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:35,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't rescued.

1099
01:08:35,464 --> 01:08:38,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd gave me to the owl who brought me here.

1100
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:41,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Eg, no. That's impossible.

1101
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:44,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that would mean that Allomere would have to be a...

1102
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be a traitor.

1103
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:49,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's a trap.

1104
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:35,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allomere!

1105
01:09:35,858 --> 01:09:37,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allomere!

1106
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:49,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll follow the whale's Fin. It's how they would have gone.

1107
01:10:07,223 --> 01:10:08,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see something.

1108
01:10:09,391 --> 01:10:10,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

1109
01:10:13,762 --> 01:10:15,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should check out that smoke.

1110
01:10:22,404 --> 01:10:24,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, look.

1111
01:10:40,289 --> 01:10:41,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Allomere.

1112
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:46,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it different when you see the consequences of your betrayal?

1113
01:10:46,962 --> 01:10:50,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Must it be bats that bleed them? - Of course.

1114
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have no gizzards to be impaired by the power of the flecks.

1115
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, my love?

1116
01:10:56,972 --> 01:11:00,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would be cruel to make them wait any longer.

1117
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finish them.

1118
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:14,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we can't just leave them down there, writhing in pain.

1119
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can we? - No, you don't understand.

1120
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:18,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we were at St. Aggie's,

1121
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:19,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we saw what those things can do.

1122
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:22,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They do something terrible to your gizzard.

1123
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:23,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that right, Soren?

1124
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:25,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren?

1125
01:11:27,403 --> 01:11:29,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, we've got bats inbound.

1126
01:11:29,638 --> 01:11:32,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to worry. I can down a hundred of those bloodsuckers.

1127
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Ooh. How about a thousand?

1128
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we won't find out

1129
01:11:36,106 --> 01:11:38,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sitting on our tail feathers, will we? Come on!

1130
01:11:38,514 --> 01:11:40,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Just wait.

1131
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Of course. - Soren, what is it?

1132
01:11:42,985 --> 01:11:45,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The flames. That's it.

1133
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:47,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I see a way to free the Guardians.

1134
01:11:47,957 --> 01:11:50,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Soren, you can't fly into fire.

1135
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:52,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Gylfie, I need to trust my gizzard.

1136
01:11:52,895 --> 01:11:54,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twilight, can you take care of the bats?

1137
01:11:55,064 --> 01:11:57,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friend, I'll give you as much time as I can.

1138
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:59,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But hurry. And be careful.

1139
01:12:00,603 --> 01:12:01,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1140
01:12:07,176 --> 01:12:10,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twilight, I think if we're going into battle together...

1141
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll have to sing your best battle song ever.

1142
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:15,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - No, I'm serious. I want to hear one.

1143
01:12:15,517 --> 01:12:17,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us your bravest,

1144
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,509
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}most inspiring battle song ever!

1145
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brilliant idea, Digger!

1146
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:24,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Into battle we do fly

1147
01:12:25,027 --> 01:12:26,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's it!

1148
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:29,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No matter if we're going to die

1149
01:12:29,632 --> 01:12:31,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Is that supposed to be inspiring?

1150
01:12:31,634 --> 01:12:33,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! We haven't gotten to the best bit!

1151
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:38,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A nasty, scary death that hurts quite a lot

1152
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:41,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even if our wings are ripped clean off

1153
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:45,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No!

1154
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:48,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told us you'd bring all the Guardians.

1155
01:12:49,118 --> 01:12:51,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they're not Guardians.

1156
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:52,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren.

1157
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:56,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have no chance against the flecks.

1158
01:12:56,659 --> 01:13:01,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, I don't think we can trust you anymore, Allomere.

1159
01:13:01,397 --> 01:13:02,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1160
01:13:02,898 --> 01:13:05,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, you promised me.

1161
01:13:05,634 --> 01:13:08,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised me I would be King of the Tree!

1162
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:13,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should know, Allomere...

1163
01:13:14,076 --> 01:13:17,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is only room for one king.

1164
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:45,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly away!

1165
01:13:51,113 --> 01:13:53,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use your gizzard, boy!

1166
01:13:53,382 --> 01:13:56,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly inside.

1167
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:07,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren!

1168
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:12,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1169
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:45,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Soren.

1170
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:58,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Soren.

1171
01:15:58,974 --> 01:16:00,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was exemplary.

1172
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we're not finished yet, boy.

1173
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:10,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1174
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:12,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you didn't count on this.

1175
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:21,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha, ha! Good job, my friends!

1176
01:16:27,236 --> 01:16:29,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pure Ones, attack!

1177
01:16:30,138 --> 01:16:31,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crush them!

1178
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,331
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before they can recover!

1179
01:16:36,378 --> 01:16:39,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guardians, we must uphold our oath.

1180
01:16:40,148 --> 01:16:41,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To battle!

1181
01:16:43,785 --> 01:16:46,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to stay here with your friends...

1182
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:48,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and guard these owlets.

1183
01:17:33,335 --> 01:17:34,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

1184
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:17,705
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd?

1185
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1186
01:18:23,418 --> 01:18:24,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren!

1187
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd!

1188
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:52,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, brother.

1189
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:12,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the legendary Lyze of Kiel.

1190
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:18,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once again, it's come down to just you and me.

1191
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:24,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now I can take my vengeance for this.

1192
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:28,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should thank me. It appears to be an improvement.

1193
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:16,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your precious Guardians are finished, Soren.

1194
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:19,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pure Ones will triumph...

1195
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:22,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Tytos will take their

1196
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:25,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}rightful place as rulers of the owl kingdoms.

1197
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's gonna be glorious!

1198
01:20:32,914 --> 01:20:33,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Glorious"?

1199
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:36,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the Pure Ones are monsters.

1200
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw what they were doing.

1201
01:20:38,353 --> 01:20:39,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were moon blinking other owls

1202
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:41,516
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and turning them into slaves.

1203
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just weak, Soren.

1204
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:44,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still living in your dreams.

1205
01:20:46,027 --> 01:20:48,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, my dreams are what make me strong, Kludd.

1206
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:51,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They led me to the Guardians.

1207
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:54,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pity there won't be any Guardians left after today.

1208
01:20:57,772 --> 01:20:59,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

1209
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could you join the Pure Ones

1210
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after what they did to us?

1211
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What they did to us"?

1212
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:06,779
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They believe in me like no one else ever has.

1213
01:21:07,549 --> 01:21:10,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Metal Beak says the strong will triumph...

1214
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:13,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the broken are put out of their misery.

1215
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:14,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And honor...

1216
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}honor is just another word for weakness!

1217
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Kludd! I know you don't really think that.

1218
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:23,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you don't know me at all.

1219
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:36,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren! My wing's broken! Help me up!

1220
01:21:39,314 --> 01:21:41,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soren, I'm your brother.

1221
01:22:04,606 --> 01:22:05,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kludd, no!

1222
01:22:17,652 --> 01:22:19,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Metal Beak.

1223
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:46,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be done with it, then.

1224
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1225
01:22:56,358 --> 01:22:59,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not letting you hurt one more soul.

1226
01:22:59,227 --> 01:23:01,821
