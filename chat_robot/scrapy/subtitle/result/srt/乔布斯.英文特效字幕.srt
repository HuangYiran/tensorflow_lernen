{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what happened to you last night? Where'd you go?

41
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to study. I know, I know.

42
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm not dismissing the value of higher education,

43
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just saying it comes at the expense of experience.

44
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The system can only produce the system.

45
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to be a part of that. Neither should you.

46
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I agree with you. It takes balls to drop out like you did.

47
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you should.

48
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't. I mean that... Steven.

49
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might I borrow you for a moment?

50
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you in, see you later. Sure.

52
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about your classes?

53
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a student anymore, Jack.

54
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're here, and you're learning.

55
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure sounds like a student to me.

56
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want me gone...

57
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I want you gone, Steven?

58
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad that you're here.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whether you're paying or not.

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you're always carrying this notebook around.

61
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You obviously fancy yourself as an artist.

62
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you sit in on some design classes?

63
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Well, I like the idea of art, the beauty.

64
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But only in the right context.

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just not as a career. I don't have the necessary talents.

66
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But aren't you interested in electronics? What about engineering?

67
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a growing market for qualified technicians. What about that?

68
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to spend my parents' money

69
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get a degree and become something

70
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as forgettable as an electrician.

71
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, what,

72
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a degree is a waste of time now? So...

73
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For some.

74
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For others it offers validation. Job security.

75
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve... I'll see you around.

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steven.

77
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be continued.

78
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you working on?

79
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing, really. It's homework for calligraphy class.

80
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's beautiful.

81
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the teacher's this monk, or something.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A monk?

83
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Robert Palladino.

84
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's totally inspiring.

85
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's Julie.

86
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you leaving?

87
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I have to go.

88
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want a hit?

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I take a couple?

92
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. For my friends.

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, my friend, and my girlfriend.

94
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,720

95
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a window to the world.

96
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think it's like in space?

97
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's...

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

100
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who has a baby,

101
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then just throws it away like it's nothing?

102
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You talking about your birth parents?

103
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

104
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's bad. Yeah. That's making me really sad. I...

105
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry that my life is ruining your high.

106
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

107
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss you when you're not around.

108

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, Steve.

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

110
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Space. The endless black deep.

111
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was it that that guru used to tell us?

112
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no time to waste.

113
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you hear that?

114
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

115
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he goes again.

116
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calligraphy is the artful and visual expression of communication.

117
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take Garamond, for example.

118
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A typeface specifically designed to make the very act of reading

119
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}more natural.

120
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Computers are inherently designed to make your lives easier.

121
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Theoretically there's no limit to what computers can do.

122
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is not who you were at birth that matters

123
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but what you do with the time you are given.

124
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The moment of your death is fixed.

125
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Life is but a journey to serenity, to its completion.

126
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be as simple as you can be.

127
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be astonished to see how uncomplicated

128
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and happy your life can become.

129
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know what I'm gonna do when I go back home.

130
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about you?

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do when you get back to The Valley?

132
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve?

133
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve? You okay?

134
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no! No. It's still black and white.

135
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People want color.

136
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pong didn't have color. So?

137
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do something better.

138
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't do color.

139
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says who?

140
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you refuse to do anything

141
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that vaguely escapes your comfort zone.

142
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not even my boss.

143
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I damn sure should be.

144
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Jobs!

145
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What're you doing, Steve?

146
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an idiot.

147
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, and half the people around here

148
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't know how to design shit.

149
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People are complaining about your behavior.

150
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? And, yeah. About mine?

151
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your odor.

152
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you showering like we discussed?

153
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm wearing shoes. You asked me

154
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to wear shoes, and I've got them on.

155
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not part of the deal, Steve.

156
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta learn how to work well with other people.

157
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just trying to do it right, Al.

158
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you are.

159
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then let me.

160
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Steve!

161
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're good. You're damn good.

162
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're an asshole.

163
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that...

164
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Let me finish.

165
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you here. I really do.

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's gotta change.

167
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me my own project. What?

168
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me my own project.

169
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll do it on my own.

170
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll make the best damn game you have ever seen.

171
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're serious.

172
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Steve.

173
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need someone to reprogram a troublesome game.

174
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm on a tight deadline.

175
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you can deliver,

176
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll pay you up to $5,000.

177
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$5,000? Mmm-hmm.

178
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

179
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as for your personal issues, I think I may have a solution.

180
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so many circuits.

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

182
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for saving my ass.

183
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. We're friends. That's, that's what friends do.

184
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just can't work for other people.

185
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I need my independence. If that makes any sense.

186
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh.

187
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes perfect sense.

188
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry for ruining your Friday night.

189
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me? This is great.

190
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd do this for free. I really would.

191
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But just out of curiosity, how much are we getting paid?

192
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$700.

193
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some big bucks there.

194
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

195
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is good. Really good.

196
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

197
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Four days. You aren't kidding around.

198
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have to show it to Nolan, but this is, this is good.

199
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woz?

200
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Hi.

201
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woz!

202
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi! Yeah, I'm in the living room.

203
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Good news.

204
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? Let me guess, your bosses liked the video game.

205
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They loved it! Ooh.

206
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$350. Whew! That's not bad.

207
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not bad? It's great.

208
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you working on?

209
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm writing jokes for my dial-a-joke machine.

210
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got some really good funny Polish jokes,

211
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which work because I'm Polish.

212
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang out and tell me what you think of this one.

213
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready? Ready?

214
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is long, and hard, that a Polish bride gets on her wedding night?

215
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A new last name.

216
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's hilarious.

217
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty good, isn't it?

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you call

219
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a beautiful Polish girl? Lucky.

220
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

221
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm?

222
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

223
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That. Now that is gonna be cool.

224
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a computer terminal board I'm working on.

225
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hooks up to the TV for the display.

226
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it like, a kit? What do you mean?

227
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, well...

228
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The code is still buggy,

229
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but in theory it'll display whatever you're working on.

230
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like...

231
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me.

232
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show you. Okay.

233
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

234
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care if HP didn't like it. It matters.

235
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's got potential.

236
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the Sex Pistols have potential. This is the wheel.

237
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the Industrial Revolution.

238
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more decks, no more mainframes.

239
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That changes everything.

240
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty cool, I guess.

241
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Charlene. Hello. Hey.

242
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool. It's profound. How could you not tell me about this before?

243
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I was just working on it for my own.

244
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a hobby.

245
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly. Exactly. For your own. For you.

246
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what you wanted. It's what your gut, your instinct wanted.

247
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your big evolved brain wanted something that didn't exist,

248
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so you just willed it into existence.

249
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's, what do you call the system?

250
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The operating system?

251
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The operating, and it just shows you...

252
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I call it.

253
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's just a real time display of current operations.

254
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can see what you're working on while you're working on it.

255
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Look...

256
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you get this? This is freedom.

257
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is freedom to create, and to do, and to build,

258
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as artists, as individuals. Look, look, look.

259
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But look, you're overreacting.

260
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if you were developing this for freaks like us,

261
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I doubt you are,

262
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody wants to buy a computer. Nobody.

263
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does somebody know what they want

264
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if they've never even seen it?

265
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

266
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to Homebrew.

267
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No... abs...

268
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not presenting anything at Homebrew.

269
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... No.

270
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do people drive so slow? Get out! Move!

271
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you right now, I've been to Homebrew.

272
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand the caliber of people who speak there.

273
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not one of those people.

274
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you this thing is amazing. I'm not...

275
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna be great, Woz.

276
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, could you do me a favor, could you just please

277
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}slow down a little bit so that I feel like

278
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's a chance we might actually get there alive.

279
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to get there first so we can present first.

280
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know if we're gonna do this thing,

281
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we need to come up with a name.

282
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. Something catchy. Something...

283
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinking about it.

284
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...electric.

285
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It needs to feel like... I don't know.

286
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Enterprise Computers?

287
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

288
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Star Trek names.

289
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:24,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Kirk Enterprises? I swear.

290
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will drive this car right off this road. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

291
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will run the car right off the road.

292
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

293
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

294
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just needs to be, like, something that people will relate to, you know?

295
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like, it needs to be something that you see,

296
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're just, like, "Man, I just gotta have it."

297
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple\nApple.

298
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

299
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple. Apple, like the fruit?

300
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fruit of creation. Apple.

301
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's simple but sophisticated.

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It comes before Atari in the phone book, too.

303
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is so much better than Phaser Beam Computers.

304
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's naming it after a fruit.

305
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple. Apple Computer.

306
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, what about Apple Records?

307
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple Records? The Beatles' label, stu...

308
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, they own the word "apple"?

309
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you always hate The Beatles?

310
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I do not hate The Beatles.

311
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you do. You always...

312
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:18,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do not hate The Beatles.

313
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,060


314
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just, they're not Dylan, and you know that.

315
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, and that's a comparison that you always make.

316
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I... 'Cause it's obvious.

317
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't think it's fair.

318
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple. Really? Apple?

319
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, listen. If we come up with something better, we'll change it.

320
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just go with it and see if it sticks.

321
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will display up to 192 memory locations

322
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the monitor simultaneously.

323
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allow me to explain because it's quite fascinating, actually.

324
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The logic board is rather complex, especially compared to some of

325
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the other boards here, including of course,

326
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Altair.

327
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as you can see...

328
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's much smaller, and cheaper to manufacture and build...

329
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which, by using dynamic RAM, I was able...

330
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were able to shrink the size of the board substantially.

331
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, it works with your television?

332
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes, yes, yes!

333
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will work on any television, or video monitor.

334
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All you need is a radio frequency converter

335
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to display the images from your microprocessor

336
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to your set output device.

337
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it'll run BASIC.

338
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will also run BASIC, which I think could be a great...

339
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I guess that wraps it up. Thank you very much for your time.

340
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was terrific. Fuck.

341
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tough crowd.

342
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Frank.

343
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Lutz.

344
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we're here with reduced instruction set computing CPU.

345
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Name is Paul Terrell.

346
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw your presentation.

347
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And?

348
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'd like to talk business.

349
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do for you? Well...

350
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I own a local computer parts store, in Mountainview.

351
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Byte Shop?

352
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You buy computer parts.

353
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,

354
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}soldering equipment, monitors.

355
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, hobbyist types.

356
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like Radio Shack?

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

358
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, why don't you stop by and talk to me some time.

359
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's my card. Give me a call.

360
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

361
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was nice meeting you.

362
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve Jobs.

363
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve Jobs. All right.

364
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was that?

365
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Paul Terrell. Oh.

366
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

367
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what kind of investment are we talking about here?

368
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus, Steve. I said I was interested, not buying.

369
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. But you're also not the only interested party.

370
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? I'm not? No.

371
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not. Hmm.

372
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's interesting.

373
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it sure seemed

374
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that way the other night at Homebrew.

375
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think that's the first stop that we made?

376
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been all over The Valley.

377
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, then you already have a retailer.

378
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got offers.

379
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Paul. My middle name's Paul.

380
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,890


381
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad's name is Paul.

382
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunch of Pauls. I'm...

383
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're kindred spirits here.

384
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're both businessmen that operate from our gut.

385
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my gut tells me to give you this opportunity.

386
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50 units, paid at the time of delivery.

387
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$400 for a hundred units, a third up front.

388
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not negotiating.

389
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we are.

390
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'll pay $450 per machine. $450.

391
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On delivery, nothing up front. I know it's asking a lot, Steve.

392
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's a big payoff if you deliver.

393
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I deliver.

394
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$500 per unit and you've got a deal.

395
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. You got 90 days.

396
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have it in 60.

397
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daniel and I just didn't have room at our place, so...

398
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. I'm glad you asked.

399
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we could...

400
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}move some things around, give it a good cleaning.

401
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could move most of my tools to the shed.

402
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe get you boys a fan when it gets hot.

403
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh.

404
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

405
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's great, Dad.

406
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. It is. This is perfect.

407
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Well, it'll be good to see you building something.

408
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Hey, keep it neat.

409
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inside and out.

410
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Mr. J. Mmm.

411
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a shop.

412
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we do.

413
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it going?

414
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Voila.

415
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gotta be straighter. These have to be more symmetrical.

416
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have 60 days to complete 50 of these,

417
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're worried about the symmetry?

418
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, nobody cares about the look of the board.

419
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I care. Well, that's just great.

420
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we were out of time the minute you made that stupid promise.

421
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

422
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Need help.

423
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woz. Huh?

424
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a problem. Huh?

425
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to figure out what to do with all these employees.

426
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know Bill? Bill.

427
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too long, Woz. How are you?

428
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to see you. How is everyone?

429
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is my friend Daniel Kottke.

430
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. I've heard a lot about you. How're you doing?

431
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kottke? Kottke from India,

432
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of course.

433
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've heard a lot about you, too.

434
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch that.

435
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Chris Espinosa. Kid down the street I was telling you about?

436
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice to meet you, fella. This is gonna be so cool.

437
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I'm so glad that you're excited

438
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about this thing we're doing here.

439
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I talk to you for a second?

440
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

441
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, just please stop. And go over there.

442
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just out of the way, over there.

443
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't afford to pay three people right now.

444
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't afford to pay ourselves, unless we deliver.

445
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't worry about Chris.

446
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just a kid. So he just wants to help.

447
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just a kid.

448
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheese!

449
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Mom.

450
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So embarrassing.

451
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. As promised.

452
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice board.

453
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the rest?

454
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rest? This is all of them.

455
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked for 50 computers.

456
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's keyboards, cases, monitors, and power included.

457
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not just boards.

458
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just boards? Excuse me? Just boards? These are state-of-the-art.

459
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The logic boards alone are... Nobody's making anything like this.

460
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're, what, how dare you! How dare you!

461
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think what my colleague is saying is that...

462
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not seeing the possibilities here.

463
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is indeed one unbelievably kick ass computer.

464
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to the consumer.

465
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then maybe your consumer

466
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should start to learn how to...

467
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How to even work that, don't you think?

468
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, boys.

469
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sold me on a home computer.

470
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a keyboard and monitor.

471
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a board.

472
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'm sure this makes a very capable starter kit,

473
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the everyday person,

474
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the kind of person that's not an engineer,

475
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or in a computer club like you,

476
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're not gonna know what the hell this is.

477
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The average Joe doesn't want to build their own computer.

478
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just want to buy it.

479
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to take it out of the box, plug it in,

480
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and have it work.

481
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

482
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you listening to me?

483
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. These are your boards.

484
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they will sell.

485
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can promise you that.

486
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw our demo at Homebrew.

487
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what it's capable of with the right components,

488
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which, by the way, all of which you sell.

489
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, demo it to the consumer.

490
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And market the components separately.

491
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You show them your keyboards, and your monitors.

492
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll move more inventory that way,

493
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll make a hell of a lot more cash.

494
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got me.

495
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Steve.

496
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll try to sell them.

497
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I don't, I'm not making another order.

498
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. That's fine.

499
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I think that you might be really interested in our second model.

500
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the second model?

501
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

502
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All-in-one.

503
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help you?

504
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

505
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The technician. We talked on the phone.

506
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. It's Rod.

507
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glad you could stop by.

508
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to Apple Computer.

509
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

510
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me this revolutionary piece of shit.

511
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Apple ll.

512
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the first ever all-in-one personal home computer.

513
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you called me because?

514
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need a heat efficient power supply. In the case.

515
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's impossible, but don't mind me.

516
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just, you know, an engineer.

517
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, wattage?

518
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}40 watts. And quiet.

519
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell do you mean, quiet? I mean silent.

520
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no such thing.

521
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These things run hot. They need fans in them.

522
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those bitches ain't quiet.

523
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly why we need you.

524
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To redesign it.

525
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Redesign what?

526
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The power supply. From scratch.

527
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can't have a fan, it can't overheat.

528
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it needs to fit inside a box, this size.

529
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't do that. Please, don't do...

530
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. Do whatever you want.

531
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My rate is $200 a day.

532
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I ever think things aren't working out, I walk.

533
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

534
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we clear?

535
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're clear.

536
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're talking about the future.

537
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're working in a market that doesn't even exist yet.

538
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What Intel has done for the microprocessor,

539
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we are gonna do for the home computer.

540
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you not know what I'm talking about?

541
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, ma'am. But it runs on a TV monitor.

542
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, like a television set. Exactly.

543
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.

544
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a personal computer.

545
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, do you own a typewriter?

546
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Okay, now do you use it? Perfect.

547
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So imagine combining your typewriter with your television set.

548
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

549
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Please, sir, don't, don't hang up.

550
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. We are small right now, but we...

551
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know we're working out of our garage?

552
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who told you that?

553
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahhh!

554
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes.

555
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you for taking the time.

556
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

557
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

558
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

559
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. All I'm asking is that you come visit us.

560
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One meeting and I promise you'll be on board.

561
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Around $50,000 would be my guess.

562
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

563
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did they say?

564
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is the matter with people?

565
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it the call went well.

566
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would say I hope you choke,

567
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that burrito is gonna kill you either way.

568
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on, Steve.

569
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool your jets, man.

570
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse you?

571
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, you know, you're so stressed, you know?

572
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's, like, relax for a change.

573
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a change... Why? Why? So I can be more like you two assholes?

574
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. I'm studying integrated circuit design here, man.

575
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you?

576
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We each do our part.

577
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Then why do I suddenly feel like your part is expendable?

578
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out here smokin' up like we're in India.

579
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, wake up! We're not.

580
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to you?

581
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You used to be... What? I used to be what?

582
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motivated. I am motivated.

583
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Then show me.

584
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a business, Daniel.

585
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't help you if you don't help yourself.

586
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in there making a hundred phone calls.

587
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rod is slaving away.

588
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid always finds something to do,

589
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and God knows Woz pulls his weight.

590
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

591
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's a whole lot of weight.

592
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That really... That kind of hurts my feelings.

593
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa.

594
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this the right...

595
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple Computer?

596
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, this is us. Yeah.

597
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You expecting something else?

598
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something a little less Manson Family.

599
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a startup. Yeah.

600
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Mike Markkula.

601
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Jobs.

602
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. I heard a lot about you.

603
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You spoke to Don Valentine on the phone.

604
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He and I are old colleagues of sorts.

605
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The VC from Atari.

606
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Valentine. He said you called him 150 times.

607
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

608
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He practically begged me to come and look at your outfit here.

609
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Called in a personal favor.

610
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Mark.

611
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

612
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

613
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to Apple Computer.

614
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Yeah, is this...

615
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is everything?

616
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. No.

617
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We're, we're in six stores in the greater area.

618
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be launching the Apple ll in about a month.

619
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a few months. It's close.

620
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, is there some place we can talk?

621
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you are, fellas.

622
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For you.

623
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve's a fruitarian. He will only eat fruit.

624
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, boys. I'll just... I'll leave you to your business.

625
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

626
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Mrs. J.

627
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the best.

628
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. So where were we?

629
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, don't take this the wrong way, but what's your angle?

630
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

631
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What my colleague is trying to say is...

632
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where was your last employment?

633
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Intel.

634
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how much are we talking about here?

635
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, the investment? That's what you came here for.

636
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foreplay is not Steve's strong suit.

637
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't it?

638
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well,

639
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been looking for something to really sink my teeth into.

640
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Steve. I'm willing to take the risk.

641
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, this certainly qualifies.

642
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But risk disguised as promise.

643
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you've shown promise. I've seen it in your eye,

644
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I know that look because I've had it myself.

645
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tells me you're on to something big.

646
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Okay. To the point.

647
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we should start with around 90 grand,

648
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}see where that takes us.

649
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

650
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

651
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$90,000 isn't gonna get it done.

652
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait. Steve, one second.

653
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see anybody else coming in your garage with a checkbook.

654
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no.

655
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ninety grand gets it done for us.

656
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't think it gets it done for you.

657
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll do the $90,000 investment.

658
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At a $300,000 valuation.

659
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I also want you to kick in a $250,000 credit line

660
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with 10% interest to be paid back in full

661
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once we meet net revenue positive.

662
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

663
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I mean is, okay.

664
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

665
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the first thing you need to do

666
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is incorporate, so that you two

667
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as owners can protect your interest.

668
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is, of course, if you'll have me aboard.

669
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very much, Mr. Markkula.

670
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. Mike. Yeah.

671
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How're you doing? Yeah, put her there.

672
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill. Bill?

673
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fernandez. Yeah.

674
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Thanks, Mike. Yeah.

675
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Here's to you, pal.

676
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you even listening to me?

677
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pregnant.

678
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, you have to talk to me.

679
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your responsibility, too.

680
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you dare

681
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}blame this on me.

682
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not. Mmm-mmm.

683
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We both had our moments of...

684
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What the hell are you talking about?

685
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You.

686
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was in India, you were with, you know.

687
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve? Are you crazy? You cannot put this all on me.

688
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't do this to me right now. Not now.

689
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sorry this isn't part of your plan.

690
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry you have a problem.

691
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's not happening to me.

692
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is your... No!

693
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of my house.

694
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Now!

695
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

696
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Is everything okay out here?

697
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steven, he's kicking me out.

698
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't want anything to do with me.

699
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it's for the best.

700
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't deserve to be treated the way he treats you.

701
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pregnant, Daniel.

702
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You're...

703
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says it's not his, but I would never...

704
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I do wrong?

705
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't do anything wrong.

706
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Steve.

707
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just him.

708
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He changed.

709
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hook them right to your television.

710
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is, yeah.

711
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think, J? Ready?

712
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Steve Jobs.

713
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I founded this company,

714
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had one goal in mind.

715
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that was to do what nobody else considered possible.

716
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To put the power and the beauty

717
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the world's most advanced technology

718
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the hands and homes of people just like you and me.

719
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can promise you that after today,

720
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will never look at computers the same way again.

721
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I am proud to introduce to you, and the world,

722
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the future of personal computing.

723
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The revolutionary Apple ll.

724
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta just start over. It has to be intuitive.

725
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precognitive. I mean, I want it to know what you want to do

726
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before you even know you want to do it.

727
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, are we still talking about the command prompts?

728
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill, we're talking about everything. The whole thing.

729
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa. Guys, it's the future.

730
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you right now.

731
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Lisa's gonna do for the next 10 years

732
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what the Apple ll did for the last three.

733
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you that right now.

734
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why people buy an Apple?

735
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do they buy an Apple, not the competitor?

736
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it's got bravado.

737
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's social status.

738
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you know what? It's even more than that.

739
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's social currency.

740
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've raised the bar.

741
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if we want to stay there, we gotta risk everything.

742
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great artists, Dylan, Picasso, Newton,

743
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they risk failure.

744
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if we want to be great, we've gotta risk it, too.

745
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:28,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the command bar?

746
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On everything.

747
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What... And it starts with the little things.

748
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's over 20 different functions

749
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tied to every single variation of the command bar,

750
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which by the way, takes weeks to program.

751
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not doing anything that IBM's not already doing.

752
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I would rather gamble on our vision

753
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than make a me-too product.

754
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to make the small things just unforgettable.

755
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just start with something simple. LisaWrite.

756
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happens if I click on one of these tabs?

757
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get a drop-down menu, and then there's preferences,

758
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and page options.

759
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Exactly.

760
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:09,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, which tab do I click on to get different font styles?

761
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many custom typefaces are there on LisaWrite?

762
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's actually something that I wanted to talk to you about, Steve, is...

763
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been asking for the fonts for months.

764
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But everything we're talking about is conceptual.

765
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sorry, but typeface, it isn't exactly a pressing issue right now.

766
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything is a pressing issue.

767
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we want to make the vision for Lisa a reality,

768
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we gotta put in the hours and make something great.

769
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but we have a hard date on this software,

770
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm sorry, but adding pretty fonts is not gonna change that.

771
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Bill?

772
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't share our enthusiasm,

773
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and care for the vision of this company...

774
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no. I just, I'm not understanding...

775
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out. What?

776
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your shit and get out. What, wait...

777
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're done. What, you...

778
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, are you gonna, you're gonna fire me?

779
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

780
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already fired you!

781
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you still here?

782
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, he was our best programmer in the division.

783
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the best programmer that doesn't care about our vision.

784
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Look, I know it's not my place to say it, but...

785
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then shut the hell up, Bill!

786
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

787
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Jobs,

788
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but your attorney is here for your 8:00.

789
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

790
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to see samples this afternoon.

791
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow we managed to design a word processor that doesn't have fonts.

792
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it can't happen again.

793
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So fix it!

794
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}2:00 to 3:00.

795
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your 10:00 is waiting for you.

796
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Steve, hey.

797
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daniel. Hey.

798
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a second to talk?

799
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we rescheduled.

800
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll only take a second.

801
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what everyone says.

802
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

803
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

804
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:51,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have a lunch,

805
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so, meet me at Good Earth at noon.

806
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Cool. Okay.

807
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you working on these days?

808
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, um...

809
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple ll Plus repairs, mainly.

810
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

811
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to sign this.

812
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It legally preserves your visitation rights.

813
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:20,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want them. Lisa Brennan is not my child.

814
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The courts disagree.

815
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.

816
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the very least, improbable.

817
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You knew going into this

818
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the paternity test could prove that you were the father.

819
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are 24 million people in California.

820
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That test has a five percent margin of error.

821
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's 1.2 million people that could be the father of that child.

822
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's not me.

823
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't need to convince me. But you do need to sign this.

824
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Brennan is entitled to your child support

825
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}regardless of whether you sign it or not.

826
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really want to give up the rights to see your...

827
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To see her child in the future?

828
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have time.

829
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now.

830
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steven, as a father, I implore you to sign this.

831
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Regardless of whether you think Lisa is your daughter or not.

832
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no risk in signing.

833
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only the regret if you don't.

834
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick Rodney Holt, he recently made

835
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an additional preferred purchase

836
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of 106,656 shares at 19 cents a share.

837
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, and to be clear, this new purchase,

838
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it does not affect Mr. Holt's entitlement

839
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to founder stock.

840
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not at all. Steve?

841
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Rod gets his due.

842
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daniel Kottke,

843
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}engineering technician, founding employee. Now, at our last meeting I,

844
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe that we met a consensus

845
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement to founder stock.

846
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in all honesty, to be rewarding Daniel

847
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the same amount of stock as Rod seems

848
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a bit unfair. Doesn't it?

849
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

850
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing?

851
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you think you should

852
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}think about what you're doing, for a second?

853
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have thought about it. Daniel gets nothing.

854
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

855
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's noted.

856
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

857
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any low grade technician could do his job.

858
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been feeding him for years. It's not personal.

859
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't give me that bullshit, Steve. Of course it's personal.

860
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can barely do his job.

861
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we give Daniel preferred stock,

862
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some engineer with 10 times his talent gets nothing.

863
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what happens?

864
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we just draw this line right here, right now, okay?

865
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you, what are you talking about? Management, or...

866
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Management and engineers.

867
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, this means...

868
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what it means, Mike.

869
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

870
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he's... You know what, I don't...

871
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay then. Shall we continue?

872
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can assume that Bill Fernandez,

873
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Randy Wiggington

874
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Chris Espinosa will not

875
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}be receiving

876
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}any Options?

877
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drinking a beer, huh?

878
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow's a big day for you.

879
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For us.

880
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For us.

881
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike told me about what happened with Bill and Dan

882
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Chris. And, Steve...

883
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you do it?

884
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The company outgrew them.

885
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not management. They're not project leads.

886
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my job to be nice to people.

887
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job to make them better.

888
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't deserve it.

889
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then who the hell does?

890
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how this company works?

891
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to know?

892
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be happy to teach you, if you want to know.

893
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why I started this company with you?

894
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why I left the safety of HP for this?

895
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt you do. You never asked.

896
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I left because this was my thing.

897
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you guys thought it was cool.

898
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to be one of the guys.

899
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And of all the guys I knew, you were the coolest.

900
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were smart, quick-witted.

901
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this was my chance to do what I loved.

902
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to do it for fun.

903
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all, that's all I ever wanted.

904
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that's what you wanted, too.

905
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's happened to you, Steve.

906
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm grown up, Woz.

907
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, you're not.

908
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now, turning to big news in business,

909
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple Incorporated is making headlines once again.

910
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On Wall Street the tech titan Apple

911
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}went public this morning, to incredible market interest,

912
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as four point six million shares of its IPO

913
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were sold within an hour of the opening bell.

914
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wall Street executives had forecast the big day

915
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the growing technology company,

916
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but experts now say Apple's day

917
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}exceeded the market's wildest expectations.

918
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the most over...

919
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Here he is!

920
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

921
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you did it.

922
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:50,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's help them move that stock.

923
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, pal.

924
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, thank you.

925
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Business as usual, guys.

926
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's work to be done, people.

927
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. I had some fun ideas.

928
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it for me, Bill. I'll see you when I see you.

929
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get out of here.

930
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call you later.

931
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

932
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Could you please tell Mr. Markkula we're here. Thank you.

933
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

934
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen.

935
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike. Please.

936
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a seat.

937
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something we need to talk about,

938
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I don't think you're gonna like it.

939
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Steve.

940
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's hemorrhaging the company's dollar

941
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on fantasies that simply are not possible with the Lisa computer.

942
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but Steve's been doing the impossible

943
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:17,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ever since this company was in a garage.

944
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike, I love everything Steve represents. You know that.

945
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's like a kid in a candy store, and we've given him the keys.

946
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. But, it's his candy store.

947
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're never gonna see a personal computer

948
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where the keyboard is attached to the machine again.

949
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike, it's a problem.

950
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:39,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bigger problem is that he is ridiculing IBM.

951
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jobs took out a full page ad in The Wall Street Journal

952
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taunting the biggest computer company on the planet.

953
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Congratulations on your first personal computer."

954
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to start a war with IB fucking M!

955
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fully aware of the ad.

956
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then do something about it!

957
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Arthur, you know he's right.

958
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three years ago IBM had no interest in the personal computer

959
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now look at 'em!

960
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They followed us. Think about it.

961
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have, Mike.

962
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sorry, but the Board is unanimous.

963
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve will no longer be involved in Lisa's development. Period.

964
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this, Arthur? Some sort of power play?

965
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For 18 months now you've offered nothing but support.

966
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now you want to try and take Jobs off of his own team?

967
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want any of this, Mike.

968
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:30,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you have to try to look at it

969
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from the shareholder's perspective.

970
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve is great.

971
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's great. Yeah, he's great.

972
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's a time bomb.

973
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's our job to diffuse him.

974
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So take care of it.

975
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a shit what the Board thinks.

976
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the time you're taking. Your perfectionism.

977
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:52,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's, it's, it...

978
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're looking at losses in the millions

979
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before this thing even gets off the ground.

980
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not seeing the big picture.

981
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. The shareholders don't see past their own shadows.

982
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're only concerned about the here and the now.

983
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Board has got blinders on.

984
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they could see you they'd take them off,

985
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:10,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'd see you the way I see you.

986
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way your employees see you.

987
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa is my project.

988
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's mine.

989
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're taking it away from me?

990
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're letting them take it away from me.

991
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit, Steve. You know that's not true.

992
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

993
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are more Apple IIs teaching more subjects

994
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in more schools than any other computer...

995
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:50,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything from alphabet lessons for preschool,

996
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to science programs for graduate school.

997
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So whatever Brian wants to be,

998
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an Apple personal computer

999
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can help him be it.

1000
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The AppleII.

1001
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no telling how far it can take you.

1002
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that doesn't make any sense.

1003
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you haven't seen as much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

1004
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather have a judge give me the works than have to do it myself.

1005
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right here in solitary.

1006
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what?

1007
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:35,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you go right on punishing yourself.

1008
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't get away with it.

1009
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.

1010
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the Pepsi Challenge. Let your taste decide.

1011
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, guys? Okay, now why don't you tell me

1012
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which one you chose. Pepsi Cola.

1013
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Hey, Steve. It's Mike.

1014
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1015
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Um, I think I may have found a project for you.

1016
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's more of an R&D outcast than anything,

1017
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it's actually a project you approved some time back.

1018
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you look into it?

1019
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is the Macintosh team.

1020
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

1021
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Jesus.

1022
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. It's just Steve.

1023
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really good to see you, Steve.

1024
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill Atkinson. It's good to see they got A players over here.

1025
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm. Hey. Get up.

1026
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Steve Jobs.

1027
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your name?

1028
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burr... Burrell Smith.

1029
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burrell Smith.

1030
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sorry for the mess.

1031
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just a bunch of degenerates. So...

1032
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. I like degenerates.

1033
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1034
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's your project lead?

1035
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, Jef Raskin...

1036
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where he is.

1037
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jef Raskin.

1038
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'll deal with that one. I'll be taking over now.

1039
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... Sorry, taking over, like, the entire Macintosh project?

1040
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Awesome.

1041
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's your design team?

1042
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Team? I don't...

1043
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me your current build.

1044
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, obviously ease of use is a big feature here.

1045
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're trying to develop a simpler interface

1046
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's geared towards the real layman end user.

1047
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:31,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, we're kind of struggling with the interface, and, to be frank...

1048
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The results have been...

1049
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. Yeah.

1050
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's it got under the hood?

1051
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Standard kick ass stuff.

1052
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sixty-four K RAM...

1053
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two fifty-six bitmap display, Motorola 6809.

1054
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna run the 68000.

1055
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But dude, that's Lisa's processor.

1056
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's correct. Dude.

1057
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care what the budget is. Give me their processor.

1058
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done.

1059
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Steve.

1060
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you, man?

1061
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chris, it has been a...

1062
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

1063
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're working on the Macintosh? Yeah.

1064
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

1065
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, this is gonna be fun.

1066
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's go back to what you were saying before.

1067
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thing is for the everyman. Right?

1068
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's our end user.

1069
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the school teacher.

1070
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the garbage man.

1071
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the kid.

1072
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's some grandma out in Nebraska. Right?

1073
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we need to make this thing simple.

1074
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gotta work like...

1075
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like an appliance.

1076
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jef.

1077
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve Jobs is here.

1078
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since you weren't around...

1079
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of the project leads were having a meeting with Motorola.

1080
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why exactly are you here?

1081
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here to help build the Macintosh.

1082
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:09,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah. I'm not sure that that's practical for us.

1083
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're actually trying to avoid this project

1084
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}becoming another over bloated disaster.

1085
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Jef.

1086
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got my attention.

1087
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Steve.

1088
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't want to be involved back when we started this thing,

1089
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that was fine by me.

1090
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted you to cut the checks.

1091
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be involved, just don't turn Macintosh

1092
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into a measure of revenge for you.

1093
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone knows about your fallout with Team Lisa.

1094
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So trust me when I say, we're doing fine.

1095
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Jef.

1096
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get a couple things straight.

1097
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't do fine.

1098
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we don't accept things the way that they are,

1099
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we don't stop innovating.

1100
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, your machine lacks power.

1101
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:19,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And your little interface, it needs work.

1102
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm here to help with that.

1103
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'm not trying to take Macintosh away from you.

1104
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you on this team.

1105
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:32,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can either get on board, or you can get the fuck out.

1106
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do. So, let's get to it.

1107
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill, you come with me.

1108
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Where are we going?

1109
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Recruiting.

1110
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1111
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Steve. Hold these for a second.

1112
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Thanks.

1113
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, what's going on? What are you doing?

1114
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve? You're on the Macintosh Team now.

1115
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, Ste... What's a Macintosh?

1116
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy Hertzfeld.

1117
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you good?

1118
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only want good people working on Macintosh,

1119
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm not sure if you're good enough.

1120
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

1121
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill Atkinson says that you're good.

1122
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... Yes. I think I'm pretty good.

1123
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you creative?

1124
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I... I think so.

1125
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

1126
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm tired of saving your ass, kid.

1127
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love saving my ass.

1128
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want my own engineering team.

1129
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can pick them yourself.

1130
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I am done working under the gun

1131
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of your ridiculous deadline bullshit.

1132
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might as well be asking for a date with her.

1133
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want that, too.

1134
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Done.

1135
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Serious, Steve.

1136
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what is this, Steve? Some sort of performance review?

1137
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are things going on the IIE?

1138
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things are great. Really great.

1139
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're bored to death, aren't you?

1140
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Yes I am.

1141
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to come work with me on the Mac Team?

1142
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're trying to recruit me for the Mac Team, aren't you?

1143
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm in.

1144
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta have a problem that you want to solve.

1145
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A wrong that you want to right.

1146
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's gotta be something that you're passionate about,

1147
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:34,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because otherwise you won't have the perseverance to see it through.

1148
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't ever want to hear you tell me that you can't make it faster.

1149
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, millions of people are gonna buy this machine.

1150
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we can't look at the competition

1151
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and say we're gonna do it better.

1152
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to look at the competition and say we're gonna do it differently.

1153
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have an opportunity to build a revolutionary machine.

1154
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in your life you only get to do so many things.

1155
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now we've chosen to do this.

1156
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's make it great.

1157
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's great.

1158
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It's not.

1159
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's insanely great.

1160
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should try to get more memory into it if we can.

1161
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can still hit the timeline.

1162
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a look at it.

1163
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This little Macintosh side project

1164
01:13:57,790 --> 01:13:59,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has gotten out of hand, Steve.

1165
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way beyond the pale.

1166
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First you created a $10,000 monstrosity with Lisa,

1167
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now you've poured millions

1168
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into what was supposed to be a minor diversion.

1169
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've missed multiple ship dates,

1170
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and meanwhile, IBM is just purring along.

1171
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve...

1172
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People don't use computers the way you think they do.

1173
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:22,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we even supposed to market the Macintosh?

1174
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't.

1175
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You give me five candidates for CEO.

1176
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:28,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna let me choose.

1177
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say we choose someone with a marketing background

1178
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to help us sell what's never been sold.

1179
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, while I would like to run my own company,

1180
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike has helped me understand that you don't think I'm ready.

1181
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, because you're not.

1182
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1183
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want John Sculley.

1184
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Sculley?

1185
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}President of Pepsi Cola.

1186
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Pepsi Challenge guy.

1187
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's smart, he's a marketing genius

1188
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed.

1189
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, Sculley is a tough get.

1190
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe the toughest on our list.

1191
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell makes you think you can get him?

1192
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would he ever leave Pepsi?

1193
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:11,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody remembers the world's best soda salesman.

1194
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need somebody I can trust.

1195
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can make a great product.

1196
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you have to convince people

1197
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that what you're selling is greater.

1198
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not selling computers.

1199
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're selling what they can do

1200
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a computer.

1201
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:50,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A tool for the mind.

1202
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that, ladies and gentlemen,

1203
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is limitless.

1204
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because people will never stop believing

1205
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they could get more out of something,

1206
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whether it be their jobs, their marriage, their money,

1207
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}their lives.

1208
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what you have to do with the Mac.

1209
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the belief in the limitless.

1210
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The impossible.

1211
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That no matter what you dream, you can do it.

1212
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Mac will help you get there.

1213
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few months ago, when Steve was visiting me in Manhattan,

1214
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:29,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he asked me a very important question. He said,

1215
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life,

01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:37,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"or come with me, and change the world?"

1217
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,

1218
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I am. Thank you.

1220
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It appears IBM wants it all.

1221
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple is perceived to be the only hope

1222
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:23,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to offer IBM a run for its money.

1223
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1227

01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today we celebrate the first

01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the first time in all history,

1232
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a garden of pure ideology,

01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where each worker may bloom,

01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}secure from the pests.

1235
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our enemies shall talk themselves to death.

1236
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First time in all history.

1237
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shall...

1238
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}prevail.

1239

01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.

1241
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:27,740


1242
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good work.

1243
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some response, huh? I can't believe it.

1244
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a revolution. It's a revolution.

1245
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:12,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The thing's a game changer.

1246
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really outdid yourself, Steve.

1247
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Why don't you give me a call?

1248
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:20,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab some dinner or something. Yeah.

1249
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'd like that.

1250
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Arthur.

1251
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great job up there.

1252
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1253
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, I want you to know that we believe in you.

1254
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you know that.

1255
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Arthur.

1256
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1257
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1258
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What...

1259
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rock. He just...

1260
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Said something, "we believe in you."

1261
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

1262
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the Macintosh.

1263
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we had them run the numbers

1264
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}100 different ways, 100 times over...

1265
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're marking up the Macintosh. Yep.

1266
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we keep it as is,

1267
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll be hemorrhaging money by launch date.

1268
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna price out the consumer.

1269
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we can't take the risk of flattening our profits.

1270
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We can't have it both ways.

1271
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:20,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you insisted on the most expensive hardware.

1272
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Mac was originally much cheaper.

1273
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jef Raskin designed a $1,000 box.

1274
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made it great.

1275
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want the company to remain profitable...

1276
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:30,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose idea was this?

1277
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a group decision.

1278
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose idea was this?

1279
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was mine. Not Michael's,

1280
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not the Board. It was me.

1281
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't do this, John. IBM does this shit.

1282
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve... Not Apple. Not me.

1283
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:58,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, don't make me the villain because

1284
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking out for our company's best interests.

1285
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1286
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some things have to change.

1287
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you keep heading down this path,

1288
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will not be able to protect you.

1289
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got to you.

1290
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They?

1291
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you get this?

1292
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arrived yesterday.

1293
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:59,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pre-beta, obviously, but it's all...

1294
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a blatant rip-off.

1295
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me Bill Gates on the phone.

1296
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me make this perfectly clear, Bill.

1297
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that when I'm finished, you can still see through those

1298
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thick pretentious glasses,

1299
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you psychopathic, unimaginative criminal.

1300
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stole my software, and I can prove it in court.

1301
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:43,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna sue you for every cent that you have ever made.

1302
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I will make it my life's mission to see to it that you never,

1303
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never,

1304
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:53,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ever make another dollar that I don't first take 90 cents.

1305
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can only assume that you are all as irate as I am,

1306
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're simply too dumbfounded to speak.

1307
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Jobs promised us a million units.

1308
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have yet to reach a quarter of that.

1309
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something has to change.

1310
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With two failed projects, overextended R&Ds,

1311
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that Microsoft fiasco,

1312
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're about to experience the first quarterly loss in company history.

1313
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IBM beat us to market by two years

1314
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a better product and better sales.

1315
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Macintosh is not even a toy. It's a joke.

1316
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}IBM has now moved on to mini decks.

1317
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so should we.

1318
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you getting at, Arthur?

1319
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen, I believe it's time to reconsider

1320
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the viability of the personal computer.

1321
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, anything to say?

1322
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you have me say, Arthur?

1323
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:56,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You raised our price.

1324
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't put that on me.

1325
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The problem is not the price, Steve. It's your product.

1326
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You over-hyped the Mac.

1327
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told people to wait. You sold the future of the Macintosh.

1328
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as a result we lost two years of sales.

1329
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not my fault.

1330
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it sure as shit is somebody's fault.

1331
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not receiving any support.

1332
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're stripping me of my resources,

1333
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and dumping millions into the Apple ll.

1334
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know why we keep dumping millions into the Apple ll?

1335
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it sells.

1336
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 70% of our revenue.

1337
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the Mac doing?

1338
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made my opinion perfectly clear.

1339
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want to keep sucking on the tailpipe of IBM, then I can't stop you.

1340
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I will not take the blame for the failures of some court jester.

1341
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:41,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, this is crazy, Steve...

1342
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no. To whom are you referring, Steve?

1343
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, Arthur.

1344
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell me.

1345
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John, you're awfully quiet.

1346
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'm sorry.

1347
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I'm just at a loss for words.

1348
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Head of marketing. Pepsi genius.

1349
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loss for words.

1350
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's him. Not the Mac.

1351
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the cost of that process...

1352
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$10,000 price tag. That price tag...

1353
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goes against him, and not against Mac.

1354
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's ironic, isn't it?

1355
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You chose Dylan, I chose, I chose The Beatles.

1356
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems so backward now.

1357
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woz.

1358
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1359
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:57,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to see you, too, Steve.

1360
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

1361
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, do you mind if we talk later?

1362
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This'll only take a minute.

1363
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, uh...

1364
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm leaving, Steve.

1365
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1366
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, Steve.

1367
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm leaving Apple.

1368
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For good. Actually, I already did.

1369
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just...

1370
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I should come back and tell you first.

1371
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1372
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We both knew this was coming for some time. I don't even...

1373
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even remember the last time we talked.

1374
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want from me, then?

1375
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not everyone has an agenda, Steve.

1376
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

1377
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I can still remember when we were just kids,

1378
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:02,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}back in your dad's garage.

1379
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we just wanted to

1380
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:08,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}create cool toys for people like us.

1381
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember that?

1382
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1383
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's not about people anymore for you.

1384
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's about the product.

1385
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Worst of all, it's...

1386
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:23,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about yourself.

1387
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the beginning and end of your own world, Steve.

1388
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's so small. So sad.

1389
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's... it's gotta be lonely.

1390
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know you're gonna say

1391
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:48,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the product and the person

1392
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}need to be connected and all that,

1393
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it will never be what you think it will.

1394
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just won't.

1395
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not, not for a long time at least.

1396
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you think is going on, Steve, but I do.

1397
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it doesn't end well for you.

1398
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:14,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm not...

1399
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:18,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sticking around to watch.

1400
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been a journey.

1401
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for the record,

1402
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love what we did.

1403
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. You've reached John Sculley. Please leave a message.

1404
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, John. It's Steve.

1405
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:40,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

1406
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just...

1407
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:50,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're still partners, John, you and I.

1408
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are, we're in this together.

1409
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I, um...

1410
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just give me a call back? That'd be great. Um...

1411
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

1412
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you give me a call back?

1413
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please?

1414
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John, you have to take control now.

1415
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any idea how close our shareholders are to a panic?

1416
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The implications of your inaction?

1417
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget your job, the entire company is at stake here.

1418
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This could ruin everyone.

1419
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, Arthur, but I still think that we can salvage this.

1420
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't salvage anything.

1421
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt...

1422
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1423
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

1424
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John.

1425
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1426
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur.

1427
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing here so early?

1428
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could ask you the same question.

1429
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is good.

1430
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, why don't you join us this time? Have a seat.

1431
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This time?

1432
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, have a seat.

1433
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John?

1434
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur, I don't want to. Yes.

1435
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do. Say it.

1436
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him what you've told me.

1437
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find it increasingly difficult to do my job

1438
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the greatest obstacle in my path

1439
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:04,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}casts a looming shadow over everything I try to do.

1440
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

1441
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve...

1442
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are your own worst enemy.

1443
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this company's.

1444
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This... It's unbelievable.

1445
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are?

1446
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

1447
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hiring you

1448
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was the worst mistake I have ever made.

1449
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, it doesn't have to be this way.

1450
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. That's done.

1451
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:15,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boards don't run companies.

1452
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people who create the product run the company.

1453
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has the nerve to tell me we should have used the 512.

1454
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We told them that it needed a 512.

1455
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We said not to use the 128.

1456
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna get it done when we built it.

1457
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:30,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sculley is leaving for China tonight.

1458
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna be there for a week, so we got time.

1459
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:34,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just gotta recruit.

1460
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, Sculley's gonna find out.

1461
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then what happens, you know?

1462
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the CEO of the company now.

1463
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:40,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, for now.

1464
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we have the people who make Apple.

1465
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, Mike.

1466
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:47,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just getting started.

1467
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, give us a second.

1468
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John's canceled his trip.

1469
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's having an executive staff meeting first thing tomorrow.

1470
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I didn't come to join your revolution. I came to warn you.

1471
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to make absolutely sure

1472
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:18,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're nothing more than a figurehead.

1473
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No power, no title.

1474
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No team.

1475
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember thinking when we first met, um, that you were remarkable.

1476
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanted to do something truly great.

1477
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I did, too.

1478
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still do.

1479
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley. I'm begging you.

1480
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1481
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't win this one.

1482
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose side are you on, Mike?

1483
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because there are sides now.

1484
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're either with me or you're against me.

1485
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you with me, Mike?

1486
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

1487
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1488
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1489
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those in favor of John Sculley.

1490
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:44,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All in favor of Steve Jobs.

1491
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:57,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

1492
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every Board member's vote must be accounted for.

1493
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike?

1494
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sculley.

1495
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I vote for Sculley.

1496
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, now what do we do?

1497
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple's market value has eroded in the past several years,

1498
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which led to the ousting of former chief John Sculley in 1993.

1499
01:39:26,410 --> 01:39:28,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed Woolard, former CEO of DuPont,

1501

1502

1504
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, will you wake up Lisa and see if she wants breakfast?

1505
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa?\nLisa?

1507
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lisa? Come on.

1508
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna sleep all day, huh?

1509
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, go away.

1510
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? I say all day because it's 10:00.

1511
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:45,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laurene made you breakfast.

1512
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not hungry.

1513
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you can't sleep all winter break.

1514
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I can.

1515
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reed! Reed!

1516
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we not run in the garden? Please?

1517
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1518
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:14,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you able to get Lisa up?

1519
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, how can a human being sleep that much?

1520
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She... I don't know if she's coming or not.

1521
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:33,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to the farmer's market today. Just gonna get a few things.

1522
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have any plans? You want to come with me?

1523
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:43,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm?

1524
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:45,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said do you have plans?

1525
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:46,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today?

1526
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:50,850


1527
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:50,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Gil Amelio is gonna stop by.

1528
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're transitioning in some of our software.

1529
01:41:58,770 --> 01:41:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1530
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm just helping them out. They just need a little help.

1531
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy.

1532
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in trouble, aren't I?

1533
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:18,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, what can I do to convince you to come back?

1534
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can you do to convince me

1535
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't be boarding the Titanic, Gil?

1536
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I know how you feel about Apple.

1537
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What NEXT could never be.

1538
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, you know, considering that you now own

1539
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a million and a half shares of Apple,

1540
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that's a tangible investment, too.

1541
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys must be pretty desperate.

1542
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not desperate.

1543
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are things going with the Newton?

1544
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, don't blame me for the failures of the last regime.

1545
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not as bad as you think.

1546
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're overseeing massive layoffs.

1547
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple stock just set another record low.

1548
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're four months from insolvency, Gil.

1549
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say that's pretty bad.

1550
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:07,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yeah. In order to fix what's broken,

1551
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some sacrifices are necessary. All right?

1552
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, what do you need?

1553
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name it.

1554
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Gil.

1555
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1556
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

1557
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nice to see you.

1558
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, I'll show you around.

1559
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Gil, don't worry about it. I'll give him the tour.

1560
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

1561
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure. No problem. Come on.

1562
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's great.

1563
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys go ahead. I'll...

1564
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll catch up.

1565
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something I always wanted you to know, Steve.

1566
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was never my call.

1567
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not do this, Mike.

1568
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this is important. You know, I tried.

1569
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted you here. I always did.

1570
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too bad it took me so long to get you back.

1571
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm not back.

1572
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You will be.

1573
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see about that.

1574
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I'm gonna show myself around.

1575
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take it from here.

1576
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a bitch.

1577
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who did these?

1578
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did, sir.

1579
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

1580
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:40,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jonathan Ive. I'm Director of Industrial Design.

1581
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you still here?

1582
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 11:00 a.m. on a Monday.

1583
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1584
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:52,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you still here at Apple?

1585
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't the company I built.

1586
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no taste, no style.

1587
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No design.

1588
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So unless they're shackling you here,

1589
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why do you stay?

1590
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, sir, I guess I would say there are still

1591
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those of us that believe in what Apple stood for.

1592
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you stood for.

1593
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think I stood for?

1594
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:25,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think...

1595
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:31,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you believe that the computer,

1596
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the Walkman, or whatever it may be,

1597
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should be a natural extension of the individual.

1598
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's that mission,

1599
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that devotion to quality,

1600
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and ideals, and heart...

1601
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what keeps us here.

1602
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That we might do it once more.

1603
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Whatever you're working on,

1604
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the rest of the day I want you to forget it.

1605
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want everyone to design something new.

1606
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care what it is, I don't care if it's technology,

1607
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just create something.

1608
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something useful.

1609
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something you care about.

1610
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:55,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1611
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're glad you're back.

1612
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not back.

1613
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:08,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yet.

1614
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve.

1615
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:30,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh!

1616
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Junk.

1617
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve, you met our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

1618
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve. Hi.

1619
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, um...

1620
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:44,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know all about the bad blood you must taste.

1621
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I understand your hesitation to trust me.

1622
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I just want you to know

1623
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not Arthur Rock.

1624
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm your friend.

1625
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1626
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:01,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, can we take a minute to talk?

1627
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:03,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently.

1628
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today's paper.

1629
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure you've seen the news.

1630
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna have to be more specific.

1631
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:15,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our shares dropped 7.5% overnight.

1632
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the lowest it's been in 10 years.

1633
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last week an unidentified investor

1634
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}dropped one point five million shares.

1635
01:49:25,010 --> 01:49:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put a real scare into the marketplace, Steve.

1636
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One point five million shares? Wow.

1637
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess the stockholders must be getting restless.

1638
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:40,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want you here, Steve.

1639
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here. As a consultant.

1640
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As CEO.

1641
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CEO? Yeah.

1642
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least in the interim.

1643
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Gil?

1644
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, Gil's halfway out the door.

1645
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has to see the writing on the wall.

1646
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:59,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least if he's not too proud to admit it.

1647
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he's going to try to force you out,

1648
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and make a case against you.

1649
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have I seen this before?

1650
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,720


1651
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gil's on the ledge. He doesn't have a play here.

1652
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we need is a little push from you.

1653
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:14,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want to get back what you lost, this is the time.

1654
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never lost it. It was stolen from me.

1655
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no sex left in computers. No curves.

1656
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if computers are for art, and beauty,

1657
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:37,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and global interconnectivity,

1658
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why are they so ugly?

1659
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it should be artful.

1660
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no one cares.

1661
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:48,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world may mistakenly see computers only in black and white,

1662
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we live, and we dream

1663
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:53,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we paint in color.

1664
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:57,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we think the computer should, too.

1665
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

1666
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:15,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jony, I always want you to be honest with me.

1667
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No matter what.

1668
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just be brutally honest.

1669
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Understand?

1670
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Understand.

1671
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

1672
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:36,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, I think the blue,

1673
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's not quite right.

1674
01:51:43,110 --> 01:51:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's a dopey idea. What if we put the speakers inside?

1675
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Steve, Gil Amelio and the board

1676
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are not gonna allow that. No way.

1677
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna ask for permission.

1678
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve's done an admirable job assisting me

1679
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as an advisor during this, this period.

1680
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And while I commend his actions, and his initiatives,

1681
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe it's now in our best interest to move on,

1682
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:18,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and relieve Steve of his advisory role in this company.

1683
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I agree, Gil.

1684
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do?

1685
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do think it's time Steve step out of his current role, yes.

1686
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve?

1687
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:31,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Ed.

1688
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to present the Board my vision for the future of Apple.

1689
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not Microsoft or Dell.

1690
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we need to stop trying to be that.

1691
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to go back to who we are, and what we do best,

1692
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and throw away everything else.

1693
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's how we're gonna do it.

1694
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:57,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna build a new line of computers

1695
01:52:57,390 --> 01:52:59,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the home, and for the office.

1696
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna build a new operating system on the backbone of NEXT.

1697
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next generation of Macintosh.

1698
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:10,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we're gonna kill every other project.

1699
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything.

1700
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:15,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This company will not make shit anymore.

1701
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:19,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're also gonna double down on the advertising budget.

1702
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chiat Day will be the only advertising agency we use.

1703
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like back in the old days.

1704
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In short,

1705
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're gonna make Apple cool again.

1706
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I will not be able to move forward

1707
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:39,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without the Board's permission to operate under complete autonomy.

1708
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be made a full voting member of the Board. And lastly...

1709
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interim CEO.

1710
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:52,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, hold on.

1711
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the CEO, and this is...

1712
01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you put me in this position.

1713
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:05,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom,

1714
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's leaking water.

1715
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's my job to make sure that

1716
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we point the ship in the right direction.

1717
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why don't you let me do my job?

1718
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's put this to a vote.

1719
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those in favor?

1720
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

1721
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed?

1722
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike?

1723
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Gil. Nothing personal.

1724
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you grow up, you tend to get told

1725
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the world is the way that it is,

1726
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your life is just to live your life inside the world

1727
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:59,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and try not to bash into the walls too much.

1728
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's a very limited life.

1729
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Life can be much broader,

1730
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once you discover one simple fact.

1731
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is that everything around you

1732
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you call life

1733
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was made up by people that are no smarter than you.

1734
01:55:16,450 --> 01:55:19,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can change it. You can influence it.

1735
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can build your own things, that other people can use.

1736
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's to shake off this erroneous notion

1737
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that life is just there,

1738
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're just gonna live in it,

1739
01:55:29,790 --> 01:55:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}versus embrace it.

1740
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:34,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Change it. Improve it. Make your mark upon it.

1741
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

1742
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in our cash position...

1743
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. CEO.

1744
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

1745
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanted to talk to me?

1746
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome. Please. Have a seat.

1747
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ed. Hey, Gareth.

1748
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:54,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mike.

1749
01:55:58,780 --> 01:55:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

1750
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an opportunity.

1751
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:06,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't seen Bernard around for a few days.

1752
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Katherine, Delano?

1753
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:12,290


1754
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson made a difficult decision easier

1755
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:15,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by agreeing to step down from the Board.

1756
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

1757
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They both agreed to accept incredibly generous golden parachutes.

1758
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:20,770


1759
01:56:21,390 --> 01:56:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same opportunity is detailed inside that envelope.

1760
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're forcing us out?

1761
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With good reason.

1762
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's that?

1763
01:56:30,190 --> 01:56:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The current arrangement is

1764
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}inhibiting.

1765
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hold everyone's hand while we cross the street, Mike.

1766
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so your next big move is to eradicate your Board?

1767
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you think you can just do that?

1768
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Mike. But it's time.

1769
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the parachute. It's more than fair.

1770
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twenty years.

1771
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:05,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I told myself I'd be out of here

1772
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while I was still in my thirties.

1773
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now look at me. I'm practically an old man.

1774
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen.

1775
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:25,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Mike.

1776
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

1777
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we gonna do now?

1778
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:53,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna put a dent in the universe.

1779
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's to the crazy ones.

1780
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The misfits,

1781
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the rebels,

1782
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the troublemakers,

1783
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the round pegs in the square holes,

1784
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the ones who see things differently.

1785
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not fond of rules,

1786
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they have no respect for the status quo.

1787
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can quote them,

1788
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}disagree with them,

1789
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}glorify or vilify them.

1790
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About the only thing you can't do

1791
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is ignore them.

1792
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they change things.

1793
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They push the human race forward.

1794
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And while some may see them as the crazy ones,

1795
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we see genius.

1796
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the people who are crazy enough

1797
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to think they can change the world

1798
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are the ones who do.

1799
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was that?

1800
