{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Deputy Warden. That will be all.

104
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

105
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a lot to say about you.

106
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McPherson's a good man. He believes in the work we do here.

107
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what would that be, exactly?

108
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}疝 moral fusion between law and order and clinical care.

109
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CHUCK: Pardon me, Doc. A what between what and what?

110
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those paintings are quite accurate.

111
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Used to be the kind of patients we deal with here

112
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}were shackled and left in their own filth.

113
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were beaten,

114
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

115
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We drove screws into their brains,

116
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness

117
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or even drowned.

118
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And now? -We treat them.

119
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to heal, try to cure.

120
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if that fails, at least we provide them

121
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.

122
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are all violent offenders, right?

123
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, they've hurt people.

124
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Murdered them in some cases. -In almost all cases, yes.

125
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, personally, Doctor, I'd have to say,

126
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}screw their sense of calm.

127
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job to treat my patients, not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

128
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So this female prisoner... -Patient.

129
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Patient,

130

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one Rachel Solando, escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

131
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Last night between 10:00 and midnight. -Is she considered dangerous?

132
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could say that. She killed all three of her children.

133
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She drowned them in the lake behind her house.

134
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She took them out one by one, held their heads under till they died,

135
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then she brought them back inside and arranged them around the kitchen table.

136
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She ate a meal there before a neighbor dropped by.

137
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what about the husband?

138
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died on the beaches of Normandy. She's a war widow.

00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She starved herself when she first came here.

140
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She insisted the children weren't dead.

141

00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen to have an aspirin, do you?

143
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Prone to headaches, Marshal? -Sometimes. But today,

144
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm a little more prone to seasickness. -Ah, dehydration.

00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In that case, you're quite right. The simpler the better.

147
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks so much.

148
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rachel still believes the children are alive.

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She also believes this place is her home in the Berkshires.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}acknowledged that she's in an institution.

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To sustain the delusion that her children never died,

00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she's created an elaborate fictional structure,

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she gives us a疝l parts to play in that fiction.

00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So have you searched the grounds yet?

00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The warden and his men scoured the island.

00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's more disturbing is we don't know how she got out of her room.

161
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was locked from the outside, and the only window is barred.

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls.

163
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought her right back here after group therapy, locked her in,

164
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}came back for midnight rounds, she was gone.

165
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible that the truth never gets through to her?

166
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, she's in a mental institution, right?

00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems like something you'd notice from time to time.

00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two pairs.

00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sanity's not a choice, Marshal. You can't just choose to get over it.

00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,116
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, she left here barefoot?

172
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Doc, she couldn't get 10 yards in that terrain.

00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say that's quite close to my clinical conclusion.

00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,909

00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was murder.

607
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

608
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not why I'm here.

609
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:49,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So what is this all about? -(SIGHS)

610
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After Laeddis vanished, I started doing some checking on Ashecliffe.

611
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of people know about this place, but no one wants to talk.

612
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's like it...

613
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like they're scared or something.

614
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this place is funded by a special grant

615
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from The House Un-American Activities Committee?

616
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}HUAC? And how exactly are we fighting the communists

617
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from an island in Boston Harbor?

618
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By conducting experiments on the mind.

619
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least that's my guess.

620
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you think that's going on here?

621
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I said, no one would talk, right?

622
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Till I found somebody who used to be a patient here.

623
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy's name is George Noyce. Nice college kid. Socialist.

624
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gets offered some money to do a psych study.

625
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess what they were testing?

626
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toothpaste.

627
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

628
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:49,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He almost beats his professor to death. Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

629
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They release him after one year, right? And what does he do?

630
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two weeks on the mainland, he walks into a bar, stabs three men to death.

631
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:04,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and he...

632
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He begs the judge for the electric chair. Anywhere but a mental hospital.

633
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

634
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And you found him.疝 -Yeah, I found him.

635
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he's a mess.

636
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's pretty clear from what he tells me.

637
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

638
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're experimenting on people here.

639
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, boss.

640
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How do you believe a crazy guy? -That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

641
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy people, they're the perfect subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

642
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stood at Dachau.

643
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We saw what human beings are capable of doing to each other, right?

644
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For Christ's sakes, we fought a goddamn war to stop them,

645
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:51,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now... Now I find out it may be happening here? On our soil? No.

646
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what are you really here to do, Ted?

647
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get the proof, I'm gonna go back,

648
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.

649
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.

650
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

651
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started asking around about Ashecliffe,

652
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,285
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}waiting for a chance to get out here,

653
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then suddenly they need a U.S. Marshal?

654
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient escape. It was the perfect excuse.

655
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, boss. Luck doesn't work that way.

656
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world doesn't work that way.

657
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,133
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got an electrified fence around a septic facility.

658
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

659
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:33,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS? Funding from HUAC?

660
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about this place stinks of government ops.

661
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What if they wanted you here? -Bullshit.

662
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You were asking questions. -Bullshit! Bullshit!

663
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit. We came here for Rachel Solando.

664
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's one shred of evidence she even existed?

665
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no way they could've known

666
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be assigned to this case. There's no way.

667
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if while you were looking into them, they were looking into you?

668
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All they had to do was fake an escape to get you here, and now they have you.

669
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now they have us both. Here! Now!

670
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McPHERSON: (ON MEGAPHONE) Marshals, are you out here?

671
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

672
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marshals!

673
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about that? They found us, huh?

674
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an island, boss. They're always gonna find us.

675
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're in there.

676
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting off this goddamn island. You and me. Come on.

677
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Come on! -Go, go!

678
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McPHERSON: Get dried off. Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

679
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And hurry up! This thing is turning into a goddamn hurricane!

680
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:54,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dropped those suits off to be cleaned. Should be ready by tomorrow.

681
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is, if we all don't wash away first.

682
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes are pretty疝much done for.

683
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So...

684
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is our only choice, huh?

685
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got something really nice in a prison gray if that don't work for you.

686
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

687
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I must repeat my insistence that all Ward C patients

688
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}be placed in manual restraints.

689
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the facility floods, they'll drown. You know that.

690
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}NAEHRING: That would take a lot of flooding.

691
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAWLEY: We're on an island

692
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the middle of the ocean during a hurricane.

693
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of flooding seems like a distinct possibility.

694
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DOCTOR 1: It's a gamble, Stephen. Say the power fails.

695
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a backup generator.

696
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,555
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if that goes, the cell doors will open.

697
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are they going to go? Mmm?

698
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over to the mainland and wreak havoc.

699
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}NAEHRING: Oh, you're quite right.

700
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're far more likely to wreak havoc right here on us.

701
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

702
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is 24 human beings.

703
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can live with that, can you?

01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After we got that guy to the infirmary, I took a little detour to patient records.

01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever find Laeddis?

01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I never found him.

01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I got the next best thing. His intake form.

01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was the only thing in his files. There's no session notes,

01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no incident reports, no photographs, just this. It was weird.

01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Take a look.

01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll look it over later, that's all.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn. We're too far south. We're gonna have to double back.

01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no way we could cross those rocks.

1047
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There could be a way behind those trees.

01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe a path that goes around the rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Boss... -Come on.

01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's proof there's a 67th patient,

01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:26,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting to that lighthouse. You understand?

1054
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell can I say to you to stop you?

01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

1056
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because climbing down there when it's dark

01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is a thin step short of suicide, that's why.

01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, maybe you better sit this one out then.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People tell the world you're crazy,

1108
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all your protests to the contrary just confirm what they're saying.

1109
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:09,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1110
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:11,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once you're declared insane,

1111
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then anything you do is called part of that insanity.

1112
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:21,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reasonable protests are denial. Valid fears, paranoia.

1113
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:22,741
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Survival instincts are

1114
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}defense mechanisms.

1115
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:29,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're smarter than you look, Marshal. That's probably not a good thing.

1116
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tell me something. -Yeah.

1117
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to you?

1118
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:40,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I started asking about these large shipments of sodium amytal

1119
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and opium-based hallucinogens.

1120
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Psychotropic drugs.

1121
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:47,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I asked about the surgeries, too.

1122
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever heard of a transorbital lobotomy?

1123
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They zap the patient with electroshock,

1124
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1125
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pull out some nerve fibers.

1126
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tractable.

1127
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's barbaric,

1128
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unconscionable.

1129
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:19,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how pain enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1130
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Depends on where you're hurt?

1131
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1132
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The brain controls pain.

1133
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:32,519
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep, hunger, anger. Everything.

1134
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if you could control it?

1135
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You mean the brain? -Recreate a man

1136
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:45,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he doesn't feel pain or love or sympathy.

1137
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A man who can't be interrogated,

1138
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:51,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he has no memories to confess.

1139
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can never take away all a man's memories. Never.

1140
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:01,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marshal, the North Koreans used American POWs

1141
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}during their brainwashing experiments.

1142
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:06,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They turned soldiers into traitors. That's what they're doing here.

1143
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're creating ghosts to go out in the world

1144
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:12,434
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and do things sane men... Sane men never would.

1145
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:15,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge,

1146
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-that would take years. -Years. Years of research.

1147
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:21,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1148
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty years from now, people will look back and say, here, this place,

1149
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is where it all began.

1150
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:34,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1151
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:38,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1152
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they won't.

1153
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:43,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1154
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do understand

1155
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they can't let you leave.

1156
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am a federal marshal. They can't stop me.

1157
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:03,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was an esteemed psychiatrist from a respected family.

1158
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't matter.

1159
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:13,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ask you. Any past traumas in your life?

1160
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1161
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why would that matter?

1162
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they're gonna point to some event in your past

1163
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and say it's the reason you lost your sanity.

1164
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:29,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that when they commit you here, your friends and colleagues will say,

1165
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Of course he cracked.

1166
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Who wouldn't after what he'd been through?"

1167
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,768
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can say that about anyone, anyone at all.

1168
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is they're gonna say it about you.

1169
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How's your head? -My head?

1170
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:50,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any funny dreams lately? Trouble sleeping?

1171
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Headaches? -I am prone to migraines, yes.

1172
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

1173
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't taken any pills, have you? I mean, even aspirin?

1174
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The aspirin? -Jesus.

1175
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank the coffee they gave you?

1176
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:19,269
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1177
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I haven't.

1178
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes 36 to 48 hours for neuroleptic narcotics

1179
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:27,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to reach workable levels in the bloodstream.

1180
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Palsy comes first,

1181
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:35,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}first the fingertips, then eventually the whole hand.

1182
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seen any walking nightmares lately, Marshal? Huh?

1183
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:45,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1184
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:48,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me.

1185
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brain surgery.

1186
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:55,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The let's-open-the-skull-and-see- what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1187
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:59,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1188
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:03,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where they create the ghosts.

1189
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:09,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows about this? On the island, I mean. Who?

1190
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone.

1191
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:16,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1192
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They couldn't possibly know... -(FIRMLY) Everyone.

1193
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't stay here.

1194
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:42,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1195
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid if they come looking for you, they might find me.

1196
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1197
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna come back for you.

1198
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be here. I move during the day. New places every night.

1199
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I could come get you, get you off this island.

1200
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:04,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1201
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:08,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way off the island is the ferry, and they control it.

1202
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never leave here.

1203
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a friend.

1204
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was with him yesterday, but we got separated.

1205
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:27,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you seen him?

1206
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,275

1605
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She could feel it clicking across her skull,

1606
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:25,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just pulling the wires just for fun.

1607
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:31,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me that.

1608
02:05:32,733 --> 02:05:35,568
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1609
02:05:39,281 --> 02:05:41,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I loved her so much, you know.

1610
02:05:42,993 --> 02:05:44,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAWLEY: Why did you make them up?

1611
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:51,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children.

1612
02:05:55,005 --> 02:05:56,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I...

1613
02:05:58,842 --> 02:06:03,346
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help, you know.

1614
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I killed them.

1615
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:15,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's my fear, Andrew.

1616
02:06:15,192 --> 02:06:18,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We broke through once before, nine months ago,

1617
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:19,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then you regressed.

1618
02:06:22,032 --> 02:06:25,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't remember that. -I know.

1619
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You reset, Andrew.

1620
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:33,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a tape playing over and over on an endless loop.

1621
02:06:34,461 --> 02:06:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope that what we've done here will be enough

1622
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:39,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to stop it from ever happening again,

1623
02:06:39,216 --> 02:06:42,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I need to know you've accepted reality.

1624
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:51,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1625
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tried to help me when no one else would.

1626
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:12,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1627
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:22,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I murdered my wife in the spring of '52.

1628
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:49,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How we doing this morning?

1629
02:07:50,204 --> 02:07:53,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good. And you? -Can't complain.

1630
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:05,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what's our next move?

1631
02:08:06,637 --> 02:08:08,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell me.

1632
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1633
02:08:16,313 --> 02:08:17,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get back to the mainland.

1634
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever the hell's going on here, it's bad.

1635
02:08:35,666 --> 02:08:36,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(INAUDIBLE)

1636
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:45,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(WHISPERING) Don't worry, partner, they're not gonna catch us.

1637
02:08:51,348 --> 02:08:54,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. We're too smart for them.

1638
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:57,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1639
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:15,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, this place makes me wonder...

1640
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:18,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what's that, boss?

1641
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which would be worse,

1642
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to live as a monster

1643
02:09:24,798 --> 02:09:26,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or to die as a good man?

1644
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:37,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Teddy?

1645
02:09:40,477 --> 02:09:59,477
