{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, bad idea. Bad idea!

10

12
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's...?

13
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}RJ?

14
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No?

15
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The moon's not full.

16
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You woke me up a week early?

17
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

18
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell me you're dumb enough to actually try and steal my stuff.

19
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}RJ, I'm gonna have to kill you.

20
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, I'm just a desperate guy trying to feed his family.

21
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't have a family. - I meant a family of one.

22
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, wait, wait, wait, wait! Look, it's still in the cave.

23
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, technically, not stolen.

24
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

25
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

26
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow!

27
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

28
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close.

29
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vincent, wait! I can get it all back!

30
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right! If you eat me, you'd have to do it.

31
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can get it. All of it!

32
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My red wagon? - Redder!

33
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The blue cooler? - Blue cooler. On my list!

34
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gotta be blue? - Yes!

35
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want my Spuddies. I love those things.

36
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause with a Spuddie, enough just isn't enough.

37
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So true. Painfully true. And I'll tell you what.

38
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get you the giant picnic pack, family-fun size.

39
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They have that? - I'm pretty sure.

40
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, RJ. I'm going back to sleep.

41
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When that moon is full, I'm waking up.

42
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all my stuff had better be right back where it was.

43
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's just one week! That's impossible for one guy!

44
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A week's perfect. I'll get some helpers.

45
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Full moon, all my stuff. And don't even think about running away.

46
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if you do, I will hunt you down and kill you.

47
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy, all right, 'cause I'm on it.

48
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, in a week from now, we're gonna be laughing about this thing.

49
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,640


50
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy, that's cold! That's cold!

51
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one place I didn't have a shell.

52
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

53
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spring.

54
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means there's only 274 days left till winter.

55
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, wake up! Hibernation's over.

56
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, morning!

57
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Morning, Hammy. - I gotta go wee-wee!

58
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not in the lake we drink from!

59
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, all right, the rest of you. It's spring!

60
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means we gotta get to work.

61
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finished. No, wait!

62
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, everybody. Wake up. Don't make me come in there.

63
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ya'll better listen.

64
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been holding something in all winter, and I'm about to let it out.

65
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm up, I'm up! - She means it. Let's go!

66
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Stella.

67
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I can clear a room, Verne. Come on, that much I can do.

68
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good morning. - Good morning, everyone!

69
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How'd you guys sleep? - Just a super-duper morning.

70
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, jeepers.

71
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, not lookin' so good around the eyes there, hon.

72
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bucky and Quillo were up every three or four weeks.

73
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Spike kept poking me.

74
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

75
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the sharpest of the bunch there.

76
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? How 'bout I take the day shift?

77
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Lou, that'd be just super.

78
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, kids, you heard your mother, and now you listen to me. Shape up.

79
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy.

80
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I was afraid of.

81
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the food? Is there any left? I'm hungry, so is there any left?

82
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ate all the food, Hammy. During the winter? We gotta go get some more now.

83
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right! I buried some nuts in the woods.

84
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know where they are. I'll be right back. Bye!

85
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's enough. - Dad, it was just snow.

86
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it could have been a predator.

87
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't playing dead a little... weak?

88
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heather, how many times must I say it?

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Playing possum is what we do.

90
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We die so that we live!

91
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the boss of you, OK? So calm down.

92
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what we need to find you this year, don't you know? A good fella.

93
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A good fella? A good fella? - Jeepers, here we go.

94
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why does everyone think I need a man?

95
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I look like a nest and smell like a swamp.

96
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when you find a fella who's decent,

97
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}good with kids and has no sense of smell, call me.

98
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - I don't care who started it.

99
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - I don't care who started it.

100
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look, food.

101
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I think you know what this means.

102
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Verne. - Just a minute, Hammy.

103
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This means we were nine berries away from starvation.

104
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. That was a little intense.

105
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant really serious hunger pains.

106
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne!

107
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not finished, Hammy. - Morning, Lou, Penny.

108
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - Hey, kids.

109
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What I want to tell you is... - Verne!

110
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not done, Hammy. If you have to go again, just go.

111
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. So all I'm saying is we cut it a little close.

112
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this year we need to make sure that we fill the log...

113
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All the way to the top. - Exactly. All the way to the top.

114
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Because what are we? - Foragers!

115
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And what do we forage? - Food!

116
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right. - Super, Verne, really super.

117
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, Hammy.

118
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is it? - What is what?

119
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it you want to tell me?

120
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was it, what was it, what was it, what was it?

121
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. Right on the tip of my tongue. Oh, yeah!

122
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a weird thing I've never seen before.

123
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really scary. Follow me.

124
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Meeting called on account of weird scary thing.

125
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

126
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Foragers...

127
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hammy, what weird thing?

128
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. That weird thing.

129
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It never ends!

130
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

131
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It never ends that way too!

132
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jeepers, Lou. - Whoa.

133
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, jeepers is the word there, hon.

134
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've never seen anything like this. - Man, that's big.

135
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is this thing? - Heather, no!

136
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm scared. - Me too, Mama.

137
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK, it's just a... What is this thing, Lou?

138
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... Well, it's a... It's... Verne?

139
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's... it's obviously...

140
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...some kind of bush?

141
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be less afraid of it if I just knew what it was called.

142
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's call it Steve! - Steve?

143
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's a pretty name. - Steve sounds nice.

144
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm a lot less scared of Steve. - Oh, great and powerful Steve!

145
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you want? - I don't think it can speak.

146
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard that, young man!

147
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You get over here right now! - OK.

148
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hammy, get back here.

149
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Steve is angry! - It came from the other side of Steve.

150
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean the bush. I mean... Jeez!

151
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one way we're gonna find out what this thing is,

152
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and what this is all about. I'm gonna go check it out.

153
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Steve ate Verne!

154
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Steve, you brought this on yourself.

155
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stella, don't! I'm not eaten, I just tripped.

156
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go over there. Just don't anybody move.

157
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids, come on, hurry up! You'll be late!

158
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

159
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey there, little...

160
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...fella.

161
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

162
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

163
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Operator. Can I help you?

164
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can talk. I'm just driving.

165
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne's back.

166
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Verne! - Jeepers!

167
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You OK? - Help him up.

168
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was over there? - Freaky pink primates!

169
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must have come while we were hibernating. It was awful.

170
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had wheels on their feet and these sticks, and they were

171
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whacking me with these sticks like it was some sort of sick game.

172
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have died! You should have laid down and died.

173
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad. - That's not the worst part.

174
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half the forest is gone.

175
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The oak trees and the berry bushes,

176
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're just... they're just gone.

177
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeepers.

178
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'll we do for food?

179
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we gonna live?

180
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. But here's what I do know.

181
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will be fine as long as no one goes over Steve again.

182
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called a hedge, and it is not to be feared, my amphibious friend.

183
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the gateway to the good life.

184
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a reptile, actually.

185
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, you know, it's a common mistake.

186
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you are?

187
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are my manners. I'm RJ.

188
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't think I'm prying, but I couldn't help overhearing,

189
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can shed a little light on what this whole hedge situation is about.

190
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, what was once mere wilderness

191
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is now 54 acres of man-made, manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

192
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for that little-bitty speck. You are here.

193
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, that's a good thing. You're hibernators, right?

194
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gather food, store it for the winter?

195
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We fill the log! - Hammy.

196
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? This log? This cave-like log?

197
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All the way to the top. - Ozzie.

198
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ask ya, how long's it take?

199
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know, to fill the log? - Two hundred and seventy-four days.

200
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ever done it in a week? - That's impossible.

201
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if we work together.

202
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got the food gathering skills, I've got the know-how,

203
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and they have the food! - How much food?

204
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loads of food. Heaps of food. Food out the wazoo!

205
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, whatever kind of food comes out of a wazoo,

206
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think we're interested in eating.

207
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, the guy's making a lot of sense to me.

208
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think we should listen. - Yeah, I'm OK with wazoo food there.

209
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not. The tail is tingling.

210
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why didn't you say so? - Hold on, hold on. The what is what?

211
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When something doesn't feel right, my tail tingles. Let me tell you,

212
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything you've said so far is driving my tail crazy.

213
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen. Verne, right? This isn't something you need to be afraid of.

214
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I am. And for good reason.

215
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not a birthmark.

216
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because you went over there without a guide.

217
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for stopping by. We're not interested.

218
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not interested in the most delicious food you've ever tasted?

219
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! - Come on.

220
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not interested!

221
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. I get it.

222
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand. This is something that you're just not open to.

223
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

224
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my! - Jeepers.

225
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that?

226
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, my friend, is a magical combination of corn flour,

227
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}dehydrated cheese solids, BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

228
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a.k.a., the chip. Nacho cheese flavor.

229
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Over here! Toss me one of those! - More please! More.

230
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Verne, those were good!

231
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all good. And we're going over there. Tonight!

232
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

233
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:06,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to suburbia.

234
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to suburbia.

235
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow! - Look at that!

236
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Mom, look at us! Look at us!

237
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my! Hon, look at this.

238
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeepers.

239
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that tail, Verne?

240
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, if anybody in this family gets hurt, I'm holding you responsible.

241
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're having a good time. I'll take responsibility for that.

242
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is neat. - Look at that.

243
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Spike, look at that. - Hey, Verno,

244
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took a few clippings out of my quills to do a little comparison.

245
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this, the grass seems to be greener over here.

246
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne, are you certain you came to the same place?

247
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, 'cause the raccoon says...

248
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, enough about him. I get it.

249
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he can do a couple of tricks. I mean, it's not like he can walk on water.

250
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, everybody! This way to the food!

251
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That thing's huge! - What is that?

252
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is an SUV. Humans ride around in it

253
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they are slowly losing their ability to walk.

254
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jeepers, it's so big! - How many humans fit in there?

255
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually? One.

256
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, this is Gladys Sharp. Your president?

257
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of the homeowner's association? Right.

258
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jeepers. - What is that?

259
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, easy, don't worry. That's just a human being.

260
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they are just as scared of us as we are of them.

261
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if a human does happen to see you, just lay down,

262
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}roll over and give your privates a good licking. They love it.

263
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The charter, which you signed, says the grass is supposed to be two inches,

264
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and according to my measuring stick, yours is 2.5.

265
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could we just get the food and go? Really, do they have it or not?

266
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you see it? It was in the box. They've always got food with them.

267
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

268
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you what I'm talking about.

269
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The human mouth is called a "pie hole."

270
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The human being is called a "couch potato."

271
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is a device to summon food.

272
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is one of the many voices of food.

273
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the portal for the passing of the food.

274
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is one of the many food transportation vehicles.

275
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Humans bring the food, take the food,

276
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ship the food, they drive the food,

277
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they wear the food! That gets the food hot. That keeps the food cold.

278
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That... I'm not sure what that is.

279
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know? Food!

280
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the altar where they worship food.

281
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what they eat when they eat too much.

282
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gets rid of guilt so they can eat more food.

283
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Food! Food! Food! Food!

284
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Food!

285
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you think they have enough?

286
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they don't. For humans, enough is never enough!

287
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what do they do with the stuff they don't eat?

288
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They put it in gleaming, silver cans,

289
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just for us.

290
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet jeepers.

291
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dig in!

292
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good, isn't it? - OK.

293
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wow. - Share there, everyone, share.

294
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a diaper. And that does come out of a wazoo.

295
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do you think? Was I right or was I right?

296
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And these things are just the scraps!

297
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait'll you see what comes in the boxes, packages and cans!

298
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, stick with me, and in one week

299
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will gather enough food to...

300
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- To feed a bear. - What?

301
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a figure of speech.

302
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Halt! Intruders! Intruders! Get out, all of you.

303
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it, baby?

304
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - You said to lick our...

305
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Nix that! Run!

306
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Run! - Get outta here!

307
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run!

308
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shoo! - To the hedge!

309
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here! I just mopped this patio!

310
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Filthy vermin!

311
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne's right, that was horrible.

312
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You kids OK? - Stay close.

313
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll find other food, right? - See? That's what I was talking about!

314
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These humans don't want us around.

315
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we scared her, and she overreacted. No biggie.

316
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No biggie? That is what we call a biggie.

317
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, think about the food. It was worth it for that food, huh?

318
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That stuff is to die for!

319
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me rephrase that.

320
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, to die for. You nailed that part.

321
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, maybe our little forest life

322
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

323
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - But I think I speak

324
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the whole family when I say we want nothing

325
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to do with anything that's over that hedge.

326
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, come on! - I'm done.

327
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't even tried doughnuts yet! You wanna store fat?

328
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the way to store some fat.

329
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be sweatin' through the winter!

330
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll eat the bark, right? - OK, all right, you guys sleep on it!

331
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good idea. I'm gonna check back with you.

332
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot!

333
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost had 'em.

334
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Heather. - Good night.

335
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Ozzie. - Good night.

336
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Lou. - Good night.

337
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Night, Penny. - Good night.

338
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Hammy. - Good night.

339
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Night, Bucky. - Good night.

340
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Spike. - Good night, Uncle Verne.

341
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night, Quillo. - Night, Uncle Verne.

342
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we wake up, only 273 days left till winter.

343
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's enough, Verne. - Good night, 273.

344
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spuddies...

345
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cooler... Wagon... Redder wagon.

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time's up, RJ.

347
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have six more days! No!

348
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Four paws, fur.

349
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still alive, still alive.

350
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what are you saying? You want me to take 'em to his house?

351
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - Then what are you saying?

352
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jimmy was pushing me on the bus.

353
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He likes you. - No way, he's a creep.

354
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next time he shoves you, beat him up.

355
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

356
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, kids, dive in. There it is. Bark for breakfast!

357
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I want a doughnut! - I want pizza.

358
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't.

359
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. This is great.

360
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Granted, it takes some time to chew.

361
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that...

362
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was very satisfying.

363
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, by the way, lots of fiber in there too.

364
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lots. - I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

365
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

366
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here to help you with your... foraging thing.

367
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Verne, you said a word yesterday about your little gang here.

368
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It starts with an F, do you remember what it was?

369
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Family? - Right, right, that.

370
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, that got me right here.

371
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, Verne, I used to have all of that.

372
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My own place, surrounded by loved ones,

373
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}universal remote.

374
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then all that went away with...

375
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the weed hacker incident.

376
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

377
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come here.

378
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that feels good, doesn't it?

379
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, brother. - Jeepers, Verne.

380
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could always use the extra hand there, you know.

381
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The weed hacker, Verne. The weed hacker.

382
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

383
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not your problem. I'll just go.

384
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is me...

385
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...going.

386
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Been nice. - Don't hit.

387
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really nice getting to know you.

388
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I'm sure I'll see you around the forest.

389
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take care. - All right, all right.

390
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, RJ?

391
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can... you can stay.

392
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come here, ya big lug! - No.

393
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew beneath this hard, crispy outside

394
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was a soft, nougat-y center in there.

395
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne? - With every bone in my body.

396
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Hey, can I work with Hammy?

397
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna help me find my nuts?

398
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very tempting, Hammy, very tempting. But first, I want to show you this.

399
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like this cookie?

400
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, this cookie's junk! - I like a cookie.

00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they might just be overreacting.

475
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if they're not? What if we have a potential pandemic on our hands?

476
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vermin running loose, spreading disease

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Worry about your casserole,

480
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll worry about the end of suburban peace and tranquility!

481

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Don't push. Plenty for everybody.

482

484
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feel buzzing in the back of your skull? That's called a sugar rush.

485
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's what keeps humans going, why they don't hibernate. Add a little of this,

486
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and what usually takes you all summer

487

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, Hamsquad. The last thing you need is caffeine.

490
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Come on, dig in.

491
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because this, my friends, is just the beginning.

492

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read it and weep.

496
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? I need every business listing you have under "exterminator."

508
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lights fading, limbs growing cold.

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice catch, Verne. - Yes! Yes!

00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see? This is exactly why I called the exterminator.

521
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To kill them before they get hurt like this.

00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe someone phoned about an animal problem?

528

00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

547

00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne. What are you doing?

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we've angered the humans.

00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That the food we gather our way isn't as good as the food we gather your way?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hold you back, all right. From extinction.

00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they listened to half the stuff you're telling them,

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they're too stupid and naive to know any better.

702
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you put this one in? This Depelter Turbo?

703
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a contraband item, ma'am, as it is illegal in every state, except Texas.

704
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care if it's against the Geneva Convention.

705
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I want it! - I thought you might.

706
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I took the liberty of installing it for you.

707
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adios, animal infestation.

708
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

709
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have I done?

710
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shouldn't have taken all that food. - What?

711
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't have taken all that food.

712
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just trying to return things to the way they were.

713
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just being cautious. 'Cause that's what I am.

714
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm naturally tentative.

715
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's even places in my shell I haven't been.

716
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, on the other hand, you're like... cool.

717
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And crazy and fearless.

718
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they're right. I think I'm just jealous.

719
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne, believe me, you should not be jealous of me.

720
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a good thing here. You're trying to do what's best for your family.

721
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I think you're what's best for them now.

722
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about your tail?

723
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My head says listen to my tail

724
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my tail says listen to my head, and I just...

725
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...end up with an upset stomach.

726
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you need to be in charge now.

727
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't know what's going on. - And you do.

728
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, what's the problem? - This, Verne, is the problem.

729
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You see this? - I'm listening.

730
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just...

731
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just hang on a second. All right?

732
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

733
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You throwing the party? - Yes. To the right.

734
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are protective booties to put on over your shoes.

735
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Yes!

736
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is this? - What?

737
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that...

738
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... is a...

739
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}... Iist of all the stuff that you lost, Verne.

740
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - It's a big, long list. You can see.

741
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a... organized little guy, aren't you? Nice job.

742
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I know a place so chock-full of food,

743
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we could get it all back in one night.

744
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Let's go. Where is it?

745
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- lnside that house. - What?

746
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is the point of this thing? - Just send it down.

747
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:40,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What Verne is trying to say is...

748
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What Verne is trying to say is...

749
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's hard to really sum it all up in just one word.

750
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But... - I'm sorry.

751
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come here.

752
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, come here, Verne. - That's right.

753
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK! Listen, stay in the huddle. Here's the plan.

754
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the traps are set here, here, here,

755
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}here, here, here, here, here, here,

756
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}here, here, here and here.

757
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, here, here, here.

758
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big one here, here,

759
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and maybe a few over here. - Gee, is that all?

760
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. There's a bunch of red lights all over here.

761
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, Verne? Looking a little green.

762
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I blacked out for a second there, but I get the idea.

763
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's lights, traps... I might need to change my shell.

764
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, this is us.

765
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I be the car? - I wanna be the car!

766
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm the car. You be the shoe. - The shoe is lame.

767
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you be that snazzy-looking iron?

768
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it's not important!

769
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, I'm the car. I'm always the car.

770
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plan works in three simple steps. Step one, kill the lights.

771
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step two, get inside. Step three, get out with mountain of food.

772
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this place is like a fortress. Walls, so high. Doors, impenetrable.

773
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How will we get in? - The collar is the key.

774
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Literally, the collar.

775
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a key that opens the door and if...

776
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what? You think he's just gonna hand over his collar to you?

777
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me, my femme fatale. To you.

778
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Her? - Me?

779
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, Stella, will get that cat to give you his collar by using...

780
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My stink. -...your feminine charms.

781
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was that out loud?

782
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:27,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, raccoon, maybe that mask you're wearing is obstructing your view,

783
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if you haven't noticed, I'm a skunk.

784
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the outside, maybe. But I'm looking inside, Stella, and I see a fox.

785
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all we gotta do is get her out.

786
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Scissors. - Scissors?

787
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here we go. - Watch the...

788
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Charcoal. - Charcoal?

789
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Air freshener. - Tomato juice.

790
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Cork. - Cork? Don't you dare.

791
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get 'em! - Score! Yeah!

792
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more thing.

793
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop. That's it.

794
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, our work here is done.

795
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

796
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Big jeepers. - She's all like, wow.

797
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

798
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meow.

799
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whoa! - Amazing!

800
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gosh, she looks...

801
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

802
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,370

810
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I like a cookie.

811
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on? Is everything OK?

812

00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, that's it.

815

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is. Go get it.

816
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, that's it.

817
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get it, you little nut!

818
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bingo! OK, step two.

819
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we'd be dead by step two, so this is going great!

820
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, gorgeous, you're on.

821
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, this better be one stupid cat.

822

824
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put it on cat. Maybe the cat likes a cow.

825
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who goes there?

826
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,050

827
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a cat!

828
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I'm a cat.

829
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Meow. - Yeah, right.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoo. Go on, get away from here.

831
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My owner does not give scraps to common strays.

832
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Common strays? All right, you asked for it.

833
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get the collar! - Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mind if I have a look? - No! Come no closer!

835
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must not be so near a creature of the outdoor woods.

836
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Away with your filth! - My filth?

837
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My filth?! - Oh, jeepers, here we go.

838
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, that's it. I am sick and tired of everybody taking one look at me

839
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and running away 'cause they think I'm filthy.

840
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I got news for you.

841
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't get all primped and preened to have some over-fed, pompous puffball

842
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tell me he's too good for me. I got makeup on my butt, dude!

843
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you don't even wanna know about the cork!

844
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! No one has ever spoken to me like that!

845
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is bold. I like it.

846
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, believe me, there's more where that came from...

847
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...puffball. - All right, team, let's boogie.

848
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are strong. Your essence is overpowering.

849
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What...? What do you mean by that? - It is your eyes.

850
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My eyes. - They are luminous.

851
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luminous? Dang.

852
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think this is the part where I blacked out.

853
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did the little shoes and cars actually get into the house?

854
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:15,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So you got a name? - Yes.

855
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a Persian name, for I am Persian.

856

00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Heather!

903
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a dead, white rat on my staircase.

904
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were dead.

905
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I learned from the best, Dad.

906
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my girl.

907
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come to Papa.

908
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We better hurry. We don't have much time.

909
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's going on, RJ? - Nothing!

910
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get out of here because we have what we need.

911
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, we don't. - What are you talking about?

912
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We have more than enough. - Hey, listen.

913
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got this long to hand over that wagon of food to a homicidal bear.

914
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If these Spuddies aren't on the menu, then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

915
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

916
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go!

917
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, whoa!

918
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

919
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stella, Stella, where are you going? Stella!

920
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stella!

921
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, it's not you. It won't work, OK, because I'm a...

922
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skunk!

923
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that. Sorry you have to see this.

924
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire in the hole!

925
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my... - This smell doesn't bother you?

926
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. This face was bred for beauty.

927
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot smell a thing.

928
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't smell?

929
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the door! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

930
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Run! - This way!

931
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's party.

932
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bunnies!

933
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flee, my love.

934
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, that way. Outside!

935
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move, kids! Come on!

936
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buenos días, reptile.

937
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've just been verminated.

938
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stink.

939
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because you let them into my... house!

940
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Those... - Hey, Nancy, stop your honkin'.

941
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These little guys will be disposed of quickly and humanely.

942
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Not humanely. As inhumanely as possible.

943
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a pleasure doing business with you, ma'am.

944
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's he gonna do to us, Mama? - I don't know, baby.

945
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna die, Dad. Not for real.

946
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there, there, sweetheart. We'll be OK.

947
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right about him, Verne.

948
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shoulda listened. Sorry there.

949
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

950
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew we couldn't trust him, and I got us into this.

951
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should've known better.

952
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

953
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vincent?

954
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I was on my way down here to kill you.

955
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I stopped to watch the show, and I gotta say...

956
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that, right there,

957
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is a thing of beauty.

958
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is the most vicious, deceitful,

959
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}self-serving thing I've ever seen.

960
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Classic RJ.

961
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take the food, and they take the fall.

962
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You keep this up, you're gonna end up just like me.

963
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Having everything you ever wanted.

964
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I already had that.

965
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, them? Who are you kidding?

966
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said it yourself, you're a family of one.

967
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always will be.

968
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's how guys like you and me survive.

969
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So a few saps got hurt in the process.

970
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tough. That's life. Trust me, you don't need them.

971
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I do.

972
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And right now, they really need me.

973
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I really need this!

974
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}RJ!

975
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...?

976
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There goes my back again. - Are you OK?

977
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:34,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sorry sack of rat dung.

978
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, Stella, this is a rescue. I'm rescuing you.

979
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna gas you so hard your grandchildren'll stink.

980
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bear! - What's that?

981
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bear! - Hair?

982
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bear! - Dare?

983
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bear! - Oh, bear!

984
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

985
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're out of control! - We can drive.

986
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's just like Auto-Homicide 3! - What?

987
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Verne, let me in! Wrong button! Wrong button!

988
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please select destination. - Take us home! Take us to the log!

989
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Previous destination selected. Make a legal U-turn.

990
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got it!

991
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hammy! Let me in! - Not listening to RJ.

992
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids, lose that bear!

993
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What weapons do we have?

994
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We've got a hammer. - Cool.

995
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You little...

996
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

997
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let me in, let me in! - No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

998
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ozzie!

999
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to help us. Just let him in.

1000
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- After what he did to us? - But he came back.

1001
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he brought a bear.

1002
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No fighting while we're driving. - We will turn this van around, mister.

1003
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,700

1105
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:39,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, my friends, is the object of all human attention and devotion.

1106
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:41,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And they call it a TV. - Wicked cool!

1107
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Humans feel an inner need to connect with the world around them.

1108
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is super-duper.

1109
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:48,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They also feel a need to sit on their fat butts.

1110
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watching TV fulfills both needs at the same time.

1111
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Interesting.

1112
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:55,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, kids. Family time there, in front of the TV. Got your snack food?

1113
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buy a vowel. Buy a vowel! Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1114
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I can't find the remote. - Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1115
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Has anybody seen the remote? - Dad, chill.

1116
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could do a little TV.

1117
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:08,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today's the day we find out if the baby is gifted

1118
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or if Saxon is really an alien.

1119
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like Khan in Star Trek ll!

1120
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Genesis Project was in the hands of the Enterprise,

1121
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Khan had his plan to steal the invention!

1122
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:19,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, that was specific. - I saw it on TNT, a retrospective.

1123
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:22,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gummi Worm, anybody? - Let me have one.

1124
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bucky, pass this to Lou.

1125
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Taste this. - Don't you take that.

1126
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is the perfect food. - Fat-free cookies?

1127
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might as well be eating dirt.

1128
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had dirt. I don't like dirt. It tastes like dirt.

1129
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The show is starting.

1130

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on a minute.

1131
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:23,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait. I can't wait.

1132
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Here we go.

1133
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kind of anticlimactic. - Shoot!
