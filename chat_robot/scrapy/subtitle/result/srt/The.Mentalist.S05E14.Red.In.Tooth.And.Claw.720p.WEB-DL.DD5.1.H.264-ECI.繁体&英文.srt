2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,090
我們有個撲克牌局
Listen, there's this poker game we've got going on.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,870
-想來嗎  -也許吧  什么時候
- You want in? - Maybe. When?

Let me see-- Thursday night.

你要去玩撲克
You're going to play poker.

Hey. Teresa. Glad you made it.

來了這么多高層人士
It's a pretty high-class crowd.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,550
你早跟我說一聲就好了
I wish you would have warned me.

13
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,270
我想這位你認識  對嗎
Oh, I think you know this guy, right?

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,750
特蕾莎  我沒想過你會喜歡賭博
Teresa. I didn't take you for a gambler.

15
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,170
如果知道自己贏定了  就不算是賭了
It's not gambling if you know you're gonna win.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,170

Ace of hearts.

不跟
Not me.

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,310
法官先生  看你的了
Action's on you, Judge.

伯特侖  比你多了五百美元
That's $500 more to you, Bertram.

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,000
加注一千
Raise it $1,000.

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,830
你在虛張聲勢
You're bluffing.

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,820

All in.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,910
我喜歡跟你打牌  蓋爾
I love playing with you, Gale.

27

I can read you like a kids' book.

I'm sorry, guys, but we caught one.

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,510
-能幫我兌現嗎  -好的
- Will you cash me out? - Yeah.

Are you playing poker again, Lisbon?

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,730
你被撲克打垮了

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,710
輸錢了
Losing money?

博物館的實驗室在東翼

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,610
對死者的情況你有多少了解
What can you tell us about the victim?

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,790
我們認為死者是琳達·帕弗瑞
We think it is Linda Parfrey.

你們認為是她
You think it's her?

琳達失蹤了好一陣子了  而且...
Linda has been missing for some time, and...

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,810
你們很快就知道了
Well, you'll see.

這位是發現琳達的學生
Ah, this is the student who found Linda.

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,720
告訴他們你的名字
Tell--tell them your name.

60
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,620
我叫格雷  格雷戈里·劉易斯
Uh, Greg. Uh, Gregory Lewis.

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,500
我是大約午夜的時候發現她的
I found her around midnight.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,030
說說事發經過
Tell me what happened.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,490
全憑運氣  我找到了一只非常好的樹鼩
Well, by sheer luck, I-I happened upon a very nice tree shrew.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,100
我從未研究過樹鼩
Um, I've never examined one before,

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,860
就把它帶回來準備去除皮肉
and I-I brought it in to strip the flesh off.

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
就是只保留骨架
You know, to keep the skeleton.

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,130
這怎么做
How do you do that?

68
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,550
把它們放到這些箱子里
Oh, w-we put 'em in these tanks.

69
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,060
這又怎么把骨架和皮肉分離開來
How does that strip them of their flesh?

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,140
-食尸蟲  -食尸蟲  對
- Flesh-eating bugs. - Flesh-eating bugs. Right.

71
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,150
沒錯
Right.

72
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,970
我就是這樣發現琳達的

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,050
為何要棄尸于蟲箱里
Why dump a body into a beetle tank?

96
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,890
博物館安保措置不佳
The museum doesn't have great security,

97
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,340
但也沒到能隨隨便便把尸體運出去的地步
but it's not the kind of place you can sneak a body out of.

98
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,920
除非尸體小到能裝進行李袋
Unless you make it small enough to fit in a duffel bag.

99
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,570
兇手是在等蟲子將尸體啃食至
So the killer was waiting for the bugs to eat it

100
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
只剩骨架  然后再偷運出去
down to the skeleton so they could sneak it out?

101
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,380
有可能  我們在箱子里發現了一件科學器械
Possibly. Uh, we found a scientific tool in the tank.

102
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,760
有可能是兇器
It could be the murder weapon.

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,480
兇手也許也是一名科學家
So the killer's probably another scientist then.

104
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,940
或者是博物館的工作人員
Or someone that works at the museum.

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,490
最后一次看見琳達是什么時候
When was Linda last seen?

106
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,440
琳達已經失蹤好幾星期了
Linda's been missing a couple weeks.

107
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,840
大家以為她是去
People thought she was out camping

108
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,140
約塞米蒂國家公園做什么研究去了
near Yosemite doing some kind of research.

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,030
后來有人注意到她的車停在校園里
Then someone noticed her car was on campus,

110
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,460
才意識到她失蹤了
and they realized she was missing.

111
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,410
是誰填的失蹤人口報告
Who filed the missing persons report?

112
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,020
索尼亞·基德博士
Dr. Sonia Kidd.

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
她是校生物系主任
Head of the Biology Department at the university

114
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,150
也是琳達的顧問
and Linda's adviser.

115
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,130
名字聽起來很耳熟
Her name sounds familiar.

116
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,610
是的  她寫過幾本書
Yeah, she's written a couple books.

117
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,530
流行科學讀物  有一本叫

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,720
《天生殺手:謀殺的進化根源》
"Natural born killers: The evolutionary roots of murder."

119
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,840
有趣  我和簡去找她談談
Cute. Jane and I will go talk to her.

120
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,120
琳達在博物館有間辦公室
And, uh, Linda had an office here at the museum.

121
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,350
你和周去查看一下
You and Cho check it out.

收到  頭兒
You got it, boss.

123
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,140
我們以為她在山里迷路了
We thought she was lost in the mountains.

124
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,030
沒想到她一直都在這里
But she was here the whole time.

125
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,530
簡直太可怕了
It's too horrible for words.

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,820
她研究什么  研究哪種動物
What did she study? What kind of animal?

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,880
有什么關系嗎
Why does that matter?

128
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,610
沒有人會因為偶然而選擇其終身事業
Nobody picks what they dedicate their life to by accident.

129
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,880
都是有原因的
It says something.

130
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,880
我研究靈長類動物大腦
I study primate brains.

131
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,620
這能說明我是怎樣的人
What does that say about me?

132
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,650
你有一些陰暗的思想
You have dark thoughts inside your head

133
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,110
但你覺得它們很正常很自然
that you want to believe are normal and natural.

134
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,180
當然它們確實是那樣
Which they are, of course.

135
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
琳達是研究鳥類的
Linda was an ornithologist.

136
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,380
她的博士生項目是研究北撲翅鴷的飲食
Her doctorate was on the diet of the northern flicker.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,540
北撲翅鴷是一種啄木鳥
A kind of woodpecker.

138
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,690
有意思
Interesting.

139
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,770
啄木鳥十分執著
Tenacious.

140
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,800
不斷用頭撞樹直到問題解決
Bang their head against the problem until they solve it.

141
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,440
琳達也是這種性格嗎
Was that Linda?

142
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,590
是的
It was.

143
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,160
但是啄木鳥并不是用頭撞樹
Although woodpeckers don't bang their heads

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,530
而是用喙在樹上鉆洞
against things so much as they use their bills to drill holes.

145
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,420
的確  潛意識這東西
Yes. Well, the subconscious mind is--

146
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,520
沒那么準
isn't really a stickler about that kind of thing.

147

她是個好學生嗎
Uh, was she a good student?

148

她很聰明
Brilliant.

149
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,680
她已經和人合作在著名期刊上
She had already co-authored several papers

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
發表了好幾篇論文了
in prestigious journals.

151
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,790
有誰嫉妒她嗎
Well, who was jealous?

152
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,880
沒有
Nobody.

153
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,610
我們的生物系在整個西海岸是頂尖的
This is the top biology department on the west coast.

154
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,810
這里的人都是精英
Best and brightest only.

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,610
每一個人的成功對我們都有好處
The success of one of us helps all of us.

156

我們是一家人

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,060
每天都有謀害親人的事發生
Well, people murder family members every day.

158
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,360
這很自然
It's natural.

159
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,150
謀殺是一件自然的事
Murder is natural.

160
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,170
但卻不正常
But abnormal.

161
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,860
教授們不會了解丑聞
Teachers don't know there's scandals

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,820
除非他們自己深陷其中
unless of course they are the scandal.

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,720
你們問完了嗎
Are we done?

164
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,780
暫時問完了
Yeah. For now.

165
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,520
我們得跟幾個學生談談
Uh, we're gonna need to talk to some students

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,210
還得去一趟禮品店
and visit the gift shop,

167
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,950
出門左拐  對嗎
which is left out the door, isn't it?

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
打擾一下  你在做什么
Excuse me. What are you doing?

169
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,180
你們是什么人
Who are you?

你在這做什么
What are you doing here?

176
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,170
我想在你們把這里封鎖之前
I just came to get my copy of "Understanding macro-evolution"

177
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,270
拿走我的《理解宏觀進化》的拷貝
before you guys sealed the place off.

178
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,010
你跟琳達熟悉嗎
Did you know Linda well?

179
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,280
她是這里的明星
She was a rock star.

180
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,030
也許需要打扮下  但確實是明星
A rock star who could use a makeover, but still.

181
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,520
她拿到了今年的院長獎學金

182
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,220
大約有10萬塊
That's like 100 grand.

183
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,430
而我們這些人只能用社保金
The rest of us will be paying off our student loans

184
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,150
去交我們的助學貸款
with our social security checks.

185
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,830
怎么會有這么多動物標本
What's with all the taxidermy?

186
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,790
琳達不是研究啄木鳥的嗎
I thought Linda just studied woodpeckers.

187
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,450
管理標本室是琳達勤工儉學的工作
No, Linda managed the specimen rooms for her work-study,

188
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,750
她精力旺盛嘛

194
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,530
-什么意思  -她有男朋友嗎
- What about it? - Did she have one?

195
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,030
我們沒怎么談論過這個話題
We didn't talk about that stuff very much.

在大象這邊
Look for the elephants.

201
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,770
大多數的物種在很長一段時間都不進化
Most species stay in stasis for long periods of time.

非常敬重
from the students.

207

我在基德教授手下教課

抱歉打斷你了
I'm sorry to interrupt,

209

大概是她失蹤前一周
About a week before she went missing.

221
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
你不會懷疑是他干的吧

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,930
我是周探員  這位是派翠克·簡
Agent Cho. This is Patrick Jane.

285
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,340
我很愿意配合你們工作
Uh, look, I want to talk to you guys,

286
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,610
可我得先把手頭的事處理完
but we gotta handle this, okay?

287
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,440
我過幾個小時找你們吧
Let me catch up with you in a couple hours.

288
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,500
-幾個小時  -對  我們剛接警
- A couple hours? - Yeah, we just got this.

289
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,340
我們得發布犯罪通報
I mean, we gotta put out a crime broadcast.

290
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,030
還得片區巡邏
We gotta cruise the neighborhood.

291
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,530
然后寫報告
Then there's the paperwork.

292
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,190
你的報告我是愛莫能助了
Well, can't help you with the paperwork.

293
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,680
-他戴著兜帽  走進來  -你為什么把錢給他
- He had a hood. He came in... - Why'd you give him the money?

294
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,710
先生  請由我們來問話
Sir, we're asking the questions here.

295
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,420
告訴我事發經過
Just tell me what happened.

296
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,710
我從收銀機取錢時這家伙走進來
So this dude comes up while I'm cashing out the register,

297
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,120
問我要名片
asks for a calling card.

298
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,270
我只轉過身一秒鐘
I just turned for one second,

299
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,740
他就把手伸進窗口搶了一摞20塊
and he reached through the gap and grabbed a stack of $20s.

300
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,320
你得等到取完鈔
You wait until you're finished cashing out

301
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,020
才能做另一筆交易
before you do another transaction!

302
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,780
聽著  這家伙拿著錢
Look, the guy had money.

303
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,980
他看上去沒什么可疑的
He didn't look shady or anything.

304
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,400
我怎么會知道他會搶錢
How was I supposed to know?

305
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,900
請問
Hey. Excuse me.

306
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,910
給我演示一下他手伸進來夠錢的情景
Show me how he reached through the gap again.

307
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,690
好了  手縮回去
All right. Pull your hand out.

308
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,290
這就是抓浣熊的方法  你知道嗎
That's how they catch a raccoon, you know that?

309
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,990
這么說  那家伙沒法通過這個口搶錢
So the guy couldn't have grabbed the cash through the gap.

310
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,290
根本沒有這個人  是嗎  哥們
There wasn't another guy, was there, buddy?

311
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,620
是你  你就是小偷
You! You're the thief!

312
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,410
我是小偷
I'm the thief?

313
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,760
你就是小偷
You're the thief.

314
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,520
你就付我那么點工資  反倒說我是小偷
With what you're paying me, I'm the thief?

315
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,550
活兒干完了  哥們
Work's done here, buddy.

316
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,760
我想你們可以把小偷帶去做筆錄了
I think you can get your man to do the paperwork.

317
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,970
聽著
Look--

318
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,850
不不不
No, no, no.

319
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,000
你和琳達什么時候認識的
When did you and Linda meet?

320
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,380
去年  我在值夜班
Last year. I was moonlighting,

321
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,580
在博物館做安保
doing security at the museum.

322
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,000
你們的感情生活如何
And how was the relationship?

323
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,030
她的生活比我認識的任何人都穩當
Her life was more together than anybody I ever met.

324
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,320
她很專注
She was so focused.

325
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,790
我想也感染到了我
Got to me, too, I guess.

326
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,110
我甚至開始為警官考試做準備
I even started studying for the sergeant's exam.

327
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,410
然后把她給甩了
Mm-hmm. And then you dumped her?

328
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,460
-你以為我不難過嗎  -這要你告訴我們
- You think I was happy about it? - You tell me.

329
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,990
大約兩個月前  我收到了一封匿名電郵
About two months ago I got an anonymous e-mail

330
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,310
里面有個鏈接
with a link in it

331
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,260
是她網上的約會資料
to her online dating profile.

332
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,470
我無法相信
I couldn't believe it.

333
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,440
她已經在和別人交往了嗎
And she'd started seeing other people?

334
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,660
我不知道有沒有
I... I don't know if she started.

335
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,960
她只是在看有沒有更好的
She was just shopping around.

336
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,250
可能她一直都這樣吧
Maybe she'd been doing it the whole time.

337
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,340
-你和她聊過這事嗎  -聊過
- You talk to her about it? - Yeah.

338
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
大吵了一架
Big fight.

339
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,100
你對她動粗了嗎
You get rough with her?

340
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,860
沒  我不干這種事
Mnh. I don't have that in me.

341
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,480
我不會傷害女人  尤其是琳達
Hurt a woman? Especially not Linda.

342
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,930
她有解釋嗎
She have an explanation?

343
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,990
她不承認  不過她還能怎么樣呢
She denied it, you know, but what else was she gonna do?

344
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,270
我無法接受她腳踏兩條船  只好放手了
I can't take cheating. I had to let her go.

345
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,930
你知道資料是誰發給你的嗎
Mm-hmm. Did you know who sent you the profile?

346
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,790
-不知道  -你不好奇嗎
- No. - And you weren't curious?

347
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,060
我不知道  我...
I don't know. I...

348
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,060
某個人的女友和我同病相憐
Some guy's girlfriend's in the same boat as me,

349
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,620
有人心存怨恨
somebody's holding a grudge.

350
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,510
唯一重要的是  我配不上她
Only thing that mattered was I wasn't enough for her.

351
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,670
分手后  你沒再和她聯系過嗎
And after you broke up, you never spoke to her again?

352
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,660
沒
No.

353
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,810
我早該知道的
I should have known.

354
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,830
她很有頭腦
You know, she had smarts.

355
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,030
她會大有作為
She was gonna have a big life.

356
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,110
她怎么會想要我這樣的小人物呢
What'd she want with a mook like me, right?

357
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,660
有什么進展嗎
Do you have something?

358
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,930
這是別人傳給莫蘭的約會資料
Here's the dating profile somebody sent Moran.

359
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,760
{\pos(198.6,184.8)}東方海灣

360
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,080
查查這個交友網站
Get a hold of the dating site.

361
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,050
看是否有人在她失蹤前后聯系過她
See if anybody contacted her around the time she went missing.

362
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,040
我覺得琳達沒和人約會
I don't think Linda went on any dates.

363
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,090
為什么
Well, why not?

364
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,980
發送莫蘭這封電郵的地址
The address that sent Moran the e-mail

365
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,760
正是建立這個交友賬戶的郵箱地址
was used to set up an account with the dating site.

366
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,520
你找到了嗎
Did you find them?

367
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,290
算是吧  我登陸了賬戶
Sort of. I logged into the account.

368
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,990
你不需要密碼嗎
Don't you need a password for that?

369
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,590
我用最常見的密碼試了兩分鐘
I spent two minutes using the most common passwords.

370
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,920
是"Qwerty"
It was "Qwerty."

371
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,950
"Qwerty"
"Qwerty"?

372
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,850
Q-w-e-r-t-y
Q-w-e-r-t-y.

373
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,230
這是最常見的密碼第五位
It's the fifth most common password.

374
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,830
猜猜是誰的資料
Guess whose profile it was.

375
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
琳達
Linda.

376
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,750
那發給莫蘭資料的人就是創建賬戶的人
So whoever sent Moran the profile also created it.

377
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,450
對  資料是偽造的
Yep. Profile's a fake.

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,940
有人想拆散琳達和莫蘭警官
Someone was trying to break up Linda and officer Moran.

379
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,690
干得好
Nice work. Mm.

380
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,240
聽著  我知道你沒去成培訓計劃很失望
Look, I know you're disappointed about the training program.

381
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,080
我們明年送你去
We'll get you in next year.

382
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,360
沒事
It's fine.

383
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,440
伯特侖本應該打的得心應手
Bertram's supposed to be this real smooth player,

384
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,250
但他卻輸了好幾把牌
but he loses a couple of hands of poker

385
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,090
還惹惱了跟他打牌的人
and he has to bum everybody else out.

386
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,450
琳達想找一個"身材火辣的男人"
Linda wanted "A man with a super hot body."

387
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,470
你是在說偽造的交友簡介
The fake dating profile, right?

388
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,850
你剛才在說什么
You were saying something?

389
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,910
伯特侖把范佩爾給坑慘了
Bertram hanging Van Pelt out to dry.

390
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,000
他打牌輸了很多錢  就變得歇斯底里了
He's just mad because he's losing big money at poker.

391
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,610
有些人就是喜歡把他們的痛苦凌駕于他人之上
Well, some people like to push their pain onto other people,

392
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,520
軟弱的人  總是有人更軟弱的
weaker people, and there's always someone weaker.

393
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,000
這就是生命的輪回啊
That's just the circle of life.

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,180
好吧
Cheery.

395
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,440
里斯本  伯特侖不是想贏  是必須贏
Bertram doesn't want to win, Lisbon, he has to.

396
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,300
所以他才會在現在的位子上
It's why he is where he is.

397
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,220
對他而言  輸是不可忍受的
The idea of losing is just intolerable to him.

398
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,630
為什么會有人想拆散琳達和她男友呢
Why would somebody want to break Linda and her boyfriend up?

399
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,950
情敵
Romantic rivalry?

400
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,480
有可能
Yeah, possibly.

401
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,450
"我在找有頭腦  有肌肉  全面的男人"
"I'm looking for brains, brawn, the total package."

402
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,800
范佩爾試著追蹤電子郵件
Van Pelt's trying to trace the e-mail,

403
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,110
但毫無收獲
but she hit a dead end.

404
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,650
不管是誰做的肯定留下了線索
Well, whoever authored this left their fingerprints all over it.

405
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,100
"半吊子不行"
"No half-steppers.

406
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,140
"我在找一個真正的壞小子
"A genuine badass.

407
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,040
裝點我的小巢"
Feather my nest."

408
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,900
把人都喊來  里斯本
Gather the troops, Lisbon.

409
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,910
為啥
Why?

410
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,400
咱們來玩賓果游戲
It's time to play bingo.

411
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,710
我們從偽造的約會資料里提取了一些詞
So we have a list of words from the fake dating profile.

412
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,000
我們和學生們談談
We talk to the students

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,170
對比學生們的用詞
and compare what they say to the words in the list,

414
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,370
如果他們的用詞和列表上的詞相吻合
and if what they say matches up with the words on the list,

415
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,500
那他們就是偽造資料的人嗎
Then they're the one that wrote the profile?

416
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,740
你說的沒錯
So far, so good.

417
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,450
但我們怎么讓他們說出這些詞呢
But how do we get them to say the right words?

418
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,460
我們該問他們些什么
What do we ask them about?

419
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,070
讓他們不停的說話就行了
You have to try to get their words flowing.

420
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,610
-談談他們喜歡的東西  -喜歡的東西
- Talk to them about their passions. - Their passions?

421
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,290
當然是動物
Animals, of course.

422
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,630
蟲子  以及小動物
Bugs. Critters.

423
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,080
人們用"冷血"來表示邪惡
People use "Coldblooded" to mean evil,

424
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,770
就好像物種的體溫調節特性
as if a species' thermophysiology

425
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,890
能夠決定它們的道德屬性一樣
could determine its moral attributes.

426
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,970
這太荒唐了
That's ridiculous.

427
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,510
爬行動物永遠也發明不了原子彈
Reptiles never invented the atomic bomb.

428
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,330
要我說  恒溫動物才是問題的所在
If you ask me, warm blood is the problem.

429
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,210
明白我的意思嗎
Know what I mean?

430
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,350
失陪一下
Excuse me.

431
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,900
說說...骷髏吧
So... skeletons.

432
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
你為什么喜歡骷髏
Why are you into them?

433
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,590
為什么一定要有原因呢
Why do I need a reason?

434
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,140
我就當你是不正常了
I'll just go with "Weird."

435
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,120
這就像是在我們的五臟六腑之下
It's, like, under all this viscera we wear,

436
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,420
有一些很強壯  很干凈  
there's--well, there's something strong and--and clean

437
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,030
很美麗的東西  把它們組合在了一起
and--and beautiful that--that holds us together.

438
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,850
沒它們還真不行  我覺得這很酷
You can't lose it. I think--I think that's cool.

439
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,640
我通過了嗎
Did I pass?

440
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,040
我之前接受過精神分析測試
I've taken a psych test before.

441
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,790
簡先生
Mr. Jane.

442
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,710
我們剛才還談到了你
We were just discussing you.

443
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,620
帕帕達基斯院長和我說了你驚人的記憶力
Dean Papadakis told me about your impressive memory.

444
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,250
我現在的記憶力大不如前了
My own memory isn't as good as it used to be.

445
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,540
你有什么秘訣嗎
What's your secret?

446
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,090
不要忘記就行了
It's easy to remember when you never forget.

447
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,450
你在做什么
What you doing?

448
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,900
放置捕捉飛蛾的誘餌
Laying bait for moths.

449
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,780
它們喜歡甜味
They like sweetness,

450
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,460
所以我就用芝麻蕉和啤酒做餌
so I use brown bananas and beer.

451
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,670
真美味
Delicious.

452
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,420
保羅在這里發現了一個全新的飛蛾物種
Paul here discovered a new species of moth.

453
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,940
加利福尼亞綠玉蛾
The California Jade Moth.

454
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,820
在我們的博物館里就有展出
It's on display in our museum.

455
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,590
真是件了不起的大事
It's rather a big deal.

456
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,260
是啊  現在世界上的蕓蕓昆蟲又多了一種
Yeah. Now there are 1,500,001 types of insects in the world.

457
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,210
這謙虛可真假
Well, that's false modesty.

458
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,480
我想是的  這的確是件大事
I guess so. It is a big deal.

459
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,610
對研究蛾的人來說
To moth people.

460
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,370
是對我們大家來說
To all of us.

461
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,620
恭喜你獲得新發現
Congratulations on your new addition.

462
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
-謝謝  -令人印象深刻
- Thank you. - It's most impressive.

463
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,520
謝謝
Thank you.

464
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,260
讓我猜猜  你是在研究禿鷹
Uh, let me guess. You're studying buzzards,

465
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,290
而你還設好了陷阱
and you're laying a trap for one right now.

466
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,400
說的跟真的一樣
As if.

467
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,770
我研究的是"加州海獅的交配習慣"
Mating habits of the Zalophus Californianus.

468
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,970
海獅
Sea lions.

469
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,140
雄海獅靠打斗吸引一群雌海獅  像個壞小子
One badass male maintaining a stable of females through combat.

470
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,550
那很吸引你嗎  有個能為你大打出手的男人
And that appeals to you? A man fighting for you?

471
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,660
誰不想找個霸道的男人
Who doesn't want an alpha male?

472
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,590
一個會為他的東西大打出手的男人
A guy who will fight for what's his?

473
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,590
超級火辣
Yeah. Super hot.

474
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,410
聽起來不錯
Sounds exciting.

475
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,730
很酷的  當保羅在追逐蛾子
It's so cool. While Paul chases moths

476
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,410
而珍妮特和她的蜥蜴混在一起的時候
and Jeanette messes around with her lizards,

477
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,170
我正在海島間穿梭觀察海豹
I head out for the islands to watch the seals play.

478
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,350
我不光只有腦子  瞧見沒
I'm not just a brain, see?

479
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,170
我還喜歡玩
I like to play, too.

480
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,720
我是全方位的
I'm the total package.

481
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,200
壞小子  熱辣  全方位
"Badass," "Super hot," "Total package."

482
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,080
全中
Bingo!

483
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,630
全中
Bingo!

484
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,410
是你偽造了約會資料
You wrote the fake dating profile

485
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,470
導致了琳達和她男友分手
that made Linda and her boyfriend break up.

486
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,140
這也沒犯法啊  對吧
No law against it, is there?

487
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,230
也許她發現了是你干的
Maybe she found out it was you,

488
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,570
在實驗室里找你對質  接著事情就失控了
confronted you in the lab, and things got out of hand.

489
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,620
聽著  我沒殺琳達
Look--hello! I didn't kill Linda.

490
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,660
那你為什么要拆散他們
So why did you want to break them up?

491
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,450
你是不知道項目組里的情況
You don't even know what it's like in the program.

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,070
基德博士希望我們像歡樂的一家人一樣
Dr. Kidd likes us to play like we're one happy family.

493
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,920
但我們就像一群鬣狗一樣  撕咬著對方
We're like a pack of hyenas tearing each other apart.

494
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,900
為什么
Why?

495
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,950
為了錢  還能為什么
Money. Why else?

496
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,810
博物館里的東西可不是免費得來的
Look, the museum doesn't get all that stuff for free.

497
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,290
它需要各種發現  宣傳和捐助
It needs discoveries, publicity, donations.

498
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
基德博士希望我們的項目小組是最棒的
Dr. Kidd wants our program to be the best.

499
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,000
所以如果你沒有成果的話  再見了
So if you aren't producing, so long.

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,140
這話是什么意思
What does that mean?

501
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,110
你有沒有聽說過適者生存
You ever heard of survival of the fittest?

502
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,730
基德博士肯定聽說過
'cause Dr. Kidd sure has.

503
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,260
她會淘汰到那些沒有貢獻
She likes to weed out the ones who can't contribute,

504
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,690
不能勝任的人
who can't hack it.

505
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,990
但沒人能勝任  根本沒有
But nobody hacks it. Not really.

506
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,980
什么意思
What do you mean?

507
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,640
珍妮特  那個蜥蜴女
Jeanette? Lizard girl?

508
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,070
你以為她能留下來  她都要急哭了
She has a special place on the back stairs? She goes to cry.

509
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,890
格雷格去年出了大紕漏
Greg had a major breakdown last year,

510
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,200
比如把老鼠骷髏扔到了窗戶外
like throwing rat skulls out the window.

511
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,290
保羅呢  在他發現那該死的蛾子之前
And Paul? He was convinced Dr. Kidd was gonna fire him

512
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,150
他一度確信基德博士就要開除他了
until he discovered that dumb moth.

513
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,370
琳達呢  她是怎么應對的
How about Linda? How did she handle it?

514
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,160
她就像個機器
She was a machine.

515
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,820
我們都快瘋了  她卻什么事都沒有
You're losing your mind, and there she is,

516
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,430
一樣辛苦工作  卻毫不費勁
working just as hard, not even breaking a sweat.

517
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,160
而我呢  因為沒拿到
My mom wanted to kill me

518
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,150
院長的獎學金  我媽差點要殺了我
for not getting the dean's fellowship.

519
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,360
接著琳達遇到了她那個性感的警察男友
And then Linda lands that hot cop boyfriend?

520
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,590
就憑她
Her?

521
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,960
我是說
I mean...

522
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,340
看看
Right?

523
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,850
所以你偽造了約會資料想讓他們分手
So you made up the fake dating profile to break them up.

524
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,320
我只是想看看  我能不能傷到她
I just wanted to see if I could hurt her.

525
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,330
或者她能不能被傷害到
If she could even be hurt.

526
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,470
她知道是你干的嗎
Did she know it was you?

527
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,210
這件事毀了她
It wrecked her.

528
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,220
第二天  她做了一些很愚蠢的事情
The next day she messed up something stupid,

529
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,520
基德博士還朝她大吼來著
and Dr. Kidd yelled at her.

530
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,940
你知道嗎
You know what?

531
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,860
這讓我感覺真的很好
It felt really, really good.

532
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,660
我知道  這讓我聽上去像個壞人
And I know that doesn't make me sound like a nice person.

533
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,420
對  還真不是好人
No. No, it doesn't.

534
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
有點像"蠅王"的橋段啊
It's like "Lord of the Flies" over there.

535
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,030
{\an8}英國作家威廉·戈爾丁的代表作  借小孩的天真來探討人性的惡

536
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,620
我不知道原來科學世界是如此的殘酷
I didn't know the world of science was so cutthroat.

537
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,890
人們不是常說  因為風險極小
Well, like the man said, academic politics

538
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,940
學術政治也會充滿惡意
can be vicious, because the stakes are small.

539
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,390
事實上風險非常小
Very small, indeed.

540
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,330
明天早上我們回博物館一趟
Tomorrow morning we need to go back to the museum.

541
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,070
為什么
Why?

542
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,420
去教育
Education.

543
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,200
但現在我得做些事情
But now I have to do something.

544
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,200
檢察長很清楚  控告不會堅持到最后
And the A.G. knows damn well the indictment won't stick.

545
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,440
我現在沒空和你談
Uh, I don't have time for this.

546
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,920
天下沒有免費的午餐  這道理他懂
Nobody rides for free. I mean, he knows that.

547
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,390
怎么  你過來找我打撲克嗎
What--what, you came here to play games?

548
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
我聽說你輸得挺慘
I heard you've been losing,

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,020
還影響到了你的工作
and, uh, it's been affecting your work.

550
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,810
我再打給你
Uh, I'll call you back.

551
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,410
撲克根本沒影響我的工作
Look, the cards haven't been falling my way.

552
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,010
得了吧
Oh, come on.

553
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,690
你相信運氣嗎
You believe in luck?

554
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,010
不
No.

555
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
里斯本說你很厲害
Lisbon says you're pretty good.

556
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,540
瑪格麗特  取消六點的安排
Margaret, cancel my 6:00.

557
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,840
兩對
Two pair.

558
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:18,980
四條[四張同點]
Four of a kind.

559
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,850
瞧見沒
See?

560
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,280
我知道怎么玩撲克
I know how to play poker.

561
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,350
你當然知道
Of course you do.

562
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,440
你擅長玩弄人  而不是牌
You play the man, not the cards.

563
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,300
對吧  我懂機率  我了解我自己
Right? I know the odds, I know myself.

564
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,610
你了解人性  知道如何操縱他們
You know people, you know how to control them.

565
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,210
卻不善利用
Not that you always care.

566
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,940
什么意思
Uh... what's that mean?

567
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,430
要多抓蒼蠅  蜂蜜比醋有效
Well, you win more flies with honey than with vinegar,

568
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,610
但你卻非用醋
but you use vinegar anyway.

569
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,920
你是為里斯本來的吧
Is this about Lisbon?

570
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,890
你很喜歡虛張聲勢  是吧
You're very fond of the fake tell, aren't you?

571
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,430
你押注前  會四處張望  緩慢呼氣
Before you bet, you look away and you breathe out very slowly,

572
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,820
看似想讓自己平靜下來
like you're trying to... calm yourself.

573
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,340
沒錯
Yes.

574
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,050
其實你有破綻
Well, you have a tell inside the fake tell.

575
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,450
當你這么做的時候
When you're bluffing,

576
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,780
別人能聽見你的呼吸聲
the breathing is audible.

577
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,410
說什么呢  我能控制住自己
The hell it is. I-I control myself.

578
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,820
你拿到好牌以后  就像那樣呼吸
You get yourself a good hand and puff away like that,

579
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,660
曼徹斯特一定以為你在虛張聲勢
Manchester will for sure think you're bluffing.

580
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,130
相信我
Trust me.

581
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,740
簡先生  有什么可以效勞
Mr. Jane. Can I help you?

582
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,280
但愿吧  你還想學我的記憶訣竅嗎
I hope so. Uh, you still want to learn my memory trick?

583
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,050
當然
I would.

584
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,650
好  你要給琳達的同學們
Yeah, you teach a master class

585
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,300
上研修課的  是吧
with all of Linda's fellow classmates, huh?

586
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,210
今天下午的課  是我和保羅來上
Paul and I will be teaching it this afternoon.

587
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,400
這樣啊
Yeah.

588
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,020
那我給你和你的學生
Well, how about I put on a memory seminar

589
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,470
來場記憶講座如何
for you and your class?

590
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,560
再好不過了
That would be terrific.

591
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,090
不過你不是有謀殺案要破嗎
But don't you have a murder to solve?

592
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,460
來得及
Eh, all in good time.

593
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,710
我需要幾張桌子
Uh, I'm gonna need some tables,

594
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,200
大概三到四張排在那后面
possibly three or four across the back there.

595
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,190
好的
Okay.

596
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,180
還有  琳達的辦公室里有很多動物標本
And, uh, Linda's office, it's full of animals-- dead ones.

597
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,150
是的
It is.

598
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,840
那些也要  做道具用
We'll need access to that, uh, for props.

599
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,090
好的  我猜
Okay. I assume...

600
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,430
你這么做一定另有意圖吧
that you have some ulterior motive for all of this.

601
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,610
你們有懷疑對象了嗎
Do you have a suspect?

602
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,200
有件事我要向你求證一下
There's one thing I'd like you to confirm for me.

603
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,620
什么事
What is that?

604
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,430
北撲翅鴷以什么為食
Just what is the diet of the northern flicker woodpecker?

605
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,140
好的  當然
Yeah. Sure.

606
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,500
你怎么會喜歡三角龍
How can you like Triceratops

607
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,150
而不是霸王龍
more than... T-rex?

608
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,480
霸王龍都是廢物
T-rex are losers.

609
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,350
小胳膊小腿的  不過是長了牙的大型雞
Little arms. It's a big chicken with teeth.

610
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,100
是嗎  那三角龍根本就是長了角的豬
Yeah, and Triceratops is basically a pig with horns.

611
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,410
可它頭上長著盾牌呢
And a shield on its head.

612
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,860
分分鐘秒殺你那巨型雞
Beats a giant chicken any day of the week.

613
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,290
做夢去吧  簡有什么事
Ha ha, in your dreams. What did Jane want?

614
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,610
他叫我們回博物館去
He wants us back at the museum.

615
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,810
回去干嘛
What are we gonna do?

616
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,270
-搶劫博物館  -為什么
- Museum heist. - Why?

617
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,720
我早就不問這些問題了  走吧
I stopped asking questions a long time ago. Come on.

618
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,830
這是干嘛
What's this all about?

619
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,550
我們只是不想有任何遺漏  先生
We just need to cover our bases, sir.

620
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,220
這跟調查有什么關系
What does this have to do with the investigation?

621
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,870
我不能透露在辦案件的細節
I can't discuss ongoing details of an investigation.

622
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,000
我得看看這些蜘蛛
I'm gonna need to look at one of these, uh, spiders.

623
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,430
狼蛛嗎
The tarantulas?

624
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,670
孩子們  來看這些蜘蛛啊
Hey, kids, come check this out. Spiders.

625
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,070
對了  叫狼蛛
Oh, yes. The tarantulas.

626
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,680
我看沒必要吧
I don't see why it is necessary.

627
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,850
別擔心  先生  警方只是例行公事
Don't worry, sir. This is, uh, official police business.

628
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,070
你們一定想看看...
I'm sure you want to take...

629
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,720
等等  你要干嘛
Wait! What are you doing?

630
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,790
-我得近距離觀察一下這只蜘蛛  -不行
- I'm gonna need to take a close look at this spider here. - No.

631
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,300
就是這只蜘蛛
This one specifically here, this spider.

632
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,330
不行  不行  你要干嘛
No, no, what are you doing?

633
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,270
來吧
Here we go.

634
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,080
不行  求你了
Just-- no. Oh, oh, please.

635
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,140
多加小心
Be very careful.

636
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,640
來吧  太好了
There we go. Uh, yeah.

637
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,150
我看沒這個必要吧
I-I don't see why this is necessary.

638
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,660
別害怕  孩子們
Don't worry, children, it's...

639
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,180
好了  來吧
Uh, yeah... there we go.

640
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,230
等等  你在干嘛
Wait, what are you doing?

641
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,280
好了  我們得...
Yeah, we're gonna have to, uh...

642
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,020
-采集它的指紋  -什么
- dust this for prints. - Do what?

643
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,120
顏色真漂亮  是吧  孩子們
Oh, pretty colors. Huh, kids?

644
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
我被咬了
It bit--it bit me.

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,910
慢著  你說什么
Oh, wait. What?

646
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,380
我被它咬了
It bit me.

647
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,900
我去叫人來吧
Let me call somebody,

648
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
這個很危險
this can be a danger.

649
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,570
看  看見沒有  我死定了
Look. See? It's deadly.

650
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,030
我感覺怪怪的
It feels a little strange.

651
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,120
-什么都看不出來  -我頭暈了
- I don't see anything. - Oh, I'm feeling woozy.

652
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,750
沒有  我開玩笑的  我沒事
No, I'm just kidding. I'm fine.

653
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,920
別玩蜘蛛  孩子們  懂了嗎
Don't play with spiders, kids. Okay?

654
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,890
我們今天有福了
We've got a real treat today.

655
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,310
可以稱之為"現實版進化論"
You could call it "Evolution in Action."

656
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,600
派翠克·簡先生將給我們做一場
Mr. Patrick Jane is coming to give us a seminar

657
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,440
有關記憶力上限的講座
on the upper limits of memory.

658
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,200
-我們到教室了吧  -是的  到了
- Are we in the classroom? - Yes, we are.

659
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
太棒了
Great.

660
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,690
人類的記憶能力通常比人們意識到的要強
The human memory is far more capable than most people realize.

661
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,540
我之前進過這個房間
I've been in this room once before.

662
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,330
我當時來的時候
But when I was in here...

663
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,590
觀察了一下
I paid attention.

664
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,880
觀察得非常仔細
Very close attention.

665
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,320
謝謝  不過這只是記憶力方面的小兒科
Oh, thank you. Please. But that's just memory 101.

666
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,220
讓我們轉入高級課程吧
Let's move forward into the advanced coursework.

667
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,270
要想記憶力發揮作用
For memory to be useful,

668
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,290
就必須使其如照相機一般精準和迅速
it has to be as accurate and as fast as a camera.

669
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,930
你拿了多少動物  里斯本
How many animals did you get, Lisbon?

670
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,670
大概三十個
Around 30.

671
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,250
是從琳達的辦公室里拿的吧
And you got them from Linda's office?

672
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,070
是  沒錯
Yes, I did.

673
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,550
所有的動物都來自琳達的辦公室
All of the animals came from Linda's office.

674
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,590
之前我從沒去過那兒
That's a place that I have never been.

675
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,980
一會兒  我會回過頭
And in a moment, I will turn around

676
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,110
看我身后的東西  只需要幾秒鐘
and look behind me-- and just for a few seconds--

677
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,050
我就能按順序記住桌上的所有動物
and I will memorize every animal on those tables in order.

678
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,080
然后我會教你們如何做到這一點
And then I will show you how you can do the same.

679
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,410
誰知道你是不是已經背下來了
How do we know you didn't already memorize them?

680
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,290
有個懷疑論者  我該想到的
Ah. A skeptic. I should have known.

681
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,280
不過你說得對
And you're right.

682
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
你們沒道理要相信我
There's no reason for you to trust me.

683
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,400
保羅  你能不能把那些動物
Paul, would you mind rearranging the animals

684
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,490
按你認為合適的方式重新擺放
any way you see fit?

685
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,620
沒問題
Sure.

686
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,650
謝謝
Thank you.

687
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,710
人類的大腦
The human brain.

688
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,830
只要運用得當  就能異常高效
Once you get it working right, it can be incredibly effective.

689
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,490
我們的大腦能作出很多不可思議的事情
The mind can do some miraculous things.

690
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,290
比如  預知未來
Uh, like... telling the future.

691
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,340
正如我現在所做的一樣
Which is what I'm doing right now.

692
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
吹牛
Bull.

693
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,490
你要是這么說
For that...

694
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,440
就由你來拿著這個預言吧
You can be the one who holds the prediction.

695
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,660
科學就是預言  不是嗎
Science is about prediction, isn't it?

696
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,550
是以確實的數據為基礎的預言  不是算命
Predictions based on hard data, not fortunetelling.

697
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,940
表達不同而已
Ahh. Well, you say "Tomato,"

698
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,270
我認為科學家推崇理性思維
I say scientists believe in rational thought.

699
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,880
表格  列表  分類
And grids and lists and classification,

700
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,770
這些都沒問題  可世界不是這么運轉的
which is fine, but it's not how the world works,

701
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,430
當然大腦也并非如此運轉的
and it's certainly not how the brain works.

702
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,590
你是說人是非理性的嗎
You're saying people aren't rational?

703
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,210
保持理性只是一種手段
Well, being rational is a tool,

704
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,080
但并非我們掌握的唯一手段
but it's not the only tool we have.

705
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,780
早在我們把知識填進圖表前
Long before we stuffed our knowledge into graphs and charts,

706
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,090
我們就用上了很多古老的方式  有時候
we used older and, in some cases,

707
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,170
是更為有趣的方式來記事
more entertaining ways to remember things.

708
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,330
怎么樣了  保羅
How we doing there, Paul?

709
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,280
-好了  -太好了  請坐吧
- I think we're good. - Excellent. Please, take a seat.

710
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,770
現在  我要讓你們見識一下我的理論
Now, I'd like to show you what I'm talking about.

711
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,660
里斯本  勞駕
Lisbon, uh, would you mind?

712
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,230
多謝
Thank you.

713
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,910
我們可以在大腦中建造一座宮殿來幫助記憶
We can create a memory by building a palace in our minds.

714
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
我們可以給自己唱首歌
We can sing ourselves a song,

715
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,340
或是講個小故事
or tell ourselves a little story.

716
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,170
這是個惡霸的故事
A story of a bully--

717
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,040
一只灰色的狐貍
a gray fox--

718
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,900
和一個小個子勇士
and a little brave man--

719
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,040
一只老鼠
a rat--

720
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,290
他為他胖乎乎的兄弟癩蛤蟆
that stood up for his chubby little buddy the toad

721
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,160
和他的朋友蛋頭出頭
and his friend egghead.

722
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,130
接著是個穿燕尾服的男人的故事
The story of a man in a tuxedo

723
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,850
他在人群中鉆來鉆去
who snaked his way through a crowd

724
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,830
只為去見一位身著華服的女人
to meet a woman in a colorful dress.

725
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,760
企鵝  蟒蛇  三只松鼠  還有一只鸚鵡
Penguin, cobra, three squirrels, and a parrot.

726
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,550
接著是個關于飛行的故事
The story of flight...

727
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,150
貓頭鷹  蝙蝠  飛蛾
An owl, a bat, a moth,

728
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
全部...
All...

729
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,170
看來我說錯了
Ah, I sense I made a mistake.

730
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,830
沒有飛蛾
No moth.

731
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,310
也許我的預言能解釋我犯的錯
Well, perhaps my prediction will explain my error.

732
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,650
珍妮特  請讀出來  好嗎
Uh, Jeanette, could you read it out, please?

733
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,410
飛蛾在保羅的口袋里
"The moth is in Paul's pocket"?

734
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,920
等等  什么
Wait, what?

735
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,130
那只飛蛾
The moth.

736
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,900
那只你重新擺放動物時
The moth you stole from the table

737
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,400
從桌上偷走的飛蛾
when you were rearranging the animals--

738
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,730
在你口袋里面
It's in your pocket.

739
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,510
我需要你清空你的口袋
I'm gonna need you to empty your pockets.

740
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,540
快點
Come on.

741
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,580
讓我們看看
Let's have a look.

742
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,060
保羅  你拿這只飛蛾做什么
Paul, why did you take the moth?

743
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,570
那是只加利福尼亞綠玉蛾
That's a California Jade Moth.

744
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,590
-是的  -這物種是他發現的
- So it is. - The kind he discovered.

745
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,440
我以為唯一的一只收藏在博物館里
I thought the only other one was in the museum.

746
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,790
-那這只是從哪兒來的  -等一下
- Where did that come from? - Wait a second.

747
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,640
你說過所有的動物
You said all the animals

748
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,810
都是從琳達辦公室拿來的
came from Linda's office.

749
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,580
是從那兒拿的
They did.

750
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,480
保羅在琳達死后才發現了這種飛蛾
Linda died before Paul discovered the moth.

751
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,040
這飛蛾不可能是從她辦公室拿的
This moth couldn't have come from her... office.

752
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,660
你會想明白的
You'll get there.

753
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,570
除非  是她先發現的這種飛蛾
Unless... she discovered the moth first.

754
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,690
保羅
Paul...

755
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,920
不會是你殺了琳達吧
You didn't kill Linda.

756
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,270
對  就是他
Yes, he did.

757
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,180
但是  我承認
But, uh, I confess--

758
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,620
那只飛蛾不是我從琳達辦公室拿的
that moth didn't come from Linda's office.

759
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,580
我
I...

760
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,030
偷
s--

761
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,940
我從博物館借出來的
Well, I-I borrowed it from the museum...

762
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,660
為了證明我的觀點
to prove a point.

763
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,250
保羅
Paul.

764
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,070
之前我的論文被退稿了
I'd just had a paper rejected.

765
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,930
被同行評審打回了
Peer review threw it back at me.

766
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,600
基德博士非常失望
Dr. Kidd was so disappointed.

767
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,660
她從沒說過什么
She never said anything.

768
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,890
她也不需要說
She never had to.

769
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,060
琳達的死跟這些事有什么關系
How did Linda come into it?

770
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,780
那天半夜在實驗室里
It was late night at the lab.

771
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,660
她剛剛從森林里回來  非常興奮
Uh, she came in fresh from the forest, excited.

772
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,320
她看到她的一只啄木鳥正在吃一只
Uh, she'd seen one of her woodpeckers eating a moth

773
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,430
她說不出種類的飛蛾
that she couldn't identify.

774
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,940
所以她放了些誘餌并抓住了一只
So she put down some bait and caught one.

775
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,810
我們在她的辦公室找到了紅糖
We found the brown sugar in her office.

776
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,300
就是她的誘餌嗎
Was that her bait?

777
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,430
對
Yeah.

778
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,220
當我看到它的一瞬間我就知道這它是什么
I knew what it was the moment I saw it.

779
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,120
一個新物種
A new species.

780
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,240
它將帶來新文章
I mean, that's articles,

781
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,400
博物館展覽
that's museum exhibits,

782
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,830
為項目帶來資金
that's money for the program.

783
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,230
我看到未來由我自己命名這種飛蛾
I saw myself naming the moth.

784
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,100
我一直都想要給什么東西命名
I'd--I'd always wanted to name something.

785
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,830
我的工作岌岌可危
My job was on the line.

786
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,950
還有我的未來
My future.

787
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,840
我需要這只飛蛾
I needed it...

788
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,620
來度過難關
to survive.

789
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,270
我完全失去了理智
I just lost myself completely.

790
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,910
當我回過神以后
I came back to my senses,

791
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,160
把現場收拾干凈
I cleaned up,

792
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,210
在我們實驗室有很多種清理血跡的方法
lots of ways to clean blood in our lab.

793
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,200
然后  我讓蠕蟲來處理琳達
And then, I gave Linda to the worms.

794
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,280
之后我去了琳達之前
Then I went out to the part of the forest

795
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,360
發現飛蛾的
where I knew she'd been

796
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,470
那片樹林
discovered the moth.

797
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,560
然后回來將這一切據為己有
I came back and got my accolades.

798
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,060
我保住了我的工作
I saved my job.

799
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,780
得到了一切我渴望的東西
I got everything I wanted.

800
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,810
基德博士
Dr. Kidd.

801
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,610
請叫我索尼亞
Sonia, please.

802
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
我想要感謝你抓住了保羅
I wanted to thank you for catching Paul.

803
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,550
你不必客氣
Ah. There's no thanks necessary.

804
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,150
琳達死了  保羅進了監獄
Linda's dead, Paul's in jail,

805
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,160
梅根將被開除
and Megan is being expelled.

806
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,030
我想這個項目永遠不會恢復了
I don't think the program will ever recover.

807
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,170
項目并不是真實存在的
The program isn't real.

808
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,060
問題是  你能從中恢復嗎
The question is, will you recover?

809
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,150
我覺得非常無力
I felt so powerless.

810
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,040
我是說  面對死亡你又能做什么呢
I mean, what can you do in the face of death?

811
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,380
但是你并不軟弱無力
You're not powerless, though.

812
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,930
你會行動
You act.

813
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,900
至少你可以做這件事
Well, there's one thing you can do.

814
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,780
保羅通過命名那種飛蛾獲得了很多的榮譽
Uh... Paul took a lot of pride in naming that moth, when...

815
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,740
但實際上應該是琳達來命名它
When it should have been Linda who named it.

816
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,590
沒錯
Yes.

817
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,390
我會確保飛蛾將重新以她來命名
I'll make sure to rename it after her.

818
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,670
謝謝你
Thank you.

819
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,430
是我的榮幸
Pleasure.

820
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,500
對
Yeah.

821
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,620
講得通
Makes sense.

822
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,630
好男人都有主了
All the good ones are taken.

823
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,640
得了吧
Please.

824
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,590
我想是物競天擇
Natural selection, I suppose.

825
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,680
行啦
Come on.

826
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,320
再見  派翠克
Good-bye, Patrick.

827
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
再見  索尼亞
Good-bye, Sonia.

828
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,000
跟道金斯五百美元
$500 to Dawkins.

829

不跟
Nope.

830
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,500
我要
I'll, uh...

加注一百美元
raise $100.

832
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,070
看來我不得不再加注一百美元
Well, I'm just gonna have to raise you another $100.

833
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,370
你怎么就學不會呢  蓋爾
When are you gonna learn, Gale?

834

再加注一千美元

同花
Flush.

838
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,560
同花更大
Flush takes the pot.

839
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,490
"晚安  月亮"
"Goodnight moon."

840
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,490
{\an8}以下皆源自美國兒童讀物《晚安  月亮》

841
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,500
"晚安  星星"

842
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,720
晚安  大法官
Goodnight Judge.

843
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,590
你看到沒  你剛才看到沒
You see that? Did you see that?

844
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,330
同花嗎  非常帶勁
The flush? It was very nice.

845
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,700
我把他贏光了
Ah, I gutted him!

846
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,370
我也這么想
I would say so, yeah.

847
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,650
你很聰明  讓簡來給我上課
That was very slick, you having Jane give me lessons.

848
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,160
看來你真得很想幫范佩爾
You must really want to help Van Pelt.

849
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,340
簡到底做了什么
What did Jane do?

850
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,530
現在就不要再裝了
Oh, now there's no need to be coy.

851
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,160
我會給你回報的
I don't have a problem with a little quid pro quo.

852
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,310
白帽黑客項目  對嗎
The white hat program, wasn't it?

853
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
明早我就會批準津貼
I'll authorize the stipend in the morning.

854
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,440
謝謝你  長官

855
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,710

856
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,080
-還要謝謝簡  -我會的

857
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,050
一些科學家認為霸王龍
And some scientists think the T.Rex could run

858
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,070
一小時可以跑45英里[72.4公里]
up to 45 miles an hour.

859
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,770
它是頂級捕食者
That's apex predator.

860
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,240
-你知道這意味著什么嗎  -是的
- You know what that means? - Yes.

861
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,450
這意味著它們是食物鏈的最頂端
That means they're top of the food chain.

862
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,970
-它們能吃掉任何動物  -所以呢
- They eat everything. - So?

863
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,320
所以霸王龍比三角龍更強  我贏了
So... T. Rex beats Triceratops. I win.

864
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,460
你昨晚回家百度了恐龍
You went home last night and googled dinosaurs,

865
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,430
-是不是  -沒錯  我查了

你連生活都沒  我贏了
You have no life. I win.

867
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,320
我昨天欠她的
I owe her from yesterday.

868
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,910
她正在去機場的路上
She's on her way to the airport.

869
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,950
對  為了那個什么白帽項目的事
Oh. Yeah, for that white hat thing.

870
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,560
不是說沒有津貼嗎
I thought there's no money for that.

871
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,280
里斯本解決了
Lisbon fixed it.

872
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,760
要是能說聲再見就好了
Would have been nice to say good-bye.

873
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
對啊  膽小鬼可沒機會
Yeah, well, cowards don't get to say good-bye

874
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,350
說再見
when they want.

875
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,390
膽小...
Cow--wow.

876
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,200
你為什么這么說  你叫我膽小鬼
Where'd that come from? You calling me a coward?

877
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,190
沒錯
Yep.

878
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,230
此話怎講
How so?

879
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,720
你假裝沒有愛著范佩爾
How long have you been pretending

880
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,850
裝了多長時間了
you're not in love with Van Pelt?

881
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,220
誰說我愛著范佩爾了
Who says I'm in love with Van Pelt?

882
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,660
我很久以前有過  但之后再沒有了
I was once, a long time ago, but not anymore.

883
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,210
我們只是  只不過是  好朋友
We're just... we're just... good friends.

884
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,250
你是個膽小鬼和糟糕的騙子
You're a coward and terrible liar.

885
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,780
你胡扯
Uh... says you.

886
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,190
膽小鬼  他懂什么是戀愛嗎
"Coward." What does he know about relationships?

887
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,190
你就跟懷孕的妓女約會
Yeah, well, you date pregnant hookers

888
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,180
而且你的恐龍是吃草的
and your-- your dinosaur eats grass!

889
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,610
-早  -早上好
- Morning. - Good morning.

890
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,040
這段時間我們人手會不夠
We're gonna be short-staffed for a while.

891
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,350
范佩爾啟程去洛杉磯了

成人教育是很美好的事
Adult education's a beautiful thing.

894
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,680
說到這
Uh, speaking of which, uh...

895
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,440
我破壞了撲克游戲的生態系統
I've upset the ecosystem of the poker game.

896
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,160
我想你在博物館呆了太久了
I think you've been spending too much time at the museum.

897
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,430
"破壞了生態系統"
"Upset the ecosystem"?

898
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,370
全靠我  伯特侖現在牌技進步了
Bertram's now a better poker player because of me.

899
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,720
生態系統改變了  你要么適應它要么就死亡
The ecosystem has changed. You need to adapt or die.

900
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,200
誰說我需要幫助的
Who says I need the help?

901
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,750
別想跟我耍花招
Don't try to razzle-dazzle me.

902
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,420
有錢能使鬼推磨
Money talks.

903
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,820
我們用什么來做籌碼
What do we use for stakes?

904
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,440
沒有籌碼怎么打撲克
You can't play poker without stakes.

905
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,560
我已經搞定了
Oh, I have that covered.

906
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,430
食草動物算一  食肉動物算五
Herbivores are worth 1, carnivores are worth 5.

907
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,350

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,820
你在虛張聲勢  我跟注
You're bluffing. I call.

912
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,050
你確定
Really?

913
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,370
好吧  你出老千了嗎
Okay, are you cheating?

914
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,330
沒有
No.

915
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,820
