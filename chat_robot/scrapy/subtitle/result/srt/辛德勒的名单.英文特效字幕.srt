{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}whatever you do you could make other things, couldn't you?

105
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Field kits, mess kits.

106
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Army contracts.

107
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great.

108
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can make a fortune, don't you think?

109
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think most people right now have other priorities.

110
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Like what?

111
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sure you'll do just fine once you get the contracts.

112
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In fact, the worse things get, the better you'll do.

113
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, well, I can get the signatures I need. That's the easy part.

114
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.

115
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You don't have any money?

116
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Not that kind of money.

117
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know anybody?

118
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Jews, yeah. Investors.

119
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You must have contacts in theJewish business community working here.

120
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What community? Jews can no longer own businesses.

121
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's why this one's in receivership. But they wouldn't own it.

122
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product...pots and pans.

123
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pots and pans.

124
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Something they can use.

125
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want.

126
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everybody's happy.

127
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If you want, you could run the company for me.

128
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Let me understand.

129
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They'd put up all the money, I'd do all the work.

130
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What, if you don't mind my asking, would you do?

131
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd make sure it's known the company's in business.

132
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd see that it had a certain panache.

133
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's what I'm good at, not the work. Not the work.

134
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The presentation.

135
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sure I don't know anybody who'll be interested in this.

136
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, they should be, Itzhak Stern.

137
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tell them they should be.

138
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got a client who'll sell marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

139
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Wool, mink collar. It's a nice coat. She'll trade it for ration coupons.

140
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Wicks, for lamps. You have a truckload of wicks?

141
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What am I going to do with a truckload of wicks?

142
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nine by 12, nine by 14.

143
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You don't recognize this?

144
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's shoe polish.

145
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In metal containers?

146
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You asked for shoe polish.

147
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In metal containers. This is glass.

148
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's not what I asked for. What's the difference?

149
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's the difference?

150
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's the difference?

151
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My client sold it to his client who sold it to the German Army.

152
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Only by the time it got there, because of the freezing cold, it broke.

153
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All 10 000 units.

154
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is not my problem.

155
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is not his problem. This is not your problem?

156
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is not my problem.

157
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The German Army wants to find out where it came from.

158
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I am going to make sure they find out.

159
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Now it's your problem.

160
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You be quiet!

161
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Metal containers.

162
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pardon me for interfering, but that's a nice shirt.

163
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nice shirt.

164
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you know where I can find a nice shirt like that?

165
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Like this?

166
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's illegal to buy or sell anything on the street. We don't do that.

167
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're here to pray.

00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you have any idea how much a shirt like this costs?

169
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nice things cost money.

170
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many?

171
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm going to need some other things, too, as things come up.

172
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This won't be a problem.

173
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}From time to time.

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a good racket, Poldek. The only racket here.

205
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look, maybe I could put in a good word for you with my superiors.

206
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your superiors?

207
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, they are not as bad as everyone says.

208
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, they're worse than everyone says, but it's a lot of money.

209
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A lot of money.

210
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Give me my housing assignment.

211
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

212
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You look like a clown, you know?

213
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's a very important man. Just give him two minutes of your time.

214
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Since when did time cost money? Just sit down and listen.

215
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Please. Sir?

216
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For each thousand you invest, I will repay you with...

217
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Two hundred. 200 kilos of enamelware a month

218
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to begin in July and to continue for one year.

219
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}After which time, we're even. That's it. It's very simple.

220
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Not good enough. It's not good enough.

221
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Not good enough?

222
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look where you're living. Look where you've been put.

223
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"Not good enough."

224
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A couple of months ago you'd be right, not anymore.

225
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Money's still money.

226
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, it is not. That's why we're here.

227
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Trade goods that's the only currency that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

228
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Things have changed, my friend.

229
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Did I call this meeting?

230
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You told Mr. Stern you wanted to speak to me.

231
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm here. I've made you a fair offer.

232
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Fair would be a percentage in the company.

233
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Forget the whole thing.

234
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Get out.

235
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How do we know that you will do what you say?

236
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Because I said I would. You want a contract? To be upheld by what court?

237
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I said what I'll do. That's our contract.

238
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The standard SS rate forJewish skilled laborers is seven marks a day...

239
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}five for unskilled and women.

240
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is what you pay the Reich Economic Office.

241
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}TheJews themselves receive nothing.

242
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more.

243
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Are you listening? What was that about the SS?

244
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The rate? The what?

245
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}TheJewish worker's salary you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

246
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He gets nothing. But it's less.

247
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's less than what I would pay a Pole. It's less.

248
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's the point I'm trying to make.

249
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Poles cost more.

250
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Why should I hire Poles?

251
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}An enamelware factory over at, uh, Lipowa Street.

252
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It, uh, it, um...It's owned by a German.

253
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But it's outside the ghetto, so you can barter for extra goods...

254
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}for eggs, I don't know what you need with the Polish workers.

255
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can't get it here.

256
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Also, he's asking for ten healthy women for the...

257
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I am healthy.

258
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bring your sister, okay?

259
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You need to convince them you have a trade

260
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}something valuable to the war effort.

261
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Like what? What if you don't?

262
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a musician.

263
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your name goes on a list.

264
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And they put you on trucks...

265
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, no, no, that's not true.

266
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're a musician?

267
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yeah. I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

268
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm not going to hide like some animal.

269
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There are places to hide.

270
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a graduate of the University of Lwow.

271
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I used to work at the hydroelectric station in Roznow...

272
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Blauschein.

273
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm gonna get the necessary papers because this card is no good anymore.

274
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can stay in this line all day, you'll still get one of these.

275
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They are no good. You'll have to leave the line now then you'll get a blue card

276
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}a Blauschein, to say that you are an essential worker.

277
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll get these papers for you at Pankiewicz.

278
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pharmacist. Just there, look.

279
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Guess who is here?

280
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Poldek! Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

281
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Enjoying the lines?

282
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Need some shoe polish?

283
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In a metal container maybe?

284
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Not essential? I think you misunderstand the meaning of the word.

285
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No Blauschein, sir. Stand over there. Move. Next!

286
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What do you mean, "Not essential"?

287
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I teach history and literature. Since when it's not essential?

288
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's a metal polisher.

289
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It was not right? It's very good.

290
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's 53 years old. It's too new.

291
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're crazy. You left it in your drawer.

292
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many times have I told you?

293
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your work certificate you keep in your pocket at all times.

294
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And you leave everything in your drawer.

295
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many times I've told you?

296
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a metal polisher.

297
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Take the round sheet of tin...

298
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}dip it in soap emulsion.

299
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Then place it centrally in the press.

300
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We obtain the soup pot. The soup pot.

301
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Soup pot.

302
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Grosz, Mrs. Grosz, stay together.

303
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sir, I have ten work permits here for the Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik...

304
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}cosigned by Mr. Bankier and myself.

305
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If it's carbonized, clean it with a file.

306
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But don't touch both the electrodes at the same time.

307
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You'll get electrocuted. Here, have a try.

308
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Roll the metal under the press...

309
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}but be very careful unless you want your fingers...

310
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to become part of the teapot.

311
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Occupation?

312
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a writer. I play the flute.

313
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

314
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He can make tin pots. He can make tanks.

315
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He can make whatever Mr. Schindler asks.

316
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's highly skilled. Give him your card.

317
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Moses, give him your card.

318
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Now, dip the basin with the tongs into the enamel solution.

319
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And after swiveling it around, carefully place it aside to drip-dry.

320
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And whatever he asks you, allow me just to represent you and speak for you.

321
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Don't say a word.

322
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Filing, billing

323
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}keeping track of my appointments, shorthand. Typing, obviously.

324
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How is your typing?

325
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Uh, all right.

326
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Please.

327
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You need a secretary. Pick one.

328
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't know how.

329
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're all so qualified.

330
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You have to choose.

331
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Big smile. Big smile.

332
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If you would, look after my guest.

333
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Um, boxed teas are good. Coffee, pate, um...

334
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}kielbasa sausage, cheeses, Beluga caviar. Yes.

335
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And, of course, who could live without German cigarettes?

336
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Get me as many as you can find.

337
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And some more fresh fruit.

338
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The real rarities...oranges, lemons, pineapples.

339
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I need several boxes of Cuban cigars. The best. Yes.

340
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And dark, unsweetened chocolate.

341
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Not in the shape ofladyfingers, the chunk chocolate.

342
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes. Big as my hand, you sample at wine tastings.

343
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're going to need lots of cognac.

344
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The best, Hennessy.

345
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,000

365
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's factory on Tuesday of next week.

366
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My father was fond of saying, "you need three things in life.'

367
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"A good doctor, a forgiving priest...

368
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and a clever accountant.

369
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The first two...I've never had much use for.

370
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But the third...

371
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

372
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Is that all?

373
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm trying to thank you.

374
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm saying I couldn't have done this without you.

375
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The usual thing would be to acknowledge my gratitude.

376
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It would also, by the way, be the courteous thing.

377
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're welcome.

378
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Get out of here.

379
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Klonowska, who is it?

380
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

381
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know something? You would like her.

382
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oskar, please. What?

383
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't have to like her...just because you do.

384
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It doesn't work that way.

385
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You've done well here.

386
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,550

387
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Be careful of the step, miss.

388
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

389
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's not a charade, all this?

390
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How could it be a charade?

391
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The clothes, the car, the apartment. Wait a minute.

392
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Take a guess how many people are on my payroll., Oskar.

393
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My father, at the height of his success, had 50.

394
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got 350.

00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}To make pots and pans?

00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}To make money. For me.

398
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Does anyone ask about me?

399

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They won't soon forget the name Schindler here, I can tell you that.

402

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"He did something extraordinary.

405
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"He did something no one else did.

406
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"He came here with nothing...

407
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"a suitcase...

408
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"and built a bankrupt company into a major manufactory.

409
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"And left with a steamer trunk...

410
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"Two steamer trunks full of money...

411
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}all the riches of the world."

412
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's comforting to see that nothing's changed.

413
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're wrong, Emilie.

414
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There's no way I could have known this before

415
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}but there was always something missing.

416
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In every business I tried, I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

417
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Something was missing.

418
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Even if I'd known what it was, there's nothing I could have done about it...

419
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}because you can't create this thing.

420
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.

421
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Luck?

422
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}War.

423
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Should I stay?

424
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a beautiful city.

425
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I asked you if I should stay.

426
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's up to you.

427
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Promise me, Oskar, no doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

428
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler

429
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and I'll stay.

430
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Good-bye, darling.

431
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

432
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're doing well? Yes.

433
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Better this month than last? Yes.

434
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Any reason to think next month will be worse?

435
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The war could end.

436
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What? There is a machinist outside

437
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.

438
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Every day he comes. He's very grateful. It'll just take a minute.

439
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mr. Lowenstein?

440
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I want to thank you, sir...

441
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}for giving me the opportunity to work.

442
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're welcome. I'm sure you're doing a great job.

443
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The SS beat me up. They would have killed me...

444
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}but I am essential to the war effort, thanks to you.

445
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's great.

446
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I work hard for you.

447
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sure you do.

448
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll continue to work hard for you.

449
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's great. Thanks.

450
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}God bless you, sir. All right.

451
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You are a good man.

452
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He saved my life.

453
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, he did.

454
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}God bless him. Yeah. Come on.

455
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}God bless you.

456
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but you're running very late.

457
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is for the Obersturmbannfuhrer, sir.

458
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And this is for his niece, Greta. It's her birthday.

459
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}By the way, don't ever do that to me again.

460
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go. Go, go, drive! Don't bow.

461
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Did you happen to notice that that man had one arm?

462
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What? Did he?

463
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's his use? Very useful.

464
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How?

465
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Very useful! Success!

466
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We'll be late for work.

467
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}you shouldn't think of them as yours, Oskar.

468
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You need to understand that some of the officers here

469
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}don't give a damn about production.

470
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}To them, it's a matter of, um, national priority...

471
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}thatJews be made to shovel snow.

472
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:11,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar. You know it and I know it.

473
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Jews shoveling snow. It's got a, um, ritual significance.

474
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come with me.

475
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I am an essential worker.

476
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Essential worker?

477
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes.

478
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I work for Oskar Schindler.

479
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

480
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A one-armed Jew?

481
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Twice as useless!

482
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I lost a day of production, Rolf.

483
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I work for Oskar Schindler.

484
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Danka, look at the snow. Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

485
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I lost a worker. I expect to be compensated.

486
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}File a grievance with the Economic Office. It's your right.

487
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Would it do any good?

488
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Of course not.

489
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A big shot from the SS Budget and Construction Office came to lunch...

490
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and he told us that to believe theJewish skilled worker had a place...

491
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}in Reich economics

492
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}was a treasonable idea.

493
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

494
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He was a metal press operator.

495
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Quite skilled.

496
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Direktor? Shit. I don't believe it.

497
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Stern, is that you?

498
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern.

499
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Leave your luggage on the platform.

500
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Clearly label it.

501
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Given name first, then your surname.

502
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do not bring your baggage with you. It will follow you later.

503
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Leave your luggage on the platform.

504
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Clearly label it.

505
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Stern?

00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's on the list.

507
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He is?

508
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, let's find him.

509
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sorry. You can't have him.

510
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's on the list. If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list.

511
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm talking to a clerk. What is your name?

512
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sir, the list is correct.

513
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I didn't ask you about the list. I asked you your name.

514

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hauptscharfuhrer, this gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.

516
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My plant manager is somewhere on this train.

517
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production...

518
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and the Armaments Board will want to know why.

519
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Is he on the list?

520
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, sir.

00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:21,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, the list is correct, sir. There is nothing I can do.

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What is your name?

528
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think I can guarantee you you'll both be in...

529

00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Makes no difference to us, you understand. This one, that one.

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's the inconvenience to the list.

542
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's the paperwork.

00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I somehow left my work card at home.

00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I tried to explain them it was a mistake, but...

545
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sorry, it was stupid!

546
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What if I got here five minutes later?

547
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Then where would I be?

548

00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know...

00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}only to discover I was broke and sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to laugh.

555
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You are living behind walls.

00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You call that a villa?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Their synagogue, can you see it?

591
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's not a villa.

00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're planning to turn it into the camp stables.

608
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What? I can't hear.

609
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Helen Hirsch.

610
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}To work.!

611
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Take it down.! It is not safe.!

612
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She says the foundation was poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

613
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I told her it's the barracks, not the fucking Hotel Europa.

614
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Fucking Jew bitch engineer.

615
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You fucking bitch!

616
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Kommandant. The entire foundation has to be torn down and repoured.

617
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If not,

618
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}there will be at least a subsidence at the southern end of the barracks.

619
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Subsidence, and then collapse.

620
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And you are an engineer?

621
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes.

622
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My name is Diana Reiter.

623
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a graduate of Civil Engineering from the University of Milan.

624
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ah, an educated Jew, like Karl Marx himself.

625
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Shoot her. What?

626
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Kommandant, I'm only trying to do my job.

627
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ja, I'm doing mine.

628
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But, sir, she's foreman of construction.

629
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We are not going to have arguments with these people.

630
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No. Shoot her here, on my authority.

631
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It will take more than that.

632
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sure you're right.

633
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:53,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Take it down, repour it, rebuild it. Like she said.

634
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We have more to see, but we have only one more hour of light.

635
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Today is history.

636
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Today will be remembered.

637
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Years from now

638
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}the young will ask with wonder about this day.

639
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Today is history, and you are part of it.

640
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Six hundred years ago...

641
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}When elsewhere they were footing the blame for the Black Death

642
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Kazimierz the Great, so-called...

643
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:42,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}told the Jews they could come to Krakow.

644
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Chaja, bread. They came. Not that fat. No, less.

645
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They trundled their belongings into the city.

646
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, a bit less. They settled.

647
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They took hold. They prospered...

648
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}in business, science, education, the arts.

649
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They came here with nothing.

650
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nothing.

651
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And they flourished.

652
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow.

653
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Think about that.

654
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}By this evening...

655
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}those six centuries are a rumor.

656
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They never happened.

657
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Today is history.

658

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think we will start...with Ghetto B.

660
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All right?

661
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Start from both sides?

662
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I would like you to start there. The right side?

663
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The right side, yeah. And then move around. Okay.

664
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Gold, Chaim! Platz Chodi.

665
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Gold, Chaim!

666

667
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Shoot him.

668
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hey, little boy. Wie alt bist du, he?

669
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Na, wie hiesst du ? Wie heisst du, huh ?

670
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Was soll der Koffer hier?

671
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're getting out through the sewers.

672
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to check if they're clear.

673
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger than this.

674
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I can't go in the sewers.

675
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I told you I won't go in the sewers.

676
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can go.

677
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, you can.

678
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I won't go in the sewers.

679
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Move! Over there! Over there! Move!

680
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your card, Jew!

681
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Deine Papiere,Jude!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That line.

684
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Was soll denn die Scheisse? Bist du denn verrueckt geworden?

685
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mit diesem Scheissgewehr haettest du mich erschiessen koennen!

686
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Du hast so nah an mir vorbeigeschossen!

687
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Was heisst hier Entschuldigung. Du bist wohl verrueckt geworden!

688
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Zurueckbleiben! Zurueckbleiben!

689
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nicht sprechen,nicht sprechen! Einfach zu den Lastwagen gehen!

690
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Weiterlaufen! Weiterlaufen! Nicht sprechen!

691
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Komm her, du Judensau!

692
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bleib stehen, hab'ich gesagt. Bleib stehen!

693
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She's good as dead. Leave her.

694
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Give me a moment. Just let me bring her inside.

695
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can join her or join the line.

696
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Women to the left! Wilhelm! Rose!

697
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Men to right. Women to the left.

698

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Women to the left.

699
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

700

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Women to the left, and men to the right. Promise me, be safe.

701
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}your government is in the wrong country!

702
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mila!

703
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, God, Danka!

704
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You have a Blauschein. Blauschein doesn't matter anymore.

705
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They are cleaning out the ghetto. There's not enough room for you.

706
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What are you talking about? We tried it before. There's more than enough room.

707
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I changed my mind! Mama!

708
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,590

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I can fit the girl, but not you.

710
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mama, I'm coming out!

717
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}so there will be no obstructions to the thoroughfare.

718
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Finish and join the lines, little Polish clicking soldier.

722
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Don't worry, I'll go quietly. I'll be no trouble.

723
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:28,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, get under the stairs.

724
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They'll be done searching soon. You'll be safe there.

725

727
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've searched the building. There's no one here.

728

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}certain industries itself inside plaszow...

761

01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:31,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But it's private industry like yours that stands to benefit most...

764

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}by moving inside the wire of Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

773
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Only in the shoulders.

774
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Please, everybody, sit down.

775
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How are you doing? Oskar Schindler.

776
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We started without you.

777
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:02,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Fine. I miss anything good?

778
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I was explaining to Herr Bosch and Herr Madritsch...

779
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}some of the benefits of moving their factories into Plaszow.

780
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I meant the food.

781
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Since your labor is housed on-site, it's available to you at all times.

782
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can work them all night if you want.

783
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your factory policies, whatever they've been in the past

784
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}they'll continue to be. They'll be respected.

785
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to know, where do you get a suit like that?

786
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:29,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What is that? Is that silk?

787
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Of course.

788
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ja. It's...It has a nice sheen about it.

789
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you.

790
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Very nice.

791
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:42,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd say I'd get you one, but the man who made it is probably dead.

792
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't know.

793
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I go to work the other day.

794
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nobody's there.

795
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nobody tells me about this. I have to find out. I have to go in.

796
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everybody's gone.

797
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're not gone. They're here.

798
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're mine! Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

799
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Every worker that is shot costs me money. I have to find somebody else.

800
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We are going to be making so much money...

801
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}that none of this is going to matter.

802
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's bad business.

803
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you.

804
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Leave the bottle.

805
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Take that.

806
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Lena...thank you.

807
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:55,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Scherner told me something else about you.

808
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yeah? What's that?

809
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That you know the meaning of the word "gratitude."

810
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That it's not some vague thing with you...

811
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}like it is with others.

812
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You want to stay where you are.

813
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You've got things going on the side.

814
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Things are good.

815
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You don't want anybody telling you what to do.

816
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I can understand all that, you know. L...I know you.

817
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:35,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What you want...is your own sub-camp.

818
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you have any idea what is involved? The paperwork alone?

819
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You've got to build the thing.

820
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Getting the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

821
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Then the engineers show up, they stand around

822
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}they argue about drainage, foundations...

823
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}codes, exact specifications, fences four kilometers long

824
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}1,200 kilograms of barbed wire...

825
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}6,000 kilograms of electrified fences, ceramic insulators...

826
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}three cubic meters of air space per prisoner.

827
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.

828
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've been through it. I know.

829
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, you know. You've been through it.

830
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:14,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You could make things easier for me.

831
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd be grateful.

832
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Where's Stern?

833
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Goldberg and Chilowicz...make sure I see my cut...

834
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}from the, uh, factory owners in this camp...

835
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:09,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}leaving you to take care of my main account...

836
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}the Schindler account.

837
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He wants his independence. I gave it to him.

838
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But independence costs money.

839
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This you understand?

840
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look at me.

841
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:41,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Don't forget who you are working for now.

842
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Jawohl.! Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard.!

843
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ja. Now, girls, everyone.

844
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We need more wine. More wine!

845
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Stand on my friend. Don't let him leave.

846
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you, Herr Direktor.

847
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:37,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What are you doing?

848
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What? Scratching my head.

849
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Makes them think we have lice.

850
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Helps make them keep their distance.

851
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you have lice? Do you have your notebook?

852
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The calendar on my desk has the birthdays of

853
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}our SS friends' wives and children.

854
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Don't forget to send something.

855
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Record payoffs to the Main Administration

856
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and Economics Office, the Arm...

857
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Slowly, Stern, slowly.

858
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The Armaments Board, Governor General's Division...

859
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:02,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}of the Interior and Chief of Police as "fees"

860
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and make them on the first of each month...

861
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}as opposed to individual payoffs to our SS contacts.

862
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The list is in the lower drawer of my desk, which you...

863
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"First of month..."

864
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:15,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}SS contacts: List, lower drawer of my desk, which you handle...

865
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}as cash contributions to legitimate charities sent to each official's office.

866
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Dealings with our black market contacts

867
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}listed as suppliers in the legitimate ledger

868
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}are more complicated. Forget it.

869
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What do you mean, forget it? You can't forget it!

870
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It gives me a headache!

871
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I couldn't get you out of here.

872
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll be all right.

873
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Anyway, I'm here almost every week.

874
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll look in on you, see how you're doing.

875
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Here, put these in your pocket. Come on.

876
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Direktor, don't let things fall apart.

877
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've worked too hard.

878
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thanks for...Good luck.

879
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Achtung, Mutzen ab.!

880
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Work! An die Arbeit.!

881
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What are you making?

882
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hinges, sir.

883
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ja, I've got some workers coming in tomorrow. Where are they from again?

884
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yugoslavia, Herr Kommandant.

885
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got to make room.

886
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Make me a hinge. Yes, sir.

887
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Keep going, you're doing well.

888
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, that's very good.

889
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But I'm a bit confused, and perhaps you can help me.

890
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What I don't understand is that you've been working...

891
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}since I think, what, about 6:00 this morning?

892
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:25,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yet such a small pile of hinges.

893
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, Christ.

894
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}May I try that, sir?

895
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Check the angle lever. Maybe it's bent.

896
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, no. You wouldn't hear

897
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}a click if it was the angle lever.

898
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:03,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Maybe it's the pin. Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

899
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What did I just say? Here.

900
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Kommandant...

901
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:12,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I beg to report

902
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}that my heap ofhinges was so unsatisfactory...

903
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}because the machines were being recalibrated this morning.

904
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I w-was put on to shoveling coal.

905
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Strange, huh?

906
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you, Muek.

907
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather, it's just been oiled.

908
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Rottenfuhrer. Oh, for me?

909
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, thank you very much, Herr Direktor.

910
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}So the man can turn out a hinge in less than a minute.

911
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Why the long story? Hmm?

912
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you, sir.

913
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're welcome.

914
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nobody knows who stole the chicken, hmm?

915
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A man walks around with a chicken and nobody notices this.

916
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Save yourselves.

917
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tell him about the chicken.

918
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Still nobody knows.

919
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It was you. You committed this crime.

920
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, sir.

921
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But you know who, though.

922
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes.

923
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Who?

924
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Him!

925
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's very gifted.

926
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sure.

927
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bring him over.

928
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, Sir.

929
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you.

930
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you again, Herr Direktor.

931
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're welcome again.

932
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's an honor to work for such a great company.

933
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:15,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's great to have you.

934
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:19,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I promise to learn everything about enamelware production.

935
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's great.

936
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:34,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.

937
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I only need five minutes.

938
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.

939
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes. He won't see you.

940
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Please, sit down.

941
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pernod? Cognac?

942
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Uh, no. No, thank you.

943
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}So, what can I do for you?

944
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They say that no one dies here.

945
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They say your factory is a haven.

946
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:01,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They say you are good.

947
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Who says that?

948
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everyone.

949
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

950
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've been living in Krakow on false papers

951
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}since the ghetto massacre.

952
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My parents are in Plaszow.

953
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Their names are Chana and Jakob Perlman.

954
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They are older people.

955
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They are killing older people now in plaszow.

956
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They bury them up in the forest. Look...

957
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't have any money.

958
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:40,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I, I borrowed these clothes.

959
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm begging you.

960
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Please, please bring them here.

961
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't do that.

962
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You've been misled.

963
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I ask one thing: Whether or not a worker has certain skills.

964
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My father is an importer, not a metalworker.

965
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Such activities are illegal.

966
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You will not entrap me!

967
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Cry, and I will have you arrested. I swear to God!

968
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}People die. It's a fact of life.

969
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He wants to kill everybody?

970
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:24,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Great! What am I supposed to do about it?

971
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bring everybody over? Is that what you think?

972
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Send them over to Schindler. Send them all!

973
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:33,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}His place is a haven, didn't you know? It's not a factory.

974
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's not an enterprise of any kind.

975
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a haven for rabbis and orphans...

976
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and people with no skills whatsoever!

977
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You think I don't know what you're doing?

978
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're so quiet all the time. I know, I know!

979
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:53,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Are you losing money? That's not the point!

980
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:53,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What other point is...

981
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

982
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You have to understand. Goeth is under enormous pressure.

983
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You have to think of it in his situation.

984
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:09,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's got this whole place to run.

985
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's responsible for everything here, all these people.

986
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's got a lot of things to worry about.

987
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And he's got the war which brings out the worst in people.

988
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad.

989
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But in normal circumstances he wouldn't be like this.

990
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:30,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He'd be all right.

991
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There'd just be the good aspects of him which...

992
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He's a wonderful crook.

993
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...

994
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Killing.

995
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:45,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He can't enjoy it.

996
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bejski told me the other day,

997
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}somebody escaped from a work detail outside the wire.

998
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man's barracks.

999
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right ofhim.

1000
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:02,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol.

1001
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Twenty-five.

1002
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What do you want me to do about it?

1003
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nothing, nothing.

1004
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:19,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're just talking.

1005
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"Perlman."

1006
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Perlman!

1007
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:39,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Husband and wife.

1008
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1009
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Have Goldberg bring them over.

1010
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.

1011
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herr Direktor, I was just helping Lisiek to find something...

1012
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to clean the stains from the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1013
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go clean it. Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1014
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You don't have to report to me, Helen.

1015
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know who I am? Hmm?

1016
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm Schindler.

1017
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Of course. L-I have heard and...

1018
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:31,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}you have been here before.

1019
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:36,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Here, why don't you keep this someplace?

1020
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go on, take it.

1021
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I get extra food here.

1022
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:42,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.

1023
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:45,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Or give it to Lisiek.

1024
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Why not build yourself up?

1025
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}My first day here, he beat me...

1026
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:00,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}because I threw out the bones from dinner.

1027
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He came down to the basement at midnight, and he...

1028
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}he asked me where they were.

1029
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For his dogs, you understand.

1030
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I said to him, l...I don't know how I say this.

1031
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:27,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I never could say it now...I said to him...

1032
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"Why are you beating me?"

1033
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He said, "The reason I beat you now...

1034
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}is because you ask why I beat you."

1035
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know your sufferings, Helen.

1036
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It doesn't matter.

1037
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have accepted them.

1038
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Accepted them?

1039
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}One day he will shoot me.

1040
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, no, no, no, he won't shoot you.

1041
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know. I see things.

1042
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:08,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I...

1043
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door...

1044
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:18,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and down the steps by the patio right there below us and...

1045
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:23,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and there on the steps he drew his gun and he...

1046
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}shot a woman who was passing by.

1047
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A woman carrying a bundle. Through the throat.

1048
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Just...Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know.

1049
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She was no fatter or thinner...

1050
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}or slower or faster than anyone else...

1051
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and I couldn't guess what had she done.

1052
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The more you see of the Herr Kommandant...

1053
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by.

1054
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can't say to yourself, "If I follow these rules, I will be safe."

1055
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He won't shoot you because he enjoys you too much.

1056
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:09,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He enjoys you so much he won't even let you wear the star.

1057
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:13,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He doesn't want anyone else to know...

1058
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1059
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:24,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He shot the woman from the steps...

1060
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}because she meant nothing to him.

1061
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:33,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She was one of a series neither offending or pleasing him.

1062
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:38,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But you, Helen.

1063
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's all right. It's not that kind of a kiss.

1064
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you.

1065
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Right. The wine.

1066
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Wonderful party, Amon. Thank you.

1067
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Why do you drink that motor oil?

1068
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hmm? I send you good stuff all the time.

1069
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Your liver's going to explode like a hand grenade.

1070
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know, I look at you...

1071
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I watch you.

1072
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're never drunk.

1073
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, that's...that's real control.

1074
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Control is power.

1075
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's power.

1076
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Is that why they fear us?

1077
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us.

1078
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:13,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1079
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A man commits a crime, he should know better.

1080
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We have him killed, and feel good about it.

1081
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.

1082
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's not power, though.

1083
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:30,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's justice. It's different than power.

1084
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:38,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Power is when we have every justification to kill...

1085
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and we don't.

1086
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You think that's power?

1087
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's what the emperors had. A man stole something...

1088
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:50,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}he's brought in before the emperor...

1089
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy.

1090
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:57,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He knows he's going to die.

1091
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:03,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And the emperor...pardons him.

1092
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This worthless man. He lets him go.

1093
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think you are drunk.

1094
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's power, Amon.

1095
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That...is power.

1096
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:31,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Amon the Good.

1097
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I pardon you.

1098
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What do they want?

1099
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't know, but they're in my office now reviewing our books.

1100
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}As my accountant, tell me, should I be alarmed...

1101
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}that the auditors are reviewing my books? Well...

1102
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Or have you done your job properly?

1103
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You needn't be alarmed.

1104
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm sorry, sir.

1105
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you know how much this saddle is worth? Do you know how much it costs?

1106
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All right.

1107
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All right.

1108
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Stern, what the hell are you doing following me around?

1109
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:11,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She was smoking on the job.

1110
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tell her not to do it again.

1111
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to report, sir...

1112
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've been unable to remove the stains from your bathtub.

1113
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What are you using, Lisiek?

1114
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Soap, Commandant.

1115
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Soap? Not lye?

1116
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:03,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go ahead, go on, leave. Leave, I pardon you.

1117
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I pardon you.

1118
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Although I am not a rabbi, in these circumstances...

1119
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I pray to the Almighty that he will forgive me...

1120
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:24,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}if I intone the blessings.

1121
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}So this is where you come to hide from me.

1122
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I came to tell you...

1123
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}that you, um, you really are a wonderful cook...

1124
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and a well-trained servant.

1125
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I mean it. If you need a reference after the war...

1126
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd be...I'd be happy to give you one.

1127
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:42,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It must get lonely down here...

1128
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}when you're listening to everyone upstairs having such a good time.

1129
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:54,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Does it?

1130
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can answer.

1131
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But what's the right answer? That's what you're thinking.

1132
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What does he want to hear?

1133
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The truth, Helen, is always the right answer.

1134
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}YYes, you're right.

1135
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:24,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sometimes we're both lonely.

1136
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes. L...

1137
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I mean...

1138
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:41,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I would like so much to...

1139
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}reach out and touch you in your loneliness.

1140
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Wh-What would that be like, I wonder? I mean...

1141
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What would be wrong with that?

1142
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:56,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I realize that you're not a-a person in the...

1143
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:59,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}the strictest sense of the word, but...

1144
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, maybe you're right about that too, you know.

1145
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Maybe what's...what's wrong isn't...It's not us.

1146
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's no...It's this.

1147
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:18,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I mean, when they compare you to...

1148
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:23,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to, uh, vermin and to rodents and to lice...

1149
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I just, uh...

1150
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:36,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}NNo, you-you make a good point. You make a very good point.

1151
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:47,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Is this the face of a rat?

1152
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:52,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Are these the eyes of a rat?

1153
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hath not a Jew eyes?

1154
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I feel for you, Helen.

1155
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, I don't think so.

1156
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:39,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're a Jewish bitch.

1157
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You nearly talked me into it

1158
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}didn't you?

1159
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:51,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Bravo.

1160
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}On behalf of the...of the workers, sir...

1161
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:31,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I, I wish for you a happy birthday.

1162
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Happy birthday.

1163
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well, the staff, please. Thank you very much for the lovely cake.

1164
01:51:56,590 --> 01:52:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank you very much. Tell them thank you from me.

1165
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:20,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The trains arrived and the people were driven out with clubs.

1166
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:24,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They were lined up in front of two big warehouses.

1167
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}One was marked "Cloak Room," and the other "Valuables."

1168
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:30,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And there they were made to undress.

1169
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}AJewish boy handed them pieces of string to tie their shoes together.

1170
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They shaved their hair.

1171
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They told them it was needed to make something special for U-boat crews.

1172
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And then they were herded down a big corridor...

1173
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to bunkers with Stars of David on the doors...

1174
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and signs that said "Bath and Inhalation Room."

1175
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}SS gave them soap.

1176
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They told them to breathe all the time because it's good for disinfecting.

1177
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And then they gassed them.

1178
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Mila, why soaps?

1179
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}So that they would agree to go in, I think.

1180
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, Mila, stop it. Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1181
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I just don't believe it. Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1182
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't believe it either. I cannot believe it.

1183
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I didn't say I believed it. I said I heard it.

1184
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}From who?

1185
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}From somebody who heard it from someone who was there.

1186
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know, if they were there they would have been gassed.

1187
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:32,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes. It doesn't make any sense.

1188
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We're their workforce.

1189
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What sense does it make to kill your own workforce?

1190
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:43,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}To go to all this trouble of assembling a workforce only to...

1191
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, it can't be true.

1192
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We are very, very important for them.

1193
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Good night.

1194
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Good night. Sweet dreams.

1195
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Attention, attention.

1196
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:11,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everyone who is alive is to come to the Appellplatz.

1197
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Attention, attention.

1198
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:16,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We have to go to the Appellplatz.

1199
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The list makers are here.

1200
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There is going to be a selection.

1201
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Attention, attention.

1202
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everyone who is alive...

1203
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}is to come to the Appellplatz.

1204
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You could afford to lose some weight, Amon.

1205
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And you've got to cut down on the cognac.

1206
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Morning. What's going on?

1207
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's another semi-annual physical.

1208
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There.

1209
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, I've, um, got another shipment coming in of, uh, What are they this time?

1210
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hungarians. Oh, ja, Hungarians.

1211
01:55:19,150 --> 01:55:23,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We've got to separate the sick from the healthy to make room.

1212
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Let me help you.

1213
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look alive, Rebeka.

1214
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's my mechanic.

1215
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Whose bright idea was it to get rid of him?

1216
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, no, no. Wait, go away. She can work.

1217
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come here. Look, separate the sick from the healthy.

1218
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Those who can work and those who can't. She can work.

1219
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You can work, you can come.

1220
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:26,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Those not selected for transport

1221
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}put your clothes back on.

1222
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go back to the barracks.

1223
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:33,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Return to the barracks.

1224
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go back to the barracks.

1225
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, my God!

1226
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Olek? Olek? Danka?

1227
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:29,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Olek? Danka?

1228
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Danka?

1229
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:31,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Olek?

1230
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:36,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I didn't see him!

1231
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're hiding. I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1232
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know Danka. She knows a good place. She took all of them together.

1233
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:05,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Find your own hiding place.

1234
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There's no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1235
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:34,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Get out. This is our place. Get out!

1236
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oskar! Amon. Gentlemen. Why didn't you call me?

1237
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1238
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch. Oskar.

1239
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:08,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're running a little late. It's taking longer than I thought.

1240
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:10,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A drink? Something cold. Bowle.

1241
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The Bowle.

1242
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:18,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oh, another beautiful day.

1243
02:02:57,090 --> 02:03:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What do you say we get your fire hoses out here and hose down the cars?

1244
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Indulge me.

1245
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hujar.

1246
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, sir.

1247
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Go bring the fire hoses.

1248
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Where's the fire?

1249
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In the windows. That's it, that's it.

1250
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}On the roof. That's it, good, good.

1251
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:25,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In the window, in the window.

1252
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:27,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on. Come on.

1253
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:32,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's it, more, more.

1254
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:39,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's it, that's it. More, more.

1255
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is really cruel, Oskar. You are giving them hope.

1256
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You shouldn't do that. That's cruel.!

1257
02:03:47,190 --> 02:03:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, try and reach the far end. Look out...

1258
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Water.! More water.!

1259
02:03:58,210 --> 02:04:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got some 200-meter hoses back in Emalia.

1260
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have 20 meters at home in my garden.

1261
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:04,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We can reach the cars at the end.

1262
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What? What?

1263
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:13,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hujar. Yeah, sure.

1264
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Don't forget the roof. On the roof on the other side.

1265
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:46,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Water! Scharfuhrer, every time the train stops...

1266
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}you open the doors, you give them water, ja?

1267
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:51,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Jawohl. Ja. This car! This car!

1268
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:17,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm not saying you'll regret it, but you might.

1269
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You should be aware of that.

1270
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We will have to risk regret.

1271
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All right, sure. It's a nice day. I'll go for a drive with you.

1272
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:02,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What about you?

1273
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I violated the Race and Resettlement Act.

1274
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:09,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Though I doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me.

1275
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:12,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I kissed a Jewish girl.

1276
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Did your prick fall off?

1277
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He likes women.

1278
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:44,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He likes good-looking women.

1279
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't think.

1280
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}he has so many women. And they love him.

1281
02:06:57,450 --> 02:07:00,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ja, they love him. I mean, he is married, ja, but he's...

1282
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}All right, no. She was Jewish. He shouldn't have done it.

1283
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But you didn't see this girl.

1284
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I saw this girl. This girl was, woof...

1285
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:15,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}She was very good-looking.

1286
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:21,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They cast a spell on you, you know, theJews.

1287
02:07:21,170 --> 02:07:25,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}When you work closely with them, like I do, you see this.

1288
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:27,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They have this power. It's like a virus.

1289
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:29,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1290
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment.

1291
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is as real as typhus. I see this all the time.

1292
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a matter of money? Hmm?

1293
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're offering me a bribe?

1294
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:42,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}A bribe? No. No, please.

1295
02:07:43,310 --> 02:07:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a gratuity.

1296
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:46,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Heil Hitler.!

1297
02:07:50,690 --> 02:07:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hello, Amon.

1298
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:57,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sit down.

1299
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:03,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar.

1300
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You should kiss us, not them.

1301
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}God forbid you ever get a real taste forJewish skirt.

1302
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There's no future in it. They don't have a future.

1303
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's not just good, old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1304
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's policy now.

1305
02:08:52,910 --> 02:08:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}CHUJOWA GORKA APRIL, 1944

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Also los! Bewegung!

1309
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:08,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Can you believe this?

1310
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:11,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}As if I don't have enough to do, they come up with this?

02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.

1312
02:10:17,610 --> 02:10:18,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The party's over, Oskar.

1313
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're closing us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1314
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}When?

1315
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't know. As soon as I can arrange the shipments.

1316
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:27,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Maybe 30, 40 days. That ought to be fun.

1317
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've been talking to Goeth.

1318
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know the destination. These are the evacuation orders.

1319
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm to help organize the shipments, put myself on the last train.

1320
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's not what I was going to say.

1321
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I made Goeth promise me he'll put in a good word for you.

1322
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nothing bad is going to happen to you there. You'll receive special treatment.

1323
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The directives coming in from Berlin

1324
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.

1325
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'd like to think that's not what you mean.

1326
02:11:09,850 --> 02:11:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Preferential treatment.

1327
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do we have to invent a whole new language?

1328
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think so.

1329
02:11:18,850 --> 02:11:20,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're staying, I take it.

1330
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In Krakow? What on earth for? What for?

1331
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You have a business to run.

1332
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Of course, you'll have to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.

1333
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:34,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They cost a little more, but...

1334
02:11:37,450 --> 02:11:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What are you going to do?

1335
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:45,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You ran my business.

1336
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, I'm going home.

1337
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've done what I came here for.

1338
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1339
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Some day

1340
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}this is all going to end, you know.

1341
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:17,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I was going to say we'll have a drink then.

1342
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think I better have it now.

1343
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't understand.

1344
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I mean, you want these people?

1345
02:14:00,590 --> 02:14:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}"These people'"? My people, I want my people.

1346
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Who are you, Moses? Come on, what is this?

1347
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:07,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Where's the money in this? Where's the scam?

1348
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:08,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's good business.

1349
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:10,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's good business in your opinion.

1350
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1351
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:17,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pay for all that and build another camp. Doesn't make any sense.

1352
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:19,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look, Amon...It's good for me.

1353
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're not telling me something.

1354
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:24,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know them. I'm familiar with them.

1355
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't have to train them.

1356
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're not telling me something. It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1357
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's right.

1358
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's good for the army.

1359
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You know what I'm going to make? What?

1360
02:14:31,590 --> 02:14:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Artillery shells.

1361
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everyone is!

1362
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tank shells, they need that.

1363
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tanks shells, ja.

1364
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:38,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Everybody's happy. Except me.

1365
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You're probably scamming me somehow.

1366
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:44,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If I'm making 100, you've got to be making 300.

1367
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}If you admit to 300, then it's 400 actually.

1368
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But how?

1369
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I just told you.

1370
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You did, but you didn't.

1371
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Ah, ja, all right, don't tell me.

1372
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll go along with it.

1373
02:14:57,710 --> 02:14:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1374
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Look

1375
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:03,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.

1376
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:05,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's a person worth to you?

1377
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No, no, no, no.

1378
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:09,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's one worth to you?

1379
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:21,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Poldek Pfefferberg. Mila Pfefferberg.

1380
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}And, uh...

1381
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:28,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Uh, Stagel, Stagel Paul. Paul Stagel.

1382
02:15:28,030 --> 02:15:29,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Doctor.

1383
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The investors. I want all of them.

1384
02:15:34,730 --> 02:15:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, sir.

1385
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer. Fischer, Ismail.

1386
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Josef Scharf.

1387
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1388
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, Stern. Scharf, Scharf.

1389
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:52,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The children. All the children.

1390
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:59,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Herbert Stier. Thank you.

1391
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many?

1392
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:03,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}-400, 450.

1393
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}More, more.

1394
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:34,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Feigenbaum, Jakob. Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1395
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1396
02:16:44,350 --> 02:16:47,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Nacha, that's right. And Wolf.

1397
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many?

1398
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}-600.

1399
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:55,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}More.

1400
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:59,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}you can do the same thing I'm doing.

1401
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You might even make money at it. I don't know.

1402
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, Julius, I know about the extra food and clothes you give them.

1403
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Paid for out of your own pocket. If we make a combined approach...

1404
02:17:05,390 --> 02:17:08,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}we could get more than 4,000 out, mine and yours.

1405
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oskar...

1406
02:17:08,930 --> 02:17:11,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We could relocate them in something like safety, in Moravia.

1407
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't know.

1408
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:19,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How many cigarettes have you smoked tonight?

1409
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Too many.

1410
02:17:20,490 --> 02:17:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For every one...You smoke, I smoke half.

1411
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've done all I can.

02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In hopes of ensuring that

1616
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1617
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:18,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}without my authorization.

1618
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:27,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.

1619
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:31,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, come.

1620
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Come on, boys, come. Guck dir mal die Buddeln an!

1621
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No doorman or maitre d'

1622
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}will ever mistake you again.

1623
02:40:07,290 --> 02:40:09,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I promise.

1624
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:14,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Itzhak.

1625
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:17,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant. Itzhak...

1626
02:40:17,870 --> 02:40:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1627
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:20,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It's a pleasure.

1628
02:40:20,570 --> 02:40:22,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

1629
02:40:22,300 --> 02:40:23,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Very generous of you.

1630
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:23,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know.

1631
02:40:23,960 --> 02:40:26,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We need to talk when you have a moment.

1632
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}This is my wife, Stern. I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1633
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:32,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Oskar, please, attend to business. It's much more attractive.

1634
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Madam. Hello. What is it?

1635
02:40:34,040 --> 02:40:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We've received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board.

1636
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings...

1637
02:40:39,130 --> 02:40:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Apparently all of them have failed quality control tests.

1638
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}That's to be expected.

1639
02:40:43,480 --> 02:40:45,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans. This is a precise business.

1640
02:40:45,910 --> 02:40:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll write them a letter.

1641
02:40:46,970 --> 02:40:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They're withholding payment.

1642
02:40:47,990 --> 02:40:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sure, so would I, so would you.

1643
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:51,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I wouldn't worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1644
02:40:51,830 --> 02:40:55,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.

1645
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.

1646
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'll call around, find out where we can buy shells.

1647
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:07,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Pass them off as ours.

1648
02:41:07,250 --> 02:41:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I don't see the difference. Whether they're made here...

1649
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}You don't see a difference? I see a difference. You'll lose a lot of money.

1650
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Fewer shells will be made.

1651
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Stern

1652
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:14,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}if this factory ever produces...

1653
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.

1654
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Hello, madam. How do you do?

1655
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:36,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}How are you doing, Rabbi?

1656
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Rabbi!

1657
02:41:40,670 --> 02:41:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Good, Herr Direktor.

1658
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Sun's going down.

1659
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:50,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yes, it is.

1660
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:54,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What day is this? Friday?

1661
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}It is Friday, isn't it?

1662
02:41:55,800 --> 02:41:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Is it?

1663
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What's the matter with you? You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1664
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:07,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Shouldn't you?

1665
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:18,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I've got some wine. In my office. Come.

1666
02:42:57,160 --> 02:43:00,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}For the seven months it was fully operational,

1667
02:43:00,970 --> 02:43:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Schindler"s Brinnlitz munitions factory

1668
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:09,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}was a model of non-production.

1669
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:11,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}During this same period

1670
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:15,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}he spent millions of reichmarks to sustain

1671
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:19,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}his workers and bribe Reich officials. Gut Shabbos.

1672
02:43:30,970 --> 02:43:32,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}What?

1673
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:36,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Do you have any money, uh, hidden away someplace...

1674
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}that I don't know about?

1675
02:43:44,700 --> 02:43:46,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}No.

1676
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Why? Am I broke?

1677
02:43:57,820 --> 02:43:59,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Well...

1678
02:44:01,050 --> 02:44:06,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Yesterday morning, at 2.'41 a. M...

1679
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}at General Eisenhower's headquarters...

1680
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}General Jodl...

1681
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender...

1682
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}of all German land sea and air forces in Europe...

1683
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:26,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to the Allied Expeditionary Force...

1684
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.

1685
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The German war is, therefore, at an end.

1686
02:44:35,960 --> 02:44:37,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}But let us not forget for a moment...

1687
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I think it's time the guards came into the factory.

1688
02:44:45,180 --> 02:44:47,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Japan, with all her treachery and greed.

1689
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced.

1690
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:55,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}At midnight tonight, the war is over.

1691
02:44:56,860 --> 02:45:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Tomorrow you'll begin the process...

1692
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}of looking for survivors of your families.

1693
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:10,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}In most cases, you won't find them.

1694
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}After six long years of murder...

1695
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}victims are being mourned throughout the world.

1696
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}We've survived.

1697
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Many of you have come up to me and thanked me.

1698
02:45:28,530 --> 02:45:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank yourselves.

1699
02:45:31,930 --> 02:45:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Thank your fearless Stern...

1700
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and others among you who worried about you...

1701
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}and faced death at every moment.

1702
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:46,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1703
02:45:46,650 --> 02:45:49,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1704
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I'm a profiteer of slave labor.

1705
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I am a criminal.

1706
02:45:55,930 --> 02:45:59,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}At midnight you'll be free, and I'll be hunted.

1707
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight...

1708
02:46:04,790 --> 02:46:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}after which time, and I hope you'll forgive me...

1709
02:46:07,990 --> 02:46:10,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I have to flee.

1710
02:46:12,600 --> 02:46:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}I know you have received orders from our commandant...

1711
02:46:16,090 --> 02:46:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}which he has received from his superiors

1712
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}to dispose of the population of this camp.

1713
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Now would be the time to do it.

1714
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:26,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\i1}Here they are, they're all here.
