00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I don't write the questions. I just review the answers.

191
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,870

192
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, what is this for? What are you selling?

193
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's a game.      - A game?

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think of it as a great vacation. Except you don't go to it, it comes to you.

196
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of vacation?

00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'll participate without knowing...

202
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.

203
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Second, you don't have to decide today.

204
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the silly test, fill out the forms. One day, your game begins.

205
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You either love it or hate it. Decide then.

206
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we're like an experiential Book-of-the-Month Club.

207
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can drop out at any time with no further obligation.

208
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was my sales pitch.

209
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How long will this take?      - An hour for those,

210
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- an hour for the physical.      - Physical?

211
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a cursory examination. Turn your head and cough.

212
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be out of here in no time.

213
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Confused.

214
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Risky.

215
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bloody.

216
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoops.

217
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr Sutherland called.      - Make it Wednesday.

218
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Anson Baer called about tomorrow.      - Tomorrow?

219
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How much longer will this take?      - Not long, you're almost done.

220
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said that two hours ago. Put it back until tomorrow.

221
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...following emotional responses.

222
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does this thing end?

223
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.      - Don't worry.

224
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been terrific spending my entire day with your crack team.

225
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all down to this, an insurance company requirement.

226
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It states you're aware that The Game exists,

227
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're willing to participate in it.

228
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Payment is at your brother's discretion, dependent on your satisfaction.

229
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I'm not happy, he doesn't have to pay?

230
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've never had an unsatisfied customer.

231
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you mean "dissatisfied".

232
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. You're a left-brain word fetishist.

233
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Initials. And sign there. In blood.

234
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just kidding.

235
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, your copy will be at the front desk in this folder.

236
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And keep the pen.

237
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll let you know.

238
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Monday or Tuesday?      - Both bad.

239
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How about tonight?      - I'm working all this evening.

240
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wednesday's the only possibility right now.

241
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wanna do dinner?      - Okay.

242
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, I went to CRS.

243
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? What'd you think?

244
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, they seemed just a little bit disorganised.

245
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I did it in London, they'd been around a while.

246
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you gonna do this?      - I haven't decided yet.

247
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland.

248
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CRS won't go public. They're family owned.

249
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stranger things have happened.

250
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they haven't, actually.

251
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They opened here.      - The Game in San Francisco?

252
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? They're doing fine without any of us.

253
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A scotch and soda.

254
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nicholas, how are you?      - James, good evening.

255
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got new members here?

256
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I believe so, sir.      - Put their next round on me.

257
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha, sir.

258
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:06,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again.

259
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, speaking about games, I couldn't help but overhear you talking about CRS.

260
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The reason I mention it is I took the test today.

261
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Montgomery Street office.      - You did? Kudos.

262
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So yours hasn't started yet?

263
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet. That was one of the questions I had for you. What is it?

264
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is it?      - The eternal question.

265
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I envy you. I wish I could go back

266
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and do it for the first time, all over again.

267
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's to...new experiences.

268
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, I've gotta go. Night, Ted.

269
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nicholas.      - Nice to meet you.

270
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So you played recently?      - About a year ago.

271
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was working in Los Angeles.

272
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear the London office is very good, too.

273
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds like a lot of fantasy role-playing nonsense.

274
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know what it is?

275
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What it's all about?

276
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Chapter 9, Verse 25.

277
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...haven't been to Sunday school in a long time.

278
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."

279
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Nicholas.

280
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Best of luck.      - Good night.

281
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the Baer/Grant meeting...

282
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is not held tomorrow...

283
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it may as well not be held at all.

284
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When Mr Van Orton boards his plane on the morrow,

285
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he will have every agreement and addendum;

286
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the complete closing package, flawlessly revised.

287
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you'll miss another opera you would have slept during anyway.

288
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We now have an opportunity to show our client

289
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how well we will rise to his exhilarating challenge.

290
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

291
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  Nicholas Van Orton?      - Who is this?

292
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is Cynthia from CRS.      - How did you get this number?

293
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We've processed your application.      - I'm in a meeting...

294
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm afraid it was rejected.      - I beg your pardon?

295
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you.

296
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is ridiculous.      - Thank you for thinking of CRS.

297
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Anything wrong?      - No, nothing.

298
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may hang up, or press "pound"for more options.

300
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Connie, it's Nicholas. Give me a ring when you get in.

301
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:07,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, uh, regarding your birthday present; things are a little crazy right now,

302
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if I can fit it in my schedule.

303
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk about it at dinner tomorrow. Thanks. Bye.

304
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

305
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...resulting rise of unemployment

306
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and decline in viable small businesses.

307
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meanwhile, Republican leaders argue that its passage

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would be the very stimulant a sluggish economy needs.

309
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one has expressed an opinion as to how it will impact

310
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton.

311
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one thing on which both Democrats and Republicans agree

312
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that most Americans harbour serious doubts about the economic future.

313
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A recent poll suggests a staggering 57 per cent of American workers

314
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}believe there is a very real chance they will be unemployed

315
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}within the next five to seven years.

316
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what does that matter to a bloated, millionaire fat cat like you?

317
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stock markets rose both domestically and abroad

318
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after the announcement of stronger than expected earnings

319
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by several hi-tech companies, but dipped again after reports

320
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Nicholas Van Orton had sneezed.

321
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna spend the rest of the evening prying at that clown's mouth?

322
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...I don't...

323
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's frustrating for me if you don't pay attention.

324
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

325
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your game, Nicholas, and welcome to it.

326
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules.

327
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've received the very first key and others will follow.

328
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't know where you'll find them or how you'll need to use them,

329
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so keep your eyes open.

330
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you? You can see me?      - Let's save the questions till after.

331
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does this work?

332
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a tiny camera looking at you right now.

333
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's impossible.      - You're right. Impossible.

334
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're having a conversation with your television.

335
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's miniaturised.

336
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know how dangerous that is?

337
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Van Orton?

338
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And in domestic news, in southern...

339
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, Ilsa, what is it?      - Is everything all right?

340
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine...

341
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in a petroleum processing plant yesterday...

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've finished for the evening.

343
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you be needing anything else?      - No, thank you.

344
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good night.      - Good night, then.

345
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Several workers were injured...

00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who's that?      - Never mind who that is.

347
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know how a camera got into your home.

348
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I would.

349
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cold.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Colder.

351
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warm.

352
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warmer.

353
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Write this number down.

354
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,750

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But don't call asking what the object of the game is.

356
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Figuring that out is the object of the game.

357
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, and congratulations on choosing CRS.

362
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to be in 'Nam.

365
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

366
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

367
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

368
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bud?

369
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you help me out?

370
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need some toilet paper, I ran out.

371
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go into the next stall.

372
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, help me out.

373
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

374

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Didn't expect to see you here.      - I wanted to wish you luck.

376
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You been up all night?      - I checked it. Personally.

377
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I appreciate that. Go home and get some sleep.

378
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sure you don't want me along?      - No, I'll be fine.

379
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice shirt.      - Don't ask.

380
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ciao.

381
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these years...

382
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the first time ever you step foot in these offices,

383
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's to ask me to step down.

384
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised to meet the projections, Anson. $1.640 a share is what you said.

385
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think this visit comes as a surprise.

386
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The projections were too optimistic.      - Admittedly, yes.

387
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our EPS was 1540 last quarter. We are up eight cents per share.

388
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The expectations were ten. The expectations meant everything.

389
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you hold me to it over pennies?

390
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My stock is falling, I don't know about yours.

391
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those pennies are costing millions.

392
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares.

393
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today is what counts, Anson.

394
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You...You intractable son of a bitch.

395
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If your father could see you now.

396
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - Your father was a friend.

397
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A friend. Goddammit, I watched you grow up.

398
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you went fishing with my father, I should watch you throw my money away?

399
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I was...      - I'm not finished.

400
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You misspoke before when you said you're stepping down.

401
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am firing you.

402
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Action is taken, confidence is restored.

403
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The stock goes up.      - No.

404
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no Baer/Grant Publishing...

405
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Baer/Grant Publishing without Anson Baer.

406
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Stewart Grant? Probably out sailing, enjoying his golden years,

407
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wondering where the hell you are, Anson.

408
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

409
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You failed.

410
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have prepared a severance package that is more than equitable.

411
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valid until this evening.

412
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could fight you on this.

413
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate.

414
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Benefits shrink, options narrow,

415
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your compensation will be shrivelled.

416
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's in your best interest, Anson, to...

417
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess this is your lucky day.

418
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My lawyers will be in touch with you.

419
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, has Conrad Van Orton left a message?

420
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll check right away, Mr Van Orton.      - Thank you.

421
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry. Here.

422
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please don't do that.      - I'm so sorry.

423
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wasn't even looking. I'm really having a bad day.

424
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a bad month? You did almost the same thing to me last week.

425
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here.      - Don't do that.

426
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get me some napkins and some soda water.

427
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like the cleaning bill's gonna be more than the suit.

428
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

429
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It was an accident, sir.      - Terrific.

430
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said I was sorry.

431
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Asshole.      - Christine.

432
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr Van Orton is a valued customer.      - Fine. Then you kiss his ass.

433
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't you talk to me like that.      - I apologised, I offered to help.

434
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Clean out your locker.      - What?

435
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard me.

436
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm terribly sorry, Mr Van Orton.

437
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will this table suit you for a complimentary meal?

438
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be fine.

439
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll fetch your waiter.      - Thank you.

440
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check, sir.

441
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you and your vichyssoise, you little...

442
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss? Pardon me, miss.

443
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Great, it's you.      - I don't know how this works,

444
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but do you have something for me?

445
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, uh...

446
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I received this note.      - What are you babbling about, psycho?

447
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know what is going on.

448
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going on my second job this month,

449
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now it looks like I'm going on unemployment.

450
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I should try to explain...

451
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't explain, just fuck off.

452
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son of a bitch.

453
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to...I am apologising.

454
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus. What is this?

455
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's with him?      - He just fell down.

456
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, can you hear me? Do you know what to do?

457
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know if he's breathing.

458
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move your head. Don't stand there, get help.

459
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. It's okay.

460
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're gonna get help.      - How do we know he's real?

461
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's piss in his pants, is that real enough for you?

462
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Holy God.      - He's turning blue.

463
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police.

464
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You have to fill these forms out.      - I don't know this man.

465
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't get involved.

466
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have to detain you.      - Detain me?

467
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The report's gotta be filled out.      - She can do it.

468
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ride with your wife, we'll meet at the hospital. Two blocks away.

469
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not my wife.

470
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is insane. Ten minutes ago, I was enjoying a quiet little dinner.

471
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I received this note.

472
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's breathing, isn't he?      - Yes.

473
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the siren entirely necessary?

474
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

475
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just talk to someone who can get this over with.

476
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on.

477
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They need your driver's licence number.

478
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, no, you've got to be kidding.      - What is happening?

479
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I was trying to explain to you. This is a game.

480
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A what?      - It's a company.

481
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They plan elaborate pranks. I don't really understand it myself.

482
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? This is a?

483
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lights, they went out. A hundred people ran away.

484
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, so you mean the guy who just pissed himself and turned blue was?

485
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about that.

486
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be.

487
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are they involving you?

488
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's gotta be a...

489
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...fucking flashlight.

490
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great.

491
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that guy was gonna die. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

492
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you around.

493
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you know that's the way?      - I don't.

494
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you all go, you motherfucking frat boys?

495
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd better hide.

496
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lobby?

497
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brother got me this gift certificate to this company.

498
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I got the key out of the mouth of this...

499
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...wooden clown.

500
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind.

501
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like this.

502
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No signal.

503
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is the going rate for a "trapped-in-the-elevator" adventure?

504
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't even think about it.      - Why not?

505
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read the sign. "Warning, do not attempt to open if elevator stops."

506
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "Use emergency..."       - "...phone"? If there was one.

507
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"And wait for help." So, let's just wait for help.

508
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, I'll give you a boost.      - You can go first.

509
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not gallantry. If I don't lift you, how will you get up?

510
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. You pull me up.

511
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's easier my way. Step up.      - No.

512
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, please.      - I'm not wearing any underwear.

513
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? There, I said it.

514
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

515
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We can use this like a ladder.      - My hero. Let's go.

516
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

517
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

518
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it, my briefcase!

519
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll wait.

520
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not as if anybody could open it.

521
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait a minute. This is CRS.      - What's CRS?

522
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The company I was telling you about, that gave me the gift certificate.

523
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is their building.

524
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll wait for Security to come, and we'll just explain.

525
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll love that! Explain for both of us.

526
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

527
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

528
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't want to draw any attention. We're just out for a stroll.

529
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run.

530
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't fit down there!

531
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you trying to ditch me?      - I'm not responsible...

532
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not the one who started running!

533
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, I'm not the one that started this...

534
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get up there!      - I'm going!

535
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

536
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Climb. Climb.

537
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where's your modesty around attack dogs?

538
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up! Stupid fucking dogs.

539
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me guess. I go first.

540
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There goes $1,000.      - Your shoes cost $1,000?

541
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one did.

542
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, come on.

543
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out for nails and rats.

544
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There should be a fire escape.

545
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's classic.

546
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why me?

547
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

548
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas Van Orton.

549
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, a tsar or something?

550
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

551
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, if we drop from here,

552
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the garbage will break our fall.

553
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think not.

554
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful!

555
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck are you looking at?

556
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

557
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Table for two, please.

558
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?

559
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That tall, bright building? It's right near there.

560
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything okay, miss?

561
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. How are you doing?

562
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}San Francisco's finest.

563
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there some place I could throw this?

564
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a waste basket beside the desk.

565
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I have a fresh sweatshirt for you somewhere.

566
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'd be great.

567
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you've never even asked me my name.

568
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The maitre d' said your name was Christine.

569
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right.

570
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I'll call you a cab.

571
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You got a shower in your office?      - Yeah.

572
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You an athlete or something?

573
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:29,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm an investment banker. I move money from one place to another.

574
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, would you mind if I just quickly rinsed off?

575
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

576
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is there a towel I could use?      - Yeah, it's behind the door.

577
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh. I'll just be a second.      - No problem.

578
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I know the owner of the City Club.

579
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be happy to give him a call if you'd like.

580
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.

581
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, uh...

582
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a confession to make.

583
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:12,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone gave me $400 to spill drinks on you as a practical joke.

584
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? And what did they say?

585
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said 300, I said 4, they said "The guy in the grey flannel suit."

586
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I said "The attractive guy in the grey flannel suit?"

587
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello?      - Mr Van Orton? It's Maria.

588
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought I should call.      - What time is it?

589
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's 11.00. I rescheduled your meeting with Allison and Dietrich.

590
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'll be in there in an hour.

591
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:17,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you...I left my briefcase at 1019 Montgomery Street.

592
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you check with Lost and Found, please?

593
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anson Baer is at the Ritz Carlton. He's requesting dinner.

594
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll see about that.

595
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:30,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Hotel Nikko called to say they have your American Express card.

596
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You left it there last night?

597
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Should I send someone?      - Give me the number.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}people will care about my reputation?

638

01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:10,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the fact that you bring Conrad into this juvenile game is unconscionable.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you finished?      - No, I'm not finished.

654

658
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find out about a company called Consumer Recreation Services.

659
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds like they make tennis racquets. What do you know?

01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

797
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.

798
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess he was just on my mind.

799
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother loved your father very much.

800
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he just worked too hard.

801
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was he, uh...

802
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:10,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...morose? I mean...

803
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:15,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I remember most was that his manner was so slight.

804
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:21,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could spend time in a room and not know he'd been there the whole time.

805
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, what I mean is...

806
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- ...before he...      - What happened? No.

807
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody expected it.

808
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder how much of him there is in me.

809
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:36,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not much, I think.

810
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was Mother worried about him?

811
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody ever worried about your father.

812
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

813
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found the address from United Taxi.

814
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give it to me.

815
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

816
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christine, is she here?

817
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's sleeping.

818
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:05,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amy, who is it?

819
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing here?      - Can we talk?

820
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

821
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:19,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi.      - Hi.

822
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Didn't think I'd see you again.      - What can you tell me about these?

823
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this you?

824
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get them?

825
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My hotel room.

826
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was in my hotel room. Are you telling me this is not you?

827
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes you, um...

828
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- think this is me?      - The bra, the red bra.

829
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:48,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

830
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I thought that...

831
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I sit down for a minute?

832
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

833
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:02,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

834
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not all right, are you?

835
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it this contest thing that you're in still, or...

836
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I should go.

837
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's okay. I'll put some clothes on and be right back.

838
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have an aspirin?

839
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get you something to drink?

840
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this you?

841
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, that's First Communion.

842
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Show it to me.      - What's wrong?

843
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.

844
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

845
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're watching.      - What?

846
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not here. They can see.

847
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The smoke detector.

848
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say? Let's go for a drive or something.

849
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. I am tired of this.

850
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I am goddamn tired of this.      - We'll go for a drink, then.

851
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are?

852
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who do you think you are...Come on out of there!

853
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nicholas, please!      - Let's go.

854

855
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:18,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you've done it.

856
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

857
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So what are they gonna do?      - Get away from the window.

858
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the?

859
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is this?      - Wake up. It's a fucking con.

860
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in!

861
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right? Hold on.

862
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the car.

863
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:57,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I could've handed you to them.      - Get out of the goddamn car!

864
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a choice. No one else is gonna tell you what's going on.

865
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna know? 'Cause if I'm gone, you never will.

866
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:37,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe they didn't take the time to get the fucking house right.

867
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who are they?      - I don't know. Nobody does. I'm an employee.

868
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what good are you?

869
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know things like who you can trust and that your brother was in it from beginning.

870
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's a lie.     - Yeah?

871
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was your waitress on your birthday. Connie told you about CRS that day.

872
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever seen me in there before?

873
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. It wasn't his fault. I guess he thought it was his only way out.

874
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They fleeced him real good.

875
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How did they get to him?      - Same thing they did to you.

876
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

877
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You checked your accounts?

878
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That night in your office, I got the number to your private line and modem

879
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gave CRS remote access to your computer.

880
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You gave them everything else.      - What?

881
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took their tests. Handwriting, psych info.

882
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They used it all to figure out your passwords.

883
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feingold, the guy who signed you up,

884

887
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why else are they shooting at us?      - Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.

888
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they're finished with you.

889
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alive or dead's the same.

890

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as you disappear.

891
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guten Tag. Englisch, bitte.

892
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:55,800

893
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}9, 6, 9, 40, D as in David.

894
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The balance?

896
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's impossible.      - They already got it, Nicholas.

897
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got everything.

898
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the Sutherlands. Please leave a message.

899
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, I have checked them all.

900
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how, but they have drained my accounts.

901
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're trying to kill me. You call the cops.

902
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:38,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got one of them right here. We'll make her testify.

903
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know how this sounds, but you call me, on my cell here.

904
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you be careful.

905
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He, uh, cut your card in half, so...

906
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My treat.

907
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take two sugars, right?

908
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind.

909
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's not Christine. It's...I mean it's not my real name

910
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who fucking cares?

911
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.

912
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather not talk about it right now.

913
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All I mean is someone like you...      - How many times have you done this? I am curious.

914
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:04,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?      - These scams, con games. How many?

915
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lots.

916
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, whatever nickle dime bullshit you pulled in the past...

917
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is more than just me.

918
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is pension plans, payrolls.

919
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:17,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is 600 million dollars.

920
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes.      - Nick, it's Sam. I got your message.

921
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was disturbed to say the least.

922
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So what are we gonna do?      - I've been on the phone already.

923
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas, your funds are intact.

924
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's been touched.

925
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:47,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? I checked on them myself.

926
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who is it?      - I made the calls.

927
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's changed.

928
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am telling you not one cent is unaccount.

929
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is it?

930
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:00,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My attorney says nothing is missing.      - He's in on it.

931
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what the hell is happening, but stay where you are until I get there.

932
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sutherland's in on it.      - Nicholas, I have another call.

933
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me your precise location.

934
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas?

935
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta get out of here.

936
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did they get to him?

937
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:29,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did?

938
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't worry about it.

939
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

940
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:43,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's out of your hands.

941
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cellular calls can be intercepted.

942
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:14,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those calls you made to B of A France, B of A Switzerland, France, Switzerland...

943
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you were talking to us.

944
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You filled in the blanks, access codes and passwords.

945
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:26,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

946
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have it now so we're done.

947
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Nicholas.

948
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Embassy? American?

949
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

950
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things have happened and it's important...

951
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh.

952
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No money, no identification, no passport.

953
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:24,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to you?

954
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where to begin...

955
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's complicated.      - It always is.

956
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was on holiday alone and I was robbed by two men...

957
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robbed?

958
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What hotel were you staying at?

959
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:48,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I, um, don't remember. I, um...

960
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you gone to the police?

961
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't speak Spanish.

962
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I just need enough to get out of here.

963
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:03,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll help with the local law enforcement if you want.

964
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as money is concerned, can I make a suggestion?

965
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say you were mugged?

966
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they didn't take that watch?

967
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much is a watch like that worth?

968
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A couple of hundred at least.

969
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A man with a watch like that doesn't necessarily have a passport problem.

970
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:54,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

971
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I have your attention, please?

972
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

973
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:08,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody here going to San Francisco? I need a ride.

974
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got eighteen dollars and seventy eight cents...

975
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:21,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for a ride to San Francisco.

976
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody?

977
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep the change.

978
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conrad Van Orton. Could you ring his room, please?

979
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:26,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One moment, please.

980
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a problem?

981
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:33,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're here for Conrad Van Orton?      - Yes.

982
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:37,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm the hotel manager.      - Nice to meet you. Where is my brother?

983
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you come with me?      - Wait a minute. Is there trouble?

984
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:44,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, this is a private matter for you.

985
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were complaints by other guests, damage to his room.

986
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We did our best to accommodate his behaviour.

987
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:07,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- His behaviour?      - Yes, Sir. There was an incident a few days ago.

988
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A nervous breakdown, they said.

989
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police took him.

990
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They left this address in case anyone came.

991
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a hospital in Napa, sir.

992
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm terribly sorry.

993
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elizabeth, I need to borrow your car.

994
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nickie...

995
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what happened to you? I mean...

01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at you.      - What happened? I don't know.

997
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's things I have to do and I need your car.

998
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:57,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you can have it.

999
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't I get you something to eat?

1000
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you're the only person that I can trust?

1001
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone else...If Sam Sutherland calls, don't tell him you talked to me.

1002
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lie to him and whatever else happens...

1003
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coffee, English muffin and your water.

1004
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This bottle...is open. Who opened this bottle?

1005
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:27,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I opened it.      - I don't want it.

1006
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:33,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want an unopened bottle. I don't want ice, just the glass.

1007
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

1008
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:42,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nickie, talk to me. You're scaring me.

1009
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know what you're saying.

1010
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Liz, I don't mean to. I'm sorry.

1011
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinking the last couple of days, I've had some spare time...

1012
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:02,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I wanted to tell you that...

1013
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I understand why you left me.

1014
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know that I resented it.

1015
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to apologise to you for shutting you out...

1016
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for not being there.

1017
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you can forgive me.

1018
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're tired. You've been on the go for days.

1019
01:44:27,810 --> 01:44:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing to forgive.

1020
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:33,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pain sets in. The onset of a migraine headache.

1021
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this sounds all too familiar, relief is here at last.

1022
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You bastards!

1023
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taggarene. For nearly a decade...

1024
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you find me here?

1025
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:51,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taggarene is strong medicine for headaches, toothaches...

1026
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an actor.

1027
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you trust your doctor, trust Taggarene.

1028
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:01,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an actor on television.

1029
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:05,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some day I'll explain.

1030
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could I borrow your Yellow Pages?

1031
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay...

1034
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:40,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the car, fucker. Open the door and leave it running.

1035
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're making a mistake.      - Get outta the car.

1036
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:49,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get the fuck outta the car.      - I am extremely fragile right now.

1037
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New Moon...

1039
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He does commercials.      - You know how many customers we have?

1040
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know he ordered from you. It went to 14019 Montgomery Street.

1041
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can anybody help me?

1042
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's an actor, like one of these people you have up here on your...

1043
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:32,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, where are you taking my picture?

1044
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were hoping he could audition today. He would be perfect for this part.

1045
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-  This will break his heart.      - Well, is there any  place we can contact him?

1046
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:47,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, his beepers here on the table. He took the kids to the zoo.

1047
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:51,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The zoo? That's very very sweet. Which zoo?

1048
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one with the white tiger.

1049
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lionel Fisher, I love your work.

1050
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, please, can I? I got my kids.

1051
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get rid of them.

1052
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:11,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, guys. Snack time.

1053
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More snacks. Go, go, go.

1054
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:17,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, uh...

1055
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a job. Nothing personal.

1056
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:24,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know I mean... Play my part...provise a little, I mean...

1057
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's what I'm good at.      - I need to talk to who's in charge.

1058
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody knows. Nobody gets the big picture.

1059
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tammy, Alex, cut it out, Damn it, why do they do that?

1060
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The offices are empty. I need to find out where they are.

1061
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, they own the whole building. They just move from floor to floor.

1062
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you work for them, right? You can get me in.

1063
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, I can't.      - Yes, you can.

1064
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell them the police called. You got to speak to someone...

1065
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell them I'm gonna blow the whistle on them.

1066
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What whistle? There's no whistle.

1067
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is very dangerous.

1068
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:07,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you understand.

1069
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now...

1070
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I am extremely dangerous.

1071
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Michael, guys, come on, we're leaving.

1072
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we're here.

1073
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drive in.

1074
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do anyway? You won't get your money back.

1075
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care about money. I'm pulling back the curtain.

1076
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:52,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna meet the wizard.

1077
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1078
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's eyeing us like Tiffany Towers.

1079
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:03,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull in where they won't see you.

1080
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. Stay down.

1081
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not allowed to be here.

1082
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They called me back. I got a fitting.

1083
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's with me.

1084
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't need me.      - Shut up.

1085
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:48,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in there.

1086
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cuff him to the rail.

1087
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What floor?

1088
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fucked!

1089
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:23,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where?      - I told you they hired me over the phone.

1090
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where'd you pick up your cheques?      - It was a different floor.

1091
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Guess.      - This way. Sort of.

1092
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:31,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I...

1093
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy now.

1094
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh. This is gonna be a surprise.

1095
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:27,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck!

1096
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

1097
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back from the dead.

1098
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas, you're not about to shoot anyone.

1099
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn around.

1100
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:59,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna come with me.

1101
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, down!

1102
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:24,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?

1103
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

1104
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:45,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think you're doing?

1105
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell me!

1106
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:50,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's behind this? Who did this to me?

1107
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:52,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why?      - What do you mean, why?

1108
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How deluded can you be?

1109
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't you...It wasn't personal...

1110
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:59,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank.

1111
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:03,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on my radio, all right? You get your boss. Tell him I'm gonna shoot someone.

1112
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I going to call, Nicholas?  They won't do it.

1113
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, they will. Get someone up here because I'm gonna kill you.

1114
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll let me die. You're not in a position to threaten anyone.

1115
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:15,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get that?

1116
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1117
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gun. That's not an automatic.

1118
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

1119
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get the gun?

1120
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is my gun.      - We searched the house.

1121
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:29,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess you missed this.

1122
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a real goddamn gun up here.

1123
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:35,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is fake. It's part of your game.      - Don't start with me!

1124
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Listen to me!      - Don't you fucking start with me!

1125
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:40,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am telling you the truth now. This is all the game.

1126
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit, all right? Bullshit. I know what happened to that guy.

1127
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:43,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They shot that guy Feingold, Fisher.

1128
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:46,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Think about it. What'd you see?     - They killed him. I saw them kill him.

1129
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, what'd you really really see, this whole time?

1130
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Special effects. Squibs, like in the movies.

1131
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas, listen!

1132
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a real gun.

1133
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'll put it down!

1134
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fisher's behind that door. He's an actor.

1135
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're trying to kill me.      - No one's trying to kill you.

1136
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas. Please put that gun down. You're about to make the biggest mistakes of your life...

1137
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a safety net. The taxi, there was a diver.

1138
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We were shot at with blanks.      - That's not true.

1139
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:17,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is. It's what you hired us for.

1140
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne.

1141
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pleas, goddamn it. It's Conrad. Conrad's there!

1142
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your birthday party.

1143
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stop lying!

1144
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:33,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you.

1145
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you move.

1146
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a gun! Get back from the door!

1147
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shot him.

1148
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone call an ambulance!

1149
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead.

1150
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We thought you knew.

1151
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you let this get so out of hand?

1152
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wouldn't listen to me.

1153
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went through this over and over.

1154
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mark is your responsibility.

1155
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never, never let the mark take over.

1156
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1157
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:13,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I had a walkie-talkie.      - I used it.

1158
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to jail. We're all going to jail for the rest of our lives.

1159
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

1160
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas!

1161
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We got him. He's in the bag.      - He came in right on target.

1162
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:18,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand by for a further medical.

1163
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:21,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep them back until we clear away the breakaway glass.

1164
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Van Orton, Don't open your eyes.

1165
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is breakaway glass but it can still cut you.

1166
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm just gonna take a look.      - I'm gonna check your pulse.

1167
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it easy. That was quite a fall.

1168
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:15,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday, Nickie.

1169
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:28,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wh...What is this?

1170
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your birthday present.

1171
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to do something. You were becoming such an asshole.

1172
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, my brother Nicholas Van Orton.

1173
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing. I just wanted to tell you.

1174
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:51,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was the best ever.

1175
01:59:52,230 --> 01:59:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank God you jumped. If you didn't, I was supposed to throw you off.

1176
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to head home. I just wanted to say goodbye.

1177
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:05,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rachel, sweet dreams.

1178
02:00:07,950 --> 02:00:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Mel, for coming. Sorry about your car.

1179
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I left it at the zoo.      - No problem.

1180
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:22,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy birthday, Nicholas.

1181
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call you. I really will.

1182
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas, I haven't a clue what this is all about

1183
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:50,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but your taste in champagne is excellent, as always.

1184
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a great entrance.

1185
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, and I want you to know that what happened on Sunday was...

1186
02:00:55,460 --> 02:01:00,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, please. I've never been happier in my whole life.

1187
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thank you.

1188
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my wife thanks you.

1189
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for coming.

1190
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:10,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Sam.

1191
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:15,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's this?      - This is...

1192
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,640
