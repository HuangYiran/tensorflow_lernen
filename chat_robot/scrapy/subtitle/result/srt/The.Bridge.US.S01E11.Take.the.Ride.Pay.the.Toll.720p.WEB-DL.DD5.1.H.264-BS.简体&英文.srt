《边桥谜案》前情提要
Previously on the Bridge...

2
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,310
我们去哪
Where are we going?

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,850
有人吗  有人吗
Hello? Hello?

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,130
-格斯还活着  -何以见得
- Gus is alive. - Why do you say that?

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,800
他想让马可痛苦
He wants Marco to suffer.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,770
如果有人抓了你儿子你会怎样
What would you do if someone had your son?

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,820
丹尼尔・弗莱失踪了  丹尼尔帮忙包庇了那场肇事逃逸
Daniel Frye is missing. Daniel helped cover up the hit-and-run.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,510
就是戴维・泰特家的那场事故
David Tate's family.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,020
他说正因为这样凶手才一直针对他
He told me that's why he's been targeted all this time.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,790
离他远点  只管冲着我来
Leave him alone. Take it out on me.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,170
我不是正在这么做吗  你一个人来
Well, isn't that what I'm doing? Come alone.

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,670
绝对不要带上她
Entirely alone, leave her.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,760
别告诉任何人我去哪了
Don't tell anyone where I went.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,110
-马可在哪  -他接了个电话就走了
- Hey, where's Marco? - He got a call and left.

15
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,890
谁打给他的
Got a call from who?

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,220
带枪了吗
You have a gun?

17
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,130
-带了  -很好  我来开车
- Yes. - Good. I'll drive.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,080
杀了他
Shoot him.

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,940
我以为你只是想吓吓他
Thought you said we were gonna scare him.

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,800
我改主意了
Well, I changed my mind.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,550
不要啊  不要
Ah! No, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa..

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,730
你身上的味道可不好闻  小蒂
You ain't smelling too good there, Timbo.

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,170
有人吗  你好
Hello. Hola.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,370
这里有人吗
Anyone around?

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,870
天啊
Oh man!

26
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,040
该死
Oh, shit holy shit!

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,310
搞什么
What the hell?

28
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,250
冷静点  哥们  冷静点
Stay cool, bro stay cool, bro, stay cool.

29
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,320
我只是打算借这把佩德罗
I'm just gonna borrow this pedro.

30
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,720
搞什...
What the...?

31
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,470
放松点  蒂姆  要么干脆完全放松吧
Take it easy, Tim. Or don't take it at all.

第一季   第十一集

42
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,390
对于我妻子而言  痛苦是短暂的
For my wife, it was instant.

43
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,370
我知道你在想什么  别这样
I know what you're thinking. Don't.

44
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,000
我只希望儿子能活过来
I just want my son back.

45
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,540
车祸发生后  我儿子还活了十分钟
My son lived for ten minutes after the crash.

46
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,790
他叫迦勒  你记得吗
His name was Caleb, do you remember that?

47
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,690
很遗憾  戴维  很遗憾你失去了儿子
I'm sorry, David. I'm sorry you lost your son.

48
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,070
谢谢你
Thank you.

49
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,280
我能想象到他被压在车下  无法呼吸
I imagine him there. Under the car. Crushed. Unable to breathe.

50
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,310
-别说了  戴维  -我一直希望他那时
- Please, David. - I always hoped he was already gone, you know.

51
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,050
已经神游天外了  想着美好
In his head. Daydreaming about something nice.

52
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,740
温暖安全的事
Something warm and safe.

53
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,250
但我有种感觉  我深深地觉得
But I have a feeling, down in the utter bottom of myself,

54
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,000
对他来说并不是那样
that it wasn't like that for him.

55
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,300
我认为他孤独地死在一个寒冷黑暗的地方
I think it was like dying in a cold, dark place alone.

56
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,110
等着我去救他
Waiting for me to save him.

57
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,630
这是场意外  戴维  
It was an accident, David.

58
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,110
但我没露面  他独自一人死去
But I never showed up, he died alone.

59
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,120
大概就在这里
Right about here, in fact.

60
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,550
-你在干什么  -下车吧
- What are you doing? - Here we go.

61
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,650
你干什么  戴维
What are you doing, David?

62
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,300
准备好了吗  马可
You ready, Marco?

63
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,760
退后  全都退后
Get back! Go back! Back! Everybody back!

64
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,980
这人身上有炸弹  都退后
Tiene una bomba! He's got a bomb! Back!

65
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,430
把边桥炸了也于事无补
Blowing up the bridge won't solve anything.

66
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,200
-那要看了  -看什么
- Well, it depends. - On what?

67
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,250
你还想见你儿子  对吧
You still want to see your son, right?

68
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,150
我要听你说  马可
I need to hear you say it, Marco.

69
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,540
是的  我想见儿子
Yes. I want to see my son.

70
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,350
那就开始吧  把后备箱打开
Then let's get started. Open the trunk.

71
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,560
弗莱
Frye.

72
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,580
让他出来
Get him out.

73
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,220
你怎么来了  你该在医院的
You shouldn't be here. You should be at the hospital.

74
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,520
我得找到格斯
I need to find Gus.

75
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,300
马可现在跟泰特在一起  是吧
So, Marco's with Tate, isn't he?

76
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,280
回答我  桑娅
Answer me, Sonya.

77
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,690
是的  他去见他了
Yes. He went to meet him.

78
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,160
所以你决定瞒着我 
So you decide not to tell me.

79
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,550
事实上  你骗了我
In fact, you lied to me.

80
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

81
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,330
-桑娅  怎么了  -我也许知道他在哪
- Sonya, what is it? - I think I know where he is.

82
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,920
我得回沃尔特・钱伯斯家一趟
I have to go back to Walter Chambers' house.

83
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,720
桑娅  我们都查过了  什么都没有
Sonya, we've been all over that. There ain't nothin' there.

84
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,100
-我知道  我们遗漏了一些线索  -什么线索
- I know, but we're missing something. - Well, what'd we miss?

85
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,160
那个狗娘养的在美国境内的边桥上挟持着马可
That son of a bitch has Marco on the Bridge of the Americas.

86
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,300
他身上绑着炸弹
And he's got a bomb.

87
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,560
-格斯在吗  -不在  但丹尼尔・弗莱在
- Is Gus with them? - No, but Daniel Frye is.

88
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,340
-他会杀了他俩的  -不  这不符合他的复仇大计
- He's gonna kill them both. - No, it doesn't fit.

89
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,750
格斯也是其中的一部分
Gus is part of this, too

90
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,770
-我要去钱伯斯家  -库珀  跟她一起去
- I'm going to Chambers' house. - Cooper, go with her.

91
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,000
-我去边桥  有发现打我电话  -是  长官
- I'll be at the bridge. Call me if you find anything. - Yes, sir.

92
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,010
-给我一把枪  -我有好几把
- I need a gun. - I have several.

93
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,170
弗莱一直是泰特复仇大计的一部分
Frye's always been a part of Tate's game.

94
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,850
炸弹  电话  我猜想马可也是
The bomb, the phone calls. I'm guessing Marco is, too.

95
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,590
我不予置评
I'm not gonn comment on that.

96
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,490
一旦找到弗莱  这里就没你的事了
Hey, we found Frye, we're done here.

97
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
副队长  我能跟你一起去吗
Lieutenant, can I come with you?

98
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,840
-为了弗莱还是报道  -都有
- What, for Frye or the story? - For both.

99
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,320
-不行  你会妨碍警方办案的  -拜托
- No. You'll be in the way. - Please.

100
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,550
随你吧
Aw, hell.

101
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,010
搞什么  他妈的到底搞什么
What the hell's going... what the hell's going on?

102
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,060
你知道的  丹尼尔  你马上就要没命了
You know, Daniel. This is the end of your life.

103
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,190
放他走  这是你我之间的恩怨
Let him go. This is between you and I!

104
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,750
丹尼尔也牵涉其中  脱不了干系  不是吗
Oh, Daniel is a part of it. A big part, aren't you, Daniel?

105
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,580
-你疯了  泰特  -也许吧
- You're crazy, Tate. - Maybe.

106
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,170
你只要说出真相
But all you had to do was tell the truth.

107
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,610
记者就是这样的  但你却没做到
That's what a journalist does, but you didn't do that.

108
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,010
你俩都给我过去
Over there, both of you.

109
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,200
快点  快点
Come on. Come on

110
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,270
最重要的就是将那两个人救下来
This is all about getting those two men off the bridge alive.

111
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,970
明白了吗
Do you understand that?

112
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,660
-明白  -好
- Yes. - Good.

113
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,190
那就老实待着  别碍我的事
Then keep your mouth shut and stay out of my way.

114
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,420
我有正经事要做
I got a job to do.

115
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,090
-他提出什么要求了吗  -目前没有
- He made any demands yet? - Not yet.

116
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,230
-狙击手就位了吗  -是的
- Got snipers in position? - Yes.

117
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,300
-很好  能瞄准吗  -是的  长官
- Good. You got a shot? - Yes, sir

118
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,310
我的炸药一旦引爆
If this vest I'm wearing detonates,

119
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,860
你  我  弗莱  还有这座桥的主体
it'll tear apart me, you, Frye

120
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,820
都会灰飞烟灭
and most of the center of the bridge.

121
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,740
好吧  戴维  你是老大
Okay, you're in control, David

122
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,790
-已经瞄准  只等您下令  -不  等等
- I've got a shot. On your call. - No, hang-hang on.

123
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,280
炸弹已经激活  让狙击手待命
Bomb's live. Have your sniper stand down.

124
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,430
他已经激活了炸药
He's activated the dead man's switch.

125
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,150
-不许开火  -不许开火
- Hold your fire. - Hold your fire

126
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,720
他裹了炸药  现在他说了算
He's engaged the vest. He is in control now.

127
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:00,870
现在什么情况
What's happening?

128
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,680
事情很不乐观
There is no good outcome here.

129
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,100
只能两败俱伤
None.

130
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,180
我的拇指扣动扳机  我们就全玩完
My thumb comes off this trigger, we all die.

131
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,510
你也永远别想救格斯了
And so does any hope of saving Gus.

132
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,730
只要你告诉儿子的下落  你想干什么都行
Just do whateve you have to do and tell me where my son is!

133
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,950
别再玩这些该死的游戏了
And-and stop with all thes bullshit games.

134
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
拿出你的枪
Take out your gun.

135
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,320
很好  现在瞄准他
Good. Now point it at him.

136
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,910
他在搞什么鬼
What the hell's he doing?

137
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,980
-马可  -丹尼尔
- Mar... - Daniel.

138
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,240
你的儿子命在旦夕了  马可
Your son is dying, Marco, right now

139
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,140
现在你还有选择
You have a choice to make.

140
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,320
我儿子在哪儿
Where is my son?

141
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,740
想想后果  马可
Consequences, Marco.

142
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,430
丹尼尔・弗莱这个人渣死了
Daniel Frye, a waste of a human being dies,

143
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,710
你的儿子就能活下来
your son lives.

144
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,480
我想大部分父亲都会愿意一试的
I think most fathers would take that bet.

145
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,070
也许你得进监狱
Then maybe you'd go to jail.

146
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,020
不过要是在华瑞兹  你未必会蹲牢子
Maybe it's Juarez, and they look the other way.

147
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,600
但总之你救回了你的儿子  他活下来了
But you have your son, and life goes on for him.

148
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,500
现在杀了他
Now, kill him.

149
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,470
我不会这么做的
I'm not gonna do that!

150
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,800
杀了他  就能救格斯
Kill him, save Gus.

151
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,420
不要
No.

152
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,710
-格斯快要死了  马可  -我...
- Gus is dying, Marco. - I'm...

153
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,680
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

154
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,960
丹尼尔  告诉他你都干了什么
Daniel, tell him what you did.

155
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,340
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to.

156
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,580
那只是场意外
It was... it was a mistake.

157
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,060
你没有站出来  丹尼尔
You failed to act, Daniel

158
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,640
你什么都没做
You did nothing.

159
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
所以希望鲁伊斯警探能比你好点
Let's hope Detective Ruiz is made of better stuff.

160
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,030
怎么回事
Wha...

161
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,020
我不会这么做的
I'm not gonna do this!

162
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,690
他不正是你所憎恶的一切吗
Isn't he everything you hate, anyway?

163
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,170
就是因为他们华瑞兹才充斥着暴力
The reason your real Juarez is overrun with violence?

164
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,080
他们为了一己之欲来这里购买毒品
This... this is the man who buys those drugs

165
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,390
却完全漠视这片土地上发生的一切
and then sneers at the place he got them from

166
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,860
和无数死去的生命
and the people who died so he can pack his nose!

167
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,560
你在拖延时间
You're stalling right now.

168
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,990
我怎么知道我儿子还活着
How do I know my son is still alive?

169
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,630
你只能选择相信我
You're just gonna have to trust me.

170
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,370
毙了这满嘴谎言的家伙  我们就完事了
Now, shoot this lying piece of shit, and we'll be done.

171
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,560
我跟你不一样
I'm not like you.

172
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,700
你这样救不了任何人
You're not saving anyone.

173
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,090
丹尼尔
Daniel!

174
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,870
丹尼尔
Daniel!

175
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,070
我们已经搜查过了
We've searched this already.

176
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,750
这里什么都没有  桑娅
There's nothing here, Sonya.

177
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:15,920
帮帮我
Help me.

178
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,510
停下  停下  我来
Stop it, stop it. I got it.

179
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,160
-怎么了  这里什么都没有
- What? There's nothing.

180
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,790
-墙灰  -老天
- Plaster. - Jesus.

181
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,910
拉出来  快点
Pull it out. All the way out. Come on.

182
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,140
好了  小心
All right, watch out.

183
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,620
站开点
Step back.

184
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,420
这本应该是高尚的行为吗
Was that supposed to be the honorable move?

185
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,360
但却只能显示你的懦弱
'Cause it was the cowardly one.

186
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,380
说明不了什么
It doesn't mean anything.

187
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,310
告诉我他在哪里
Just tell me where he is.

188
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,740
你很快就会像我一样
You will be like me before this ends.

189
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,860
我可以向你保证这点
That I can promise you.

190
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,070
我知道四周都包围了狙击手
In seconds, the snipers that I know are posted everywhere

191
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,430
很快他们就会向我开枪
wil take my head right off.

192
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,630
你就再也不会知道格斯的下落
And you'll never know where gus is.

193
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,940
不 不 别开枪  别开枪
No, no, no don't shoot. Don't shoot!

194
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,550
别开枪
Don't shoot!

195
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,650
别开枪

196
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,310
大家都别开枪
Nobody shoot.

197
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,830
叫你的手下别开火
Have your men hold their fire.

198
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,620
不要开枪  不要开枪
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

199
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,810
格斯
Gus!

200
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,860
把枪拣起来  马可
Pick up the gun, Marco.

201
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,380
不拣吗
No?

202
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,550
你不是什么英雄
You're no hero.

203
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,620
阿尔玛跟我说了你和那女人干的好事
Alma told me what you did with that woman.

204
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,600
闭嘴
Oh, shut up!

205
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,850
你一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.

206
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,680
你的欲望摧毁了一切
Your appetites ruin everything.

207
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,430
破坏了家庭和别人的生活
Destroy families, ruin lives

208
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,610
这一切都只是因为你想爽一炮吗
All so you can get your rock off?

209
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,290
求你了  告诉我他在哪里
Just, please, tell m where he is.

210
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,530
他在一个黑暗的地方  马可
He's in a dark place, Marco.

211
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,210
一个冰冷  黑暗的地方
A cold, dark place.

212
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,160
很好  马可
Good, Marco.

213
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,790
很好
Good.

214
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,900
你知道迦勒是怎么死的吗
Do you know how Caleb died,

215
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,930
严格来说
technically?

216
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,130
他是在自己的血里被淹死的
He drowned in his own blood.

217
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,950
结束这一切吧  戴维
End this, David.

218
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,020
否则我会的
Or I will.

219
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,700
迦勒的肺被撞坏了  就在那边
Caleb's lungs were crushed, right over there.

220
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,940
救护车是五分钟后到的
Ambulance came in five minutes.

221
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,470
吉尔压根都没用上
It didn't even matter for Jill.

222
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,090
你知道那种感觉吗  马可
Do you have any idea what that's like, Marco?

223
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,460
失去一切的感觉
To lose everything.

224
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,900
失去你的妻子  儿子
Your wife, your son?

225
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,970
你不知道
No, you don't know.

226
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,230
你无法知道  马可
You can't know, Marco,

227
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,750
接到那个电话时的心情
what it's like to get that call.

228
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,240
还有亲眼去看他们
And to go see them.

229
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,490
我说了我很抱歉
I said I was sorry.

230
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,720
求你了
Please..

231
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,310
告诉我他在哪里
tell me where he is.

232
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,160
好吧
Okay.

233
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,570
-我需要跟马可谈谈  -桑娅
- I need to talk to Marco. - Sonya.

234
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,730
我得阻止他
I gotta stop him

235
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,570
没事  让她去
It's okay; leave it.

236
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,940
桑娅  小心
Sonya, be careful!

237
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,100
我儿子在哪里
Where is my son?

238
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,030
格斯已经死了  马可
Gus is dead, Marco.

239
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,110
马可  不要开枪
Marco! Don't shoot!

240
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,780
桑娅
Sonya?

241
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,120
桑娅  你找到他了吗
So... Sonya, did you find him?

242
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,180
他已经死了  马可
He's dead, Marco.

243
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,030
闭嘴
Shut up.

244
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,430
你有机会救他的  但是已经晚了
You had your chance to save him, but it's too late.

245
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,100
桑娅
Sonya!

246
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,230
马可  看着我  格斯已经死了
Marco, look at me. Gus is dead.

247
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,130
桑娅
Sonya!

248
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,310
他等着你去救他
He died in a cold, dark place,

249
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,260
却死在了那个冰冷黑暗的地方
waiting for you to rescue him.

250
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,150
现在你能做的只有一件事
And now there's only one thing left for you to do.

251
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,250
我找到他了
I found him!

252
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,450
我找到格斯了
I found Gus!

253
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,370
她在说谎
She's lying.

254
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,460
他在那栋房子里
He was in the house.

255
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,910
什么房子  桑娅
What house, Sonya?

256
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,510
钱伯斯的房子  他就在墙后面
Chambers' house. He was behind the wall.

257
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,290
他还活着吗
Did you find him alive?

258
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,220
把枪放下  马可
Put the gun down, Marco.

259
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,460
回答我
Answer me.

260
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,990
我儿子还活着吗
Is my son alive?

261
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,850
活着
Yes!

262
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,780
她不太会说谎  对吧
She's not a very good liar, is she?

263
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,510
桑娅
Sonya?

264
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,280
别杀他  马可
Don't kill him, Marco.

265
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,800
那正是他所希望的
That's what he wants you to do.

266
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,590
桑娅
Sonya?

267
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,710
求你了
Please!

268
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,690
我儿子要是活着就告诉我
Just tell me if my son is alive.

269
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,070
他还活着
Yes!

270
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,840
你找到他了
You found him...

271
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,530
但他还活着吗
but is he alive?

272
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,970
活着
Yes.

273
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,800
还活着
Yes!

274
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,070
桑娅
Sonya...

275
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,070
求你了
please tell me...

276
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,870
告诉我真相
tell me the truth.

277
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,690
我们去医院把你的手腕复位吧
What do you say we go to that hospital and get the wrist set?

278
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,880
好吧
Okay.

279
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,270
你冲到桥上去了
You went out on the bridge.

280
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,330
很可能被杀死

我觉得这是最正确的选择

如果是你  会怎么做呢  汉克

我真不知道我会怎么做
I can't honestly say what I would have done.

284
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,100
马可可能会杀了泰特
Marco would have killed Tate.

285
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,240
有可能
Yes, he would.

286
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,120
而你阻止了他

287
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,580
我不知道该跟他说什么
I don't know what to say to him.

288
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,850
去看看他

289

他现在正需要朋友

朋友
A friend?

你出院的时候穿

295

我不希望你在这里  桑娅

296
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,970
听我说  马可
I need you to listen to me, Marco.

297
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,360
我不希望你在这里  请出去

298
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,000
你听我说完我就走
I'm not leaving until you listen to me.

299
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,380
我尽力去救格斯了

300

但他当时已经死了

301
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,590
我对你说的
And I told you...

302
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,230
就是你想听到的
what you wanted to hear.

303
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,340
不然我该怎么做呢
What was I supposed to do?

304
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,410
你就
Just..

305
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,470
让我自己待会儿  拜托了
leave me alone, please.

306
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,250
我不会走的
I'm not leaving.

307
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,900
我们是朋友  马可
We're friends, Marco.

308
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,340
我只不过是照着你说的做
And I only did what you taught me,

309
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,780
是朋友都会这么做

310
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,000
朋友
Friends?

311
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160

Yes.

312
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,850
你阻止我开枪杀他
You stopped me from shooting him.

313
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,800
为什么
Why?

314
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,780
因为那正是他所希望的
Because that's what he wanted.

315
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,900
而你不是那种人

316
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,130
不  我正是那种人

我们不是朋友  桑娅
We're not friends, Sonya.

我不想再提起这件事了

我只想  一个人待着

他没什么朋友

情况很糟  对吧
It's bad, isn't it.

335
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,720
目前还不清楚

摔得挺重的
It was quite a fall.

337

他会好起来吗

什么时候能知道结果

这要取决于接下来的四十八个小时了
We'll have to see how he does over the next 48 hours.

342
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,610
我们就只能干等吗
So we just wait?

343

目前来说  是的
For now, yes.

停尸房

345
