00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,810
Hello,I'm America's Jane Lynch

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,340
In October 2012, on the
Paramount soundstages,

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,800
the cast and crew of Glee filmed a Christmas
episode entitled "Rough Trade Santa"

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,110
Upon viewing the director's cut,
Fox executivesrecoiled in horror,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,670
and then locked the episodein a lead
vault, where it languishedfor an entire year

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,010
A new,less-controversialChristmas
episode

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,100
containing an entire act
dedicated to biracial Judaism

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,560
was rushed into productionand
aired in its place

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,060
After a year of pleasfrom
fans all over the world,

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,580
the episode will now
air... with several edits

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,550
Gone is an entire subplot involving
Blaine and hisobsession with Yule logs

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,490
Lost forever areseveral
scenes explaining

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,370
why Will Schuester abandoned his
Washington dreams to come back

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,230
and teach his merry band
of miscreants and losers

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,450
So,sit back,relax, have
some eggnog and enjoy,

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,060
if you dare-- the never-aired
Glee Christmas episode

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,900
We're going green,guys

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,900
I refuse to give up my wig and
weave-aerosolizedluster spray

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,330
Okay,you're fine,Unique

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,350
This year's theme for the 50th Annual McKinley
Classroom Decorating contest is... "Green is Good"

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,710
Sam,Tina

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,340
All right,well,as seniors,Mr Shue asked us to
take over the ,decorating committee this year,

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,760
so we're gonna need everyone'shelp
in order to win this thing

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,820
Oh,and we will win

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,780
Because first prize is an antique glass
angel, hand-blown thousandsof years ago

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,580
This holy glass ornament issaid to
have magical powers to bring good luck,

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,460
and possibly a boyfriend or prom
queen dreamsto whoever she oversees

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,950
And that person will be me

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,800
don't we all getto share the prize

30
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,330
We're going au naturelthis year

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,550
We're gonna get pine cones,LED lights

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Are we getting those
from the LED bush out back

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,330
This is exactlythe kind of
in-fighting that will make us lose,

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,430
and I'm not gonna stand for it

35
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,840
Guys,this is serious

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,250
Cancel your plansfor the entire month

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,570
I don't want to hear about any
of you caroling in nursing homes

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
or feeding the homeless
or giving toys to tots

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,540
Every waking thought willbe spent figuring
out how to win me that stupid angel

40
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,170
- Got it
- Well

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,310
Merry Christmas,everyone

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,880
- Joy to the...
- Shut up,Blaine

43

45
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,900
The McKinley HighNon-Denominational
Christmas Club meetingis now called to order

46
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,940
Vice President Artie
Abrams has the floor

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,640
This Christmas club looksan
awful lot like Glee Club

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,570
Nobody panic

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
But Principal Figginsjust informed me

50
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,780
that McKinley's outdoor
mangerscene has been defaced

51
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,650
with swastikasand with Satanic symbols

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,050
And Baby Jesus was found
stuffeddown Figgins' chimney

53
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,720
Oh,my God,that's horrible

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,750
Christmas is canceled

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,880
Not quite yet,Tina

56
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,900
Figgins askedthe Christmas Club to
step in... and do a living nativity

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,550
Christmas is saved

58
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,400
And Artie and I have decided
that Jake should play Joseph

59
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,750
I mean... Joseph was a darkly tanned Jew

60
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,300
Thank you

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,880
I call dibs on arguablythe most important
female role in the history of the world

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,660
- The Virgin Mary
- You can't

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,430
You're black,and you'd crush the donkey

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,420
I'm a virgin

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,000
That's a shocker

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,940
To think nobody's tickled inside of
your musty,mildewed granny panties

67
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,960
except for the familyof
crickets that nest in there

68
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,410
Yeah,well... you weara
smaller bra than me

69
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,010
All right,girls,come on,okay

70
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,460
It's Christmas,andwe've got a show to do

71
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,330
Wait,are manger scenes
evenallowed on school property

72
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,150
Auditions are tomorrow

73
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,550
Mmm,what is it.What is it.Oh,my gosh

74
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,050
It's My Pretty Princess
Deluxe-All-Jazzed-UpStyling Head

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,780
Aw,Santana,I love it.Thank you so much

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,450
Oh,I had one of these when I was ten

77
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,370
And I was obsessed with her

78
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,040
I-I gave this ladysmoky eyes every day

79
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,910
Well,merry Christmas,Lady Hummel

80
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,940
Now you can relive allyour Jeffrey Dahmer
fantasies in the privacy of your own home

81
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,800
But that's not it

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,490
because additionally I am giving you
an all-expense-paid trip to Dildo Island

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,770
It's a real place,it's in Canada

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,870
I got you the deluxebachelor package

85
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,100
- I think this calls for anotherglass
of my world-famous eggnog - Yes

86
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,640
I'm using Giada's recipe, but you
tell me if it'stoo much all-spice

87
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,980
You know what I will tell youis

88
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,890
that I think that you've actuallybecome more
of a Grandma Moses since moving to New York

89
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,590
I mean,you just hada traumatic
break-up with Princess Valiant,

90
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,930
and you're single, you
should be living it up

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Oh,like you

92
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Breezing through hereunannounced,

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,380
with a sleigh fullof Christmas
decorations and presents la Auntie Mame

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,540
By the way,all of
thesearen't for us,are they

95
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,510
Oh,no,no,no,I mean,you
got your decapitated head

96
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,850
And one of theseis for Berry

97
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,600
A gallon jug ofProActiv solution
and a booklet ofJetBlue vouchers

98
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,660
The rest are for me

99
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,040
After what happenedwith Brittany, I
prescribed myself alittle retail therapy

100
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,920
Couldn't be in Limaright now,you know

101
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,650
Not with her there,it's too soon

102
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,850
But now I have tobook myself a hotel

103
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,010
In New York Cityduring
the holidays.Are you crazy

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,900
Do you knowhow expensive that will be

105
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,120
Calm down,Joyce
DeWitt.Okay.It's gonna be fine

106
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,590
Don't you remember that money
that my mom gave me for graduation

107
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,510
Your college fund

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,660
Please tell meyou didn't spend it
all on post-breakup giftsfor yourself

109
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,170
No,no,just half

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Kurt

111
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,770
Oh,my God,Santana

112
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,730
What are you doing here

113
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,530
We have our firstholiday house guest

114
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,240
Feliz Navidad

115
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,350
I decided that I wanted to dosomething a
little different for the holidays this year

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,190
In that case,you're in luck

117
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,700
Because I justgot Kurt and I the greatest
gig,and you can get in on it,too,if you want

118
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,430
We are gonna beChristmas elves
in Santa Land atthe Midtown Mall

119
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,700
I know what you're thinking,
but I've done my research

120
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,550
And this is where allof the Broadway
luminaries bring their children,

121
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,470
so we'll have tons of exposure

122
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,730
It's gonna be great,pleasesay you're in

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,670
Are you in

124
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,880
Come on,we'll alldo it together

125
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,770
- Sure,yeah -
Yeah - Cheers

126
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,010
I am gonna bethe best Jewish elf ever

127
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm serious,okay

128
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,320
What could be greenerthan foraging
in the woodsfor Christmas decorations

129
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,790
Our Christmas tree will
have,like,a zero carbon footprint

130
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,280
Except for cutting downa perfectly healthy
tree and throwing it awaytwo weeks later

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,140
Well...exactly

132
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,300
I'll go intothe West Lima Forest
Preserve and get pine cones,deer antlers,

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,890
fallen branchesand
make them into wreaths,

134
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,890
and you'd be surprisedat how many Hispanic
families throw birthday parties in there

135
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,930
I'm even gonna collectall the,uh,
deflated mylar "feliz cumpleaos" balloons

136
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,100
- and then I'm gonna maketinsel
out of it.- Perfect - Yeah

137
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,170
Hold it right there,sluts.Hey,Becky

138
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,230
This is mistletoe

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,880
I'm super horny,so
youbetter give me some tongue

140
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,370
- What
- Whoa

141
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,790
I mean it,bitch

142
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,850
I want to lickthose Asian tonsils

143
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,900
And then once she'sgot me all warmed up,

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,940
I'm gonna make you French me
because it's Christmasand I'm loose

145
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,880
Oh,dear God

146
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,960
Becky,you can't just
make usFrench kiss you

147
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,200
Yes,I can,stripper

148
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,190
I have special needs,and one of my
special needs is mouth sex with your face

149
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
No,Becky.This is not okay

150
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,090
You get away with murderat this school

151
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,460
because Sue has made you believe
that the rulesdon't apply to you

152
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,570
It's discrimination

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,300
no,it's not,honey

154
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,740
Becky.That's poison sumac

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,090
That's not mistletoe

156
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,330
Get your little buttto the nurse's
office for a Silkwood shower,stat

157
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,380
Can I take the LeCar

158
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
Of course you can takethe LeCar

159
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,300
Oh,Asian Number One

160
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,240
Stupid Trouty Joethe
Happy Strippin' Hobo

161
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,330
You're exactly right

162
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,310
I have been treating Becky differently
than allthe other kids at this school

163
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,280
when I probably should'vejust
treated her like everybody else

164
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
You've made your point,fair is fair

165
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,180
And I will adjustmy behavior accordingly

166
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,530
Geez,I just think she needs to be
treated for somesort of sex addiction

167
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,950
Yeah,okay,I got it,got it

168
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,450
I'm here to inform you that Principal
Figgins has made mein charge of judging

169
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,920
the 50th Annual Christmas
TreeDecorating Contest

170
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,170
A longstanding traditionhere at McKinley
High even thoughwe didn't do it last year

171
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,450
Or the year before

172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,650
Or the year before that

173
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,800
Anyhoo,I'm just thrilledto be able
to judge the GleeChristmas tree

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,810
so I can rank it dead last

175
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,050
Because I'm sureit's covered
with condoms and dental dams

176
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,210
and suicide hotlinepamphlets
and at-home-sex-change kits

177
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,860
I know that sounds harsh

178
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,710
But maybe it's justthe motivation that
poor little Christmas tree needs to go out

179
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,170
and conquer its dreams to hop
out of thatChristmas tree stand,

180
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,310
fly to New Yorkand audition for NYADA

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:19,870
We want Santa.We want Santa.We
want Santa.We want Santa

182
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,590
I'm seriously regrettingthese tights

183
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,960
They smell like Williamstown, and
they're giving meserious mangina

184
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,130
And I am seriously sensing some
workplace sexismhappening over here

185
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,930
All these little ladyelves are
dressed like candy-striped hookers

186
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,350
Do you think they'll let
mekeep this when we're done

187
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,790
Because I am lovingthis look on me

188
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,340
Lord of the Bling

189
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,700
We want Santa.We want Santa

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,720
Has anyone seen Santa

191
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
These Manhattan kids
aren'tgonna wait much longer

192
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,750
Uh,there he is

193
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,410
Merry Christmas.Calm
down.Calm down,here I am

194
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,260
No flash photos before I
geton my throne,though,okay

195
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,960
Ho,ho,ho.Oh

196
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,980
Lady elves

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,870
Santa,great

198
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,970
well,can we getthis line moving for you

199
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,960
Don't ever look directlyat
me again,Keebler.Ever

200
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,540
I don't like you and
your Equity card attitude

201
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,090
So I'm gonna hit the men's roomand
craft services, aka my flask

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,810
Why don't you take careof
keeping these kids busy

203
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,440
Maybe you could do that Rent medley that
you learned at the lastopen mic cabaret night

204
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,250
Ho,ho,ho,ho,ho

205
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,450
Okay,this crowdis about to get fugly

206
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,280
Do we have a plan

207
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
There is always a plan

208
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,940
We are gonna worksome NYADA magic

209
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,980
Santana,graba candy cane.Kurt,hit it

213
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
Are pulling on the reins

214
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,570
Bells are ringing,children singing

215
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,970
All is merry and bright

216
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,860
Hang your stockingsand say your prayers

217
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,270

He's got a bagthat's filled with toys

221
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,620
For the boys and girls again

222
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,780
Hear those sleigh bellsjingle jangle

223

For he loves youjust the same

234
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,740

If we just follow the light

242
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's give thanksto the Lord above

243
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,730
'Cause Santa Clauscomes tonight

244
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,830
Happy days,happy times

245
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,840
Listen to thebells and chimes

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Here comes Santa Claus

247
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,940
just goes to show you,even in New
York, all you need is justa little magic

248
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,430
Let's go already

249
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,010
You guys suck eggs

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,460
Oh,my God.Hey

251
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,170
Us girls were talking andwe figured

252
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,720
that since all of us obviously want to
playthe Virgin Mary in the nativity scene,

253
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,860
we should all audition together

254
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,260
- No,thanks
- Okay

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,780
I was justtrying to be nice

256
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,440
I have a very low tolerancefor nice

257
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,830
I may seem really cooland
loving for a week or two,

258
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,340
but then my body rejects itlike a virus

259
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,990
and I move backinto my natural
state of cruel, selfishinsensitivity

260
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,410
The fact is,that between lady-man
and his junk flapping around on stage,

261
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,620
you probably passing out atsome
point during the audition,

262
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,360
and the basic truththat there is no way
they're going to leta Chinese girl play Mary

263
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,490
I think Tina's Korean

264
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,800
I would get that part
hands downif I wanted it

265
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,690
But I don't

266
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,180
What.Where are you

267
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,950
I'm takinga much-needed break,okay

268
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,000
It is exhaustingplaying a slutty elf

269
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,000
Get back here

270
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,890
Santa passed outin his own vomit
and probablycrapped his pants

271
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,250
And until the mall can finda replacement,
we need you to come backand play Mrs Claus

272
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,010
No,no,you play Mrs Claus,Lady Hummel

273
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,250
You were born to play Mrs Claus and Mrs
Butterworth and Bea Arthurand Barbara Bush

274
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,510
The mob's gettingrestless out there

275
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,700
Oh,my God,we are begging you

276
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,190
Please come hereand help us

277
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,930
Rocking aroundthe Christmas tree

278
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,530
At the Christmas party hop

279
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,740

280
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,480
Every couple tries to stop

281
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,450
Rocking aroundthe Christmas tree

282
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,300
Let the Christmasspirit ring

283
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,280
Later we'll havesome pumpkin pie

284
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,160
And we'll do some caroling

285
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,520
You will geta sentimental feeling

286
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,530
When you hear

287
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,220
Voices singing,"Let's be jolly

288
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,700
Deck the halls withboughs of holly"

289
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,650

290
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360

You will geta sentimental feeling

294

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,780
Rocking aroundthe Christmas tree

298
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,600
At the Christmas party hop

299
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,420
Mistletoe hungwhere you can see

300
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,090
Every couple tries to stop

301
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,230
Rocking aroundthe Christmas tree

302

We want Santa.We want Santa

306
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,160
Merry Christmas,shoppers

307
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,820
Well,it turns outSanta has
got a bit of a drinking problem

308
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,060
Got into the schnappslast night, and
he was a little hardto get out of bed

309
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,970
But-but... but it is actually Mrs Claus

310
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,340
who's been writing the list of
who's been naughtyand who's been nice

311
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,830
and forcing us elvesto
work at the sweatshop,

312
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,090
and she has madea special
trip to Santa Land,

313
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,470
and you guys get to tell
herwhat you want for Christmas

314
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,240
Who's excited.Who's excited

315
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,690
So here she is,Mrs Claus

316
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,610
Merry Christmas

317
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,840
Who's ready to sit on my lap

318
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,570
And what would youlike for Christmas

319
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,400
I want a Doc
McStuffinsTime-for-Your-Check-up Doll

320
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,900
Ooh,so cute

321
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,600
Well,that soundsa little molesty

322
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,770
I mean,I didn't startplaying
doctor till I was nine

323
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,980
I'll see whatI can do

324
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,700
I think that somebody needsto
freeze the fat for Christmas

325
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,630
because somebody
weighsmore than Mrs Claus

326
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,040
Whoa,stop right there

327
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,360
You look a littleJewish,right

328
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,500
Rachel,you think

329
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay,bye

330
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,420
I think...Did you...

331
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,180
I think he poopedin his pants

332
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,670
I want a Kinder CollegeLearning Laptop

333
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,030
Why don't we justget you an iPad

334
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,490
You can't evenget porn on
whatever you justasked me for,okay

335
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,610
Hey,how's it going

336
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,540
You look exactlylike a young
Brittany SPierce,doesn't she

337
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,390
Brittany is my ex-girlfriend,and
she just dumped me,

338
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,960
which is why I'm even
hereand why I have this job

339
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,140
And we're lesbians

340
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,490
You know,and,like,I'd never
been with... Okay,great job

341
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,870
What would you likefor Christmas

342
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,110
I'd like... Oh,no,you know what

343
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,380
I think that youshould ask Santa to get
your daddy a jobwith some dental benefits,

344
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,450
because your grillis freaking jacked up

345
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,460
Do you see this

346
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,190
I think that Mrs Clausneeds a break

347
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,380
This is going well,right

348
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,220
You guys,she's coming

349
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,930
And one,two...

350
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,060
What's this ornament made of

351
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,530
It's a suet cakefor migratory songbirds,

352
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,960
and it's loadedwith
wildflower seeds for the birds

353
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,610
to poop outin their deforested wintering
groundsin the Amazon River Basin

354
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,960
- What species
- Douglas fir

355
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,140
- Which is the primary habitat of
- Red tree vole

356
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,410
And what happened to the voleyou left
homeless when you cut down this tree

357
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,180
Um,do you mean Richie

358
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,560
Because he came hereto live with us

359
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,640
Well,Glee Club,I gotta hand it to you

360
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,220
I thought Becky Jacksonwas going
to take first prize this year,

361
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,460
but shedidn't really get the
concept of "green decorations

362
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,920
" Here it is,Coach

363
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,620
See.Everything's green

364
00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:00,110
Green apples,green bananas,peas, an Apple
Jacks box, grass clippings,moldy bread

365
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,900
I won't be announ...
You're still humming.Okay

366
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,920
I won't be announcing the
winneruntil tomorrow morning,

367
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,220
but I have to admit,for once,Glee Club,
you haven't totally screwedeverything up

368
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
Happy holidays

369
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,490
Since this year'sliving nativity
has a singing element to it,

370
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,750
and since I'm no expertwhen it comes
to judging show choir star power...

371
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,200
I am,in fact,sitting right here

372
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,210
I asked Mr Shueto help
out with our auditions

373
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,730
- for the Virgin Mary
- Thanks,Coach

374
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,980
I'm happy to help
judgeyour potential virgins

375
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,300
And it looks likefirst up we
have - a group audition - Yes

376
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,990
Ladies,wheneveryou're
ready, the manger is yours

377
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,880
Mary's boy childJesus Christ

378
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,210
Was born on Christmas Day

379
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,010
Long time ago in Bethlehem

380
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,270
So the Holy Bible said

381
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,240
Mary's boy childJesus Christ

382
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,490
Was born on Christmas Day

383
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,700
***

384
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,560
And man will liveforevermore

385
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Because of Christmas Day

386
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,430
For a momentthe world was aglow

387
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,940
All the bells rang out,therewere
tears of joy and laughter

388
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,030
People shouted,"Let everyone know

389
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,420
There is hopefor all to find peace"

390
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,200
Hark now,hearthe angels sing

391
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,160
A king was born today

392
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,130
And man will liveforevermore

393
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,120
Because of Christmas Day

394
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,640
Oh,my Lord,you sentyour son to save us

395
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,510
Oh,my Lord,your very self you gave us

396
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,750
Oh,my Lord,that sinmay not enslave us

397
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,140
And love may reign once more

398
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh,my Lord

399
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,590
Oh,praise the Lord

400
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,920
You sent your sonto save us

401
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,370
Oh,my Lord

402
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,670
This day will live forever

403
00:21:46,760 --> 00:22:01,240
***

404
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,460
Oh,my Lord Ladies,I'm breathless

405
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,850
And I've got a littleJamaican in me,
and thattouched home in a very real way

406
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,280
Are there any other
last-minuteauditions for the Virgin Mary

407
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,530
***

408
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,000
No,but I'm afraidwe're gonna get killed

409
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,760
There's,like,a mobof
angry parents out there

410
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,340
We're never gonna get hiredas
holiday retail temps again

411
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,720
It's over,it's all over

412
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,820
No,it's not

413
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,660
How you doing

414
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,450
Cody Tolentino

415
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,950
But you can justcall me "Sexy Claus

416
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,610
" Heard somechatter about
there was sometrouble over here

417
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,860
Us Santastend to keep
- pretty close ranks

418
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,860
- Okay,listen

419
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,620
Even I'll admit thatmy girl-loving vagina
is feeling a littlejingle bell from you,

420
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
but we don'tneed your help

421
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,690
Okay,well,then... I'll just go

422
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,450
But if I were you guys,I would...
I would leave out the back door

423
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,930
I mean,these places tendto turn
people into animals when 'tisthe season

424
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,250
You mess with somebody's Yule,
and they will trample your ass

425
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,260
Okay,no,pleaseI'm sorry,we-we don't.we don't
want to betrampled,so... what do weneed to do

426
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,410
Yes.Anything.Truly

427
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,110
I'm Kurt,by the way.Newly single

428
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,800
Well,it's not a one-day fix

429
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,800
I can calm things down for today,

430
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,640
but if you truly want to save
Christmasfor this store and all of you,

431
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,360
it's gonna takethe rest of the week

432
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,690
I hereby deputizeeach of you as my elves

433
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,470
Ooh,we're deputized.Sounds fun

434
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,080
What are ourresponsibilities

435
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,570
Well,let's not getinto that just yet

436
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,360
I like to get to knowmy elves first

437
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,610
So what doyou guys say

438
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,090
Maybe dinner

439
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,320
- Your place. -
How's 8:00. - Right on

440
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,870
Merry Christmas,everybody

441
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,140
And that's whyancient Egyptians
regarded dung beetlesas sacred

442
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,600
- Attention,McKinley idiots.
- Come on

443
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,140
Here are your morningannouncements that were
obviously too unimportantto be mentioned until now

444
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,530
The three runners-up in the
politically-correct green-themed Christmas Tree

445
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:05,860
Decorating Contest are... the Biology
Club... ...the 420 Club... Oh,sick

446
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,670
and Beisteand the football team

447
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,210
What about me,Coach.What about me

448
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,740
Inside voice,Becky

449
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,720
And the winner of the tacky
plastic angelmade in the Philippines

450
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,810
by a 12-year-old child slave
is... bah,humbug...the glee club

451
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,140
Don't,Becky.Becky,don't.Becky,no

452
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,870
Everything's fine

453
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,660
- That's it
- Yep

454
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,900
Shocker

455
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,780
The virgin Marley gets
to playthe Virgin Mary

456
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,780
Aren't you worriedabout typecasting

457
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,930
What's with the snark

458
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,390
I asked you to audition, and
you said...I didn't want it

459
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,950
You obviously do

460
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,010
I don't get it

461
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,710
If this is somethingthat is important
to you, maybe we can talk to Mr

462
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,850
Shue... Don't you get it

463
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,720
I'm a Christian,and I know what it means to
have the Virgin Mary'sspirit in your heart

464
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,390
I don't have it

465
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,170
And I don't deserveto be her

466
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,540
To tell youthe truth, I'm
more likeMary Magdalene

467
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:47,200
Hey... Do we really have to
take downall of the ornaments

468
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,780
Rachel,yes

469
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,680
I thought it'd be niceto
have a tree-trimming party to,

470
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,710

471
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,770
We all set in there

472
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,570
If,by "all set," you mean did I light the candy-canescented
candles on the toilet, then yes,we are all set

473
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,800
- Good,perfect - Now,here.Try

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,790
I mean,come on,Kurt

Don't all you gayslove Julia Child

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,330
Didn't she,like,spike everything

478
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,670
Well,I guessI could add - some
cooking sherry in here - Yes

479
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,830
Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas

480
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,270

So,you got any tricks

486
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,150
- Oh... Well,you know,I

So how did you guys all meet

491
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,150
We were in,um,high
school glee club together

492
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,870
Kurt and I first, and then...it's
just... it's complicated

493
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,500
Glee club,huh

496
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,880

00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,910
Ready to sing your song

00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,110

504
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,250
Time for toys

505
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,870
And time for cheer

506
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,450
We've been goodbut we can't last

507
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,470

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,010
I still want a hula hoop

518
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,490
We can hardly stand the wait

519
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,990
Please,Christmas,don't be late

520
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,580
We can hardly stand the wait

521
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,560
Please,Christmas,don't be late

522
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,480
- That is good...
- Oh,my gosh... Tickle me

523
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,750
This is the bestChristmas present ever

524
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,770
- Besides curing cancer and peace on Earth,of course
- True

525
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,350
Hey,Trouty Mouth

526
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,570
Hey,Tokyo Rose

527
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,910
Merry Christmas

528
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,960
Are these teeth

529
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,710
Not any teeth

530
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,140
My baby teeth

531
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,200
To remind you of the
pure,innocent love of Baby Jesus

532
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,140
Thanks,Becky

533
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,940
That's... verysweet of you

534
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,300
We were sorry youdidn't,you
know, win the contest

535
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,250
Tell me about it

536
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,800
I'm still recovering
fromCoach Sue's critique

537
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,290
Well,I appreciate your
literalinterpretation of "green,"

538
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,910
but it looks like you fishedall this
stuff right out ofthe school Dumpster

539
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,990
It's recycled

540
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
What it is,is lazy

541
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,060
Okay,okay

542
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,430
I wanted to go home and
watch Gigolos on Showtime

543
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,580
So I did it half-assed

544
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,980
I feel like you guys

545
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,350
Losers

546
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,640
Anyways,happy holidays

547
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,300
- I love Christmas
- Me,too

548
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,780
- And I love New York
- Me,too

549
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,840
You know what.You
should totallymove here

550
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,150
- No.No way
- Yeah

551
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,820
I mean,what aboutmy scholarship
to the Universityof Louisville

552
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,420
There's no way thatI could just leave in the middle
ofthe school year for no good reasonand come here

553
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:12,940
Look,I know thatit's impossible, but you
could,like,live here with me and Kurt... Where

554
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,150
Where's Kurt

555
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,520
- Yeah,and Studly Claus

556
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,230
- Kurt.Kurt.Kurt

557
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,060
- Oh,my God
- Oh,hell no

558
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,300
That is not happening

559
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,950
Oh,don't worry,ladies

560
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,660
Santa swings both ways

561
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,450
- What.What's the matter,Santana
- Jealous

562
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,360
No,I am disgusted and also impressed

563
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,680
Who knew the Queen of
Englandcould be so trashy

564
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,610
Aren't you the one who's
always callingme Miss Priss

565
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,850
And telling me that I
needto live it up a bit

566
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,870
Well,you're right

567
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm in New York, I'm
single,I'm available,

568
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,860
and your hot butteredrum concoction
is dangerouslylowering my inhibitions

569
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,840
So why not throw cautionto the wind

570
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,270
In that case,let's drink up.Let's do it

571
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,000
Ladies,join us for a toast

572
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,280
Here's to being naughtythis Christmas

573
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,900
To being naughty

574
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,510
Oh... Santana Santana,wake up

575
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,220
Oh,my God.Oh,my God

576
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,610
Oh,the last timeI felt like this
was when I was roofiedat Lilith Fair

577
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,180
Oh,my God

578
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,110
- Oh,my God,help me up
- Come here

579
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,750
Oh,my God,Rachel... Oh,my God

580
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,960
Where's all our nice things

581
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,640
I don't know,I don't know

582
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,250
The last thing I rememberwas Lady Hummel
bouncing quartersoff of Santa's abs

583
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,500
- Kurt
- Kurt.Oh,my God

584
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,000
Take that outof his mouth

585
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,080
- What happened Are you okay
- What is this

586
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,780
- It was rough-trade Santa,that's
what happened - Oh,God

587
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,020
We were role-playing, and he
wantedme to be his Rudolph,

588
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,740
and when I said no,well,he
stopped being so jolly

589
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,770
Oh,God,he took offhis
suspenders and he tied me up

590
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,620
And-And,well,he did sayit was sexy kissing
me because it was likeI had no teeth

591
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,400
That's disgusting.This is disgusting

592
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,520
But then he just admittedthat-that he
was only here to rob us blind anyway

593
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:19,070
Oh,I think I'mgonna be sick

594
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,480
Wait... Did Kittyreally
say she wasn't worthy

595
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,400
You sure she wasn't justbeing snarky

596
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,800
- Or
body-snatched - No

597
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,690
In that moment,she
wastotally,like,a real person

598
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,330
If we can get Kitty to take
the role of the Virgin Mary,

599
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,980
get into those vestmentsand stand in the middle
of that nativity scene holding the Baby Jesus,

600
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,490
maybe she'll realize she is worthy, and
she'll stop beingso insanely horrible

601
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
Oh,a Christmas presentto us all

602
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,990
I tried to offer herthe
part, but she wouldn'ttake it

603
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,120
I know how tomake her take it

604
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,220
Sam,the Christmas angelis
not like the Stanley Cup

605
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,070
- You can't take it home with you
- Oh,this

606
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,560
Yeah,um... we decidedto give it away

607
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,630
Uh,to Becky

608
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,790
Becky'slike a sad little... Hermey the
Elf waddlingaimlessly into a snow drift,

609
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,860
and we thoughtthat giving her the angel
might light her uplike Rudolph's nose

610
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,240
Well,that walksa dangerously fine line between
being really sweetand horribly condescending

611
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,310
Don't worry,Artie,we've
gotsomething else for her,too

612
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,810
Remember,guys,you'retired,you're
hungry but ironically excited

613
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,790
- All right,dress rehearsal.
- Places.Let's go

614
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,430
Wait,Marley,why aren'tyou
dressed as the Virgin Mary

615
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:26,280
We all decidedthat the only girl who could
do the partjustice is... The black one

616
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,490
Joseph,honey,get meto the
stable.I'm about to pop

617
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,580
You think thatI don't feel love

618
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,860
But what I feel for youis real love

619
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,770
In others' eyesI see reflected

620
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,570
A hurt,scorned,rejected

621
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,640
Love child

622
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,500
Never meant to be

623
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:32,300
***

624
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,510
Is worth the pain of waiting,we'll only

625
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,750
End up hating The
child we may be creating

626
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,240
Love child

627
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,460
Never meant to be

628
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,620
Love child

629
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,460
Scorned by

630
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,640
Society

631
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,490
Love child

632
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,290
Always second best

633
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,830
Love child,different from the rest

634
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,250
Hold on,hold on,just a little bit longer

635
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,040
Mmm,baby

636
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,370
Hold on,hold on

637
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,860
Just a little bit longer

638
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,670
Don't thinkthat I don't need you

639
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,040
Don't thinkI don't want to please you

640
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,310
No child of mine'llbe bearing

641
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,520
The name of shameI've been wearing

642
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,770
Love child,love child

643
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,370
Never quite as good

644
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,690
Afraid,ashamed

645
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,390
Misunderstood

646
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,920
But I'll always love you

647
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,450
Always love you

648
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,580
Love child

649
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,530
Wait just a little bit

650
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,090
I'll always,I'll always

651
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I'll always love
you,love child Love child

652
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,900
- Yes All right
- Not bad,not bad,guys

653
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,810
- just a few notes
- Wow

654
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,860
- Ryder,deliver the baby
- a few bars earlier

655
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,580
- You got it.
- Wait.N-No

656
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,550
That wasthe most sacrilegious and
profane horror showI have ever seen

657
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,800
Racist

658
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:06,860
Mr Shue,you can not letthis abomination
happen to the most beautiful storyever told

659
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,940
We have to do this the
right wayor not at all

660
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,200
- i will play the virginary.
- not so fast

661
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,390
Um,is that okaywith you,Unique

662
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,330
Happy holidays.You get the part

663
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,220
Hey,Becky,there you are

664
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,470
- Uh,didn't you hear the news

665
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,930
- What are you talking about

666
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,820
There was a recounton the tree decorating
contest, and it turns outyou actually won

667
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,390
But my tree was a bagof diapers

668
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,080
It's Ohio,Becky.It's a swing state

669
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,560
You know,the votescan
always go either way

670
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,070
the angel's yours

671
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,980
Merry Christmas Congratulations

672
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,500
I love you,plastic angel

673
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,850
Oh,and there's something else

674
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,200
There's a,um,part left in the living
nativitythat no one else can play

675
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,660
Do you thinkyou can help us out

676
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,530
Santana,I feellike such a fool

677
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,990
I just wanted to get
outsideof myself,you know,

678
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,500
let myself be free for
once,and look what happened

679
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,570
Everything,includingmy collection
of Broadway Playbills,was stolen

680
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,400
I've never felt so ashamed

681
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,560
That's why I couldnever live here

682
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,150
Bushwick is worsethan Lima Heights

683
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,500
You can't tellanyone about this

684
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,280
Even though Blaineand I are
broken up, you can never tellhim

685
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,400
- Promise me
- I promise

686
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,330
Okay,so I justgot back from the mall

687
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,770
Turns out that Codyransacked
Santa Land as well

688
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,730
He even took all of the moneyfrom
the Salvation Army bucket

689
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,560
The police said that we
werelucky that we weren't hurt

690
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,820
More hurt

691
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,430
But,needless to say,our services at
the Midtown Mall are no longer required

692
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,050
This is gonna follow us

693
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,600
The fact that we were fired fromour jobs as Christmas
elves is gonna be a black markon our acting rsums

694
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,800
for the rest of our lives

695
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,780
Not if we have something else
to make upfor it,which I do

696
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,500
So,I was getting offof the subway
and I was passing Fifth Avenue...

697
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,880
No,Rachel,another oneof your crazy jobs

698
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,240
We barely survivedthe first one

699
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,130
Trust me,Santana

700
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,270
This jobwill not only test
our mettle as performers,

701
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,170
but we will beprotected by
the safety of bulletproof glass

702
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,950
- This is obviously myrrh,not frankincense
- No,no,no

703
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,010
That's-that's frankincense

704
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,430
Guys,can we just talk
abouthow great everybody looks

705
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,580
Look at you guys.You guyslook
phenomenal.Where's Becky

706
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,420
This hay is making mehave a rash

707
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,000
- Becky,you're a genius
- Genius

708
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,610
All you have to do is
just kneel right here

709
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,600
- It's gonna look perfect
- Yes

710
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,550
- You look amazing
- Great job

711
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,870
How did you think of that

712
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,830
Kitty... Virgin in the house,bitches

713
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,220
You look beautiful

714
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,510
Places,everyone

715
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,570
Away in a manger

716
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,190
No crib for a bed

717
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,600
The little Lord Jesus

718
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,710
Lay down his sweet head

719
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,460
The stars in the sky

720
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,630
Looked down where he lay

721
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,910
The little Lord Jesus

722
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Asleep on the hay

723
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,490
The cattle are lowing

724
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,740
The poor baby wakes

725
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,780
But little Lord Jesus

726
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,100
No crying he makes

727
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,280
I love thee,Lord Jesus

728
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,010
Look down from the sky

729
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,180
And stay by my cradle

730
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:51,180
Till morning is nigh

731
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,230
Be near me,Lord Jesus

732
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,750
Ooh...I ask thee to stay

733
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,360
Close by me forever

734
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,470
And love me,I pray

735
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,240
Bless all the dear children

736
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,080
In thy tender care

737
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,300
And take us to Heaven

738
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:29,670
To live with thee there
